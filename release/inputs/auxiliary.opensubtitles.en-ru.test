I'm in.<eos> I'll be here when you need me.<eos> - You say your friend worked here?<eos> - I said my friend had work done here.<eos> She's human?<eos> Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.<eos> Checking upper zones next.<eos> Is there any word on Major?<eos> She's gone.<eos> Off-grid. Silent.<eos> Copy that, sir.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.<eos> But I always do.
No voices.<eos> No data streaming.<eos> Just... nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I dunno who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're late!<eos> Just in time, boss.<eos> They bust in here, step on our throats, and take the one device that can cause a global power shift.<eos> So, how do we get it back?<eos> These assholes just took out the best of the best like it was Sunday brunch.<eos> We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.
Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Uh, where are you going?<eos> - London. - Why?<eos> What's in London?<eos> A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.<eos> And I did.
Megan-Ann. Okay.<eos> I will not forget.<eos> I should have married Leroy while I had the chance.<eos> Leroy knew where to put his hands.<eos> Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.<eos> Don't deny it, you shit.<eos> It's hard to put down a good book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.
So that's what I mean, what are you doing here?<eos> You listened to all those voicemails?<eos> Hey, guys, right here.<eos> Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"? Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.<eos> You do something big and you can't take it back and it's too late, and then...<eos> Crazy.<eos> I do that?<eos> I do that?
That is why I'm here today.<eos> Rodriguez Hayes must be overjoyed.<eos> Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.<eos> I fit into this family.<eos> You never did.
That was your idea.<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> How did you steal all that money?<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.

So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.
What does it matter who?<eos> Doesn't matter, not at all.<eos> I just like being a good detective.<eos> Gives me something.<eos> Well, he never showed up, so it really doesn't matter who.<eos> You know what they say? Showing up is 90% of love.<eos> Yeah, and not being an asshole is the other 10%.<eos> He didn't show up.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Neither did I.
Hey, fresh face.<eos> You here for the qualifiers?<eos> No, no, I'm not trying out.<eos> I'm actually already on the team.<eos> You're already on this team?<eos> I'm Matt Brody.<eos> Ready for duty.<eos> "Ready for duty"?<eos> Okay. You got any papers or anything like that?<eos> I do.
Found our access point.<eos> Where is Brody?<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> No.<eos> No time.<eos> We gotta move without him.<eos> Yeah, but we need our lookout.<eos> What's your deal? You like torturing guys?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
She smells like cheese toast and chowder.<eos> Holy Christ. You just tickled another man's taint.<eos> Who gives a shit right now?<eos> This was a bad...<eos> Something just dripped on me.<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - It did it again.
Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't, what you did would still be totally illegal.<eos> Okay, well, I mean, it's a good thing we're not police, then.<eos> It's like you purposely only hear 1% of what I say.<eos> Mitch, did you pull Brody off the beach to break into the medical examiner's office earlier today?<eos> Yeah, you bet I did. Absolutely, 100% and here's why.<eos> The Councilman's boating accident was no accident at all.<eos> He had no smoke in his lungs, his neck was broken in multiple places.<eos> Which means he was probably dead before that boat even caught on fire.<eos> And our investigation has found that all of this shady shit leads right back to the Huntley.<eos> You don't do investigations.
Until then...<eos> Go, baby.<eos> I'm oceanic, motherfucker.<eos> How tacky.<eos> - Mitch, you just blew her up!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.<eos> You stabbed yourself with one of those?<eos> I thought that was supposed to kill you.<eos> It does.
Also in the garden.<eos> In the quarry.<eos> I assume it's his mother he hears or thinks he hears.<eos> It seems to give him comfort.<eos> I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?<eos> No.<eos> No, signore, I do not.
Do you think I'm a good person?<eos> Of course I think you're a good person.<eos> But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl, you used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> I do. Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.<eos> But now... Now there's someone to remember me when I'm gone.<eos> It's Grandpa Wilson, right there!<eos> At least until some horrific apocalypse wipes out the human race. Hi.<eos> Can you hold him up a little closer?<eos> We like our stories to end with the promise of hope.<eos> Happily ever after and all that.<eos> Is that as clear as it gets?<eos> Too bad real lives don't have that structure.<eos> Or, hell, maybe they do.
The stone barges have been sunk, and they've blocked the river.<eos> What else? Come on, more ideas.<eos> Interrupt his supply of slaves.<eos> Excellent.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> We know their transportation routes.<eos> Oof! Now we're warming' up.<eos> Come on, ideas.<eos> Burn his favorite palace down.<eos> How you gonna do that, then?
- Yeah, I'm trying.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You worry about me, Daddy?<eos> I just wanna know what you're doing.<eos> Am I prying too much?<eos> There is someone, but... I'm not really sure what's gonna happen.<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay-<eos> But does he play out, like, make money playing and stuff'?<eos> - He does'?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> No.<eos> I know, I gotta go.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Does Dad even look at you?<eos> He's so... strange.<eos> We've... waited so long to be free of that man, and now...<eos> Do you think about forgiving him?<eos> No, I don't.

I didn't know what to tell him.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, this is... that's a good...<eos> That's a good opportunity for you.<eos> I mean, you know how I feel about him, but that... that shouldn't affect your... that shouldn't affect you.<eos> You gotta do it.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Because I'm happy.<eos> Your old girlfriend... she asked you to go off with her.<eos> Why didn't you?
Are you gonna miss me?<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I can't ask you that.<eos> Well, then I gotta go.<eos> Foolish me.<eos> Devil.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I know.<eos> I love him.<eos> Of course you do.
I was a receptionist there before I met you.<eos> You know, I...<eos> He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.<eos> You don't have to, uh... you know, hide anything.<eos> We don't have to have any secrets between us.<eos> Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?<eos> Did you ever sleep with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did?
I feel like we are so... connected.<eos> And it's...<eos> I can't really understand, it's like...<eos> I forget everything, but seeing you again...<eos> I never knew I had a soul.<eos> The word embarrassed me.<eos> I've always been afraid to be myself.<eos> I thought there was no one there.<eos> I don't believe anything that you're saying.<eos> Yes, you do.
Fascinating.<eos> What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.<eos> Look. Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.<eos> Somewhere in there, fighting to get out is a good man.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
We don't have a Smurfette.<eos> But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,<eos> Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?<eos> I do.
I want much more than this provincial life<eos> I want adventure in the great wide somewhere<eos> I want it more than I can tell<eos> And for once it might be grand<eos> To have someone understand<eos> I want so much more Than they've got planned<eos> The woods are lovely.<eos> I only wish I recognized them.<eos> Do you know where we are, Philippe?<eos> Because I don't.
The cage just moved.<eos> I thought we were gonna drop for a moment.<eos> Are you girls okay?<eos> No, I think the cage just dropped a little bit.<eos> No, it's the winch mechanism.<eos> It's-it's fine.<eos> It just slipped a little bit.<eos> Uh, no, I think we want to come back up now.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We don't.
Let's go!<eos> Sit back.<eos> Bring me the tracker.<eos> You.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Hey!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.
When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain... then screwing with our water.<eos> Couple of months ago, somebody poisoned our dogs.<eos> So, out on the highway today, those trucks...<eos> Who knows.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Hey, look at 'em.<eos> Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains... shucking their cloned-up super corn.<eos> You know it tastes like shit, too.<eos> Why do people eat it?<eos> They don't.
Neil's not talkin' either.<eos> So, then I went back to this.<eos> I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.

No.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I knew that you wouldn't stand up to these people.<eos> I just knew it.<eos> - Wait, I'm sorry, what do you mean, you knew I wouldn't stand up to them?<eos> That came out wrong.<eos> What I'm saying is that, you know, sometimes, you just let people push you around.<eos> - I do?
Dogs can't smell molly.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What do you mean, what did I do?<eos> I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Why not?<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.
You should have seen me stand up to those guys.<eos> - No, no, no, it's because you were right!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> And...<eos> And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?
For real, girl It's me in your world<eos> Believe me, nothing make a man feel better than a woman<eos> Queen with a crown that be down for whatever<eos> There are few things that's forever, my lady<eos> We can make war or make babies<eos> That's not technically a song.<eos> That's kinda like a rap.<eos> It still sound good, don't it?<eos> It did!<eos> It did.
Don't worry.<eos> In no time, you will be back with Mommy.<eos> Okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> Thanks for stopping by.<eos> Thank you for letting me stay.<eos> I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> It's just hard sometimes.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
What happened?<eos> - There are lessons to be learned.<eos> - That's some sort of punishment?<eos> No.<eos> It's a reality.<eos> I couldn't keep up with your knots.<eos> She thinks that's because of me?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.<eos> We found the remains out there in the porch.<eos> The porch where we came in? How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...<eos> I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.<eos> Why didn't he smash all the others?<eos> Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.<eos> Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.<eos> And if there's nothing...<eos> I know what happened to your son.<eos> You do?
'I swear I will.'<eos> Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you.<eos> You're completely at my mercy.<eos> Mr Baker.<eos> Well, that completes the set.<eos> No, it does not.
I promise.<eos> No...<eos> Yes, I promise.<eos> Promise me!<eos> I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.<eos> Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.
That's just what you're like.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> -My God, he knows you.<eos> -No, he doesn't.
You invited her.<eos> You sent her a text.<eos> Or, or, or, technically I sent her a text, but she's not to know.<eos> Um, let's see if I can recall.<eos> "Faith, I can stand it no longer.<eos> "I've confessed to my crimes.<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> How would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.<eos> Oh, but I do.
"I've confessed to my crimes.<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> How would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.
You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.<eos> You care what she thinks.<eos> (CHUCKLING) You maintain an impressive facade.<eos> I think it's about to break.<eos> Did you know?<eos> -She came to Baker Street.<eos> -No, she didn't.
Please, please, please, no violence.<eos> Thank you, Dr Watson.<eos> I don't think he's a danger any more.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Let him do what he wants.<eos> He's entitled.<eos> I killed his wife.<eos> Yes, you did.
He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he?<eos> John?<eos> I'm gonna make a deduction.<eos> -Oh okay, that's good.<eos> -And if my deduction is right, you're gonna be honest and tell me, okay?<eos> Okay. Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert<eos> -to become randomly attached to... -Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.<eos> Never knew when your birthday was.<eos> Well, now you do.
You'd be better off with clown outfits.<eos> At least they'd be satirically irrelevant.<eos> You'll find the real landers on the north shore, tied up with two others.<eos> Two others?<eos> Well, it was trial-and-error. We had to find the right waistband.<eos> This is insane.<eos> This is unnecessary.<eos> -No, your security is compromised, and we don't know who to trust.<eos> And that justifies dressing up?<eos> Yes, it does!
- Sherlock.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - Vatican cameos.<eos> - In a minute.<eos> Let's continue.<eos> Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Be naughty, step closer.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do it.
It's very important.<eos> I can't say why.<eos> But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that.<eos> I can't... I can't say that to you.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> - You know why.<eos> - No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.
What?<eos> No.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either.<eos> I can't believe my parents didn't tell me about this.<eos> If people knew where babies really came from, they'd never have one.<eos> Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.<eos> Going upsies!<eos> So how come I don't remember this place?<eos> You did.
Upper management.<eos> This, Templeton, is where all the action is.<eos> Nap time in Sector G.<eos> So this whole place is run by babies?<eos> Yep.<eos> My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?<eos> We don't.
I think Yondu would want you to have it.<eos> Thanks... Captain.<eos> They came.<eos> What is it?<eos> I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies, and told them what he did.<eos> It's a Ravager funeral.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.

You'd probably like to go to that place they call "The Farm."<eos> That's what I was thinking.<eos> We're heading in the right direction.<eos> I...<eos> Just saying.<eos> They're not gonna let us just walk.<eos> Are they?<eos> They're bound to be looking for us soon.<eos> You have something I want, Ray.<eos> Yes, I do.
Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> You live in... town, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You live by the school?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> I just do.
Red door.<eos> Have you been drinking, sir?<eos> Any drugs or medications?<eos> Have you taken anything?<eos> Case file.<eos> Come with me. Come on.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Ma'am, do you know this man?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
What do you mean he wasn't in the car?<eos> No.<eos> Fuck!<eos> The hell?<eos> Use the ladies' room, Chad.<eos> The hell are you doing?<eos> Please, Chad, use another restroom.<eos> Clear this with the sheriff?<eos> I'll tell him if you don't.<eos> Yeah, you do that, Chad.
Look who's bat!<eos> What?<eos> Everyone okay?<eos> Dick, Alfred, Barbara.<eos> - Are you guys...<eos> - We're fine, Batman.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really... s-s-s...<eos> Sorry?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoo! I did it!
My God.<eos> What was Colleen Wing doing here?<eos> She didn't sign them.<eos> Danny sent all but the brown MM's.<eos> That supposed to mean something?<eos> Yes.<eos> When... when we were kids... we would eat them together.<eos> Nobody would know that but Danny.<eos> but a bunch of MM's doesn't prove anything.<eos> It does.
- While you weren't necessarily wrong...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> ...there was probably a better way for you to win those people over than swinging your 51%-shareholder dick around.<eos> Well, when you put it like that.<eos> So... why did you give Jeri that bowl?<eos> Dredged up so many old memories... these feelings that I've, I don't know, pushed down.<eos> Locked away.<eos> - That make any sense?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
First time I fought in the cage... I convinced myself it was just about the money.<eos> For my students, for my dojo.<eos> Then I went a second time.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It feels good, winning.<eos> What felt good was hurting those guys.<eos> Really good.<eos> Scared me.<eos> Yeah, well, the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.<eos> But maybe doing something like this...
It's okay.<eos> It feels good, winning.<eos> What felt good was hurting those guys.<eos> Really good.<eos> Scared me.<eos> Yeah, well, the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.<eos> But maybe doing something like this...<eos> Walk where I walk, and they'll never see us.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thanks for doing this.
Ward, Wayne Olsen.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Ward.<eos> - Likewise, Mr. Olsen.<eos> And will Mr. Rand be joining?<eos> Ah, afraid not, Mr. Olsen.<eos> He's...<eos> - Uh, indisposed.<eos> - Understood.<eos> And call me Wayne.<eos> Your father did.
He's gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they'll take good care of him.<eos> You're a woman.<eos> I am, indeed.<eos> Does that make you... uneasy?<eos> No.<eos> It does.<eos> I sense your fear.<eos> No, you don't.
Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.<eos> It's the first step of CIR's plan to save the company's image.<eos> But... but what about the plant?<eos> What about it?<eos> It might be making people sick.<eos> Danny, we don't know what's causing it.<eos> The EPA cleared us.<eos> Fifteen cases of cancer can't be a coincidence.<eos> Do you think that I don't care about those people?<eos> I do.
- You talk a lot.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> No, everything is not okay.<eos> How could they lose the company?<eos> Well, it was the board.<eos> Voted them all out.<eos> - Joy, Danny...<eos> - Danny?<eos> Uh... Do you know where Ward is?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
But Harold, now, is a different story.<eos> He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> Well...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Hey!<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.
- Surprised to see me, I know.<eos> What are you...<eos> How?<eos> Oh, it's really too much to go into.<eos> Right now, it hardly matters.<eos> Um, we need a moment.<eos> Can you make sure we aren't disturbed?<eos> You might wanna check the file I left on your desk.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.
Take her some lotto tickets.<eos> Tell her they're from me.<eos> Cole, just tell me what you know.<eos> Scratch-off.<eos> Those are her favorite, all right?<eos> Just do it.<eos> Tell her that they're from me.<eos> Tell her that I'm thinking about her.<eos> - You can trust me.<eos> - I do.
You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.<eos> You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.<eos> Not yet.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Gunshot.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the penthouse.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
Counselor, a word?<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> You're gonna need another lawyer.<eos> - Why did you follow me into the building?<eos> - Ms. Jones, lose my card.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Look, I've been down this road before.<eos> - I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't.

This could be good for us.<eos> No, not these criminals.<eos> They don't get sloppy.<eos> They just get more dangerous.<eos> It has to be us.<eos> We can take care of this.<eos> "We"?<eos> There is no "we."<eos> Vigilantes don't have jurisdiction.<eos> The NYPD does.
We both get disbarred.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate.<eos> So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Let's go with the hand that I am, for Christ's sakes.<eos> Hey!<eos> Mandy.<eos> Hi. Hey. Ooh.<eos> Why'd you run up ahead of me there, Brian?<eos> Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad. Oh.<eos> So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.<eos> Oh, so that - must make you Prudence then.<eos> - Yes. - Uh-huh. Yes, it does.
They were only meant to watch.<eos> What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.<eos> Now go.<eos> Enjoy the party.<eos> Have some fun.<eos> Sì signora.<eos> John.<eos> Gianna.<eos> There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.
Ooh!<eos> I'll be in the upstairs attic rooting around if anyone needs me.<eos> - Yeah, I do. I need you.<eos> - Oh, I'll be up there, Dee.<eos> - U-Uncle Jack... - Come on, Bonnie. This boner<eos> - ain't gonna last forever. - Okay.<eos> Yeah. Goddamn it, though, - he's really gonna bang her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did Mac put a camera in my mom's room?<eos> No, I did.
Look, not in this particular case, it's not a lo...<eos> Yeah, it's a load.<eos> - Yeah. I mean, yeah.<eos> - But that's not the point! That's not the point! The point is:<eos> Dee has no rightful claim to that ticket, and I'll prove it. You see, yesterday, after noticing the contents of her purse,<eos> I decided to follow her this morning. Cassie never gets her tip, does she, Dee?<eos> No. Because I refuse to tip for coffee.<eos> - I think it's dumb.<eos> - Uh-huh. So if you were buying circus peanuts and candy sour worms and cigarettes, I think we all know what that means about the ticket in question, don't we?<eos> I don't.
Yeah, that's what this is.<eos> Okay, so, clearly, you're not busy, so, I need somebody to clear the lines.<eos> The soda gun's clogged. Did Charlie ask you to trick me?<eos> Trick you?<eos> No, the...<eos> It's not a trick. The soda gun is clogged, I cannot make drinks.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't trust Charlie today.<eos> You know, I made him a valentine... He hasn't given me shit yet in return.<eos> Why the hell did you do that?
So why don't you and Mac go solve that goddamn mystery by cleaning it up, you know?<eos> And, oh, what about the mystery of the clogged soda gun, you know?<eos> Dee, why don't you and Frank go solve that mystery by clearing the lines?<eos> Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.<eos> And we could probably trick Cricket into doing it.<eos> Oh, why don't we just trick... Cricket doesn't work here though.<eos> - But that's free labor.<eos> - Yeah, yeah. - That's kind of better.<eos> You're not... you're not getting... Hey, just do your jobs!<eos> Just do your jobs.
Well, no, 'cause he's known that forever, so it's, you know...<eos> Well, he may have suspected it before, but there's no way he could have known for sure.<eos> 'Cause I show no outward signs of being gay, and that's just the end of the story, all right?<eos> But, look, either way, he's been acting very distant towards me, and I feel like he sent me in here to punish me or something, because, I agree, the whole, like, "do your job" angle<eos> - just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like... - It's, like, a bullshit thing, right?<eos> - Like...<eos> - Unless... Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Charlie, he doesn't want us to work at all.<eos> - He doesn't?
It doesn't add up.<eos> I can't get a read on him these days. He's just always cranky and irritated.<eos> - Rage-filled, rape-y.<eos> - It's like, as the years go by, he just gets more and more irrational. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Especially with this whole "work the bar" angle.<eos> I mean, what is that?<eos> Unless...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.<eos> - He doesn't?
- Bye-bye... Jerry!<eos> I'm poisoned. Poisoned!<eos> I'm poisoned.<eos> What are you doing? - We've been poisoned.<eos> - No, No.<eos> No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned. - They're just...<eos> - Plenty more poison where that came from! - Uh, there is no...<eos> - So, don't even think about trying to get another worm, Frank. And there are no-no worms.<eos> - Nobody has worms.<eos> - Well, not anymore they don't.
I'm working on it.<eos> Working on what?<eos> I can't do this if you won't talk to me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Yo, we'll manage.<eos> My birth mother died when I was four.<eos> She was an addict, crack.<eos> You could fill in the blanks.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> - I did..
It won't.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen to me.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to, Open up to me and... tell me these things.<eos> You gotta mean the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do too.
Look, try not to think of that for now.<eos> OK, we're gonna take all this one step at a time and there'll be plenty of us around to support you.<eos> OK.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - OK.<eos> Bye, Trish.<eos> - You gave her your number.<eos> - Oh, don't start.<eos> - So what?<eos> Yes, I did.
You're gonna make me pull rank, I will.<eos> Diane didn't want you to have her.<eos> Diane...<eos> Diane didn't always think things through.<eos> Arguably one of the brightest minds on the planet.<eos> Good luck going down that road.<eos> And what do you think she'd say if she saw how her child is living now?<eos> Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?<eos> That she's living a somewhat normal life?<eos> Yes. I do.
Come on.<eos> It's nice out.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Hey, no more math today.<eos> Is there a God?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I would if I could.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> And neither does anybody else.
- ...and decide then... where she wants to live and with who.<eos> I don't understand this.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be on my team.<eos> Why are you bringing me this deal?<eos> Other than I'm required to by law?<eos> You like this deal?<eos> I love this deal.<eos> They think they're gonna lose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.
We just don't sleep with a...<eos> You don't sleep with women?<eos> No, I mean, I do, I sleep with... I sleep with...<eos> Yes, I do..<eos> But out of the confines of marriage.<eos> Not polite to assume, you know?<eos> "Marriage"?<eos> Marriage! You don't have...<eos> You go before a judge and you swear to love, honor and cherish each other Until death do you apart.<eos> And do they..
Mankind did this, not me.<eos> They are ugly filled with hatred weak Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing. And for what?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> They deserved to burn!<eos> Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
Crushed and lost forever.<eos> That's right.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Do it.<eos> Hey. Vince.<eos> You're back.<eos> Okay, Hildur... finally.<eos> Oslo's decision is that I have to sign off on all subsidy payments.<eos> Erling, you and I came to an agreement...<eos> No, no, no, no, we didn't.
Photographs.<eos> Petra, you'll be the senior investigating officer.<eos> What about Eric?<eos> Unfortunately, Eric is not here.<eos> He is still looking for Dan's body.<eos> Okay.<eos> Like some kind of puppy, that you tolerated or... or... found amusing... or cute or... loyal or obedient or...<eos> You're not cute.<eos> You never said anything to make me think anything other than all that.<eos> - I don't.
Catch up when you get back...<eos> - I just came to say goodbye.<eos> I'm heading home for good.<eos> - For good?<eos> Health...<eos> Health issues.<eos> Ever since...<eos> Oh. Well. Vincent, I'm sorry my husband isn't here.<eos> I'm sure Eric would like to say goodbye properly.<eos> - He did.
Of course, they do return... as ghosts.<eos> Now I'm older...<eos> How many boys?<eos> How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?<eos> Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see...<eos> You didn't die, did you?<eos> Not even over there, where everyone dies.<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.
No?<eos> A mulatto?<eos> I would kill for a mulatto - the Danish pay double.<eos> I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
Thank God.<eos> What did he look like?<eos> A toad.<eos> I have a question.<eos> It concerns chemistry.<eos> I hope now is not inconvenient.<eos> Wait!<eos> I wrote a fucking book about chemistry.<eos> If you've got any questions about chemistry, then read that.<eos> I already did.
You always drive me...<eos> It is a bit unexpected that we were both invited, is it not?<eos> That we were invited, both together.<eos> And if they invited us both, then they probably know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Our American friends.<eos> You feel me, don't you, when I break in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.
So, The Sons of Africa.<eos> You write on their behalf.<eos> I write on behalf of humanity.<eos> As a man concerned with injustice.<eos> Against your people.<eos> Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.
You're as bad as your da.<eos> My father cast my mother into madness, then jumped in straight after.<eos> He's scarcely a man to follow.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.
I need to be clear that you're not a spirit, like the others.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a rationalist.<eos> I'm carrying out an investigation as part of a Royal Commission.<eos> I heard that you don't drink, that you don't fuck whores and, erm... that you're squeezing Sir Stuart Strange on behalf of the King.<eos> - On behalf of justice.<eos> - Oh, justice.<eos> Hello.<eos> You believe in justice?<eos> I do.
In the later days she did things... no-one understood.<eos> In the later days, when she wasn't allowed to walk the streets, nor show her face in public, nor speak in English, nor her savage tongue because she was a mad woman.<eos> - James.<eos> - No.<eos> Explain this.<eos> I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You don't speak but you do have answers.<eos> You do.
I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.
Okay.<eos> Don't tell anybody about this.<eos> What happened to us back there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I don't remember a thing.<eos> I hope these pajamas are okay.<eos> They've been in my locker since the time that dog got lost in here.<eos> They're beautiful, Lucy.<eos> Do you remember that night, Andy?<eos> Yes, I do.
Hope breeds eternal misery.<eos> Well, the old Spencer would have agreed with you but...<eos> I don't believe that anymore.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> Mona, I didn't know you would be coming tonight.<eos> Neither did I.
- Whoa. - Please shoot me.<eos> - Come on then.<eos> - This is crazy.<eos> Please, Wren, I have to look exactly like her.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please, Wren.<eos> Please, Wren!<eos> - I can't do this!<eos> - Do it!
No, that was all him.<eos> He found Mary and convinced her it was what Charlotte would have wanted and it probably was.<eos> She loved him.<eos> Before she came back to Rosewood, the four of us<eos> Charlotte and Archer, Wren and me we did everything together.<eos> But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?<eos> I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.
Wait.<eos> So I'm still alive because I'm your sister but what's gonna happen to Ezra?<eos> Well, he's not family, so...<eos> Enjoy his company while you can.<eos> I think that you and I are gonna be the closest of all.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.<eos> No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...
No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.<eos> No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
"To get a damn cookie around..."<eos> "To get a cookie..."<eos> I swear to God, my fingers are digging into the table.<eos> There is wood under my nails.<eos> You... you know what?<eos> Let's just - stick with the "damn."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - Much better.<eos> - Do that.
Just because you two have some kind of plans.<eos> Not just us.<eos> We have all worked every night for the last six weeks.<eos> I'm using "worked" in the broadest sense, including not only our show, but your cooking show and helping you to pick out a cat, and while we all appreciate the food and we love Mr. Swizzleboots,<eos> I'm sure, everybody here would also love to get home to their families.<eos> We're just asking for one night off.<eos> Well... not quite sure what to say.<eos> Just thought the crepes would be a special treat, but... we... we don't have to have 'em.<eos> Not if people don't want them.<eos> No, we do.
No, we were talking about Ed. - Okay.<eos> - Okay, what?<eos> Is it possible that you had a little more passion for Nathan than you have for Ed?<eos> And maybe he senses that.<eos> Men can be a little more intuitive than we give them credit for, you know?<eos> Have you thought about seeing a counselor?<eos> My God, we don't need a counselor.<eos> Couples fight.<eos> You telling me you and Perry don't ever fight?<eos> No, we do.
You heard a voice coming through the radio, and now you're convinced that it's the voice of...<eos> Stiles. Your son.<eos> Uh-huh. And maybe it's just a random signal cross?<eos> Peter gave us the keys to the Jeep and it started right up.<eos> Claudia's Jeep.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.
Was it the night of the lacrosse game?<eos> You saw the lightning, the men, and the horses?<eos> Dozens of them.<eos> Then what?<eos> It was chaos.<eos> They were everywhere.<eos> Some of the kids were running.<eos> But for everyone else it, it was like there was nothing there.<eos> They couldn't see a thing.<eos> We did.
No one can fight them.<eos> Douglas can.<eos> Does he need to stay in there?<eos> He's still Theo.<eos> Theo saved Scott.<eos> Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.<eos> Then he can hear me say he needs to shut up so we can figure out how to fight the Ghost Riders.<eos> You don't need to figure it out.<eos> Because Douglas already did.
Noah?<eos> Noah?<eos> I don't remember your birthday last year.<eos> Or what we did for our anniversary or Christmas for...<eos> I don't know how many years.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> We went to Big Sur.<eos> No.<eos> We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did.
So we should try anything we can to save him.<eos> Right?<eos> Even Theo.<eos> Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.<eos> You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.<eos> I know where to find one and I can show you how it works.<eos> I'll tell you if Malia promises not to kill me.<eos> She promises.<eos> No, I don't.
On your knees.<eos> We need Parrish.<eos> So, wait a sec.<eos> So, this woman "Lenore,"<eos> she conjured up her dead son?<eos> She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.<eos> And you saw this kid?<eos> We all did.
Who's that?<eos> My wife.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You should be.<eos> You killed the witch that put them here... maybe the only one who can free them.<eos> Mistres of the Western Fields,<eos> Vessel of Truth and Solace.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> You should have sent someone ahead.<eos> I did.
Yes.<eos> K. Chapman.<eos> Karen Chapman.<eos> Yes, but K could be for anything.<eos> It could be for Katherine or Kordelia.<eos> Cordelia stars with C.<eos> Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat.<eos> Well, don't you want to see him, too?<eos> Don't you want to find out who you really are?<eos> - Of course I do.
My name is Jane.<eos> Where's Tip?<eos> - Tip?<eos> - My friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were quite alone when we found you.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> She wouldn't have left me.<eos> Well, she might have thought you were dead.<eos> We did.
You're the worst human being I've ever met.<eos> What am I even doing here?<eos> You obviously hate me and now you want me to, what?<eos> Or am I supposed to trail behind you like some kind of pet?<eos> Or maybe I'm here to entertain you, so you can laugh at my clumsiness, my freakishness, is that it?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You're my friend.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Do you even know what a friend is?<eos> Of course I do.
Fraud!<eos> I left her behind.<eos> I made her feel safe, and I left her.<eos> That's how I killed all my sisters.<eos> I took away their fear. I gave them milk of the poppy to make them forget their pain, and then I sent them out to fight. And none returned.<eos> Because of me.<eos> And now... I've betrayed another.<eos> I knew you couldn't be so mean to leave me here.<eos> But I am.<eos> I did.
Look, I know you're confused.<eos> I've been confused, too, ever since I came to oz.<eos> But then I found you.<eos> Oh, Dorothy.<eos> - We found each other.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then do something.<eos> I can't.<eos> Don't you remember anything that happened between us?<eos> Of course I do.
On behalf of Queen Langwidere, the kingdom of ev welcomes you, great and powerful Wizaed of oz.<eos> Are my weapons at the ready?<eos> Quite.<eos> Guards!<eos> You're joking.<eos> Eamonn, is it true?<eos> War is coming?<eos> Soon.<eos> Who taught you that song, sister?<eos> Why, the Wizaed did.
To have someone else all over me, infecting me?<eos> This... this... this skin...<eos> It's the only thing that was ever really mine.<eos> Tip.<eos> Yeah, I know, I'm trespass.<eos> I remember.<eos> I don't want trouble with any of you.<eos> I want ojo.<eos> Why did you take to a witch who wanted to kill me?<eos> Because the one from the west almost did.
Jane, she's been shot.<eos> You have to do something.<eos> You have to help her!<eos> Fix her!<eos> You have to do something!<eos> Please, fix her!<eos> Fix her like you fixed me.<eos> Please!<eos> She can't die!<eos> Do for her what you did for me.
- come.<eos> - Dorothy?<eos> - It's them.<eos> witches!<eos> - still here, are you?<eos> - There doesn't have to be a war.<eos> - Is that why the wizard animated the stone giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> - He didn't.<eos> I did.
witches!<eos> - still here, are you?<eos> - There doesn't have to be a war.<eos> - Is that why the wizard animated the stone giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> - He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> - how wrong roan was about you.<eos> - He didn't know me.<eos> Now he does.
I am suggesting that we help each other by an alliance of pirates and slaves, bring down Nassau, maybe bring it all down.<eos> My name is Woodes Rogers, and I am the next governor of New Providence Island.<eos> Spain... what did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would secure the remains of the Urca de Lima's gold and return it to Havana.<eos> You set aside some of the gold?<eos> She did.
I'm saying do not piss off those bitches in airports.<eos> This is the final boarding call for flight 226, Orlando.<eos> Final boarding call, flight 226...<eos> How much for a flight tomorrow?<eos> Hey, Robbie. Uh...<eos> They tell me Laura's dead.<eos> Let me out early.<eos> Coming home.<eos> I bought it. I d... I did!<eos> I did.
You take care of things generally on my behalf.<eos> And in an emergency, and in an emergency only, you kick the asses of those whose asses require kicking.<eos> And in the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil.<eos> He's hustling you.<eos> He's a hustler.<eos> Damn right I'm a hustler, swindler, cheater, and liar.<eos> That's why I need assistance.<eos> Fine.<eos> You've told me what you want, but you want to know what I want?<eos> Of course I do.
Coroner had the nerve to ask me what I wanted him to do with it.<eos> I told him leave it where he found it.<eos> Relax. They didn't bury Laura with it still in her mouth.<eos> I had them put it somewhere special.<eos> Don't listen to me, Shadow.<eos> I lost count on the Ativan.<eos> I'm interrupting.<eos> You were saying your piece.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> People did enough talking today.
She an exgirlfriend of yours?<eos> Not for all the little plastic toys in China.<eos> No, she's...<eos> She's something else.<eos> We might not be welcome at first.<eos> In the presence of a queen.<eos> Heh, forgot it was Easter.<eos> Well, it is Sunday, 16th of April, seven days after the vernal equinox.<eos> I love Easter.<eos> Many do.
When we robbed the casino, did Wednesday fuck up my perfect plan?<eos> It wasn't a perfect plan.<eos> Didn't account for divine intervention, did you?<eos> The whole fucking time, the robbery, Shadow going to jail, me dying, act of god?<eos> Just fucking with us to fuck with us?<eos> What do you think gods do?<eos> They do what they've always done: They fuck with us.<eos> They fuck with all of us.<eos> Just don't take it personally.<eos> I don't.
Well, when I got there, Germaine had already left. She was, um...<eos> She was writing, but her influence was definitely there.<eos> I was very, very lucky.<eos> I'd love it if you wanted to see some of it, Mary. - I mean, I'd be wi...<eos> - No.<eos> I hate feminism, Mum.<eos> It's boring.<eos> - See what we've raised?<eos> - I like wearing make-up.<eos> - Everyone at school does.
I met him today.<eos> Why?<eos> This is going to sound weird, but ... when he came at me ...<eos> I felt like I knew him.<eos> Like you've met Logan before?<eos> - No, not Logan, I knew the guy who came at me.<eos> I think your mom got in my head, alright.<eos> I think she got in my head...<eos> Yeah, and it worked I thought.<eos> - No, it did not.
Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.<eos> Now, flattering as that may be, this, on top of your other adventures...<eos> Sudden onset of strange.<eos> Fair cause for consternation, unless strange is a new language and what we're doing here is vocabulary building.<eos> Fuck your vocabulary.<eos> Okay? This is gibberish.<eos> You may have to consider that you didn't see what you saw.<eos> - Or...<eos> - Or you did.
THE BAR<eos> Marta, stop calling. My battery's low.<eos> Something simple. That skirt and the pink sweater<eos> I wore the other day to dinner, remember?<eos> You don't?
What if this never happened?<eos> What if we're dreaming?<eos> This is nuts.<eos> But who's dreaming, you or me'?<eos> Me.<eos> Yeah, sure!<eos> And I'm part of your dream?<eos> Why not?<eos> I know you. You play the machines every day.<eos> I don't, just now and then.
- Don't touch it!<eos> Don't let go of it!<eos> No,no,no!<eos> Put it down gently on the floor.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> There's no bomb!<eos> Tell them.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, I don't. But neither do any of you.
Straight up.<eos> And if I touch you now?<eos> I'll smash your face!<eos> - Mess with me and I'll skewer you.<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> We're not sure, but on second thoughts<eos> Amparo may be right, we should take precautions.<eos> - I'm sure I didn't touch him.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> - You did, you liar!
It says: "Are you alright?" Someone asking about him.<eos> Read the messages before that.<eos> "I swear, it works. I'm getting better".<eos> Fuck!<eos> Works?<eos> What works'?<eos> - And before that?<eos> - "I injected one, but it did nothing."<eos> - Injected one?<eos> - Who did?
We're in a small village in the mountains of rural China.<eos> He had to take, like, five forms of transportation to get here!<eos> Relax.<eos> He's here.<eos> Now there's a good chance we're going all the way, and I'm talking the College World Series.<eos> That has never happened for this school.<eos> All we need is a little more cash to improve our training facilities, and we'll bring home that trophy.<eos> Plus... did I mention... how incredibly hot you look today?<eos> - You did.<eos> - Well, you do.
Look, I just wanted to make sure that... you knew what was going on with Emmett. I...<eos> I don't know if anyone called you.<eos> Why would anyone call me?<eos> He O.D.'d.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - He's okay.<eos> He said it was a mistake, but... (sighs) he was at the hospital and he, like, escaped or something, and we thought that he might be on his way back to L.A.<eos> He had mentioned that he has a bunch of, like, film festivals and meetings coming up.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that, but you know Emmett and I broke up two months ago, right?<eos> No, I... I didn't.
God damn it.<eos> I almost had him when I told him Affleck was playing, but... he's such a starfucker.<eos> So you're rested and rejuvenated?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Well...<eos> All right.<eos> I love hockey.<eos> I love Amanda. I love supporting her dreams.<eos> Yeah. And you love coffee.<eos> Yes, I do.
I get half. New bail?<eos> This guy's beyond a flight risk.<eos> But this time is collateral, you get, you know, uh, his mother's house.<eos> I could give you 10%, tops.<eos> But it better be a brilliant plan.<eos> - It's a real...<eos> - Let's hear it.<eos> Okay. So we go to Persikof's lawyer...<eos> Mm-mm. What, you know him?<eos> I do.
- What is it again?<eos> - #NeverForget.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm just...<eos> Looking for something?<eos> What would I be looking for?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Do you even know my name?<eos> - 'Course I do, Clay.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi, Kat.<eos> This is quite a turnout.<eos> People are happy to see you go.<eos> I really just threw it so Hannah could finally meet some people before I depart this realm.<eos> I met Helmet.<eos> Clay doesn't count.<eos> You met him at work.<eos> - I feel like that should count.<eos> - Of course you do.
'Cause that's what sluts do.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Friendship.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Is it working?<eos> The hot chocolate?<eos> No.<eos> Why did you and Hannah fight?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.
Yeah, right.<eos> The old project trope.<eos> The only class you two have together is gym.<eos> It's creepy that you even know that.<eos> Just go away.<eos> What I think... is that you wouldn't do something like that.<eos> I thought you loved Jessica.<eos> I did.<eos> I mean...<eos> Maybe I even still do, but...
Fuck you!<eos> You fight like a fuckin' bitch!<eos> Little fuckin' bitch.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I'm not your fuckin' bitch, bitch.<eos> Ow! Come on, Alex, play or don't.<eos> We're getting killed!<eos> Fuck you, Montgomery.<eos> - Dude, you team-killed me!<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Okay.<eos> Wow, I really hope you're not one of the judges tomorrow, 'cause...<eos> Marcus, what are you doing?<eos> The costume contest. Two hundred bucks.<eos> Here... what are you doing out here?<eos> I heard you, man.<eos> The car alarm.<eos> I live right over there.<eos> Besides, you're not the first one to come look at the famous window.<eos> We all did it.
And if we tear this room apart...<eos> I don't want to tear this room apart, and I'm not sure I want to fight.<eos> We have to.<eos> For Hannah.<eos> What about for us?<eos> Honey, our daughter is gone.<eos> Christ, Andy, I know that!<eos> I have to know why.<eos> I need to know why.<eos> And if you don't, I...
Wait, hey, Tyler.<eos> Tyler. Hey.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> This fucking chain is gay.<eos> You look really hot.<eos> - I look like a punk rock dog. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> What?<eos> Justin, what?<eos> You said you wanted to do this.<eos> I do.
Most people, you put a camera on them, and they smile.<eos> They pose.<eos> They basically fake it.<eos> You don't see them, you see their mask.<eos> Whenever my camera was on Hannah, she was... different.<eos> Like, real, and... I fell in love with that.<eos> Real.<eos> So, yeah, I took pictures of her, but that's because girls like that don't hang out with the yearbook guy, with me.<eos> Why didn't you just talk to her?<eos> Why didn't you?
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You really don't have to...<eos> Dude, relax.<eos> Okay.<eos> "How do I spend my Saturday nights?"<eos> You answered, "video games."<eos> Favorite kind of music, "obscure indie bands."<eos> Favorite reading materials, "fantasy and sci-fi"?<eos> Dude, why not just say you watch Lord of the Rings on repeat.<eos> I don't do that.
Let me put it this way.<eos> Repeat after me:<eos> "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you."<eos> I always kind of liked Marcus.<eos> Marcus, I will definitely think about it.<eos> You always seemed like a good guy.<eos> Don't think too hard.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.<eos> Then again, they almost always do.
You know what, that movie theater job...<eos> I don't think it's healthy for you.<eos> Well... why are you here?<eos> Aren't you and Dad doing anything for Valentine's Day?<eos> Ooh! No, no, no, no, no.<eos> When you've been married as long as we have, the best you can hope for is... takeout and some red wine.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He buys you flowers all the time.<eos> That's true.<eos> He does.
So, this site says that one of John Grady Cole's central flaws is... his tendency to see the world in black and white, good and evil...<eos> Sheri.<eos> Do you remember Dollar Valentines last year?<eos> What?<eos> Dollar Valen...<eos> I mean, yeah, I guess I remember.<eos> Why?<eos> Hannah matched with Marcus.<eos> Did she?<eos> Oh, yeah, right, yeah, she did.
I think I'm listening to my tape.<eos> You're finally gonna get what you deserve.<eos> It's about time.<eos> What?<eos> I said let me know if you need to talk.<eos> Any time.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I didn't.
You're finally gonna get what you deserve.<eos> It's about time.<eos> What?<eos> I said let me know if you need to talk.<eos> Any time.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
You know, like travel agencies and cupcake stores?<eos> Let me guess, you own a Kindle.<eos> Not in a million years.<eos> No, I'm a... paperback, write-in-the-margins kind of girl.<eos> A kindred spirit.<eos> So, uh, other than the Dewey Decimal System, what else has the library got going on?<eos> Well, I like to think we are a place where people can come together, find their tribe.<eos> Do you write?<eos> You look like you write.<eos> I don't.
A peace offering.<eos> Take it.<eos> Your thoughts deserve a decent place to live.<eos> Come on, I know you're a journal girl.<eos> You do a really convincing imitation of a thinking, feeling human.<eos> Hannah...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to make you feel embarrassed or humiliated.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> You do?
You don't think I'm pretty anymore.<eos> Jess.<eos> God, no, Jess.<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> What's happening to us?<eos> It'll all be fine, okay?<eos> Once these stupid fucking tapes are done.<eos> Can we at least get high?<eos> -You don't even smoke.<eos> -Yeah, I do.
There you go!<eos> There you go!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Whoa! That was freaking amazing.<eos> Was it?<eos> Or was it fucking amazing?<eos> That was fucking amazing.<eos> Like... I thought I was gonna die!<eos> But you didn't, did you?
I mean, like... right now, maybe it's easier being mad at him than being sad.<eos> That's cool.<eos> But...<eos> I also think that maybe someday you might feel worse if all you were today was mad, you know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes you judge people...<eos> I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.
That's cool.<eos> But...<eos> I also think that maybe someday you might feel worse if all you were today was mad, you know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes you judge people...<eos> I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.<eos> I usually don't, so...
Hey, I saw you talking to Clay.<eos> What?<eos> How did you even see that?<eos> Long lenses.<eos> Is he turning you in?<eos> - We shouldn't be talking about this.<eos> - Is he turning you in?<eos> He didn't say.<eos> You like Clay, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
I was the first person at that accident, and I found him.<eos> In his car.<eos> Dead.<eos> Jesus, Clay.<eos> Why didn't Hannah tell anyone about the stop sign?<eos> Maybe she was afraid.<eos> I was so pissed off at Jeff.<eos> And at Hannah, for making it all her drama.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
Because it's your tape.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> - You can't?<eos> After all this, you can't?<eos> No.<eos> Jesus, Tony.<eos> Death, and rape, and what the fuck is next?<eos> What did I do that Hannah thought was worse than that?<eos> Don't you know what happened?<eos> No, clearly, I don't.
I was feeling rebellious.<eos> Ah. So you finished your homework.<eos> That would sort of be antithetical to the whole...<eos> Right, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, do you...<eos> Do you want a drink?<eos> I believe you promised me a drink, in fact.<eos> And a ride on your bike.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Cool.<eos> I was so nervous that night, but you made it seem so...<eos> Easy?<eos> Is she kidding me?<eos> I was shitting myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> But she's not telling the truth about the way things happened.<eos> She's telling her truth.<eos> Why do you always act like you know?<eos> Because I do.
Why do you always act like you know?<eos> Because I do.<eos> From the tapes, I know her truth.<eos> So, why do you have to be here, knowing?<eos> 'Cause I don't know what your truth is.<eos> And I don't know what's gonna happen when you find out hers.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hi, Clay, it's Mom.<eos> Yeah, I just said that.<eos> So you did. Yeah.
Stop.<eos> - I've got to stop.<eos> - You want me to stop the car?<eos> No.<eos> Yes!<eos> No, no.<eos> What does she say next?<eos> I mean, does she say what she did?<eos> Does she say why?<eos> She does.
I don't want you here.<eos> Get out.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.
Get out.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.<eos> - I really do.
You finally win, once!<eos> - I am so fucking rich!<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Justy!<eos> Alex!<eos> About fucking time, you guys.<eos> These cards are getting stale.<eos> Come on, sit down.<eos> Jess and I had this thing planned.<eos> - No, we don't.
How did you get to run this meeting, anyway?<eos> It's not the dance committee.<eos> - I sit, or I start taking pictures.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> And calm down.<eos> I think it's clear what they know.<eos> Look around.<eos> What do we all have in common?<eos> We don't know who got the subpoenas.<eos> Sheri didn't.
My mind and heart were still in the big, blank nothing.<eos> Jensen.<eos> The fuck do you want?<eos> Hey, Bryce, um...<eos> Listen, I was wondering... if... I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't mind...<eos> Look, I know it's weird, but I was hoping to buy some weed.<eos> It's kind of an emergency.<eos> You want to buy some weed.<eos> From me.<eos> Yes, I do.
From me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Why would I mind?<eos> Come on in.<eos> So you need some weed, huh?<eos> Yeah, um, I do.<eos> 'Cause you got yours confiscated the other day.<eos> - You heard about that?<eos> - Yeah, everybody did.
Anything you need.<eos> Just put it down on the inventory, which no one bothers to look at<eos> - when they call the distributor anyway.<eos> - I told you, they only allow for...<eos> Of course, if you're listening to this, I failed.<eos> Or he failed, and my fate is sealed.<eos> Okay, Mom, I'm off.<eos> Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Hey.<eos> When do we get to hear about this project?<eos> You don't.
Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?<eos> Not really.<eos> I-I think...<eos> I think...<eos> I might have been...<eos> I might have hurt Hannah's feelings... a little bit.<eos> But I didn't mean to.<eos> Hurt her feelings how?<eos> I thought she wanted to date me.<eos> She didn't.
Look, Clay... whatever happened to Hannah, between you and her, with other kids, she made that choice to take her own life.<eos> But why?<eos> Why did she make that choice?<eos> We can't know that for sure.<eos> What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.<eos> I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.<eos> It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.<eos> Maybe it does.
That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.<eos> When did you talk to her last?<eos> She told you how she got to that point.<eos> Wasthere...<eos> Did you have an encounter at the party?<eos> An encounter?<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> Did...<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.
I need to get on with things.<eos> If things aren't going to change, I'd better get on with it.<eos> Hey, Hannah.<eos> She walked out of this office... and she hoped you would come after her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can have that for you...<eos> His door is closed behind me.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - But you didn't.
And who has them now?<eos> At this point, I don't know.<eos> Jesus.<eos> But who's gonna believe a dead girl, right?<eos> I guess we'll find out.<eos> Justin.<eos> Justin.<eos> You know the real story, right?<eos> You know what's true.<eos> I do now.
But let's just say he had some help.<eos> And the true power here... is a little more complicated than that.<eos> And two, there is, by law... and strict enforcement of the administration, no piracy in Nassau.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Not ever.<eos> It's critical for commerce. This is known to the world.<eos> Meet me at the jetty.<eos> Are we ready to depart?<eos> Don't remember talking about bringing on new people.<eos> Ah, we didn't.
♪♪<eos> Morgan?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> ♪♪<eos> Richard: How do you know each other?<eos> We go back to the start.<eos> Well, the King is ready to see you.<eos> Did you find Carol?<eos> I did, yeah.
He escaped.<eos> Every second he's out here, he's a target.<eos> You gonna say you were right?<eos> No.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm just real sorry they're gone.<eos> Negan murdered Glenn and Abraham, beat them to death.<eos> Terrorized the Hilltop, set loose walkers just to make a point.<eos> I used to think the deal was something we could live with.<eos> A lot of us did.
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead."<eos> I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.<eos> He obviously doesn't wanna be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
Yeah, I'll get you something for that cut.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You went to see them, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Part of your deal?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> They did that to you.<eos> You know what they are.<eos> I do.
We'll have another chance.<eos> But we're running out of time.<eos> If you and your people want to move against the Saviors... you need to do it soon, and you need the Kingdom.<eos> What we have to do requires sacrifice one way or another.<eos> Guys like us... we've already lost so much.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I know... that Carol, living on her own like that... she might as well be dead right now.<eos> She gets hurt, she dies, if she catches a fever, if she's taken out by a walker... if she gets hit by lightning -- anything -- anything happens to her, I'll kill you.<eos> I would die for the Kingdom.<eos> Why don't you?
No, I get it.<eos> We need the Kingdom.<eos> You got to make that happen.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, I - - I really am, but, uh... it can't be me.<eos> Look, whatever it is you're holding on to... it's already gone, man.<eos> Wake the hell up.<eos> You're the same as me, Daryl.<eos> You don't know shit about me.<eos> No, I do.
Ice-cold.<eos> I love it.<eos> Come.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Better than that.<eos> You can call next, but it might be a while.<eos> Oh.<eos> Did you make the pills?<eos> I did.
Nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's gonna work out.<eos> What... What does that even mean, Tara?<eos> It means we've got the numbers to fight now.<eos> We just need to find some guns and...<eos> Do you know where we could find that many guns today?<eos> This week?<eos> This year?<eos> No. You don't.
We need guns.<eos> I'm gonna go find them.<eos> Shh.<eos> Shh.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What was it?<eos> It was a deer.<eos> I owe you a deer.<eos> From before. When they were outside the gate.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I was ready to.<eos> And if I had done it, like I'd planned to,<eos> Negan would be dead right now.<eos> And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead, too, but who gives a damn?<eos> Eugene would still be here.<eos> Olivia would still be alive.<eos> Spencer would still be alive.<eos> And now they're gone, and I'm here because I was stupid enough to listen to you.<eos> But you were.<eos> And you did.
And now they're gone, and I'm here because I was stupid enough to listen to you.<eos> But you were.<eos> And you did.<eos> You stand there telling people about their lives.<eos> Only if they come here.<eos> Like you.<eos> Right now.<eos> You don't know shit about shit.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Sorry.<eos> I was just thinking.<eos> Wh... You... You want this?<eos> Congrats.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Someone gave it to me, someone who helped me.<eos> She put her ass on the line for me.<eos> She saved my life, you know?<eos> She didn't have to.<eos> But she did.
Wh... You... You want this?<eos> Congrats.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Someone gave it to me, someone who helped me.<eos> She put her ass on the line for me.<eos> She saved my life, you know?<eos> She didn't have to.<eos> But she did.<eos> That means something now...<eos> It does.
Someone had to die.<eos> I tried to be the one.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> So I'll be the one to lead our army to crush the Saviors -- destroy them.<eos> Me.<eos> I'll talk to Ezekiel.<eos> I'll tell everyone what I did.<eos> And I'll live the rest of my life making up for it.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> Did you?
Negan killed Glenn and Abraham.<eos> What?<eos> Beat them to death with a baseball bat.<eos> Now the Saviors have Alexandria, and Rick and everybody else... everything they do is for the Saviors now.<eos> And they killed more.<eos> Killed Spencer, Olivia...<eos> Jesus brought Rick and the rest here because...<eos> Rick wants to fight them.<eos> You wanted to know.<eos> Now you do.
You should try it sometime.<eos> Even if it doesn't last.<eos> I'm gonna talk to our blacksmith about making more spears.<eos> Maybe we can trade with the Kingdom for some body armor.<eos> Thing is, what we really need is riot gear.<eos> I was... looking for something to read the other day.<eos> You can have the bullets.<eos> I didn't know you had a gun.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I do now.
But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.<eos> I have never in my life been as scared as I was that night in the woods, kit to the grit, fully believing my number's about to be called, then seeing it happen to someone brave to a survivor.<eos> And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event --<eos> I just... I couldn't.<eos> Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> I do.
We should've just killed you in the village.<eos> You're gonna be glad you didn't.<eos> You're not alone, are you?<eos> Sit.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to sit.<eos> Hey, Cyndie.<eos> You promised.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
I want you to sit.<eos> Hey, Cyndie.<eos> You promised.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
It works for me.<eos> Have you killed any of them?<eos> Because if you have and they've found out, they may think it was the Kingdom, and we lose our advantage.<eos> It's from walkers.<eos> Can we move them aside?<eos> Do you seek to extinguish everything of who you were?<eos> I don't seek it, but... I'm stuck.<eos> You want the Saviors dead?<eos> Morgan.<eos> Yes, I do.
I hate you!<eos> Not an issue, sweetie.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Drop the gun, Rick!<eos> Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really [bleep] this up right now.<eos> I'm not letting you let my sister die!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> I wasn't gonna let her die, you [bleep] moron!<eos> Aww. The point is he thought I was going to.<eos> I totally did, by the way.
You'll understand later.<eos> What is your religious denomination?<eos> Are you a Sunni, a Shia, an Alawite...<eos> I buried the Prophet and all gods along my family.<eos> I'll write down "an atheist."<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> But I'm not that, either.<eos> I'll write down "no religion."<eos> Why did you want to come to Finland?<eos> I didn't.
There's no need.<eos> I don't want to change my name.<eos> I want to keep my identity.<eos> I'll go and report myself tomorrow.<eos> As you wish.<eos> I'll take you to Mirja, and tomorrow we'll escort you to the police.<eos> You're the best brother in the world.<eos> Remember how I teased you as a child?<eos> When you were really thin.<eos> No, I don't.
That's, what have you, fate or luck.<eos> - Plus my steely gaze. Striking fear into the hearts of the elderly.<eos> - I'm proud of you mister.<eos> You really, you focused.<eos> It's like I said, simpatico.<eos> Third runner up.<eos> - In the Olympics that's bronze.<eos> - Now see, that's the kind of thinking that's gonna take us straight to the top.<eos> So, I got it Ray.<eos> I did.
You taught them that.<eos> Dr. Khatri, what can I do for you?<eos> I need Dan Andersson's medical records.<eos> You must know, they are confidential.<eos> In all matters of public health in Fortitude, I have the full authority of the W.H.O, the Norwegian government and of course the governor.<eos> I wasn't aware of that.<eos> May I ask what your concern is?<eos> Aren't you the least bit surprised by his recovery?<eos> I believe in miracles.<eos> I don't.
So my father had her rubbed out?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> He was in Vukobejina with your wife the night she was killed.<eos> Can we rule him out now?<eos> You seem tense.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Tell me a little bit about yourself.<eos> I'm an only child.<eos> I attended the local comprehensive school and won a scholarship to read medicine at Cambridge.<eos> I did my postgraduate degree at Oxford, then a doctoral thesis at M.I.T.
- Like the police?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> I'm Chief in Eden Valley.<eos> Or, was Chief.<eos> We're being swallowed by the county, so hierarchy's a little unclear at present.<eos> Married or divorced?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Your finger.<eos> You used to wear a ring.<eos> Now you don't.
-When?<eos> -Yesterday.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, there'll be a record of that.<eos> Did you speak for long?<eos> Just a few minutes.<eos> Well, it's just a quick call, just to catch up, innit?<eos> Be vague.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> No one ever does.
Hello?<eos> Uh, sir? - You're not supposed to be in here.<eos> Uh, you can't be in here, sir.<eos> Library is closed.<eos> You're here.<eos> Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> Sir?<eos> You're gonna have to leave.<eos> I just did.
Like you whack a tennis ball back and forth.<eos> Killed him where?<eos> In the den of a shithole apartment.<eos> Framed picture-puzzle in the wall, like some six-year-old, so proud, he had to hang it up.<eos> Christmas Eve.<eos> You think there's a special level of hell for people that killed their loved ones on Christmas Eve?<eos> I wanted the stamps, see?<eos> My dad gave me a car, but I wanted the stamps.<eos> What 17-year-old boy wants stamps when he can have a cherry-red corvette?<eos> But I did.
No, see, delusions feel real, okay?<eos> That's why it's a delusion.<eos> None of this feels real.<eos> It feels like a dream.<eos> What a beautiful, beautiful thing to be able to dream when you're not asleep.<eos> I've... I've crossed enough paths to know that one in four people are rock stupid.<eos> Even the smart ones have got some kind of delusion they believe in, whether it's gods or ghosts.<eos> Do you believe in love?<eos> Yeah, I believe the shit out of love.<eos> Did you always?
Amos is different.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, very different.<eos> But he's not crazy and he's not evil.<eos> He's just always needed someone to help him out with the world.<eos> And he picked you.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Do you know that old story, Pinocchio?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Not a credible witness either.<eos> This isn't the arrangement we made, Carrie.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Our partnership.<eos> You were supposed to secure funding, investigate, advise.<eos> What you weren't supposed to do was take matters into your own hands, break the law.<eos> - I'm sorry, Reda.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You did.
How many targets can it track simultaneously?<eos> 300, with the ability to engage 36 of them at any one time.<eos> I'm... I'm free to go?<eos> You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
- If you wish.<eos> - I wish.<eos> I hate to be the bearer of bad news.<eos> It appears Iran is violating the nuclear agreement.<eos> How?<eos> By pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> "Appears to be."<eos> The evidence is more than credible.<eos> Saul calls it conclusive.<eos> Mr. Berenson does.
The Mossad operation.<eos> There's been a request you represent us on the ground there.<eos> From whom?<eos> Not the president.<eos> Ah. The president-elect.<eos> Which brings us right back to what we were discussing the other day.<eos> Who on Earth is advising her?<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Of course I do.
- You do?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> I was thinking the same thing.<eos> In fact, I went to see her today, see Carrie.<eos> - And?<eos> - Asked her point blank,<eos> "Are you advising the president-elect?"<eos> - She said no.<eos> - And you believe her?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Not exactly.<eos> You came... very close to dying.<eos> Very... close.<eos> You must know that.<eos> There's a video of it.<eos> It was... It was all over the Internet.<eos> You've never seen it?<eos> No, I-I didn't want to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I do now.
No. No, it's good.<eos> It's a... it's a happy ending.<eos> I'm just wondering how the hell you pulled it off.<eos> It's better you don't know.<eos> Trust me. As long as this doesn't come back and bite us in the ass.<eos> - It won't.<eos> - Well, we're gonna be asked why we're not bringing a civil suit, that's for sure, why we're not sending a clear message to law enforcement. I... I think they got the message.<eos> What about Sekou?<eos> Doesn't he deserve to be compensated?<eos> Of course he does.
It won't happen again.<eos> Listen, um, something's come up.<eos> I-I gotta run.<eos> Can you s... tell everyone I said goodbye?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Mr. Hashem, you haven't eaten a thing.<eos> Here. Don't mind if I do.<eos> So Simone told me you got me my job back.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
Well, it's snack time!<eos> Y-you... you... You're 14 minutes late.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - But I was worried.<eos> - You should call.<eos> - Well, don't worry.<eos> I was with Franny.<eos> We were fine.<eos> A man came to school, and he had painted hair, and he scared Mommy.<eos> No, he didn't, sweetheart.
You're burned.<eos> Your face is all over the Internet.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> I got people out there after my ass.<eos> I need protection.<eos> Protection?<eos> Even my mom was looking at me funny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, guess what. People are looking at me, too.<eos> These people here do.
I expected to hear from you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.<eos> I said I expected it.<eos> - Is this about the bomb?<eos> - No. Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
Almost none.<eos> I did find one thing.<eos> The lease on that Jeep he's driving in the photos.<eos> Did you get a name?<eos> What I got was a wall of shell companies that dead-ends at some corporation off the Dulles Toll Road.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go down there and check it out.<eos> If that guy...<eos> If he's involved in the bombing, like those photos suggest, but he wasn't working with Sekou, I don't even know what we're saying here.<eos> I don't, either.
Quinn.<eos> The photos stop just before he gets to the van.<eos> W-What happened next?<eos> Quinn, please.<eos> I realize it's been rough, but this is really important.<eos> Did you... did you see anything else?<eos> Did he put a bomb on the van?<eos> You said...<eos> "P-Protect Franny."<eos> And I did.
I hope I can win you over.<eos> You don't need to do that.<eos> I'd at least like to know why you couldn't support me.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Well, it matters to me.<eos> How many times in your life are you gonna be alone with the next President of the United States?<eos> I guess I don't trust you.<eos> And why is that?<eos> You backed away from the war.<eos> I did, yep.
I'll, um-- I'll figure something out.<eos> Baa, 'cause he's a sheep, obviously.<eos> Blue 'cause he's blue.<eos> And Hop.<eos> Hop.<eos> Great name.<eos> I named him when I was little.<eos> That's all I could say.<eos> Do you like rabbits?<eos> Yes, I do.
The man in there is a US soldier just released from psychiatric care, suffering from severe PTSD, and this is making things worse.<eos> Let me go in and talk to him.<eos> He's already got two hostages.<eos> - I'm not gonna give him a third.<eos> - I'm telling you-- They're not hostages and he's not a shooter!<eos> When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!
I know he does.<eos> You know what they're calling it--<eos> "Escape From New York."<eos> Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location."<eos> Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?<eos> - We didn't.
And it wasn't because I thought I'd be a terrible mother.<eos> Some people would say that's a given.<eos> It was because...<eos> Her father and I...<eos> We had a relationship that was unusually intense.<eos> However complicated my life was, his was 1,000 times more.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> At all.<eos> Maybe I was afraid she would remind me of that.<eos> And did she?
Well, her father had red hair, and... and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.<eos> Not just that.<eos> Of my role in his not being there.<eos> I knew where everything was heading.<eos> I... I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really... I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
If you won't say what's bothering you, how am I supposed to help?<eos> You tried to kill me.<eos> The guy you sent.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - The fucking guy!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter.<eos> You know that.<eos> I don't.
No.<eos> If you don't believe that, please, just pull the trigger.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - What the fuck did you do?<eos> You sound terrible.<eos> I told you to leave him alone.<eos> And I told you there were other opinions.<eos> You answer to me, you fuck.<eos> To me, you hear that?<eos> Yeah. I do.
He ran past me.<eos> He was shouting.<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Get out of my fucking way!<eos> Some men run towards the fight.<eos> Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> Dar Adal's handiwork.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
And how was Saul Berenson connected?<eos> He almost died in the bombing.<eos> There's evidence of his complicity.<eos> - Where? What evidence? - The NSA's made its meta-databases available to us.<eos> The NSA?<eos> He had multiple contacts with each of the core conspirators Of course he did-- in the context of his job.<eos> We're in the process of evaluating those conversations now.<eos> David, you sent me out there to personally assure people this would never happen.<eos> You- - You used me.<eos> Yes, we did, and for good reason.
I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here. You don't.<eos> - Quinn--<eos> - You don't.
A priest.<eos> I mean, I can't go through this again.<eos> There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.<eos> She's...<eos> - No. No.<eos> No one does.
Okay, I need you to lay down and, uh, tell me again exactly how you fell.<eos> Dr. Kinney?<eos> Your patient in 3, can you move him out?<eos> I could use the bed.<eos> And by "I," I mean Dr. Miller.<eos> I would love to, but I don't have a patient in 3.<eos> Your, uh, Magic Mike?<eos> I told Williams to discharge him.<eos> You did?<eos> Of course you did.
You have arrived.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, beautiful.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> "The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our stars," "but in ourselves."<eos> Think Joel used to say that before he, uh, went into surgery.<eos> Joel loved him some Shakespeare.<eos> Yes, he did.
How'd you break it?<eos> I'm clumsy.<eos> Did I ever tell you how the day after October 14th I broke my leg?<eos> There was a picture of me on crutches in the newspaper once they found out about my family.<eos> The headline was "Nora Cursed."<eos> Rhymes with Durst.<eos> - Nora. - Hmm?<eos> How'd you break it?<eos> I don't wanna lie to you.<eos> Then don't.
- Uh, no, chief.<eos> - No?<eos> It's just that you've concluded that nothing's gonna happen tonight because nothing has happened?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-it's just, um,<eos> Ginny's not feeling well, so...<eos> Ginny?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know who she is.<eos> I honestly don't.
No, I came down here to be with you.<eos> Yeah, but if he's close by...<eos> Honey, I don't know where he is.<eos> And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.
- Are they mine, the twins?<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> It's relevant if you want me to answer your fucking question.<eos> They're not yours.<eos> She was working for you.<eos> Sorry?<eos> The woman at the bus stop who gave me her baby.<eos> That was a test, right?<eos> We have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you don't.
My people?<eos> ! I'm not one of those lunatics.<eos> Listen to me, there's a dangerous man on board.<eos> I can identify him.<eos> He's wearing a red hat and calling himself God.<eos> You mean David Burton.<eos> You know him?<eos> That woman, she said he was a friend of the captain.<eos> I'd hardly call him a friend, but I know him, sure.<eos> We all do.
I stopped for myself.<eos> It's an incredibly selfdestructive habit.<eos> That's what makes it so cool.<eos> My lighter?<eos> Can I have it back, please?<eos> You said you quit.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Then you don't need it.<eos> Please give it back.<eos> Like I did with Lily?
I had no choice.<eos> His chief's in a tarp under the goddamn church.<eos> He was heading right for it.<eos> Where are you gonna take him?<eos> Far enough away from civilization to give us time.<eos> You're just gonna leave him?<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If this thing with Kevin doesn't work, who gives a shit?<eos> Officer Koalafart here is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow along with all the rest of us.<eos> But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...
He's just sleeping.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's true...<eos> I borrowed your pills.<eos> Looks real.<eos> Indeed, it does.<eos> So, is this the part where you call the DSD and shut this operation down?<eos> Do you remember when we were kids after Mom and Dad died, when everyone at the church wouldn't take their eyes off us?<eos> And they'd take us to the movies and bowling and PuttPutt just to keep us busy?<eos> Of course I do.
-You must have called him.<eos> -No! I did not!<eos> 'Cause I can't see him, not yet.<eos> -Why?<eos> -Because!<eos> I made promises. I said I would come back with $16,000 in my pocket and a working pocket.<eos> I was gonna shower Mikey with gifts.<eos> Orchestra seats at a Mets performance. Mud flaps with a sexy man on them.<eos> Wait. This whole time you didn't get paid?<eos> Technically, I did.
Please tell me you're still tracking him.<eos> We were, he left the construction site heading east, but we lost him on 13th.<eos> I found out why Bin-Khalid's people wanted the strongbox.<eos> Inside there was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells that Bin-Khalid set up here along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.<eos> It looked like 15, maybe 20 cells but I didn't have the list for very long.<eos> He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.<eos> I am still waiting to find out what that is.<eos> Do you believe he'd really do that?<eos> He's angry, and he's unstable.<eos> I do.
Not until I know if I can trust you.<eos> Trust me?<eos> Because I'm the one who's acted completely out of bounds?<eos> The Ranger squad that killed Bin-Khalid was attacked this morning.<eos> Four of them were murdered and their families.<eos> What are...<eos> The Rangers were living under new identities that only three people had access to, the directors of CIA, NSA... and you.<eos> And you think I gave them up?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Ben told me to come alone.<eos> He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
It was the only way I could save your campaign.<eos> Six weeks ago, I was contacted by someone claiming to be Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> He said he had evidence that my company had bought off-market oil from ISIL.<eos> Threatened to go public with it.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Dad?<eos> One of our major pipelines had been blown up a year before.<eos> We were facing a catastrophic production shortfall, and my regional director cut a deal.<eos> So you bought oil from terrorists, then?<eos> No, I didn't.
It wasn't Nilaa.<eos> She's innocent, and I can prove it.<eos> Then who leaked those names?<eos> So you first noticed Mr. Grimes becoming unstable one year before the mission to eliminate Bin-Khalid?<eos> That's right.<eos> The war really changed him.<eos> I just... never realized how much.<eos> Did you report your observations to your superiors at the time?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
What did they say?<eos> "The lamb was too salty."<eos> Rich kids.<eos> Oh... I see.<eos> If only Justice Strauss had been able to get past Count Olaf, if only she'd seen the children in their horrible circumstances, if only this world weren't such a wicked and topsy-turvy place... this story might have turned out differently.<eos> I never wanna use a toothbrush again.<eos> Why aren't you cleaning?<eos> My list was very specific.<eos> We finished it.<eos> No, you didn't.
I am trying to engineer a future with a species that is more violent, intolerant and possessive than any species in the history of this planet.<eos> Sapiens live in a world designed by their worst fears.<eos> And nothing terrifies them like difference.<eos> You save your fucking justifications.<eos> You murdered an innocent girl.<eos> I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?<eos> There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.<eos> I thought a cop would understand that.<eos> Angelica did.
Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.<eos> Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.<eos> I was at the protest.<eos> I saw the look on their faces.<eos> They trusted you, Capheus.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> I pay a fraction of what it costs you or everyone who lives in Kibera for running water or electricity.<eos> We say there's nothing as expensive as being poor.<eos> Why? Because our government, like every other government, doesn't care about poor people or places like Kibera.<eos> But you do.
- Why?<eos> - Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ah... Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.
- How long has he been after you?<eos> - A year.<eos> - A year?<eos> - That has to be a lie.<eos> - Maybe the Cannibal is getting slow.<eos> - The Cannibal?<eos> Clustercide.<eos> Story is he ate his own.<eos> - Do you know his real name?<eos> - No one does.
So you got these different voices in your head, and one of them is Will?<eos> I know it sounds strange.<eos> If he's in your head listening, does that mean he can hear everything I'm saying?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski," he can hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> He says he deserves it.<eos> Damn right he does.
Did you watch it?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I watched it.<eos> - It has almost two million hits!<eos> Oh, can you believe it?<eos> - It is incredible.<eos> - Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.<eos> I know.<eos> He said that I needed to talk to you.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
We first considered hacking an invite, but because the police set-up is concentrated on the people coming through the front door...<eos> Security is so performative.<eos> From what we can tell, they're not even checking the staff.<eos> Just like the TSA.<eos> Which means, we found a back door, literally.<eos> The fake ID is a breeze.<eos> There is only one little problem...<eos> Do you know anything about tending bar?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> She doesn't, does she?
- I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand what you're going through.<eos> And I'm not judging, or trying to fix it, or tell you what to do.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I love you.<eos> And that you aren't alone.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lito, you have to get up, right now!<eos> If you don't do it...
- He's Pablo?<eos> - He's Pablo?<eos> I am.<eos> The deal was inked yesterday.<eos> We're...<eos> That's right, kid. In your Hollywood debut, you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor<eos> Blake Huntington.<eos> Why do you care so much about those things?<eos> I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.<eos> Of course I did.
I did. And when I heard you were meeting for this, I also screened The Passion of the Sinner.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I enjoyed it immensely.<eos> I thought it offered real insight on the interdependence of identity by rejecting the standard male narratives of sovereignty.<eos> I've said the same thing.<eos> "And he judged of others by himself, not believing in what he saw, but was convinced that every man had his real, most interesting life under the cover of secrecy and the dark of night."<eos> The Lady and the Dog.<eos> It is.<eos> Iberian Dreams reminds me of Chekhov.<eos> It does.
Not for me.<eos> Oh. You can perform?<eos> Fucking right I can.<eos> Come back to my office and try me.<eos> - Never had any complaints.<eos> - Nice.<eos> You know, they say a trained professional can always tell when someone's lying.<eos> That's an exaggeration.<eos> We don't always know.<eos> But right now, I do.
We are very excited to talk to you.<eos> Who isn't excited about textbooks?<eos> We aren't here about textbooks.<eos> We're recruiting officers.<eos> We're with an agency called the Institute for Global Advancement.<eos> You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan.<eos> Your current employment in no way suits your talents.<eos> You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people.<eos> I don't recall applying for anything.<eos> You didn't.
Shut the fuck up!<eos> Competitive table setting?<eos> Tablescape.<eos> It's called tablescape.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
I'm using the launch suit.<eos> - It's not designed for this.<eos> - I know.<eos> - There's not enough protection.<eos> - I know.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - Kat is less than a minute out.<eos> - Vent the airlock.<eos> - What about decompression?<eos> - Just do it.
To make sure that, that creature doesn't get to Earth.<eos> Then I should be Plan A.<eos> No, I'm a pilot.<eos> You're Plan B.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> I belong up here.<eos> I don't want to go back down to eight billion of those motherfuckers.<eos> I need you to say you trust me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I do.
lb and Edward told us about the little mistake.<eos> If you ask me, I don't think you should kill us.<eos> Right, Ingrid?<eos> You see, Igor, we love our husbands very, very, very much but sometimes marriage gets a little bit tired, you know?<eos> It's a bit like tide water.<eos> Sometimes the water is high and sometimes it's low.<eos> And for the last day, the water has been very, very, very low.<eos> - I hate water.<eos> - Yes, of course you hate water.<eos> Who doesn't?
Hurry up!<eos> Back off!<eos> Back off.<eos> Back off or he dies.<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> Take him down.<eos> They can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> I'm no use to them dead.<eos> - Do it now!
You're right.<eos> What Zack did is completely illogical, I know, but I still...<eos> I need to...<eos> No!<eos> No, this is not right.<eos> There is no other way of looking at this.<eos> Zack is a convicted murderer.<eos> He tried to kidnap you.<eos> And he wanted to kill you.<eos> Then why didn't he?
I do trust you.<eos> Just like you trusted us last night.<eos> - They want to help you, Trudy.<eos> - I'm going to have to do this on my own.<eos> My mum kept putting all her chips on men -- marrying them, not marrying them.<eos> Always ended up with a black eye, and the same old mess.<eos> I broke out that bedroom on my own.<eos> And now I'm going to break away from him.<eos> I want you to succeed, Trudy.<eos> I really do.
And if you wouldn't mind getting off my bed... .. I'd quite like a lie-down.<eos> Doctor, if I wasn't aware of Sister Mary Cynthia's need for psychiatric help before I saw you with her yesterday, I am now.<eos> And I'm very grateful for your interest.<eos> There is a particularly gentle, and therefore suitable, therapeutic community near Birmingham, called Northfield.<eos> Because her family live there, we may be able to get her in.<eos> Doctor, the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's family now, and she's already left for the Mother House.<eos> She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.
On the door.<eos> Logs everyone who goes in and out of the observatory.<eos> We all have individual cards to make sure everyone's accounted for in case of an eruption.<eos> Erm... If you intended to head up the volcano at night, in the dark, I assume you'd need to take a torch?<eos> Of course.<eos> You have to make your way through some pretty dense jungle up there.<eos> It just appears that Stephen didn't have one with him.<eos> But he... he must've done.<eos> My thought exactly.<eos> But, yet, he didn't.
I don't know what came over me but I thought,<eos> "Finally, here's my chance."<eos> So, you applied.<eos> As Megan Colley?<eos> I sent her degree, her results.<eos> And then all you had to do is travel on your own passport and pretend to be her.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking, I mean, I wasn't thinking.<eos> Who at the observatory knows about this?<eos> No-one.<eos> Did Stephen?
We know AMI is far more intelligent than the majority of suspects you've interrogated.<eos> Well, I can't argue that.<eos> My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands. See, Booth?<eos> AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.<eos> Okay, let's just stop the chitchat here, shall we?<eos> Let's just get with the program and get this over with.<eos> So... did you, AMI, attack Ian Goldberg?<eos> No, I did not.
The crown, the rare air...<eos> I do want it.<eos> It's been nearly seven hours now since President-elect Frankie Vargas - was shot in Fairmount Park...<eos> - You'll see behind me that a massive candlelight vigil is under way, the number of people growing by the minute...<eos> No appearance yet by Cyrus Beene or by the hospital staff, who remain tight-lipped about President-elect Vargas' condition...<eos> All we can do now is pray.<eos> We went through all 832 voicemails on the FBI tip line.<eos> No leads.<eos> Check them again.<eos> We did.
Are we in business?<eos> Now... it's all about timing.<eos> Scofield. You just as pretty as advertised.<eos> When do we get started?<eos> I need your help.<eos> You're asking me to break the law.<eos> I'm asking you to make a mistake.<eos> Forget to lock up.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it, Mike.
Come on, grab your bag.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> How did you find us?<eos> Acontact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.<eos> This is very radicalized neighborhood.<eos> Whoever set you up couldn't have set you up in a worse way.<eos> Throw your phones out the window.<eos> I don't want anyone tracking us.<eos> Do it!
- I'm gonna go talk to Hackett.<eos> - Emily, wait, before you do...<eos> No, why wait?<eos> The girl's a snake.<eos> She needs to be kicked off the team.<eos> I agree, but she is dangerous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
Hanna, you alright?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, Carly, would you mind giving us a moment?<eos> Thanks.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> What is this about?<eos> This is about you, and where you were yesterday when you were supposed to be here.<eos> And what you're willing to do to protect a lie.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
...Nicole Gordon has been found alive.<eos> Nicole?<eos> Hey.<eos> Nicole's upstairs.<eos> She's sleeping.<eos> I'm so sorry that she just took off, uh...<eos> Someone saw her getting into a cab outside the trauma clinic.<eos> Her therapist, her parents we've all been looking for her for hours.<eos> She didn't tell you that she was coming here?<eos> No, she didn't, so...
You know, paperwork.<eos> I guess there's lot of red tape when you're trying to un-marry a dead identity thief.<eos> Okay, officially, he's still alive.<eos> Well, did she officially change her last name yet?<eos> She should.<eos> Alison Rollins sounds like a mouthful of muffin.<eos> Ezra's still in New York, right?<eos> I-I'm not babysitting this pillow by myself.<eos> Okay, well, our place is loud enough already, Caleb snores.<eos> - No, he doesn't.

The end of the game.<eos> And that's what we're going to accomplish together.<eos> What happened at the clinic?<eos> When we explained the situation they said they'd rush the blood test.<eos> You explained things?<eos> Sort of explained.<eos> What do we think this means?<eos> It means that the world is much smaller than we ever thought.<eos> Lucas lied to us he said he didn't know anything about Charlotte.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
No, no, remember we talked to Dr. Randall about that before you left.<eos> Right.<eos> Alright, yeah, no, no, I'll give him a call.<eos> No, it's-it's okay, it's okay, just say hi to Nicole for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Nicole's dad?<eos> - Nicole's... dad.<eos> How are they?<eos> They want me to come back.<eos> - Nicole does?
Think about the mind that conceived this.<eos> Why build a Dollhouse when you can turn the entire town into a Dollhouse?<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Do you two wanna be left alone?<eos> I think I would just gotten assistant coach.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> Who am I if I stay?<eos> Nobody wanted this.<eos> Somebody did.
Whoever made it probably can't get into it now, it...<eos> There is poetry to that.<eos> When the game ends, the game dies.<eos> Do you think Lucas made this?<eos> I mean, he knows all about games and computers.<eos> It's not a game or a computer.<eos> There's electronics in it but the heart of the thing is mechanical.<eos> It was lovingly handmade.<eos> Mona, you have to help me play this game.<eos> - Do what?
Why me?<eos> Because you are the only person who isn't afraid of it.<eos> You admire it.<eos> You can get inside the head of whoever made this.<eos> The reason I'm not afraid of it is because you don't see a little Mona at that starting line.<eos> - Mona, please.<eos> - Don't ask me to do this.<eos> Mona, I am begging you.<eos> You are the only one who knows what it's like to make something like this.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Thanks.<eos> I figured that you'd be in Rosewood keeping tabs on Tanner's case.<eos> No, what's going to happen is going to happen.<eos> That doesn't sound like the Spencer I know.<eos> A little surprise.<eos> May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> The whole drive up, I thought about just staying on the road.<eos> Just following it someplace else.<eos> And why didn't you?
Shall I read you the statement?<eos> You went through my mail?<eos> We have what you want, you have what we want.<eos> Tell us the name of Alison's donor daddy.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then tell us who handed you the cash to make the transfer?<eos> Unless you'd rather tell the state board.<eos> Look, no..<eos> II don't have names.<eos> Alright. I never did.
You want to get it done right?<eos> Put it in the hands of a few.<eos> What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
Something.<eos> Some way I can get my boy back.<eos> Please.<eos> You sure this is where my son is?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Killing ain't right.<eos> Yeah, I read the Bible.<eos> You did?
Excessive need to bring the past back to life.<eos> Make it real.<eos> But enough of that.<eos> Time for the real dance to begin, am I right?<eos> We're going to get him back, okay?<eos> We got your wild card ready to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me that should be thanking you.<eos> You brought me all this way.<eos> We did it together.
Roan, your people are hungry for you to lead them.<eos> Do so now as your mother would have.<eos> Kill Wanheda.<eos> Take her power and rule over everything.<eos> Ah.. - That was something.<eos> - I know.<eos> Ahh... Hey, look.<eos> Um, now that everybody's coming back, I just...<eos> I don't want you to think that I expect anything.<eos> Uh, what if I do?
- That's super hot. - I know. It's what I was going for.<eos> So, I find out I can pull the patient ID thing all the way up my arm and hide it underneath my T-shirt, and I just get out past the nurse's station, I just walk out.<eos> - Where were you even going?<eos> - The beach?<eos> I don't even know.<eos> But there I am, just jogging down Wilshire Boulevard.<eos> I'm a full-on crazy person, and I'm jogging at the light...<eos> - She was on the way to the hospital. She just gets a bit nauseous because of, um... the chemo.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> No, I do.
He's her fiance.<eos> Right, come on, love.<eos> Ryan, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, love.<eos> It's all right, I've got her.<eos> We'll take care of her.<eos> Now, you and Gemma both live here?<eos> - Did you live on the island together?<eos> - No. Well, she did, most of the year.
Vicki took us over to Davy's memorial in the afternoon.<eos> We were back on the beach by four, waiting for the boat.<eos> Tourists aren't allowed there during nesting but she lets us go over.<eos> What time did you get home?<eos> We didn't.<eos> We always stay over in Ambersea.<eos> At the Westcliff Hotel.<eos> So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
- Er, just after lunch.<eos> - Did you stay with them?<eos> - No, I had to get back to the Visitor Centre.<eos> Then I was stuck there till we closed at five.<eos> - Did you see them in the evening at all?<eos> - No.<eos> We believe they were staying in Ambersea.<eos> I was in The Anchor all night for Sophia's party.<eos> What time did you go home?<eos> Er... well, I didn't, really.
- Do you know anything about that?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Gemma should've spoken to me before doing anything like that.<eos> And the judge said what?<eos> They said it was joint enterprise, but the whole trial was a joke.<eos> I wasn't even close enough to touch the guy when it kicked off.<eos> But the judge didn't like my face, so...<eos> And you've got no idea why Gemma would've been calling your probation officer?<eos> If I knew, I'd tell you.<eos> But I don't.
I should have killed you three years ago.<eos> All of you.<eos> Would have made my life a lot easier.<eos> Well, you live and learn.<eos> [whisper] I'm going to kill you last so you can watch your brother die.<eos> But first, I'm going to deal with that asshole.<eos> Oh, I've been waiting to put a bullet in your fucking head<eos> - for a long time.<eos> - Vince, I swear to God.<eos> - I don't...
I don't need the money.<eos> I need someone to launder it.<eos> You said bail bond's a cash business, so it'll be easy.<eos> Let's start with that.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was asleep.<eos> Right.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You asked me to trust you.<eos> I didn't.
Michaela's at the hospital.<eos> Asher's at Annalise's bail hearing.<eos> And you didn't want to go?<eos> I don't know what I want to happen to Annalise right now.<eos> Because you think she did it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oli, you got to go to the police.<eos> - No.<eos> - You can tell them that you cleared her phone because she threatened you.<eos> - She didn't.
I ain't trying to kill you.<eos> What, y'all girlfriends now?<eos> It's Frank.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> They're saying Wes died in the fire, and it's not true, so...<eos> Just... I need you.<eos> We were told you wanted to make a statement?<eos> About the murder of Wes Gibbins.<eos> What about it?<eos> I did it.
Before I did the official autopsy.<eos> Our initial theories change all the time.<eos> I saw someone there.<eos> Was it you?<eos> No.<eos> It should have been you.<eos> We were told you wanted to make a statement?<eos> About the murder of Wes Gibbins.<eos> What about it?<eos> I did it.
Call me when you want to talk.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did Frank confess?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Nate.<eos> He just wants to know if Frank knew I was pregnant.<eos> Did he?
I think that's smart, because all you really need to know...<eos> He just said that he doesn't want to know.<eos> Sam deserved it.<eos> Even Annalise would tell you that if she could.<eos> Back here.<eos> Every action you take right now has consequences for us.<eos> - Michaela.<eos> - This is my life on the line, and I've worked too hard to have it ruined because someone opened their fat mouth!<eos> You understand... right?<eos> I do.
And now you're sitting here, paying her what she's owed.<eos> She don't look as good as she did in the paper.<eos> She's still trying to keep that weave tight, though.<eos> Why she ain't turning around?<eos> 'Cause she rude.<eos> Hey, yo!<eos> Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.
Why?<eos> - You gonna tattle on us?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> They charged Frank.<eos> And?<eos> They charged him as your co-conspirator.<eos> I thought that I could do this, Annalise.<eos> I really did.
Please open the door if you're in there.<eos> Laurel!<eos> I'm gonna kill you if you're alive in there!<eos> You're out of the hospital.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> You told me I could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.<eos> No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.<eos> So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see Frank in the basement that night...<eos> I did!
Hello?<eos> I can't make Laurel not be mad at you.<eos> She gets to be mad right now, and whatever other emotions she's feeling.<eos> It's called the grief process, so don't try and trick me into making you two besties or something.<eos> - That's not why I called you here.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Can I just speak?<eos> I know you, Annalise, and, yes, I just called you Annalise, which I think is appropriate, considering where we are in our relationship.<eos> You can call me whatever you want.<eos> I just did.
Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?<eos> No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
We can make a million babies if you want.<eos> Good, let's get started, then.<eos> - Connor, I'm serious.<eos> - I know.<eos> No, Connor, no, I'm really serious.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I didn't do it because I was trying to be some saint.<eos> I did it out of guilt.
I mean, I'm glad you're alright.<eos> I...<eos> Uh... Can I come in?<eos> Just talk for a minute...?<eos> As you can see, I'm more than alright.<eos> I'm very well, in fact.<eos> How...?<eos> I always told you I'd get better.<eos> You just never believed me.<eos> Sure I did.
She just wanted to get back on our good side...<eos> Okay. How do you trust someone who bends any way the wind is blowing?<eos> Where is her integrity?<eos> Well, I can't help but blame myself.<eos> I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong, and I stirred the pot.<eos> So...<eos> Look, if you want to blame someone, you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
_<eos> Andrew?<eos> Uh, Professor Hayden told us to speak with you?<eos> Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Uh, hi, Andrew.<eos> I'm Sara Scofield.<eos> Thanks for taking the time.<eos> By any chance, did my husband Jacob Ness ask you to work on my cell phone?<eos> Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.
And as a sign of good faith... we'll tell you exactly where they are.<eos> Hey, can you see me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Blasted computer camera thing.<eos> Who makes these things?<eos> All right, I see you.<eos> Come on, hurry.<eos> Get this off of me.<eos> Hold your hand still.<eos> Just do it already.
You actually think I want to help you?<eos> What if I can get you the $100K?<eos> $100K?<eos> How are you gonna come up with that crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?<eos> I'm not in Chicago.<eos> I'm in Marseilles. - Marseilles?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been working on a couple deals.<eos> I got $100K in my hand. But I want off the hook.<eos> Sure you do.
Meet me halfway here.<eos> I suppose...<eos> I suppose we could limit the investigators to just nighttime hours.<eos> - Nighttime.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I'm sleeping...<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> It just makes the most sense He'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.<eos> You really think he's going to do that?<eos> I do, indeed.
Now! Prax!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Throw it!<eos> Throw it!<eos> Come on!<eos> God, do it!<eos> Prax, it's not Mei.<eos> Move!<eos> Alex, we're in.<eos> Do it!
We all are.<eos> When I was pregnant with your brother,<eos> Valentine drugged me.<eos> He did an experiment on the baby.<eos> What?<eos> He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
No!<eos> Please!<eos> She's our prisoner. She can't hurt anybody here.<eos> If only she had shown her victims as much mercy.<eos> After what she did, we're letting her off easy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've done nothing wrong.<eos> Five years ago, my father was mauled to death by a white wolf.<eos> That was you.<eos> You did that, didn't you?
She's safe.<eos> Jace, it's me.<eos> We need to get you to Alec.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why?<eos> He tried tracking you with his parabatai rune, but now, it's like he's stuck in some kind of nightmare and can't wake up.<eos> He was looking for you, so you're the only one who can help him.<eos> Okay. I'll... I'll get there.<eos> But you can't. The Clave still wants you dead.<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
Mom.<eos> Simon?<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> Oh, I thought something terrible had happened.<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> There's something I need to tell you about where I've been and who I am.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
I just wanna tell you that, um...<eos> I really appreciate you, Mom.<eos> Okay. Come on.<eos> I made a roast.<eos> I know it's overkill, but when...<eos> Okay, Mom...<eos> Mom, listen.<eos> I know I'm back, but I...<eos> I can't have you freak out if I'm out all night or if I sleep all day.<eos> The band does a lot of late-night gigging.
Smells like Shadowhunter.<eos> No need to worry.<eos> I'm not here on official business.<eos> And what other kind of business do people like you have?<eos> Looking a little under the weather.<eos> There's just something I need.<eos> The ultimate five-disc collector's edition of Blade Runner.<eos> Final Cut is, like... my favorite film of all time which is what I...<eos> What I should have said to you.<eos> - But you didn't.

- Hold on.<eos> You're telling me that this burnout used repressed memories<eos> - to write a screenplay?<eos> - That's not all.<eos> He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Which you had with you when you time-jumped<eos> - off the Waverider.<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - what you are talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
BULLOCK: Hey, Jim.<eos> Where are we with Tetch?<eos> Barbara and Nygma gave the mayor's office a list of demands...<eos> friend snuck me a copy.<eos> They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> GORDON: Yes, we do.
Good-bye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets - when you were knocked out. - (bullets clink on ground)<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
Since when are they taking orders<eos> I don't know, but I kind of like it.<eos> She had something in her hand. She had her phone in her hand.<eos> Well, it didn't look like her phone, so I told them to move.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
What's the plan?<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> We're walking into a fortress, and you're gonna use just a bow?<eos> To use a bow and arrow requires patience and discipline.<eos> That's Yurievich.<eos> I will take on his guards.<eos> Yurievich--<eos> Yurievich is mine.<eos> Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.<eos> I didn't... Sleep.
Okay, well, I only have two signed permission slips.<eos> So do the rest of you have yours?<eos> Well... I... I didn't really ask my parents.<eos> They don't know about me, they'd totally freak out.<eos> Hang tight, one second.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Um, your mom sent my mom a permission slip.<eos> - Do you not want me here?<eos> - N... No, of course I do.
Is it?<eos> I don't mean as the Green Arrow.<eos> You mean as a thug, right? No.<eos> It was...<eos> It was part of my life that I thought that I had moved past, but... here we are.<eos> Right.<eos> You know, the other guys said when you get in one of your moods I should just let you be, but, um, to be honest, brooding really kind of gets on my nerves.<eos> They told you about me?<eos> They tell you about Prometheus?<eos> Yeah, they did. W-W-Why?
Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Should I order something in?<eos> We might be here a while.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
That's how long my father struggled under the water before he died.<eos> According to my father's autopsy, your arrow pierced his aortic arch, but it didn't kill him.<eos> He was still conscious enough to feel his lungs filling with water for 145 seconds.<eos> And here you were bragging about a plan more intricate than torture.<eos> Did you ever think about why I chose the name Prometheus?<eos> He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.<eos> You see, because, like you, they play judge, jury, and executioner.<eos> But Prometheus took away their power.<eos> If that's what you're gonna do to me, you'll need to come up with something better than whatever this is.<eos> I did.
What are you doing?<eos> He will never tell you truth in that much pain.<eos> Does this have to do with your deal with Kovar, yes?<eos> Samovol'shchnia.<eos> If you knew what it was or what is coming, you will beg Kovar to spare you.<eos> And you...<eos> Are no one's hero.<eos> Everything and everyone that you love will wither and die at your touch.<eos> Good riddance.<eos> What do we do about Kovar?
Like I said, you have 48 hours.<eos> Hey. I finished that worm.<eos> I would've been a lot faster if I knew what kind of system I was embedding a backdoor into, but...<eos> Your timing is perfect.<eos> I just finished the compilation.<eos> This is all that we found on your target from all available video sources... Cell phones, traffic cams, security footage.<eos> Please promise me you're never gonna make a Felicity version of this.<eos> The world doesn't need to know how often I'm at the wine shop.<eos> I guess it's too much to hope that Chase took off his mask on camera.<eos> Actually, he did.
No.<eos> We're not done, Oliver.<eos> You and me, we're never gonna be done.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Listen, man, you can tell me that you're a serial killer, that you're crazy, or you're whatever Chase has shoved into your head, but I'm not believing any of that, even if you do, and that's because I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.<eos> The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
I know you're upset.<eos> I know you think that I've violated some kind of trust between us, but--<eos> Lyla.<eos> When you said that you wouldn't become like Amanda Waller, I was worried about you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're the one who seems to have a problem with the way that I've been running Argus, which is particularly interesting to me since neither one of us has a job that fits the conventional definition of morality.<eos> Well, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're upset because Argus is locking people up without due process when you and Oliver and your team of masked recruits has been playing judge and jury for years now.<eos> Lyla, I can't believe you'd actually compare team Arrow to this--this-- this clandestine government superagency!<eos> Well, I just did!
We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.<eos> Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...<eos> Do not attempt to interfere.<eos> No Burkhardt.<eos> Clear!<eos> I think they're leaving.<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> Here?<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> You don't?
To stay.<eos> No, no.<eos> He came to borrow a sleeping bag.<eos> He found a place to squat.<eos> One of the kids went to visit him.<eos> You know where?<eos> It's an abandoned house.<eos> From the description, it sounds like the one on Sparhawk Street.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> Yeah, I do, I do.
OurNavymightbe olderandslower, butthenumbers arestillon ourside.<eos> Wehaveenoughships toshoottheirsdown.<eos> WecouldknockMars outofoursky for good.<eos> Did you know thatmartianmarines alwaystrainat oneg, earthgravity?<eos> Theyflyat thespeedofwar.<eos> Itwon'tendout there.<eos> If we continue to force their hand, sooner or later, they will invade.<eos> Mars is an island.<eos> If we cripple their Navy now, they can't touch us.<eos> Chrisjen: But if they do?
You can't understand...<eos> The only thing he was out for was revenge.<eos> No, he cared about all of us.<eos> We had dresden.<eos> He was going to talk, we could've used him...<eos> We could've what? Worked out a deal?<eos> With a man who casually murdered countless belters.<eos> A man who was a threat to all human life, and that is why Miller shot him.<eos> He didn't have the right to make that decision.<eos> But you do?
It's floating dark, barely registers on radar but it's got a habitat ring, which means someone's home.<eos> The first thing we have to get past is this.<eos> Fred:<eos> Mmm-mmm. That's a stealth ship.<eos> Like the ones they used to kill the donnager.<eos> We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.
What did he say?<eos> He said he'd be okay throwing me into space without my helmet, but that you wouldn't like it.<eos> Sounds like Amos, 16-millimeter.<eos> It's kind of hard to explain.<eos> He's like a brother.<eos> We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship without my helmet, right?<eos> -I did.
Imagine human beings able to live in hard vacuum without a suit, or under the crushing atmosphere of a gas giant.<eos> Or able to hibernate long enough to travel to the stars.<eos> That's why you were willing to start a war?<eos> Have you heard of genghis Khan?<eos> He built one of the greatest empires in human history.<eos> Killed or displaced a quarter of the entire population on earth during his conquests.<eos> Today, that's the equivalent of 10 billion people.<eos> Eros is hardly a rounding error by comparison.<eos> And that justifies all of this?<eos> Of course it does!
It was sent to hijack life on our planet for its own ends.<eos> You can't save Eros.<eos> All you can do now is waste the data and ensure that every man, woman and child on that rock died for nothing.<eos> The data will erase itself if anyone other than me tries to decrypt it.<eos> Without this work, humanity will be left unarmed, ignorant, vulnerable, to an enemy who's already fired the first shot.<eos> I don't care who controls the project. So long as I can get back to my work, with no restrictions.<eos> So we have an understanding?<eos> We're going to need complete access to the data.<eos> As well as the names of everyone responsible for setting this in motion.<eos> Done.
I was made for you, Scott.<eos> Like you had me ordered, made, and measured just for you.<eos> And I want you to wear me.<eos> "It seemed strange<eos> "that out of a row of Union soldiers, "two or three made him think of dead loves "and dead lovers,<eos> Those are my words from my letter.<eos> Scott, you used my words?<eos> Oh, well...<eos> You made me a part of your wonderful book for the whole world to read?<eos> You really did it.

I really don't care what you think.<eos> I'm gonna run for president again.<eos> Okay?<eos> Mommy's gonna be president again.<eos> But you said that if any one of us objects that you're not gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed.<eos> You really did.<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - Yeah, woman, you really did.
My fucking nanny got another DUI and lost her license, and I'm stuck picking up my own kid like an asshole.<eos> So what's up?<eos> Uhh...<eos> Well, I know you wanted to buy Erlich's Pied Piper shares back in the previous iteration, the platform.<eos> Well, I was hoping you would want to come on as a follow-on investor - for the current platform.<eos> - The video chat? Yeah.<eos> It's got a great tech.<eos> We're growing like crazy.<eos> In fact, that's why we need funding, to keep up with the users, and I think it could be really good if we could just keep it going.<eos> No, you don't.
Were you going to say goodbye?<eos> I will see you when I return.<eos> But you don't know when that will be.<eos> No one knows.<eos> I wish you good fortune.<eos> Missandei.<eos> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why.<eos> I don't.
Do you believe in the afterlife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, my mom did.<eos> She seemed pretty sure.<eos> She used to say,<eos> "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow. Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
But to be honest, I didn't see you, not clearly, not like this here now in person.<eos> You are huge.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Do not talk to him.<eos> Do not say a word.<eos> Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.

A brand-new lemon-scented you?<eos> Oh, I'm a fine me.<eos> I just keep getting better every year.<eos> Of course you are, and that is the you that deserves to be seen incorporated.<eos> Everyone in the world gets their place.<eos> With you?<eos> That's why they call me Mr. World.<eos> And if they don't agree?<eos> I get it.<eos> I do.
No, I can see that.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> Usually when the grieving reach the bargaining stage, they find that avenue fruitless and go straight on to depression.<eos> But you, you've had your fucking bargain, and are loathe to go back to grieving.<eos> Consider this.<eos> The dead, when they come back, are tenacious little bastards and hang on until they're done, and then they're gone.<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> I know a charm that could lift grief from a grieving heart.<eos> Do you know a charm that can stop bleeding?<eos> No, I do.
- He bought it.<eos> Well done.<eos> So we're good, now?<eos> I said all you told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're good.<eos> Officer Andrew Dove, six years with the GCPD, twice decorated.<eos> Up for promotion in six months. Well, congrats, pal, 'cause you're going to Blackgate, and they love cops there.<eos> I stopped being a cop a long time ago.<eos> The hell you did.
Yes!<eos> I could have lived a life with the woman I loved.<eos> I could have been happy.<eos> No, Ed.<eos> You would have killed her.<eos> Just like you did the other one!<eos> You couldn't have helped it!<eos> And afterward, you would have hated yourself!<eos> Well... we'll never know, will we?<eos> I did it for love.
The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> He hit us on purpose.<eos> But I think you know that because you paid for his lawyer.<eos> Still think we have nothing to talk about?<eos> If you have a question for me, son... why not go ahead and ask it?<eos> Did you order the hit on my father?<eos> No.<eos> I respected your father.<eos> Much more than the son he left behind.<eos> But someone did.
But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.<eos> If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Over the centuries, we've tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that plagues Gotham, only for it to start up again.<eos> And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.
Even if I wanted to say yes, I can only survive a few hours outside the cold without my suit.<eos> And you don't have it because it's been locked away in a Wayne Enterprises black site ever since you escaped Indian Hill.<eos> Ivy?<eos> My suit.<eos> So, Mr. Fries, will you join us?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Where we are is not important, James.<eos> What matters is why you're here.<eos> You know why I killed my uncle.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hey, Jim.<eos> Where are we with Tetch?<eos> Barbara and Nygma gave the mayor's office a list of demands...<eos> friend snuck me a copy.<eos> They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> Yes, we do.
Goodbye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets when you were knocked out.<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
So why would you risk your life by coming here? I...<eos> I'm gonna get packing.<eos> It's time for H.R. to face the music.<eos> Guys, I know H.R. can be annoying, but he doesn't deserve to die.<eos> Different Earth, different morality.<eos> But he doesn't go back.<eos> I saw him.<eos> In the future, with me and Iris and Savitar, he was there.<eos> I mean, that must mean we don't let her take him back.<eos> Maybe we do.
Yeah, so you keep reminding me.<eos> No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.<eos> We depended on them.<eos> But with you, the roles are reversed.<eos> You depend on us.<eos> Harrison Wells was always there for me, so I guess in some weird way, I just... I want to be there for Harrison Wells.<eos> - Anyway... - Yeah.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> I thought you didn't want Dad to know we're going after this arms dealer.<eos> Yeah, no, I don't.
Iris.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Joe, I'm sorry...<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Joe already suspects something's up.<eos> You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.<eos> This story is going to change lives, Barry.<eos> Why do you think that you're the only one allowed to risk your life to do good?<eos> I don't.
And you're just telling me now?<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Dad, I didn't want them to say anything because I knew how you would react.<eos> This is not something you keep from your father, Iris!<eos> You should've known that.<eos> - And you should've too.<eos> - I know, Joe.<eos> Look, I can understand why they didn't want to tell me because they didn't grow up under the same roof that you did.<eos> They don't know... they don't know what my baby girl means to me,<eos> Barry, but you do.
- For every decision you make, a universe exists where you don't.<eos> Yeah, I actually went to that class.<eos> You better be going to all your classes.<eos> So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint, Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers...<eos> - Yeah, she did.
I guess I thought... one day we'd figure out a way to be together.<eos> You know, but now that you have your powers, it's... it's like I never hear from you.<eos> Jesse, if... if you would,<eos> I want you to stay.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because of your dad?<eos> Because Barry is going to find him.<eos> Look, you don't know that, okay?<eos> You don't.
No?<eos> What do you...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Solovar's words mean nothing now.<eos> You never had any intentions of letting us go, did you?<eos> I told you I needed you.<eos> I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.
No, Cisco's right.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> One of us has to die.<eos> Hi.<eos> What you doing up there?<eos> Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.<eos> He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Well?<eos> Good chat, was it?<eos> I-I don't know if I can take another one of those séances.<eos> Anyone else with me?<eos> I almost filled my drawers.<eos> Okay, so other than Savitar taking scaring-the-bejeezus-out-of-us to a whole new level, did we actually learn anything?<eos> - Please say yes.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> When I mentioned the Stone, he questioned whether or not we'd really gotten rid of it.<eos> We did.
You gotta get out of your head, man.<eos> You gotta just run, you gotta push everything else to the side.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
- No. No.<eos> Julian, we gotta end this, for everybody's sake.<eos> I'll see you downstairs.<eos> Okay, well, you guys can count me out, all right?<eos> 'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply of boxers to this planet.<eos> Julian, please.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.<eos> Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's Iris.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll be right back, but... just let me know if you get anything, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.<eos> Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone, might want to wait on it.<eos> Well, the truth had to come out, so...<eos> Yeah, it did.
You mean like this clown just did?<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Wallace...<eos> I understand what you've been through.<eos> Stuck in the Speed Force, things you saw...<eos> I get it. I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.<eos> When you get bucked from the horse, best thing you can do... get right back on the damn thing and ride, Wallace.<eos> Ride!<eos> Hello, Barry Allen.<eos> - How do you...
About what?<eos> Same as you.<eos> The future.<eos> And my dad.<eos> What about him?<eos> I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.<eos> - if he does...
- Julian!<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> Oh, boys... where are you?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Buying us some time.<eos> Hey, dummies.<eos> My palm scan still works.<eos> I don't want to have to do this.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I do.
What do you say?<eos> Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings and some book readings... lot of women left to charm, but I... I'm in.<eos> You know what?<eos> Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters.<eos> Maybe 10% off.<eos> On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
Did it not work?<eos> Do we need to try again?<eos> No, I went.<eos> I'm back.<eos> You're back?<eos> I went to the future.<eos> How far?<eos> Eight years from now.<eos> I needed to talk to myself and find out who Savitar was.<eos> Did you?
You will now.<eos> Just put 'em on.<eos> - You'll be okay.<eos> - Just don't get them wet.<eos> - [clears throat] Your Honor, I, uh...<eos> - What? Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
It'll help me prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, golly.<eos> Look at us.<eos> Just three musketeers working away.<eos> Just like old times, huh?<eos> Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?<eos> No.<eos> No, she did not.
Your family.<eos> Caitlin, I can fix you.<eos> You already tried.<eos> Well then, I'll try harder.<eos> I don't care what it takes.<eos> I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.

It's my home.<eos> It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt<eos> - I belong completely.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?
It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt<eos> - I belong completely.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.

Don't stress.<eos> - Tracy's bazooka...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - ... it's gonna work.<eos> - Tracy's bazooka?<eos> - Yeah, you helped.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> I didn't...<eos> - I didn't help.<eos> - Yes, you did.
The witches gave some magical help to a local metalsmith who was making a church bell for them.<eos> This bell had a special purpose.<eos> But what no one realized was that Seline and I had befriended this metalsmith.<eos> We threw a little wrinkle into his plan.<eos> Wait...<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Call it extra credit.<eos> I found some descriptions of an antique church bell in your family estate records.<eos> Wait, we have an estate?<eos> Oh, we did.
She'll freak out.<eos> It'll get in the way of the investigation.<eos> I really don't think this is a good idea.<eos> Are you guys done having your whisper fight?<eos> Uh, just make out already and get it over with.<eos> So... I did find this syringe on the scene.<eos> It had a tiny bit of poison left in it, so, yeah, in theory, someone out there may have been dosed.<eos> Okay, but the other poisons had corresponding antidotes, yeah? Mm-hmm.<eos> Did you find anything to match this one?<eos> I did.
Let's play.<eos> Did I tell you, I watched you on TV in that dirty-ass rec room in Danbury when Empire's first album was inducted into the Music Hall of Fame.<eos> Who was your muse for that?<eos> You done, bitch? Huh, Lucious?<eos> Don't you come any closer.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Who was your muse on that, huh? !<eos> Who was your muse, Lucious?<eos> Oh, do you remember this one?<eos> Because I do.
Boy, you know what I'm talking about.<eos> You better back down.<eos> Ma, he has never been my supplier.<eos> Look, we'll, we'll... deal with this another time, all right?<eos> Figure something out together, but right now, - I need to talk to my mom.<eos> - Yeah, he needs to talk to his mother.<eos> Maybe you should go talk to yours.<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> You guys do the family thing, man.
He doesn't even know I'm here.<eos> Look, I know you've been really nice and helpful with me, but you've become a huge problem.<eos> And I don't see a reason why we shouldn't just kill you right now.<eos> What?<eos> Let me do it, Dwight.<eos> Mama, please, will you leave?<eos> Okay.<eos> You've got 30 seconds to convince us why we should let you live.<eos> Look, I didn't need to be here right now. I could've gone to Witness Protection and taken Bella with me.<eos> Well, why didn't you?
Miss...<eos> Why is this not working?<eos> It's... It says D-Major on there.<eos> Is there some kind of mistake?<eos> You see it says D-Major?<eos> Do me a favor and call Jamal.<eos> Hey, man, come on. You don't want to be doing this.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> You don't know what I want to be doing.<eos> Yeah, I do.

You don't want to be doing this.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> You don't know what I want to be doing.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> We both do.
Been there, did it, done that.<eos> Yeah, this is nice and all, Mom, but I don't see how it solves our Vegas problem.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> You know that woman your daddy's messing around with?<eos> Yeah, Giuliana.<eos> She's dangerous.<eos> I still think it's payback for Angelo.<eos> Your daddy don't even realize it.<eos> I'll give it a month before he makes her kick rocks.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
Well, we're not one either.<eos> Then we, a family, should understand another family, trying to protect one of their own.<eos> And it's y'all fault because y'all constantly have to clap back.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - She came for me.<eos> I don't want to hear that.<eos> No, if they're going low now, though, then we can go high for once.<eos> Isn't that cute, you learned something from Michelle Obama.<eos> Yes. I sure did, yeah.
Mm. I haven't felt this good in a millennia. Mm!<eos> Oh, goody.<eos> Ah, quit your whinin'.<eos> You'll regain your strength soon enough.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> You'll have to keep better track of your things, Castiel.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I get wanting revenge.<eos> I-I really do.
Hell, I get it.<eos> We can be real jackasses.<eos> But you're gonna talk to me, son.<eos> You just are.<eos> Now that's not a threat.<eos> I don't believe in torture.<eos> Doesn't work.<eos> Oh, I've seen folks waterboarded, cut on.<eos> And they talk.<eos> Ooh, they do.
Pardon?<eos> Brings me to your final gift -- the Throne of Hell.<eos> You want me to be king?<eos> Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead, and Lucifer back in his box, we need a ruler.<eos> You are next in line, Ramiel.<eos> Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
You're a killer, Dean Winchester, and so am I.<eos> And if we go too long without something to track or trap or punch or gut, well, things get a bit ugly.<eos> Don't they?<eos> The Men of Letters keep me busy.<eos> They point me in a direction and bang. Off to the races.<eos> It's not a bad life.<eos> Speaking of...<eos> Now that you've heard what I have to say, places to be, vampires to behead.<eos> You got a line on vamps?<eos> I do.
You mean, we?<eos> Yes, dumb-ass.<eos> We.<eos> You, me, and Sam, we're just better together.<eos> So now that you're back, let's go, Team Free Will.<eos> Let's get it done.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Great.<eos> And I'd like a beer.<eos> What did you do?
Kelly, if he's born... that is not something you can survive.<eos> So even if you are right, and even if the worst isn't inevitable, then who will care for him when you're gone?<eos> Who?<eos> Who is strong enough to protect him and to keep him from evil influences and to keep him on the righteous path?<eos> What?<eos> He just... he just kicked.<eos> Do you want to...<eos> No.<eos> It's not a big deal, Castiel.<eos> He does it, like, 20 times a day.
Listen, we found another way.<eos> And you would know that if you would answer your phone.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> What you did with me, with... With Gadreel, remember?<eos> The... the grace extraction.<eos> We take the grace from the baby, from the nephilim, and then the baby just becomes...<eos> Human.<eos> Human.<eos> Wait a minute. That extraction, it nearly killed you.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
No. You stay here, you sit down, and you shut up.<eos> You're all right.<eos> The pressure waves are still very far apart.<eos> "Pressure waves"?<eos> It's what they -- it's what they called contractions in my doula class.<eos> I-I took it online.<eos> First-time mothers, labor can be 12 to 18 hours, sometimes longer.<eos> It... Although, given this is the child of Lucifer and a quasi-celestial being...<eos> They didn't cover that online?<eos> They did not.
Usually I gun down flyboys on sight.<eos> But, uh, he looked... different.<eos> Wasn't wearing a necklace made out of baby ears, for one thing.<eos> We got to talking about where I came from and our two worlds.<eos> From what he says, pretty much peaches and cream on your side.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's better than this.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.<eos> And you do?
You're welcome to have Beth accompany you, if it helps.<eos> We were still discussing the timing!<eos> No!<eos> You were discussing it, I'd made a decision.<eos> - Can we not...<eos> - No, we can't!<eos> What if another woman gets raped while we're still discussing?<eos> How would you feel, living with that for the rest of your life?<eos> - I know it's a hard balance.<eos> - You don't, actually.
None of it even touched the sides.<eos> But there's one thing I think about all the time.<eos> I can't get it off my head.<eos> And it's how we got it wrong.<eos> - Got what wrong?<eos> - Joe Miller.<eos> We should have just thrown him over that cliff while we had the chance, mate.<eos> But we were merciful, weren't we?<eos> We...<eos> Yeah, we did what good people do.
Yeah.<eos> Erm... So... we were all in here.<eos> Erm, people were coming in and out of that door there and the food was being done there.<eos> You knew everyone on the invite list?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. More or less.<eos> There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once.<eos> Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm Chloe... Latimer.<eos> Is your dad in?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> Good.<eos> Cos it's you I want to see.<eos> I tried to talk to you earlier, at the football, but there were too many people around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You do.
Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just sex.<eos> Cos me and Cath...<eos> Erm we... we don't... er...<eos> Look...<eos> What I'm saying is, I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.
I don't know, but we'll need to see your computer.<eos> - And your phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because an account registered to you was used to send the messages.<eos> Well, it's wrong.<eos> - It wasn't me.<eos> - We'll need your computer.<eos> I think it'd be better if you just told us what the text was supposed to mean.<eos> I didn't send any bloody text!<eos> - Well, someone did.
- Yeah, that was possibly me.<eos> Sarah, please say you didn't.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Sarah Elsey.<eos> I work here with Ian.<eos> I'm his girlfriend.<eos> And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife?<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Is Daisy in?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Just tell her the boys came round.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> I thought maybe you'd need a friend.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> I got everything you asked for.<eos> I found Joe Miller.<eos> It's time to put things right.<eos> - We did that...
I live at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere.<eos> Why have you come to the station today, Laura?<eos> I read about the woman who was raped.<eos> It happened to me, too. I was raped.<eos> And when was this?<eos> Two years ago... almost.<eos> June 2nd. It was a Saturday.<eos> Do you know who the person was, that did this to you?<eos> No.<eos> I still don't.
You drove your own car to go fishing?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - What route did you take?<eos> Same as usual.<eos> Out on the St Andrews Road, onto the coast road, down to the car park.<eos> - Same on the way back?<eos> - Same on the way back.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - Glad you're happy.<eos> Except you didn't.
Because you can tell me anything.<eos> I'm not gonna tell anyone, I promise.<eos> - I'm your mate, so if...<eos> - No.<eos> Me and Jim, we had sex.<eos> Saturday morning.<eos> What?<eos> No...<eos> - Trish...<eos> - We did.
It's all fine.<eos> No, something's not right.<eos> What is it?<eos> Beth, the point of these supervisions is that you're honest with me.<eos> I've been where you are, but I can't help you unless you tell me what's going on.<eos> She asked me to go along with her, for her ABE interview with the police, when she gave them her full statement.<eos> OK.<eos> It was pretty harrowing.<eos> Just... the detail of what happened to her.<eos> What he did.
That's all.<eos> Here?<eos> Fine.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Talk.<eos> Why'd you plead innocent?<eos> Why'd you make us go through that trial?<eos> Show me your phone, Mark.<eos> Why?<eos> Just... do it.
It wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> What do you wanna do, Mark?<eos> Do you wanna use that knife?<eos> No.<eos> I can't live with what you've done to us, but I'm not strong enough to make you pay.<eos> It's pathetic, innit?<eos> What do I do now?<eos> So you not only stole back your phone, you kept what I deleted and you added even more.<eos> - Do you know how much that cost?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Stay here.<eos> - Dad!<eos> Police!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Enjoying yourself, boys?<eos> Get up!<eos> Stand up!<eos> Who of you shared the photos of my daughter around the school?<eos> - Dunno what you mean.<eos> - Oh, aye, you do.
Did you hold the torch?<eos> Or a phone to shine a light?<eos> - Is that what he asked?<eos> - I don't know anything about that.<eos> You're gonna have to stop lying.<eos> You are not very good at it.<eos> And look at you.<eos> You're exhausted.<eos> I want to talk to my solicitor.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
We know what you're doing, Lucas.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> One last opportunity to tell us what happened that night.<eos> I already have.<eos> For the tape, I am showing Mr. Lucas exhibit number EM153.<eos> It's a telephone number.<eos> Do you know whose phone number that is, Lucas?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For the tape, please.<eos> - No, I don't.
But when they took the chains off of him, he killed sixteen people.<eos> And they had to take him down with four bullets, it took to take him down.<eos> The doctors started opening him up.<eos> And... he should be dead... look at him!<eos> The notes speak of "unprecedented organ and tissue regeneration".<eos> Where are the medical files?<eos> They're all right here.<eos> They're all in Russian.<eos> You translated them?<eos> No... but she did.
An investigative strategy based on Governor Munk's priorities?<eos> We need you to tell us what to do next, Eric.<eos> Eric?<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> - That good?<eos> - It tickles.<eos> It's good.<eos> I don't know much about...<eos> conditioner or stuff like that.<eos> Probably neither did Henry.
My sister isn't old enough to get married, even if she wanted to.<eos> Tell me, bookworm... can you name me a language that was spoken by ancient Romans and is still spoken by very irritating people today?<eos> - Latin.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And can you translate the Latin phrase "in loco parentis"?<eos> "Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.
We're all frightened, Gustav.<eos> Sunny must be so frightened.<eos> We're all frightened, Klaus.<eos> You should get some sleep.<eos> - But you're dismantling my bed.<eos> - Use Sunny's.<eos> You stayed up all last night trying to find out Count Olaf's plot.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> I didn't help us.<eos> Yes, you did.
It bited her!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Get moving!<eos> Call an ambulance!<eos> Call a scientist!<eos> Call my wife!<eos> This is ghastly!<eos> This is phantasmagorical!<eos> You are police officers!<eos> Do something!
When I am governor...<eos> When you're governor?<eos> What the fuck happened to you?<eos> When this gets out...<eos> It won't.<eos> And you will make sure that it does not.<eos> You will protect me and my role.<eos> It is to your benefit to have me as governor.<eos> You should act out of rationality, not emotion.<eos> You didn't.
One way or another, Axe will be in custody by day's end.<eos> But we're not taking him. Mnh-mnh.<eos> Who is?<eos> Eastern.<eos> Dake?<eos> Dake gets our trial?<eos> You had to have known we couldn't prosecute it.<eos> The conflict is too deep.<eos> You said you had a workaround.<eos> Yes, I do.
Thanks, Edge.<eos> Come here.<eos> We lifted your prints off the RV door.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Anything about your story true?<eos> All right, I went and I tried the door.<eos> All right?<eos> Then I got out of there.<eos> You saw the body?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Like a gunshot?<eos> Could have been.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, so they split.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then I went, I looked in the RV.<eos> All right, and I got the fuck out of there.<eos> Shit, man, I knew I should have called 9-1-1.<eos> - Didn't want to snitch.<eos> - No, I didn't.
He died nine months later, and then my mother, she moved back to Seoul to live with her sister.<eos> But you stayed.<eos> Yeah, this is my city, I grew up here.<eos> A friend told me about CRT, and I thought, maybe, just maybe, it would...<eos> And I was right.<eos> Trying to help other people, it helps me somehow.<eos> At least sometimes.<eos> I'm sure you know what all that feels like, yeah?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Leah Camille.<eos> They'll crucify me in court.<eos> Not if we bring it up first.<eos> Get it out of the way.<eos> Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.<eos> Please, you have no idea.<eos> Actually, I do.
It's a stickup, not brain surgery.<eos> You get what you pay for, and you can barely pay for that.<eos> I'm glad that we could finally...<eos> Bring my mom into it.<eos> Fuck.<eos> How's the finger?<eos> Those fuckers got away.<eos> What about the tag number?<eos> I didn't get the tag number, so...<eos> Oh. I did.
Bring my mom into it.<eos> Fuck.<eos> How's the finger?<eos> Those fuckers got away.<eos> What about the tag number?<eos> I didn't get the tag number, so...<eos> Oh. I did.<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
Okay?<eos> Asshole.<eos> Can you have it towed?<eos> The second the hour is up.<eos> Pete, get the lights.<eos> Uh, Pete and I lost a client yesterday.<eos> We wanted to make sure her collateral was, um, secure, and I couldn't open the safe.<eos> Oh, I changed the combination.<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> - No, you didn't.
Jesus, I forgot how much I hate this shit.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, it just seems to me like yesterday you were enjoying yourself.<eos> Yeah. 'Cause you were gonna pay me.<eos> Oh, really, is that all it is?<eos> You think I miss being in the game.<eos> Katie, you're so good at it, I mean, come on.<eos> No, I do miss it.<eos> I do.
That blows.<eos> Ms. Hay?<eos> - Mr. McGill?<eos> - Chuck, please.<eos> Meet me at the front door.<eos> Uh, they said to put my things in the mailbox.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Anything with a battery.<eos> Did your brother ever have a key to the house?<eos> Before the recent trouble, he did.
Not yet, but next month, after Vienna.<eos> Do you remember when we tried to go to Salzburg?<eos> And that crazy old lady on the scooter...<eos> - Oh, yes! Yes!<eos> - ... chased us out of the train station.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And then, um... and then we went and got, uh, it was a-a-a raspberry Linzer torte in Innsbruck?<eos> - Mm. - To make ourselves feel better?<eos> Mm. You said, "We'll never finish this!"<eos> And then we did.
- Certainly.<eos> Nothing further at this time.<eos> Ms. Wexler?<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> You testified you've known my client for some time.<eos> How long exactly?<eos> Nearly 10 years.<eos> How did you come to know him?<eos> His brother asked to hire him in the mail-room at our firm.<eos> - And you did.
Thank you for understanding.<eos> Your phone, sir?<eos> I left it in the car.<eos> - Oh. Excuse me.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's yours.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.<eos> You know why?<eos> To rattle me.<eos> He knows I still have a... a lot of, feeling for my ex-wife.<eos> He's hoping this will break me down.<eos> Split me apart at the seams, like a murderer confessing on an episode of "Perry Mason."<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jimmy.<eos> Have I answered your questions to your satisfaction?<eos> Do you have anything else?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Today?<eos> You're gonna shoot a commercial in the next 2 1/2 hours?<eos> Oh, no. I mean, there's a whole post process.<eos> I mean, there's editing and mixing, coloring, layback.<eos> It's a whole megillah.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> But we would need to be shooting in the next 15 minutes.<eos> Now, there's "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."<eos> Why don't they make, like, a Moses musical?<eos> - They did.

You got it, Mike.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You're here.<eos> This your idea of stealth?<eos> I never claimed to be good at this.<eos> Any of it. On that, we can agree.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I wanna hire you again.<eos> Do what now?
Makes for an uncomfortable work environment.<eos> Get rid of it.<eos> If you want people to do what you say, you've gotta be the bad guy.<eos> Or someone does.<eos> What's your policy on people using company computers to play Superhero Fantasy League?<eos> Usually we turn a blind eye, unless it's causing a problem.<eos> What if it is causing a problem?<eos> - Then things get fun. - Mm.<eos> Van, I think I know how to fix the photo situation.<eos> Already done.
I think you said Monday.<eos> Friday. Definitely Friday.<eos> I think.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> You don't think the finger guns are a little much?<eos> - Hey Van! - Pew, pew, pew.<eos> Hey! You tell me.<eos> - Know what the best part is?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Roger that.<eos> Eight tourists and counting, from all directions.<eos> Beginning to feel a lot like a killing zone in there.<eos> Have you seen Mattie? Where is she?<eos> Try to relax.<eos> Act like you're talking to your wife or something.<eos> My wife dumped us eight years ago.<eos> Have you seen Mattie?<eos> You need to move to your right, towards the airplanes... fast as you can. - Why?<eos> - Just do it now, please.
One more kiss, and make it a good one.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Drive safe, baby.<eos> We have been ordered to hand over Carlos mejia to the FBI because somehow Mexico has found out we have him, and now they want him back.<eos> So we're just gonna hand him over?<eos> Wait a minute, how the hell did they find out we have him?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> - Did anyone else know, apart from us? No, no.<eos> They did not.
They found out about me.<eos> Now they kill me too.<eos> Found out about what?<eos> That I was trying to defect to CIA.<eos> Two CIA officers were killed. - Langley says you set them up.<eos> - No, I didn't do that.<eos> I swear on...<eos> If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,<eos> - why didn't they know about you? - I don't know.<eos> But now they do.
No Veronica and...<eos> No Archie.<eos> Walk me to school?<eos> I needed time to process.<eos> To separate what my mom wants from what I want... I think I want.<eos> Which is?<eos> My mom says I should never speak to you again.<eos> But I...<eos> Even though you don't like me like that, I still want us to be friends... Best friends.<eos> You do?
We were wondering, Cheryl.<eos> Back in July, you told the po-po that Jason drowned.<eos> Yet, we come to find out that Jason didn't drown.<eos> He was shot.<eos> That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious.<eos> What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.<eos> We both did.
Why?<eos> I was distracted.<eos> I wasn't feeling well.<eos> Archie...<eos> If there's something you want to get off your chest, perhaps about Jason, now would be the time.<eos> Weatherbee just asked me if I knew anything about Jason.<eos> And?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That I didn't.
Let's make some noise!<eos> Put your hands together for the Riverdale Bulldogs!<eos> Cheryl?<eos> Cheryl, what is it?<eos> What happened?<eos> Jason.<eos> He's gone...<eos> I know.<eos> I know he is.<eos> No, you don't.
I just want to hear you guys play my songs.<eos> Making them better.<eos> Recording them.<eos> So, you feel qualified to write songs for the Pussycats?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - For divas of color?<eos> Maybe, maybe.<eos> Look, this isn't LA or New York, this is Riverdale, and people's minds are opening up, but do you have any idea how much hate mail my mom got when she was elected mayor?<eos> I campaigned for your mom, I get it.<eos> No, no, no, baby, you don't.
And what are you really doing here? - Archie...<eos> - Why the new identity, the moving place-to-place?<eos> Tell me the truth, please.<eos> I...<eos> Was in a bad relationship.<eos> A relationship... I was married to a man who would come home from work every night, late, and drunk, and with a temper.<eos> One night, I ended up in the emergency room with broken ribs and a shattered collarbone.<eos> The next morning, he barely even remembered the fight, and he promised that it wouldn't happen again.<eos> But...<eos> It did, again.
Who's telling you you can't do your music?<eos> Your coach?<eos> Mr. Castillo?<eos> Your dad?<eos> Or is it just you?<eos> You dragged me out of the Blossom house, and then you don't talk to me the whole way home.<eos> Dad, Jason and Polly were engaged.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you did.
Except that yes, you do.<eos> Thanks to a certain Veronica-ex-machina.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just that I had a few words with our director/host, and reminded him that he's heard you sing on numerous occasions.<eos> Even though it compromises my artistic integrity.<eos> Cutting to the chase, you have a slot if you want it.<eos> Veronica, thank you, but you saw what happened.<eos> We all did.
Dudley-Do-Right doesn't know I'm a Serpent, so I'd appreciate it if you keep that to yourself.<eos> Because here's the thing about snakes.<eos> You don't step on them, they got no reason to bite.<eos> Mom, Dad, when we find Polly, she's gonna live with us, right?<eos> At this point, there's no reason to hide or banish her, is there?<eos> Oh, of course not, honey.<eos> She's welcome back.<eos> Where will the baby sleep?<eos> Sweetie, um, we've talked to your sister about this, and she's agreed to put the baby up for adoption.<eos> Polly did?
Watch me like a hawk.<eos> Tell me the barest minimum.<eos> But let me help you help Polly.<eos> You think Polly's crazy.<eos> I do, I think she's crazier than a serial killer on bath-salts, but so what?<eos> She's carrying Jason's baby.<eos> That trumps everything.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> If I did, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> - Oh, my God, you do.
Plus, I'm trying to avoid the Blossoms.<eos> If they find out your father is the one who bought the drive-in, it'll be open war.<eos> Against us?<eos> They're making a play for the land, hoping to stop construction.<eos> Fred and I are trying to keep it on track, but...<eos> But Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?<eos> All of which is to say the timing of this shower is just...<eos> It's not ideal.<eos> Plus, I can't believe Alice even wants to come, from what you've told me.<eos> She doesn't.
I want my family back together.<eos> Well, then, it's time to face facts.<eos> Hermione, Polly is a teenager.<eos> She hasn't even finished high school.<eos> The father of her baby has been murdered.<eos> You want to play house with her, and throw her a baby shower, fine.<eos> But the very next day, all of those things will still be true.<eos> And she's supposed to what?<eos> Raise a child?<eos> Mothers do it every day.
Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.<eos> And risk having him walk off the project?<eos> We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.<eos> Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.<eos> You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.<eos> Archie.<eos> If music be the food of love, play on, play on.<eos> Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?<eos> I...<eos> No, I didn't.
How do you not tell me that?<eos> You never would have gotten involved.<eos> You're damn straight.<eos> Because I didn't sign up to go into business with a criminal like Hiram Lodge.<eos> I'm trying to turn Lodge Industries legitimate.<eos> That means partnering with people like you, good people.<eos> This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?<eos> Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?<eos> Clifford didn't send those thugs.<eos> Hiram did.
You're stronger than your mother, you're stronger than your father.<eos> You're holding this family together.<eos> So don't.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> I won't.<eos> Valerie, hi.<eos> I thought you should know,<eos> Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.<eos> She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
You're holding this family together.<eos> So don't.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> I won't.<eos> Valerie, hi.<eos> I thought you should know,<eos> Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.<eos> She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, she does.
Hiram and I had some business.<eos> What does your boyfriend say about that?<eos> - His father, you mean?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'll find out.<eos> - Yeah. You better.<eos> These kids are more on the ball than the Sheriff.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You do know my dad has a drinking problem, right?<eos> Of course I do.
So, tell me, were you upset when Hiram Lodge bought the drive-in land?<eos> Stuff happens.<eos> Let me rephrase that question.<eos> Were you surprised?<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Right this way.<eos> I thought you said she wanted me to be here.<eos> She does.
âDoneâ?<eos> I love Jughead.<eos> He's as much my family as you are, more so right now.<eos> You are not going anywhere, young lady.<eos> I am going to look for Jughead.<eos> Do not push me tonight, Mom, because I will push back.<eos> If FP confesses, he might drag us into this.<eos> Talk about our dealings with the Serpents.<eos> But at least we'll know if Dad hired him to...<eos> And if he did?
Are you sure you should be performing?<eos> Freshman year, I played the whole season with a broken hand.<eos> Well, a taped-up hand.<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> When we were at Southside High, you were looking at Betty and Jughead...<eos> I don't know, wistfully.<eos> - Wistfully?<eos> - Longingly.<eos> Like you liked Betty.<eos> I do.
- Garrett, let me finish.<eos> You know, I'm beginning to question your competency.<eos> You two, stop.<eos> All right, I have an idea.<eos> Let's do some role-playing.<eos> Just humor me now.<eos> Mr. Holland, you're Ms. Wirth.<eos> Why is this so important to your case?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Sure you do.
You need to keep your freakin' mouth shut and let the trained professionals do their work!<eos> I'm telling you it's gonna be exculpatory.<eos> What, did you watch a couple episodes of Law Order and now you're a lawyer?<eos> - Albert.<eos> - What?<eos> Can you give us a minute alone, please?<eos> Without physical evidence connecting you to the murder, we have reasonable doubt.<eos> We have it.<eos> But with you offering them your blood and spit on a silver platter, who the hell knows what they're gonna find?<eos> You don't, Perry Mason.
And that I don't have feelings for you, but you're wrong.<eos> And I'm gonna prove to you, and to everyone, that I'm innocent.<eos> And not with a hair strand or a cheek swab.<eos> I want there to be no doubt.<eos> I want to give my blood.<eos> Let me.<eos> You know it when you see it. You're on a subway.<eos> You see someone talking to themselves, maybe they're a little disheveled, and you think to yourself,<eos> "-a crazy person."<eos> We all do it.
"-a crazy person."<eos> We all do it.<eos> We look away.<eos> But you can't look away from Lester Wilson.<eos> His fate is in your hands.<eos> You don't need to have Dr. Baldridge try and make sense to you of what was going on in Mr. Wilson's mind leading up to the attack, because you know there's no sense to be made.<eos> You can see that sitting right there... is a sick man.<eos> And I needed you to see it.<eos> So much so that I took Lester off his medication so you could see his illness for yourself.<eos> And you did.
I don't believe a kid like that would self-radicalize.<eos> Why do people from Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee burn down their own neighborhoods?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.<eos> What I want to know is how Nasiri slipped under everybody's radar.<eos> That's the funny thing about freedom.<eos> It gives our enemies the freedom to destroy us.<eos> Cut a deal.<eos> O'Boyle said Jafar is not interested in a deal.<eos> Of course he did.
What kind of help do you need?<eos> Mellie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was, uh...<eos> there was a...<eos> With Teddy just now, there was a thing.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Also, stop doing that.<eos> Doing what?
With Teddy just now, there was a thing.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Also, stop doing that.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Coming up to me with your concern.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You didn't choose me.<eos> Nobody does.
Well, it... it could double as an OR in an emergency situation.<eos> This is not an emergency, Doc.<eos> It could become one real quick.<eos> You mentioned that, yeah.<eos> We'll put John Doe on the chart, limit the staff, get Dawn to sign off on it, and prep the skills lab.<eos> What do you say, Dr. Palmer, want to save a life together?<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> He's getting worse by the hour.<eos> Please tell me you have good news.<eos> We do.
Bye, buddy.<eos> Don't let him out of your life.<eos> It's true what they say.<eos> You don't know what you've got until it's gone.<eos> You're still here?<eos> Who's that?<eos> I recognize him from somewhere.<eos> Follow him, go.<eos> What?<eos> Please, just do it.
Thank God for second chances.<eos> Keep your guard up.<eos> Oh, we told him that he could be whatever he wanted when he grew up.<eos> So, for Halloween he was a Superman-Digimon- astronaut combo.<eos> Super-maut!<eos> Oh, I love it!<eos> Signs of indecision appear early in life, Holden.<eos> Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see<eos> - what happened when I was six.<eos> - Yes, I do!

Give me that bottle.<eos> Zelda, you're not like his other women.<eos> You're a challenge.<eos> You're smart and witty and fearless.<eos> He might not always know how to deal with that.<eos> He'd better learn.<eos> He basically married the heroine of his stories.<eos> This city doesn't make a lick of sense to me.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> No one does.
The trouble is, I do. I want to be in that institution if she's there, too.<eos> That is a problem.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> Zelda?<eos> Good God.<eos> You look incredible.<eos> I'm sorry that I was so thoughtless.<eos> I tried the group out.<eos> I really did, but...
- Zelda, we...<eos> - We what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> One minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and...<eos> There is a baby that has been squawling for an hour.<eos> Please do something to make it stop.<eos> I don't hear a baby, sir.<eos> You don't?
He's working.<eos> This is Kamo Rosu... roast duck.<eos> Mm. I'd say well done, Tana, but the meat's too damn tender.<eos> Does he have to be so perfect?<eos> Tana.<eos> He never stops moving, except for that damn flute.<eos> Uh, Tana's a wonder.<eos> We should have hired him the minute we got here.<eos> You said it yourself. You don't want to cook and clean.<eos> No. I don't.
What are you talking about, quiet?<eos> Scott's really tryin'.<eos> He is really tryin'.<eos> And I am, too.<eos> We have the water and...<eos> I love it. I swim every day.<eos> I thought, oh, that's where I belong.<eos> But then I have to come out.<eos> I have to come out, don't I?<eos> Oh, yes, yes, of course, you do.
Maybe... Maybe you could, uh, talk to him later.<eos> Oh, Tallulah, Eugenia.<eos> It's sensational.<eos> - What's it called again?<eos> - Between the Sheets.<eos> Oh, well, this is just what I needed.<eos> Oh, it is so comforting to be among friends.<eos> Montgomery certainly misses you two.<eos> That'll have to be their cross to bear, because I do not miss Montgomery.<eos> I do.

Well, how curious.<eos> I have no experience with them.<eos> You're missing everything, darling.<eos> Oh, then I suppose I shall have to get to know some.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Here, here.<eos> I haven't thrown a dart since I was a young man.<eos> It's like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, did Zelda mention the family supper?<eos> Yes. Yes, she did.

I'm now getting married in two weeks.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> To who?<eos> You're so funny.<eos> Have fun with the Muggle.<eos> Oh. Hi, George.<eos> It's George.<eos> Do you know my name?<eos> Of course I do.
What?<eos> Robert...<eos> No!<eos> What just happened?<eos> What?<eos> Who is Robert?<eos> You just yelled, "Robert, no."<eos> What? No.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Uh, yeah, you did.
No.<eos> She'd be upset.<eos> She's so happy.<eos> Yeah, but, Josh, if you have problems, she's the one you're gonna want to face them with, right?<eos> She's the one you chose.<eos> - But I don't want to hurt her.<eos> - You know, I'm proud of you, Josh.<eos> I mean, usually, when you get upset, you run to the nearest pretty girl, like...<eos> Ben Affleck runs to the nearest role with a Boston accent.<eos> I do?

Why would you say something like that?<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Don't tell me your sense of humor retired, too.<eos> Well, let's just suppose for a second that maybe she does find me handsome, you know?<eos> Maybe I'm handsome, maybe I'm not.<eos> She's torn, right?<eos> And your little comment possibly tips the scales against me.<eos> Did you ever think of that?<eos> Mm, mm, I guess I didn't.<eos> No, you didn't.

That can't happen.<eos> Not now.<eos> Really?<eos> If you want to live down here, in my world...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. That's enough.<eos> That's enough.<eos> - You good? - Good.<eos> Did they find her?<eos> Yeah, they did.
Yeah?<eos> Good.<eos> I got in this morning.<eos> No, I scheduled that for Thursday.<eos> Alex.<eos> I was informed that you had taken a mental-health day.<eos> Dawn, hi.<eos> Can I talk to you about this later?<eos> I meant to talk to you, but I...<eos> But you didn't, did you?
If I could get you to sign an affidavit of confirmation...<eos> I need to talk to the sheriff.<eos> Oh, I know. It's just awful.<eos> I'll meet you at the house.<eos> Bye, Hun.<eos> Oh, I just heard about Kevin.<eos> Honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna go to Christine's.<eos> You want to come?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
No, no, no.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> These are symptoms of a godless and degenerate society.<eos> There was this programme last week, and it was the dirtiest programme I have ever seen!<eos> - Dirty?<eos> - Well, it was.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The people in it hadn't had a wash?<eos> You know very well what I mean.<eos> I don't.
But that wasn't it.<eos> You thought, with Barry out of the way, Nick might be yours.<eos> But he never would have been.<eos> - That's why you slipped him the LSD.<eos> - Why would I hurt Nick?<eos> I love him!<eos> He loves me!<eos> I know he does!<eos> He wrote Jennifer Sometimes for me!<eos> - No, he didn't.
Mine too.<eos> You just want to get it right, don't you?<eos> For the sake of the victims.<eos> Yes.<eos> George Marsh and Arthur Pilbury deserve better.<eos> They weren't soldiers going into battle -- they were men doing a job.<eos> And it could've been avoided.<eos> Mrs Shelagh Turner.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Do your best for them.
The trouble is nursing treats young working class girls the way the world treats women.<eos> They're all over them when there's a war on.<eos> Afterwards, nobody wants to know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shelagh?<eos> Shelagh?<eos> You must've seen babies that lived as long as mine did.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do they have fingers and toes?<eos> Yes, they do.
Let me in.<eos> Reggie!<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I told you this was going to happen.<eos> I mean he could've...<eos> Anything could've...<eos> Something really terrible...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But it didn't.
Well, you really do look rather wonderful.<eos> Chin-chin!<eos> It was very good of Nurse Crane to lend us the Cubs' sleeping bags.<eos> I keep finding things in mine.<eos> - I think there's a woggle at the bottom.<eos> - Lucky you.<eos> The only thing in mine is the faint aroma of wee.<eos> It reminds me of when we went camping.<eos> Best holiday ever.<eos> Oh, don't.
Ready?<eos> - Baby's doing extremely well.<eos> - And so is Mum.<eos> This was donated to the toy box at the clinic, but I thought Deka might make use of it, given her interest in all things medical.<eos> Deka is not here.<eos> She's leaving on the boat with a chaperone.<eos> She's going back to Somaliland?<eos> Deka didn't say anything about leaving.<eos> She didn't know.<eos> None of us did.
I am being set up by Olivia Pope.<eos> She is trying to frame me for murdering Frankie.<eos> She is trying to steal the presidency.<eos> That is what is going on here, and I am not going to let it happen, okay?<eos> Now, I just need to take a minute and make some calls.<eos> I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.
I told you everything will work out...<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Y'ello.<eos> Hey, Cy.<eos> Tom?<eos> You do remember my name.<eos> I thought since maybe I hadn't heard from you, you might have forgotten.<eos> You shouldn't be calling me.<eos> You didn't think I'd just stay in my hole, did you?<eos> Maybe you did.
I know that I... treated you badly.<eos> This is about making up for that.<eos> This is about making sure we both have a future.<eos> P-Please... sit down.<eos> We've been through a lot together, you and me.<eos> And I know that we left things badly, but we've had a lot of good...<eos> What do you want, Cyrus?<eos> Going forward, I need you to stay quiet about me... about us.<eos> The way I see it, we had a... misunderstanding about the plan, and I don't blame you for that.<eos> I don't.
I don't get it.<eos> ‐ It's‐‐ ‐ Oh, there's nothing to get.<eos> ‐ It's like 'cause his name was Pinto, you know, like the bean, so we just‐‐<eos> We made so much fun of him.<eos> ‐ It was so stupid.<eos> Pinto and Butkiss got such crap, right?<eos> ‐ Yeah.<eos> ‐ Remember Benson Butkiss?<eos> ‐ Yeah, I do.<eos> I sure do.
Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.<eos> Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.<eos> Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're not guilty of your father's crimes.<eos> And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Because I need your help, and you need mine.<eos> Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?<eos> I did.
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.<eos> Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.<eos> - Almost. - But you haven't stormed King's Landing.<eos> Why not?<eos> The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.<eos> It's the fastest way to win the war, but you won't do it, which means, at the very least, you're better than Cersei.<eos> Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.<eos> Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game, screaming that the rules aren't fair.<eos> - You told me you liked this man.<eos> - I do.
You took my ship.<eos> I wouldn't say we took your ship.<eos> I'm not playing word games with you.<eos> The dead are coming for us all.<eos> Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.<eos> It's hard for me to fathom.<eos> It really is.<eos> If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...<eos> You probably don't believe me.<eos> I do, actually.

Who told you to treat him?<eos> No one.<eos> Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?<eos> I seem to remember you.<eos> - But you treated him anyway?<eos> - I did, yes.<eos> I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful, especially on someone of that age.<eos> You could have infected yourself and others.<eos> You could have devastated the entire Citadel.<eos> But you didn't.
My enemies are in the Red Keep.<eos> What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?<eos> A smart one.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> - I would never presume to--<eos> - I'm at war.<eos> I'm losing.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.
- What do you want?<eos> !<eos> Daenerys will win this war.<eos> You're a military man.<eos> You must know there's no way around that.<eos> Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I- - I don't.<eos> And Daenerys doesn't.
Great big monsters.<eos> They conquer the world.<eos> How did a mad fucker like you live this long?<eos> I'm good at killing people.<eos> - You don't look much like him.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> Your father.<eos> I suppose you favor your mother.<eos> You knew him?<eos> Of course I did.
Maybe we don't need to understand anymore than that.<eos> Maybe that's enough.<eos> Aye.<eos> Maybe that's enough.<eos> That's what I saw in the fire.<eos> A mountain like an arrow head.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We're getting close.<eos> Do you know what I like about you?<eos> - I honestly don't.
A bear.<eos> We can fuck her<eos> The bears have blue eyes.<eos> We have to get him back to Eastwatch.<eos> flask<eos> Go on.<eos> Alright.<eos> I just got bit by a dead bear.<eos> Aye.<eos> You did.
Oh, don't listen to Gragdor.<eos> His bark is worse than his many bites.<eos> Make a fried calamari out of him.<eos> Okay.<eos> On three?<eos> Yeah, on three.<eos> - One.<eos> Three.<eos> - Okay. - Okay, hey, did we remember - Ed and Trish?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Tripped and fell.<eos> That wound on his head suggests he must have fallen backwards.<eos> We can finish this outside.<eos> You said the door was open this morning when you arrived.<eos> Aye, that's right, and Father Brown was with me.<eos> What time did you leave the club yesterday?<eos> Must have been about six.<eos> A couple of the lads were still training.<eos> Trust these lads to lock up, do you?<eos> Course I do.
Right, chin up and chest out.<eos> And remember, the fight starts here.<eos> How did you meet him, if you don't mind me asking?<eos> I was working as a croupier in one of his clubs.<eos> The Pink Flamingo.<eos> Jeb Cornish weighs in at 100 and 70 pounds!<eos> You must have known Roy Tomkins, too.<eos> Must I?<eos> He used to work as a doorman for Mr Nelson.<eos> Plenty of boxers do.
Well, I'm sorry to tell you.<eos> He was murdered last week.<eos> Shit.<eos> Let's... Let's go inside.<eos> I didn't see anything in the news or in the papers.<eos> It was reported as a John Doe.<eos> Homeless man in Hollywood.<eos> Took a few days to make an ID.<eos> Some people don't get obits, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
One of his followers, actually.<eos> Greed, wrath, gluttony, etcetera, all depicted along the outer rim.<eos> The circular image is the eye of God.<eos> He sees all.<eos> The Latin.<eos> Cave Cave Deus Videt.<eos> "Beware, Beware, God Sees."<eos> You speak Latin?<eos> No.<eos> Google Translate does.
I think. You could have a different life.<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> You should know I already sent my report on the operation.<eos> I don't want you to be surprised.<eos> In my self-criticism, I acknowledged the mistake I made in contacting my previous family in Seattle.<eos> Tuan, that wasn't why we were...<eos> it's alright. My organization will forgive me.<eos> I said that you both did a lot of great things during our work together.<eos> But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.

_<eos> I can't believe we just did that.<eos> You got to admit that was pretty good.<eos> It's always good.<eos> It's everything else that's the problem.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, you're really very beautiful.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> You still get embarrassed when somebody gives you a compliment?<eos> Well, I don't. I... no.
- Can you just get me a Band-aid?<eos> - Where?<eos> - From the bathroom?<eos> - Please just hurry? - Okay.<eos> I just bought us 30 seconds.<eos> How should we spend it?<eos> Marius was here last night.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - He had a gun, and he was going to kill anyone who came between you and him.<eos> - Why didn't he?
Golden handcuffs are more like it.<eos> Indefinite paid leave.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> Here.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> It's pretty nice, huh?<eos> Well, it's on a golf course.<eos> What do you think, Spartacus? - Hmm?<eos> - Oh... you love it just like Mama, don't you?<eos> Hmm? Yes, yes you do.
Right.<eos> You got a second?<eos> There's something I want to show you.<eos> What? No.<eos> Oh! Does it work?<eos> Well, not yet.<eos> Couple of replacement parts, some man hours.<eos> If anybody can fix it, it's you, Holden.<eos> You saved all this?<eos> Of course I did.
Honey, Amanda... Amanda is fine.<eos> Look at me.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> She's fine.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to help me get Marius.<eos> - He's not a good guy.<eos> - We don't know where he's at.<eos> - Your wife does.
Look at me.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> She's fine.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to help me get Marius.<eos> - He's not a good guy.<eos> - We don't know where he's at.<eos> - Your wife does.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
She's part of a support group that may or may not be a death cult.<eos> Holden drew an arch that looked just like that.<eos> So... what does Holden have to do with these people?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But you should stay away from them.<eos> Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
Now you and I can take that next step together.<eos> Why me?<eos> You said you sent others in.<eos> They all came back damaged.<eos> But not you.<eos> Haven't you ever wondered why you were able to survive so long in that coma with no ill effect?<eos> That place you spent those 12 years... it kept you alive.<eos> Kept me alive?<eos> The Realm almost killed me.<eos> But it didn't.
Maybe we couldn't beat the RAPs, but at least I could do that.<eos> And now?<eos> I don't know what's waiting for me on the other side of that wall.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The rest of your life.<eos> I liked those stories we read, especially about the fish who got too big for the pond.<eos> That's a really good one.<eos> You don't believe in the Greatest Day, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
That's a really good one.<eos> You don't believe in the Greatest Day, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> Does that make you sad?<eos> Lindsey says you have to believe in the Greatest Day to be a part of it.<eos> I just don't want you to be left behind.<eos> I know what Lindsey says.<eos> She's just a girl, love. She doesn't have all the answers.<eos> And neither do I.
Stevie, yeah. How are you, man?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> I told Stevie you were in town. He invited himself over for dinner.<eos> Wasn't gonna miss this.<eos> What's it been, 25 years, 30?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You disappeared, brother.<eos> - But I read your book.<eos> - You did?<eos> We all did.
- You're here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Late start today. I don't scrub in till noon.<eos> So?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Noah's not doing well?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Okay, so did you reach Nina?<eos> She come to get him?<eos> Um, no, she didn't.
- Don't touch me!<eos> Whitney, you can't go with that man!<eos> He attacked your father.<eos> - He was defending me. - You were inside!<eos> I don't know what the hell you think you saw, but he was not defending you.<eos> He-he...<eos> This has to end right now.<eos> He's twice your age and he's using you.<eos> You have no fucking idea what you're talking about!<eos> Yes, I do!
The kids could come down.<eos> And they shouldn't see me.<eos> The kids?<eos> Also, I don't belong here, Helen.<eos> You've been very nice, but...<eos> You can't go anywhere, not like that.<eos> Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.

You deserve to be happy, to be with people who love you.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you really are, and I forgive you.<eos> Wait. Come on.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't.
I know you.<eos> I know who you really are, and I forgive you.<eos> Wait. Come on.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't.<eos> - I do. - You don't.

I don't want to kill you. - You hate me!<eos> - I don't even know you.<eos> You're jealous of me 'cause I got out.<eos> You got out of what? You got out of prison?<eos> No, out of Bloomsburg.<eos> - Fucking backwoods shithole.<eos> I got out.<eos> And you got stuck there.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you, man. - Yes, you do!<eos> - You... - No, I don't.
- I killed a man.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You weren't driving the car.<eos> What really happened?<eos> I took the fall for my wife.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> 'Cause I had an affair.<eos> Why'd you have an affair?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
What I remember most about that trip was... you jumping off the front of the bus at La Flecha... and running straight to the dig site.<eos> We must have been going 15 miles an hour.<eos> Well, it was a Titanosaurus.<eos> It hadn't moved in 97 million years.<eos> That's not what I remember most about that trip.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I remember our last night in Buenos Aires.<eos> You played me this song.<eos> I did.
- Liv! Hold on.<eos> What?<eos> Huck found Vanessa.<eos> The flu?<eos> It's bad, Sally.<eos> Vanessa can't even get herself out of bed.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> So sudden.<eos> You know how it is with these kinds of things.<eos> I do not...
He killed Frankie Vargas.<eos> And then my father ordered Jake to kill her.<eos> It's time for you to take what's yours, son.<eos> It's time to come home.<eos> But Jake didn't kill her.<eos> Because she's an innocent victim.<eos> Well, that's never been a problem for Jake.<eos> Jake believes my father might have some bigger plan, and that Jennifer could be the key to figuring it out.<eos> What?<eos> And you don't?
You're wrong.<eos> - I'm not wrong.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> Sir, opening up this investigation into Cyrus Beene based on some random voicemail and 20 seconds of video footage that's clearly been taken out of context...<eos> I made a decision.<eos> You are being played.<eos> The warrant was served by the attorney general himself, who accompanied Vice President-Elect Beene to Maryland Hamilton Federal Penitentiary.<eos> Tell me you're not seriously considering making this a death-penalty case against Cyrus.<eos> The chief of staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The president does.
About 2 1/2 minutes.<eos> Then you need to move, Huck.<eos> He's still in the trunk?<eos> I'd like to see where you'd be.<eos> Not in the trunk, that's for sure.<eos> Please.<eos> Huck, what was she driving?<eos> Huck, don't you dare give up on me.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Do you? !
- That's enough, Liv.<eos> - There you go. Get mad.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Because I'm sick of seeing you like this.<eos> - Like what?<eos> You used to be a big dog, and now...<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Now I barely recognize you.<eos> - I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.
- Now I barely recognize you.<eos> - I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I lost!<eos> You wanted the Oval, and I didn't give it to you.<eos> No, I didn't give it to you!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Forget it.<eos> If you have something to say...<eos> I don't.
Get off your cross!<eos> Like you never murdered anybody?<eos> !<eos> Like you never stole an oval or two?<eos> !<eos> This is the Oval!<eos> I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!

Eight years in office. All history will remember me for is the body count.<eos> And your sex scandal.<eos> And that.<eos> I could have done better.<eos> I could have been better.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - Well... good for you for learning something.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Rowan, I know... about the boxes they sent you.<eos> Do you?
Sir, let's not do this.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - "Work from home."<eos> When have I ever worked from home?<eos> When have I ever done anything but serve you and serve this office?<eos> You really want me to answer that?<eos> I asked you to be a friend.<eos> I told you about all the horrible things I did because I needed a friend and you agreed, and now you're holding it against me.<eos> You asked Liv to forgive me.<eos> She did.
OPA's over, but there's always gonna be another mission.<eos> There's always gonna be another job.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> B613 ended, and here I am still working.<eos> Look, we can still do a lot of great things together.<eos> Like, we can move to Tahiti and be assassins for hire.<eos> Or, you know, we could, protect Tahitians from assassins.<eos> You want to be a gladiator in a swimsuit?<eos> Look, my point is just because Olivia traded in her white hat for the White House doesn't mean we have to stop being gladiators.<eos> No. It doesn't.
I remember.<eos> Boy... do I remember.<eos> You remember Ocean City, too, don't you, baby?<eos> Huh?<eos> Don't you, baby?<eos> Don't you, baby?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you? !
You remember Ocean City, too, don't you, baby?<eos> Huh?<eos> Don't you, baby?<eos> Don't you, baby?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you? !<eos> Don't you, baby? !<eos> Don't you?
Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Tell me I don't look as old as you.<eos> You look good.<eos> You've been taking good care of yourself.<eos> Been on my "Eat, Pray, Love" ish.<eos> As much as I would like to hear about, but, as you say, tick, tock.<eos> How have you been?<eos> As if you didn't know.<eos> I don't.
- I thought Maya was restrained.<eos> - She was.<eos> Liv attacked her.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mellie, I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I'm sure there are a dozen people who would've loved to do what you did.<eos> I failed.<eos> No, you didn't.
What if your problem is you're thirsty?<eos> I'm not your wife.<eos> What?<eos> I said "knife."<eos> You know, I, uh, I got into a fight with a mastodon.<eos> I told him it was irr-elephant. [irrelevant]<eos> I heard you were the new Interim Chief.<eos> Yeah, that's the rumor.<eos> I didn't think you'd want to be Chief again.<eos> I don't.
And our greenhouse is over here!<eos> We raise all our own livestock, uh, there's a fish farm.<eos> We have everything we need!<eos> All these people are chosen from every part of the world.<eos> Why are they here?<eos> To genetically improve the human race!<eos> We all contribute and we all benefit.<eos> I-I had some pretty beneficial science stolen from me.<eos> Do you know a Rachel Duncan?<eos> Oh, we do now.
A truce?<eos> Kidnapping children is the Neo definition of a truce?<eos> You need to understand the benevolence on offer here.<eos> It comes from above.<eos> I'm sworn not to harm a single hair on a single clone head.<eos> Now, where's Helena?<eos> - Uh, in the woods!<eos> - What's her back-up plan?<eos> - I don't know her back-up plan!<eos> - You do.

Their weapons are powering down.<eos> What did you just do?<eos> She's gonna end this.<eos> You just invoked a trial by combat created by barbarians!<eos> It's been around since we crawled out of the caves on Daxam with rocks and sticks.<eos> If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?
No one must know what has passed between the two of you.<eos> Did my brother get away?<eos> We must pray to God he will.<eos> Jasper!<eos> Welcome to Westminster, Henry?<eos> Come.<eos> Jasper. How are you?<eos> My Lady Margaret.<eos> Who would have thought to find us here like this with Henry on the throne.<eos> I did. I always did.
- Come with me. - What are you...<eos> - Get off me!<eos> - Come.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Unlock the door!<eos> So, this is how the King of England behaves towards a lady?<eos> Towards a whore and you have said yourself that's what you are.<eos> Well, if I am a whore, you will not wish to wed me, will you?<eos> I do not.
Nothing.<eos> Everything that once you had inside is looted.<eos> Even doors have been ripped off.<eos> Your servants gone.<eos> Your orchard's plundered.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> And...<eos> The soldiers who were there, who came there to collect you, they were...<eos> They were told to slaughter any boys they found there.<eos> And did they?
My grandchild.<eos> I thought I might outwit him.<eos> Make him hope to take another for his bride, instead of me.<eos> But now... Well, now I have no choice.<eos> Or only one...<eos> Because if I do not marry him, yet have his child,<eos> I am shamed to everyone, and any other life for me is gone in any case.<eos> The stable boy brought news from home.<eos> Lady Margaret told the soldiers to murder any boy they found there.<eos> And did they?
I'll be right back.<eos>  Eddie, what happened to your face?<eos>  What, you didn't get the report?<eos>  What report?<eos>  From the person you sent to intimidate me.<eos>  What?<eos>  Some guy followed me after I came to the center.<eos> I freaked out.<eos>  I don't know anything about anyone following you.<eos>  Sure you do.
I didn't want things to get weird.<eos>  So you left me at a club.<eos>  Listening to great music, remembering the love of your life.<eos> I'm in a bad mood.<eos> Everyone's about to find out who they think I am.<eos>  How?<eos>  My mother just did her thing that she does, her golden handcuffs, just in case I thought I could escape and be my own person.<eos> Nope, she makes it known that I am hers and always will be.<eos>  I don't get it.<eos>  Yeah, you do.
You're my wife, and I am with you if you're with me only me.<eos>  I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> But I'm so glad you came back, and that you want us and him to be ours.<eos>  He's ours.<eos> Yours and mine.<eos> No one else's.<eos>  Hey.<eos> I saw Lisa leave.<eos>  She did.
Working for them?<eos> That place, those people... that was my whole life, my whole world.<eos> But I couldn't stay.<eos> I couldn't keep living with that fear.<eos> I was so scared every minute, every day.<eos> Then, finally, I say, "I want to leave."<eos> And the leader we called him Father.<eos> Father says to me, "You can't leave,<eos> "because even if you do, I'll come to you in your dreams."<eos> And he did.
Where is it again?<eos> Great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, uh... question?<eos> What hospital do you work at again?<eos> Holy crap!<eos> I knew we were going through changes, but I didn't think...<eos> They were gonna kill my E.R.?<eos> Well, they did.
We don't have the proper systems in place to deal with a, yeah, a cardiac situation.<eos> The General is your best bet.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where... where were we?<eos> She keeps putting up this front like she can handle anything in the world.<eos> But I know her and she's scared.<eos> I just with there was something I could do.<eos> It's your mom.<eos> Of course you do.
In this case, he gave me both.<eos> You can't just be that woman who's standing by her man, smiling like Lobotomy Barbie - while he goes fucking...<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> - But, Amy, do you think that...<eos> - Ma'am, I gotta go.<eos> Well, Amy Brookheimer just hung up on me.<eos> Doesn't get lower than that, does it?<eos> Oh, you are really loving this, aren't you?<eos> Well, I just didn't wanna tell you "I told you so," but...<eos> - Because you didn't.
Well, maybe he had a heart attack.<eos> Maybe the seat belt broke.<eos> Maybe it wasn't an accident. I don't know.<eos> Either way, the end result gon' be the same...<eos> My black ass goin' to jail.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Help me get him outta here. Hell no.<eos> I ain't touching no dead. That's bad mojo.<eos> Man, I thought you didn't believe in that shit.<eos> I don't. He did.
Many times.<eos> Henry, is that juniper tree still there?<eos> You know, the one by the infirmary.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - Oh, it has the softest grass.<eos> It feels delicious on your ass.<eos> I mean, we used to sneak out at night and, - oh, for hours we would...<eos> - Bigby, please.<eos> Are you telling me you don't even remember that tree?<eos> Of course I do, darling.
- Stop there!<eos> Get him!<eos> Three weeks. Three weeks of... stale air... bloody American baked beans.<eos> Can't stay here.<eos> We have to trust Broussard.<eos> Screw Broussard.<eos> Think he gives a shit about us?<eos> Then where the hell is he?<eos> - You know where.<eos> - No, I don't.
I have to get him to a hospital.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> His face is all over the bloc.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's BB.<eos> Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
There's no glory in any of it.<eos> I know.<eos> But I still didn't think I'd go out like this.<eos> I just want a soldier's death.<eos> Please, Will.<eos> I know it's over.<eos> If Homeland catches up to me, I can't run.<eos> And I won't be able to hold out.<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And then he wanted to go out like a soldier.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was... working.<eos> Everything takes longer now.<eos> Can't just walk down the street anymore.<eos> Your whole cell almost fell apart today.<eos> You need to be there to protect them from themselves.<eos> I never asked for this.<eos> To have my face plastered all over the bloc like some kind of revolutionary.<eos> No, you didn't.
Well... that sounds like a fun place to start.<eos> Skin grafts.<eos> Skin grafts.<eos> We know they're putting foreskin in skin grafts.<eos> It was on "The Oprah Winfrey Show."<eos> And they're putting it into t-the face creams<eos> - you all use... the girls.<eos> - Hold up.<eos> They do not put foreskins in face creams.<eos> Yes, they do.
Be right there.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> What about it?<eos> I proved my loyalty.<eos> I got rid of the body.<eos> I wiped down the whole damn house.<eos> - To prove your loyalty.<eos> - Yes, to prove my loyalty.<eos> And you did.
- Oh, really?<eos> You have a lot of experience with the Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester?<eos> If Bonaparte was still alive, you wouldn't be.<eos> Your mistake has cost us more than you know.<eos> No, my mistake was thinking that you knew what you were doing.<eos> Why did Nick look like Daddy?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... we were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.

- And you changed - all that for me. - But listen, Monroe, I am...<eos> I am... I am scared, I am, like, heart-racing, pit in my stomach, I can't breathe type of scared because now that<eos> I have everything that I never even knew I wanted, I feel like it's all going to get taken away from me.<eos> And I can't...<eos> I will not live like this.<eos> I can't be this vulnerable all the time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
Hair.<eos> Mm, wrong.<eos> Well, try glasses or a beard.<eos> Yeah, glasses.<eos> No!<eos> Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?
Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?<eos> - After all this?<eos> - No, I mean, I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes!<eos> We both do!
There is a third heartbeat.<eos> - I'm being haunted.<eos> - Were you responsible<eos> - for the death? - In a way.<eos> A mind is a terrible thing to lose.<eos> Hey, Dan, let's try and keep it down in your room.<eos> I'm tired of getting calls, you hear me?<eos> You hear me, Dan?<eos> No more calls.<eos> Hey. You did it again.
I hope you don't think that I had anything to do with her death.<eos> I was here all night.<eos> I made other phone calls after.<eos> I mean, you can track my cell phone to find out where I was, but please, don't... don't waste your time.<eos> We have to ask.<eos> Yes, I understand.<eos> Anything else?<eos> - Sounded legit.<eos> - Yup.<eos> It did.
Monroe and I made an agreement that if one of us is suffering from dementia, the other will contact the Gevatter Tod.<eos> - You serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's a commitment we made to each other.<eos> It's how Wesen have stayed in secret for so long.<eos> I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how to make contact?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Eve, ah!<eos> Nick!<eos> Eve!<eos> Eve, Nick!<eos> - Diana!<eos> - Nick!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Mommy, it worked.<eos> I got Nick back for you.<eos> Yes, you did.
Just try to get some rest, honey.<eos> I'm not tired.<eos> I know.<eos> Just try.<eos> We can't hide out here for the rest of our lives.<eos> We won't have to.<eos> This thing is gonna find us one way or another.<eos> And when it does I'm gonna kill it.<eos> I don't think it's gonna be that easy.<eos> No, neither do I.
I'm out of here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where's Eve?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Nick's here.<eos> Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.<eos> It's just awful about Hank and Wu.<eos> - They didn't deserve that.<eos> - None of them did.
I want Adalind and Diana.<eos> I want my son!<eos> - I want them all back.<eos> - You can defeat him.<eos> - I tried.<eos> I can't.<eos> - You can.<eos> With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.
- What will be his name?<eos> - Old family names be the best.<eos> Joshua or Francis... or Ross.<eos> Elizabeth and I agree his name will be Valentine.<eos> May I take Geoffrey Charles to see his mama?<eos> - Can you not wait till morning?<eos> - I want to see her now.<eos> Chastise him for his insolence.<eos> - Show him who's the master here.<eos> - Aye, do!
A new chapter begins... without him.<eos> There's something I must tell you, Ross.<eos> Though I fear you will not like it.<eos> I'm with child again.<eos> You're not displeased?<eos> I might wish the timing were better.<eos> The war's getting deadlier and everything in this world seems less certain... except for you.<eos> - Are you so certain o' me?<eos> - Perhaps I don't deserve to be.<eos> No, you do not!
"Young Cap'n Ross d' most sincerely regret?"<eos> Oh, he'll regret ever sending' home his hat, for it won't fit his head when I've done with him!<eos> Ted'n right.<eos> Ted'n fit.<eos> Ted'n fair.<eos> Ted'n proper.<eos> With a chile to raise an' another on th' way?<eos> A farm t' run an' a mine beside?<eos> How th' menfolk 'ave th' cheek to expect us t' do their bidding'!<eos> Lucky we never do.
No doubt you'll find a new lode!<eos> I've been thinkin'.<eos> I'll not tell Caroline where you've gone for fear of raisin' false hopes.<eos> And have Drake stay away from Trenwith.<eos> Why would he go there?<eos> Ask him.<eos> I must go.<eos> I do not ask you not to be reckless, for I know you cannot promise something which is so against your nature.<eos> She don't care for me.<eos> She never did.
Escape!<eos> Let's be gone.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Would you prefer Oxford or Bath?<eos> - For what, sir?<eos> - Our honeymoon?<eos> I prefer not to speak of such a thing.<eos> All the more to tease me?<eos> I pray you, do not imagine...<eos> But I do, my dear.
I do not know Mr Whitworth!<eos> We have barely exchanged three sentences.<eos> He knows enough to wish to make you his wife.<eos> - As I told your mother...<eos> - You've written to her?<eos> Emphasising the excellence of the match.<eos> The goodness and piety of the groom.<eos> I'm sure she'll be delighted.<eos> She would be, if she thought I loved him!<eos> But I do not.
I'm sure it's much needed hereabouts.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Yes!<eos> It is my mission to bring fallen women to God.<eos> We all have our cross to bear.<eos> Should you be venturing downstairs, ma'am?<eos> Let me help you back to your room.<eos> What, and have me miss the entertainment?<eos> Were you not instructed to clear the pond, down to the very last specimen?<eos> An' so we did.
Thanks for the reminder, ma'am.<eos> We will discuss that very subject when I return.<eos> I can think of a hundred more useful things I could be doing.<eos> For shame, Ross, you're becoming a misanthrope!<eos> I sympathise.<eos> I'm no lover of company these days.<eos> With the exception of my wife's.<eos> Sometimes Ross do make no exception.<eos> Well, if I have my way...<eos> Which you frequently do!
Could be a simple suture, or it could be a PTFE graft repair.<eos> Okay.<eos> That is a perfect procedure for an evaluation.<eos> What the hell? I'm gonna join you.<eos> Oh. Don't worry, Dr. Scott. I will not slap you.<eos> Unless, of course, you screw up.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> I'm just giving back to my staff who has given me so much.<eos> You want your old job back, don't you?<eos> I do.
I noticed, Cassie.<eos> But the truth is, is it's not enough if you wanna compete with Dev and Billy.<eos> You need to work 10 times harder than they do to get ahead.<eos> And that is just the way that it is.<eos> So that's why you're pushing me?<eos> There's no point in complaining about it.<eos> We signed up for this, and there's no sense in playing the victim.<eos> You go after what you want, and you make no apologies about it.<eos> Do you think I deserve to be chief resident?<eos> Yes, Cassie, I do.
Yes. Did sadie request me specifically?<eos> You're asking me.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> But still...<eos> Don't open that ice cream sandwich!<eos> Why not? Put it back exactly where you found it.<eos> Those are sadie's.<eos> Her emergency stash.<eos> My bad. Didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
Harvey, please!<eos> Jessica didn't even want your name up on the wall, so if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner while she's still breathing, you're out of your goddamn mind!<eos> Harvey!<eos> That's enough.<eos> I have the start paperwork for those associates in case you want to look it over.<eos> I'll just leave it here.<eos> I was gonna tell him, you know.<eos> I was gonna tell him that he's the one that should be managing partner.<eos> Louis, you may have your flaws, but he had no right to talk to you like that.<eos> Yes, he did.
And if you don't say good-bye to him, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your life.<eos> Donna, what are you doing here?<eos> The question is, what are you still doing here?<eos> I made you an 8:00 reservation to Boston, which means you should be halfway there by now.<eos> I missed my flight.<eos> Harvey, you never miss your flight.<eos> And the last time you said you did, you were lying to me then, too.<eos> - Donna...<eos> - Please tell me you didn't change your mind about seeing her.<eos> I didn't.
- He has a name, you know.<eos> - I do, but I'd be shocked if you knew what it was.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - No, Harvey, the point is, I'm not doing anything to him, I'm doing it for him.<eos> - And how exactly do you figure that?<eos> - I figure that, because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely, and once a quarter he's down here, pretending not to like my act, so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,<eos> I suggest you walk your pretty little self back into your office.<eos> - Benjamin.<eos> I knew it.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- Well, any judge in his right mind is gonna laugh you out of court, because you don't understand the law.<eos> - No, you're the one that doesn't understand the law,<eos> You started demolition with tenants still in your building.<eos> You sent a three-year-old to the emergency room.<eos> - You pursue this, I'm going straight after the mother, and I'll turn her into the negligent party, and she'll be lucky to keep her son.<eos> that you filed construction plans with the city, claiming that the building was empty, which is punishable under the criminal code.<eos> - No, Mr. Ross, you won't show them anything.<eos> He will.<eos> Did you think I wouldn't check up on you when all of a sudden, a queens legal clinic starts acting like a midtown law form.<eos> Well, I did.
Explains a lot, doesn't it?<eos> - It does.<eos> Good work.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> - Wait, where are you going?<eos> - Where do you think I'm going?<eos> I'm gonna see that asshole and set him straight.<eos> Turkey, no Mayo, extra pickles, like you like it.<eos> - Do you want me to fix Rachel's problem or not?<eos> - I do.
Now, are we gonna do this thing or not?<eos> - It happened at my first mock trial.<eos> I was so prepared.<eos> and the other side threw a wrinkle in.<eos> And I thought I could think on my feet, but all of a sudden, i felt everyone watching me, and my mouth went dry, and my mind went blank, and I froze.<eos> - Oliver...<eos> - Except now you told me i can't handle it, and that's gonna be boring a hole in my brain, making this thing a thousand times harder.<eos> - Well, I can't take back what I said, but what I can do is stay here all night to make sure you prove me wrong.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Yes, you do.<eos> I want you to say it.<eos> We're gonna win this.<eos> - We're going to win this.<eos> - Say it again.<eos> - We're going to win this.<eos> - One more time, but this time mean it.<eos> - We are going to win this.<eos> is file a motion to dismiss.<eos> - Actually, they already did.
Do you promise that the testimony you shall give in the case before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Some swelling to the parietal lobe, which is to be expected, but, uh,<eos> This... this is a bit of a surprise.<eos> What's that?<eos> A mass... Roughly the size of a small grape.<eos> I have a grape in my brain?<eos> But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
Didn't sleep.<eos> What's up?<eos> The DNA tests on China Girl are back.<eos> The foetus is not hers.<eos> Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Miranda told me.<eos> She said you're checking to see if there's a match with the mother and father on our database.<eos> When?<eos> - When did she?
An enthusiast, which is a good balance with Julia.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm positive.<eos> - Mm-hm. OK, um...<eos> Ah, what's your birthday, Alexander?<eos> We'll do yours and Mary's.<eos> Oh, where I come from, you don't tell anybody your year.<eos> Mummy? You want to have a peek?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Are you done?<eos> Alexander doesn't really check his phone.<eos> He's from the pre-digital age, when you make arrangements before you leave and you have conversations face-to-face.<eos> My parents are really freaked out about his age.<eos> Did they tell you about that?<eos> They think that he's just some kind of dirty old man, and he is not.<eos> He is so much more interested in empowering women than he is in sex.<eos> He's helped a lot of women who don't have anything.<eos> That's good.<eos> How does he do that?
Hmm.<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm trying to get back here, but my aim's off.<eos> Okay, all right, It seems like more than your aim.<eos> Last three worlds I've been in haven't had any fucking oxygen.<eos> My fingers just--they just-- they just keep shorting me out.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did we kill The Beast?<eos> We did.
Ask away.<eos> I'm know I'm not precisely the type you'd most likely choose, and I wasn't so experienced when we were first together, but you're so great at it.<eos> You're--you're huge, and it's so good.<eos> And, Eliot, I don't know how to politely ask you to fuck me.<eos> Oh, look, Margo's here.<eos> You remember Lasaro?<eos> That creep who made the Margolem?<eos> I twisted his arms and/or balls a little, and he gave up the spell.<eos> Living clay is hard to come by, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it's like he wanted me to steal it.<eos> So I did.
Well, you better, because if anyone figures out that we're doing this for personal gain, your chance of getting into the bar is gone.<eos> Wait, you were Captain of the Glee Club?<eos> The official title is Lieutenant Colonel, but that's cool you didn't know that.<eos> My God. You still had braces at 17.<eos> Actually, I had them again at 28.<eos> Wow.<eos> Between this, your nasal passages, the skin tag epidemic and the foot surgeries, you really had a lot of medical procedures.<eos> Tara, I know what you must be thinking and I swear, I will not pass any of my maladies onto our child.<eos> Louis, I wasn't thinking that, but you do understand that biologically this isn't your child.<eos> Of course I do.
You and I won't be talking again because in case you haven't figured it out yet, this is a hell of a lot more serious than cheating on your wife.<eos> Harvey, what are you doing in here?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's an executive kitchen.<eos> I'm an executive.<eos> Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.<eos> This place is like croissant central.<eos> Then maybe I just came in here hoping to spend some quality time with you.<eos> Are you saying you want to hear about my night with Tara?<eos> Of course I do.
- Hey, are you okay?<eos> - No, I'm not okay.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to keep Carly Donahue's business all by myself?<eos> Because, Louis, you're co-managing partner and you're one hell of a lawyer.<eos> You just don't get it, do you?<eos> This woman wants to know that she's special to this firm.<eos> If I walk in there by myself, she's gonna laugh me out of the room.<eos> Then why didn't you tell that to Harvey?<eos> Because I know how important Mike is to him and I didn't want to let him down.<eos> - Then don't.
And asked how I would deploy them.<eos> So skip my mistake and explain your process.<eos> And concentrate on how the lapd needs a leader in that office.<eos> Such as you.<eos> Or you.<eos> Hey, I'm really young.<eos> And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.

I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't mean for all this to happen. I was so scared;<eos> I thought Milan was gonna kill us.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry about Milan now.<eos> What we gotta figure out is how you gon' get through this thing with Ghost.<eos> Have you went to see him yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I did it with Kadeem.<eos> When you go visit him in prison, all that's gotta be covered up.<eos> He didn't do it.
It's a human being thing.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Look, I get it, things went sideways on your last job and it threw you.<eos> But this is not the answer.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
But this life you want...<eos> Doesn't it feel wrong to you?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't know why it feels wrong to you.<eos> Because I'm an O'Hare, Jesse.<eos> I don't know how to do it.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?
Can I ask you a question, Cassidy?<eos> Of course you can.<eos> That's what why I come.<eos> To dispense my considerable wisdoms.<eos> After lying to me?<eos> All this time?<eos> Probably since Texas, probably since she came back downstairs at the casino.<eos> After all that lying, why in the world would I ever trust you?<eos> I wanted to tell you, mate.<eos> Really I did.
- Go!<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> What?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why's everyone so...<eos> I took him down.<eos> Took him down how, Jesse?<eos> I cut his harness. From the ceiling.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> - You didn't?
What, seriously?<eos> You're doing the whole "alibi" thing?<eos> We look pretty serious, right?<eos> So take your time, walk us through every detail.<eos> Did I ever see a stalker near Quinn's apartment?<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on, is she okay?<eos> She's fine, we're just following up on a complaint.<eos> And Quinn told us you saw someone standing across from her apartment in the morning, and then again that same night.<eos> I did.
Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name is Jimmy Sanguinetti. I'm here to see Erin Lindsay.<eos> Regarding?<eos> Does she know this?<eos> She does.
Zoey Sims.<eos> - Recognize her?<eos> - No.<eos> See, the thing is about all these parks, they have cameras.<eos> See, that's you, that's Zoey.<eos> That picture's taken right before you chased her in the woods where she was killed.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> 'Cause... 'cause you think you know what went down.<eos> - And you don't.
Well, am I a part of that "doesn't matter"?<eos> - Because I'm not gonna break you out.<eos> - It's a yes or no.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, not here.<eos> Not here.<eos> Forget it.<eos> You're a waste of time.<eos> Look, look, I want you so bad.<eos> I really do.
We found a really good family for you in Libertyville, the Melnicks.<eos> They're coming here to pick you up.<eos> I'll give you a minute.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> Is that your girlfriend?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You ever find anyone to claim Sam?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> So I did.
All of us require work inside, Your Majesty, some of it more urgent than others.<eos> I am in no need of refurbishment.<eos> My concern is for your immortal soul.<eos> I'm going to war with that heretic Protestant upstart.<eos> Will that suffice?<eos> Your campaign against Holland, Sire, is just, but it is your moral conduct that stirs God to act.<eos> Your Church and your God cannot condone a double adultery.<eos> Your continued relations with a married woman are incurring a debt, and the reckoning is not yet paid.<eos> I do not respond well to threats, Bishop.<eos> Neither does the Almighty.
McLeod, that place Curry went, there were train tracks, right?<eos> Yeah, there's a little spur line there off the 11.<eos> Lise. Lise.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Curry's phone went out in the middle of nowhere<eos> and there it sat for five hours until it died.<eos> Keith London's phone went east also along the rail line until it died.<eos> But then Curry turns up back here.<eos> No, he never left.<eos> His phone did.
Well, yes, but...<eos> Here.<eos> What's this?<eos> Um, that is a bill from Ron Laflamme for the paperwork he had to do to put your coalition of companies together.<eos> Twenty-two thousand dollars? Yeah.<eos> It's at the high end of standard.<eos> So, it would've cost us slightly less if we'd have just...<eos> Paid the troll?<eos> Well, that's true, but can you put a price on dignity?<eos> Apparently, I just did.
Yeah.<eos> April.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> I know how much your work means to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Tate, we keep having the same argument.<eos> We won't. Not anymore.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Look. I am the way I am. If I don't make you happy...<eos> You do, april.
Not if she wants to go.<eos> Totally her call.<eos> Figured.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, it used to be if a doctor told a patient. To do something, they just did it.<eos> You been binging on "dr.<eos> Quinn, medicine woman" again?<eos> I'm just saying, things were different.<eos> Like, guys didn't need to tell women every single thing. They were feeling.<eos> My father never did.
Okay, well, when people die, It's different.<eos> There are no do-overs.<eos> You can't just start a new game.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't think or do anything, Because you're not here anymore,<eos> Like my mom.<eos> Right.<eos> So if you only have one chance, Wouldn't you want to fight like crazy.<eos> To keep going for as long as you can?<eos> I did, but...
Thi-I feel much better.<eos> Any it's like night and day.<eos> Mind if I take a look?<eos> All good back there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No surprises.<eos> Ready to put today behind me... no pun intended.<eos> Nick, when I was examining your abdomen,<eos> You thought you felt something.<eos> You didn't, did you?
Then probably a good idea for the three of you to sit down and have a talk.<eos> They're getting a room for him upstairs.<eos> I'll let you know when it's ready.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Damn.<eos> The funny thing about feelings:<eos> You know, we think that if we push them down hard enough, that they'll disappear.<eos> Never quite works out that way.<eos> I could've killed him.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't.
I'd have a much better idea where she was hiding him if the Director hadn't insisted I wear a hood before going on assignment.<eos> Just awful.<eos> It's hard to breathe in those things, huh?<eos> It is nice having someone here to talk to again ...<eos> - you, specifically.<eos> - Someone other than Fitz?<eos> Oh, well, of course, Fitz, but he has been rather distracted lately.<eos> - Distracted how?<eos> - Aida. You know how boys can be with their robots.<eos> Actually, I really don't.
I'm still feeling very optimistic about this mission.<eos> I bear much of the blame for this Aida situation.<eos> Science and Technology are my responsibility ...<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - I knew the risks that came with using powerful autonomous machinery.<eos> - I knew the dangers and ...<eos> - And you thought I was one of them.<eos> You didn't want that technology to fall under the control<eos> - of a Director you didn't know.<eos> - No, I did not.
Whereas I still have my mind but know exactly what I am.<eos> And more importantly, I understand a basic truth that you don't realize yet.<eos> And what's that?<eos> That our bodies don't matter.<eos> Radcliffe built a world ... a world exactly like this one.<eos> Every molecular detail the same, just... with a little less hurt for each of us.<eos> What do you mean, "hurt"?<eos> Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away.<eos> Do you know what that would be?<eos> I do.
I am saving these people.<eos> I am giving them a replica of their life<eos> - with less pain.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it.<eos> Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
It seems Radcliffe is keeping our team alive in this Framework thing.<eos> Which means they can be rescued.<eos> So you just plug yourself in to these avatars?<eos> Hook up with our people and find out where on Earth their bodies are being held.<eos> Meet at the rendezvous right away.<eos> That's where I programmed the backdoor to get out.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
Stop it!<eos> Ward, look at me.<eos> I have never betrayed you, ever.<eos> We're real.<eos> Is she your source for the Resistance?<eos> - No!<eos> - No!<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Over here! Unh!<eos> Well, I do.
Yes, I'd like to report a subversive.<eos> A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.<eos> Really?<eos> I want any and all assets in the area on this.<eos> Hydra is after you.<eos> We have to get somewhere safe.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Is she your source in the Resistance?<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Well, I do.
So, I re-ran your test results.<eos> Guess who turned out to be a potential Inhuman.<eos> Go on.<eos> Guess.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why?<eos> So you can blow his brains out?<eos> I could never hurt him.<eos> I only want to talk.<eos> Now make the call.<eos> Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.<eos> Only ever wanted what was best for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
It's okay.<eos> There isn't room in my heart for two people.<eos> You were everything to me.<eos> I know.<eos> But as devoted as I was to you in the Framework...<eos> I understand you better now.<eos> How deeply you love.<eos> You do understand me, don't you?<eos> Yes, Leopold.<eos> Now I do.
Don't.<eos> That's all you got?<eos> Robbie!<eos> Really? You?<eos> Again?<eos> You don't understand, do you?<eos> Even if you defeat this body, I will build more.<eos> You cannot stop me.<eos> Never say, "You can't stop me,"<eos> 'cause the minute you do...
I know the bullets were fired before the crash, and I know that you're involved.<eos> He threatened to hurt my family.<eos> - Argh! - What's going on here?<eos> Who?<eos> He just showed me where -- he told me to hit the bus stop.<eos> And you didn't ask why?<eos> Of course I asked.<eos> He said he needed... he needed to cause a distraction, that night, in that area.<eos> I didn't know anyone was going to be killed.<eos> I didn't.
She's investigating this thing-- this incident that John's connected to.<eos> She's gotten footing.<eos> Nothing meaningful, but footing.<eos> And, Alice, she cannot connect the person that John's positioned as right now to John Tavner.<eos> And she cannot connect him to you.<eos> It means his freedom.<eos> Something happened, and it means his freedom.<eos> He called you, I know, from this place on this night.<eos> You've already broken the rules.<eos> No, I didn't, Tom.
Up there with your wife and child?<eos> Livin' in peace for all eternity?<eos> No.<eos> I'll tell you where you belong.<eos> Right back in Hell.<eos> And that's where I'm gonna send you.<eos> I told you I did it before.<eos> Go ahead, Preacher.<eos> Send me to Hell... along with your filthy stinkin' soul.<eos> Do it!
'Cause he won't stop,<eos> Delorme.<eos> Not until we stop him.<eos> Nothing else matters.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Is that your guitar?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You play it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course you do.
Some of them were pretty far along.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.<eos> You know Linda from Marketing?<eos> yeah. She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
If he accuses you of something, don't defend yourself.<eos> Don't explain. Just apologize.<eos> They love to be forgiving.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.
They arrested three more Marthas in the West End.<eos> They were planning some kind of attack.<eos> Don't these people ever give up?<eos> I forget, how many tiles do you pick to start?<eos> Seven.<eos> - Do you want to play?<eos> - Love to.<eos> But I have work to do.<eos> - And, in any case, you know the law.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Quick, quick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Don't be picky, just take one.<eos> Watch the space between you.<eos> There's enough for everyone.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ofdaniel has been convicted of endangering a child.<eos> The punishment for that crime is death by stoning.<eos> I know how difficult this is, girls.<eos> I do.
Where'd you get this?<eos> It doesn't matter where I got it.<eos> It's out there.<eos> You can't be sure Neil knew this.<eos> What difference does that make?<eos> Because if he didn't know, it's just bad luck. Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.<eos> He knew.<eos> He kept it from us, and he kept it from the guys buying his company.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait until tomorrow, because if you don't get over there before that money changes hands, you are opening us up to a shitload of trouble.<eos> Kind of creepy in here at night, isn't it?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I find it kind of peaceful.<eos> Then why get rid of it?<eos> And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.
I had my hands pretty full myself.<eos> I got back, I stopped him, that's it.<eos> Can't you feel it, Jesse?<eos> That... That "something's not right" feeling?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Tulip.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go talk to a man about the end of the world.<eos> You want to come?<eos> 'Course you don't.
Not again.<eos> Today... you will compete in a series of trials designed to test your abilities.<eos> You have all been selected because you are, simply put, the best.<eos> The strongest.<eos> The smartest.<eos> The most able.<eos> And yet, only one of you will prove worthy enough to join our ranks.<eos> But before we begin, are there any questions?<eos> Do you validate parking?<eos> No, we do not.
May I ask, what would be my specific role in all this?<eos> The Samson Unit of The Grail handles the false prophets, contenders to Christ's throne.<eos> Our job is to rid the world of their competing narratives.<eos> Charlemagne.<eos> Lincoln.<eos> Belushi.<eos> You name it.<eos> You... will be my right-hand man.<eos> The Grail killed Abraham Lincoln?<eos> Mm. Yes, we did.
But to do what she did, she'd have to be a top corporate officer.<eos> Well, that narrows it down.<eos> But it's still gonna require huge amounts of research and hundreds of phone calls.<eos> No, Louis, it'll only require one phone call.<eos> Because what I need is access to their database.<eos> No, Harvey, there's got to be someone else.<eos> Vanessa doesn't do this kind of thing and you know it.<eos> I swore that I would never do business with that son of a bitch again.<eos> I know that, Louis.<eos> But if we don't do this...
Okay.<eos> Louis, I've got about two minutes.<eos> I'm gonna meet Rachel.<eos> Well, take two minutes to look at this.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a letter from Allen Fields.<eos> Shit.<eos> He's putting us in review based on our recent affiliations.<eos> - You know what that means.<eos> - Yeah, I sure as hell do.
You're gonna give up your chance to be a lawyer for some miners you didn't even know existed before last week?<eos> Well, I know they exist now.<eos> And I know they're dying because of you.<eos> So, we're gonna settle this thing and we're going to settle it right now.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.<eos> I'll write you a check for ten million right here.<eos> Ten million?<eos> The hell are you talking about?<eos> You told them you'd get them a hundred, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, you did.
- You ever wish you never known about Mike's secret?<eos> Or, for that matter, never even met him?<eos> Louis, what's going on?<eos> Tara and I have been sharing a lot lately.<eos> But there's still things I haven't told her.<eos> Yesterday, she asked me what I was having a bad day about.<eos> And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react.<eos> No, I don't.
I got in pretty late last night.<eos> Does that have anything to do with the flowers I just found in the kitchen?<eos> Can't a guy just buy you flowers 'cause he loves you?<eos> He can.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> You're right.<eos> I bought them to say thank you for doing whatever it took to make sure I got my shot at getting into the Bar.<eos> Wait, does that mean that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We did it.
Then what we should be doing is finding a way to get her kicked off. Harvey's working on it.<eos> But in the meantime, I need to know the ins and outs of this committee, because while she's on it, she's gonna use every dirty trick in the book to end this thing before it gets started.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go hole myself up in the library and start preparing answers to every dirty question I can think of.<eos> Louis, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine, Donna.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I know you know Benjamin and I have been working on a business.<eos> But I'm not sure that you know that we brought on Stu as an investor.<eos> - I didn't, Donna;
Where are you going?<eos> To see someone who doesn't know Samson at all.<eos> Before we get started, I'd like to point out these interviews are normally for us to quickly approve standard applicants to the Bar.<eos> However, Mr. Ross is no standard applicant.<eos> Therefore, we will convene for as long as it takes before ruling on his application.<eos> Now...<eos> Mr. Chairman, if I may.<eos> Last winter, Mr. Ross pled guilty to defrauding the citizens of New York.<eos> Therefore, I propose we reject his application right now because Mr. Ross is a felon and the New York Bar does not accept felons.<eos> Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the new board member, you do.
What are you talking about?<eos> I applied, like everyone else.<eos> No, you're not like everyone else.<eos> You didn't go to law school. It doesn't matter.<eos> There's an exception called "reading the law."<eos> See, right there, Mike, that sounds like the bullshit artist I met in prison.<eos> So you tell me right now.<eos> Did you pull some shit to make this happen?<eos> Damn, Mike, if you can't be straight with me, this conversation ends right here.<eos> Yes, I did.
I care that Louis didn't fight for me.<eos> I did fight for you, Donna, I swear.<eos> They got us dead to rights.<eos> There's nothing more I can do.<eos> Bullshit. Louis Litt does not roll over for anybody.<eos> He didn't roll over, Donna.<eos> I went over it with Benjamin, and we can't get the overlap under 30%.<eos> I also ran it by my own attorney and he was shocked at what Louis was able to get us.<eos> So you're telling me you want to take it?<eos> We do.
Harvey, whatever deal she's offering you, I'm not gonna take it.<eos> You don't even know what it is.<eos> I don't care what it is.<eos> I'm not getting into the Bar if it means getting you kicked out.<eos> Mike, she wants me.<eos> She always has. No, Harvey.<eos> She wants both of us.<eos> And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- and to name your accomplice. - And the other?<eos> - You couldn't prove anything of course, so you tricked Robert into turning on me.<eos> I knew you were brilliant, but I failed to anticipate just how devious you would be.<eos> - It wasn't my idea.<eos> - Shut up, you fool.<eos> The timing device.<eos> That was his invention.<eos> - You bloody coward.<eos> - You tried to kill me.<eos> No, I didn't.
You will be killed.<eos> No!<eos> Sir!<eos> No!<eos> Julia.<eos> That bridge is fifty feet high.<eos> The water was shallow.<eos> There were rocks.<eos> I barely survived the jump myself.<eos> Yes, but you did.
What did the man look like?<eos> I never saw him.<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> Veronica, did this man hurt you in any way?<eos> No, he was nice.<eos> He said we were playing hide and seek.<eos> Did he say who you were hiding from?<eos> You.<eos> But you found me.<eos> Yes, yes I did.
Across to where?<eos> Look, there's nothing on the other side.<eos> There is!<eos> There has to be!<eos> We just can't see it yet.<eos> You!<eos> You can reveal it to us.<eos> You were meant to show us the way.<eos> - I don't know how.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Women were abandoning their families and we needed to make a change.<eos> We were running out of time.<eos> You were arrested for inciting to riot, if I recall?<eos> I had a temper in those days.<eos> Back then, did you ever imagine a society like this?<eos> A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?<eos> A society in which women can no longer read your book.<eos> Or anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Too many eyes and ears before.<eos> You said you wanted to help?<eos> They need you to go back to Jezebel's.<eos> What?<eos> They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Find Rachel at the bar.<eos> Wait.<eos> How do they know I was there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They just do.
- No, I didn't.<eos> Hm. Well, why then did you offer to resign over it?<eos> Julie accused me of embellishing the truth.<eos> .. because you're lazy.<eos> Lazy and self-satisfied.<eos> And you lied to me.<eos> It's over for you, Tony.<eos> After all we'd been through, she should have stuck by me.<eos> - Must have stung a bit, though.<eos> - Yes, it did.
Sorry, but have we come here for a theology lesson?<eos> No, sorry, Tony, not at all.<eos> We're here because the killer of Julie Matlock also had the gift of bilocation.<eos> They were in two places at once.<eos> See, there are two victims in this case.<eos> There's Julie Matlock, demanding editor, fiercely-protective mother, domineering wife.<eos> And there was also Nadine Hunter, charismatic but haunted woman, born under an unlucky star.<eos> Depression, alcoholism, a college sweetheart buried in the past.<eos> And then, to cap it all off, she's convicted for a murder she did not commit.<eos> - Did not?
- Thank you.<eos> Don't worry about them.<eos> They're just going through the motions.<eos> - Dwayne... - Mm?<eos> I hope that newspaper report doesn't ruin Catherine's chances of becoming mayor.<eos> Well, you know, JP, it might not be a bad thing.<eos> What?<eos> Look...<eos> It's not that I don't like Catherine.<eos> Of course I do.
Yeah, I was just wondering, what you were doing in room 303 at the Paradise Bay last Tuesday evening.<eos> I...<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Take your time.<eos> I mean, obviously we could ask Verity Browning, who was also there.<eos> But we thought we'd come to you first, Peter.<eos> Look, if it helps to jog your memory, we could show you some CCTV footage.<eos> Or maybe you recall Victor Pearce calling you about the very same thing?<eos> - You know about that?<eos> - We do, yes.
Peter Baxter was in the opposing booth.<eos> Kemar Pearce was right next door.<eos> Edwina Bousquet was in the storeroom, and Judith Dawson was just outside it, here.<eos> And all of them can prove they were where they say they were when the knife was thrust into Victor Pearce's back.<eos> So just how did the killer manage to do it without anyone else in the room seeing it?<eos> - But it has to have been one of them.<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> - Sir? - Mm?<eos> The church service, we said we'd go.<eos> Oh, yes, so we did, yeah.
Well...<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Straight up.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Straight up.<eos> Cool.<eos> Do you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?<eos> Yeah. I do.
She could learn all this at these interviews tomorrow.<eos> We need to make an alibi.<eos> I'm working on it with Ed.<eos> She has...<eos> The detective has a photograph of me, too.<eos> Yeah, it's six hours later here.<eos> I know. Weird, right?<eos> You haven't been photographed since you were 19 years old.<eos> I was.<eos> I did, yeah.
Respectfully, delicately, regretfully... he's better than you.<eos> I see that.<eos> Head-to-head, he is better.<eos> So, we don't play?<eos> No.<eos> We reduce his edge.<eos> Is this, um... is this last night's or this morning's?<eos> What if I don't want to answer?<eos> Well, maybe shower before heading to the office.<eos> I already did.
- To get her attention.<eos> See, Wynonna's not a flowers and chocolate kind of a girl.<eos> D'you anticipate charging Earp as an accessory after the fact?<eos> We're weighing the evidence, considering our options.<eos> Thanks, Pam.<eos> So no parade down main street in my honour then?<eos> I'd settle for a smoothie and one sad stripper.<eos> Look, the town needed a plausible, nonsupernatural explanation for what happened.<eos> - And they already hate you, so.<eos> - They really do.
C'mon, Earp. I had my own room.<eos> What?<eos> I just like to see you squirm.<eos> Look, we came all this way for him.<eos> Just tell me what Dolls is.<eos> He's what Black Badge made him.<eos> Though they lied to him about that, too.<eos> That's why I was in Purgatory.<eos> I was trying to help him find out what he... we are.<eos> What they did to us.
Be careful with my stuff. That wig's made to measure.<eos> Which makes it the only thing we found in your flat which is definitely yours.<eos> Nice jacket.<eos> You been nicking in Carnaby Street?<eos> I know my rights. I...<eos> Now you're sober, you can tell us more.<eos> I... I swear, I didn't do it.<eos> You took her to the drugs unit in Homerton hospital.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> You did, you moron.
I followed you to the lock-up...<eos> - I don't care any more.<eos> - Is that where Julie-Ann died?<eos> If you jump, they'll say you did it.<eos> I didn't!<eos> I'd never hurt her.<eos> But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.<eos> David, I know about you and Julie-Ann.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
"Delmo"?<eos> What do you mean by "Delmo"?<eos> I consider myself an expert on the English language, and I have no idea what the word "Delmo" means.<eos> Sunny doesn't speak fluently yet.<eos> Just baby talk, mostly.<eos> Well, you have arrived just in time.<eos> I know you've seen many unusual things.<eos> - Yes, we have.<eos> - And you must have many questions.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- ordinary.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> That's just how it happened with my husband.<eos> - That wasn't pasta.<eos> - Leeches.<eos> I lost my husband to the Lachrymose Leeches.<eos> Good heavens!<eos> I had absolutely no idea.<eos> I swear.<eos> None of us did.
Very well.<eos> There's no reason both of you have to die tonight.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> The piece of the spear's inside your telescope.<eos> Now just... just let her go.<eos> Rip.<eos> Rip, it's Sara.<eos> Come on, it's Sara.<eos> You say her name as if she's supposed to matter to me.<eos> She doesn't.
She gave me a little advice on staying true to myself.<eos> Maybe it's time I let go of the old rules.<eos> A lot's changed since I left 1942.<eos> I've changed.<eos> And... maybe exploring this... whatever this is, is not the worst idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea at all.<eos> Run!<eos> What happened?<eos> She may have picked up my scent!<eos> Yep, she definitely did.
It's a long story, but it ends with her village being destroyed and her granddaughter in foster care.<eos> Ray...<eos> I gotta tell her.<eos> You can't.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> Sit down, Professor.<eos> His heart is beating way too fast.<eos> I said sit.<eos> I know you think I'm overreacting...<eos> No, I don't.
Well, you know, she's holding up pretty well.<eos> I liked you better when you were killing people.<eos> Ah, I see that not everything has changed in my absence.<eos> Ms. Jiwe, I had the honor of serving alongside your compatriots, including Dr. Heywood's grandfather.<eos> They all spoke very highly of you.<eos> Well, this group speaks very highly of you too.<eos> Nice to meet you, Rip.<eos> For real this time.<eos> Well, everyone is being very uncharacteristically pleasant, but we're all hoping you know where the final piece of the Spear of Destiny is.<eos> I do.
Where would I find a motorcycle?<eos> Is there a superhero discount?<eos> Is there some cash...<eos> It's a cool suit.<eos> Yours?<eos> I was going to tell you.<eos> I told him to tell you last night.<eos> I told you both weeks ago.<eos> - You all knew?<eos> - Um, I didn't.
Right, like, things we only would know the answer to.<eos> Like what's the scented candle that I hate?<eos> - Teak wood and tobacco.<eos> - No. They can read minds, too.<eos> They know all your preferences, everything that makes you who you are.<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> - What?<eos> - All right. Hey! - Whoa, whoa!<eos> - Holster your sidearms!<eos> - Yes, do that, please.
Okay, that's...<eos> Is that like a problem here on Earth or...<eos> Well, on Earth, you know, not everybody supports ladies loving ladies.<eos> Oh, on Daxam it's the more the merrier.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> - Drinks for you guys? Awesome.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, do you play pool?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, you don't.
Plus, he could have been listening, so...<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, so you didn't mean any of that stuff that you said?<eos> Well, the first bit about your infuriating male ego, that part I meant.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But the second part about us not being a match...<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> No, you're good. You are good.<eos> Well, you got rid of Mxy...<eos> I did.
- Hmm? - Oh, gosh, I really...<eos> - I... Oh, no...<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, no, no, 'cause we have to be at the DEO in like 20 minutes.<eos> - Boo! - I know, I know.<eos> Speaking of which, um, can we just keep this quiet?<eos> What you...<eos> -You don't want people to know?<eos> -No, no, I do.
You sound just like him.<eos> Can we just agree to stop doing the wrong things for the right reasons?<eos> Yeah, that sounds like a plan.<eos> Let me start by doing the right thing.<eos> Report back to work, Agent Danvers.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I hope one day we get him back.<eos> We will.<eos> Did you get your job back?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Thanks, brother.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Look who it is.<eos> You know what?<eos> I love these falafels. Do you?<eos> Because they are, like, the best in the city.<eos> I gotta say.<eos> Yeah, they are the best in the city.<eos> You know that because I told you about this falafel stand.<eos> Oh, yes. Yes, you did.
Why won't it shut down?<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - What I had to do.<eos> For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?
- Okay.<eos> So please...<eos> Just be faster than me.<eos> Okay?<eos> I know, I know you're fast, but just be faster.<eos> Faster than a speeding bullet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is this going to work?<eos> - Most likely.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
You'll find Sokolov's body in Anaheim.<eos> Nice work, Frank.<eos> Looks like you brought down another crime boss.<eos> It's fucking great to be a Donovan.<eos> Yesterday I thought everything was over.<eos> I thought that we'd never be able to come home again.<eos> Now, look.<eos> We got a fresh start, Ray.<eos> I told you everything would work out, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Why was that man who hit me so angry?<eos> Why did he hit me?<eos> Birds spend their time flying<eos> They look for food, they fight, and they eat.<eos> Then they hit the window<eos> And they die.<eos> Better not to be born at all.<eos> We should kill them, so they don't suffer.<eos> And this?<eos> Who did this to you?
It was a good strategy.<eos> Yes, they are lovely, in their own different way<eos> And they need so much affection, it's obvious.<eos> But you are not answering me:<eos> Who is 'the other', how long was she here, and why did she leave?<eos> Well, she wasn't a good teacher,<eos> She wasn't qualified for the job.<eos> She didn't even teach them how to use latrines<eos> Their uncle chose her, and he feels very guilty for the mistake.<eos> But he did right with you.
Too late.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Not all the way, but close.<eos> I'm selling my share of the firm to my partners.<eos> It's been a long time coming. Tomorrow is liberation day.<eos> You never tally your sheet until the lockup period is over, but even I have to admit it does feel great.<eos> You did a good thing here, son.<eos> You absolutely did.<eos> I hope that's true, Dad.<eos> I really do.
I get the feeling there's a specific reason you're struggling with this.<eos> The question you've been asking yourself.<eos> Say it out loud.<eos> I'm looking for affirmation.<eos> My father was fired when I was in seventh grade.<eos> He was a mathematician at an aerospace company.<eos> His division and his job went away, and it never came back.<eos> I imagine that affected the homelife.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It did.
Their son, Keith, was supposed to arrive home last night and never turned up.<eos> He has his next victim.<eos> This is Edie's show now.<eos> I know she doesn't look like much, but she's ready.<eos> I made him bleed.<eos> For you.<eos> That is something you, you learn very early on, not to ah, judge by volume.<eos> That... that could be a laptop, or maybe it's just a blender.<eos> Yeah, oh it's funny, you know, people, they ask me that all the time.<eos> They do.
I have been trying to reach Frank, but today was just...<eos> I saw that you were appearing at an event and I showed up to say hi.<eos> I...<eos> I really do work around here, on a street called "Wall," you know?<eos> But then you made reference to something about two very close friends that's nobody's business, including yours.<eos> And you even said so yourself, Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.<eos> I...<eos> I lost a dear friend.<eos> I loved Tim.<eos> Everybody did.
It is outrageous.<eos> We could resign our posts, you know, in protest.<eos> I bet we can convince others of the cabinet to do the same thing.<eos> Outrageous by design, I was going to say.<eos> It's smart, what the president's doing.<eos> -It's serving him in the polls.<eos> -Donald.<eos> Let's... take a step back for a moment.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> I did.
Pennyfeather, circulate, please.<eos> Mingle.<eos> The tent seems to have divided into two warring sides.<eos> Give them sandwiches. I'll go and talk to Mrs Beste-Chetwynde.<eos> Mrs Beste-Chetwynde, it's such a pity you've missed the hurdles.<eos> Peter did very well.<eos> Oh, it was such a shame to have missed that.<eos> We had the slowest journey up. Stopping at all the churches.<eos> Chokey loves an old church, don't you, darling?<eos> Oh, I sure do.
Not at all.<eos> But my race is essentially an artistic race...<eos> Oh, you should hear him play.<eos> .. with a love of song and colour.<eos> What he can do with a trombone.<eos> You white folk despise the coloured man.<eos> You think he doesn't have a soul.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But don't the coloured man breathe the air same as you?<eos> - He do.
They're claiming Mr. St. Patrick's DNA under Agent Knox's fingernails came from a struggle in the commission of his murder, when in truth, it came from Agent Knox's illegal traffic stop of my client.<eos> Well, this will be a question of fact for the jury.<eos> I'll admit the video into evidence, but I'm not throwing out the DNA.<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor, it's... It's not that simple.<eos> AUSA Angela Valdes had knowledge of the event and never presented it to the court, even though it was captured by a city-owned traffic camera.<eos> It's exculpatory evidence and it was suppressed by AUSA Valdes.<eos> AUSA Valdes, please approach the bench.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Did you have knowledge of this incident?<eos> I did, Your Honor.
And you, and you.<eos> Hi, Syd. Long time.<eos> I thought you'd be earlier.<eos> No, I... I had to go and see Linda.<eos> This is what it takes to get her to come home, you know?<eos> A crime scene.<eos> It's terrible, isn't it?<eos> She was her best friend, has she told you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
I mean, there's nothing else we can do here. No.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I mean, you can go back if you want, but I've got to stay.<eos> For Linda.<eos> Helen?<eos> Helen Weeks?<eos> It's me!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Don't tell me you don't remember?<eos> No, of course I do.
I know there's something.<eos> I feel so guilty, Linda.<eos> We were 13 years old.<eos> We were little girls.<eos> I'm hoping you'll help me prove he didn't kill anyone.<eos> So, what are you saying, you think Poppy's still alive?<eos> I think she might be, yeah.<eos> I think it's possible.<eos> You don't believe her, do you?<eos> No. I don't.
And-and it didn't mean anything much, it was just screwing, but...<eos> Fuck!<eos> And don't ask me for reasons, because I've got none.<eos> He was there and I fancied him and I knew it would mess everything up but I didn't stop myself because I couldn't, like I have never been able to.<eos> The baby...<eos> Tell me it's not his.<eos> Helen, tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I really don't.
No idea.<eos> Stole it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, actually, because I felt like it.<eos> - What if I steal it from you?<eos> - On you go, then.<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> Well, neither did I.
But you're not dead. Which means it is time to pivot.<eos> To evolve into what it is you'll become next.<eos> Wendy reassembled me, piece by piece, on that bench.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> And I decided I had to give you the chance to make the change here you need to.<eos> To modernize.<eos> To put this old horse out to pasture.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry about Phil, but this place doesn't fucking run without you.<eos> I do need you. Especially since I just let Steph Reed go.<eos> You did?
Take care.<eos> Duncan.<eos> I need something to tell greta.<eos> She's been worried about klaus.<eos> We've written to him via the royal care society.<eos> But he hasn't written back.<eos> He's at an officer's camp.<eos> He's treated fairly.<eos> Have you actually seen him?<eos> I did, ernst.
I wish you the best.<eos> You may begin.<eos> I know I said I wouldn't ask you for anything.<eos> And what I'm about to say may sound like I am, so...<eos> This is just an offer.<eos> Be my partner.<eos> In life, in love, in endless scientific pursuit.<eos> Let's build a beautiful bohemian existence together.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You do.
- Yes.<eos> But do you want to know what I've really been thinking about?<eos> It's light, because light from this candelabra, say, is a wave, just like sound.<eos> But if waves travel better through denser materials, then why can I put up my hand and block out the brightest of lights?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, - then how do we know it's there?<eos> - We don't.
Including this one.<eos> Of course you have.<eos> But you never thought to put my name in any of them.<eos> Well, I suppose it never occurred to me...<eos> No, I don't suppose it did...<eos> No, because in my heart, the two of us are one.<eos> It's our name.<eos> Einstein, 'one stone.' this paper, every paper, it's both of us.<eos> I couldn't do any of it without you. You know that.<eos> No one else does.
Shanathan needs to burp.<eos> Don't call our pretend child that.<eos> Why?<eos> It's Shahir plus Jonathan. Shanathan.<eos> Yes, I understand, but explaining it...<eos> Shh. Oh, God.<eos> I got to go to work.<eos> Hey, you can do this.<eos> - Shh. - I have faith.<eos> At least one of us does.
Alice.<eos> Alice Suzanne Storms.<eos> Arnie wanted to call her Gertie.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> Alice is perfect.<eos> She really is, even in my belly.<eos> I don't know if I've ever loved anyone like that before.<eos> But you must know what I mean.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Shona Adams called, said someone was messing about up there.<eos> And Shona Adams is...?<eos> Executive in the Vice Chancellor's office.<eos> You'll need a prints and DNA sample from me.<eos> I checked for signs of life, then secured the scene as best I could.<eos> - Are you ex-police?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Ah. - 26 years. Avon and Somerset.<eos> But you don't get used to that, do you?<eos> No. No, you don't.
No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - You're expecting?<eos> - Twins.<eos> IVF.<eos> We've been trying for three years.<eos> Well, thanks for your time, Mr Holland.<eos> Writing a book about something that happened 40 years ago.<eos> That doesn't sound like the Jamie Marshall we've been getting to know, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
- You didn't go outside at any point?<eos> - No. I didn't go outside at any point.<eos> Yes, only we've got these time-coded photos of you at the party.<eos> But between 6:40pm and 7:15pm, you don't show up in any of 'em.<eos> And Jamie was murdered between five to seven and ten past.<eos> I'm sure there were a lot of guests at the party who don't show up in random photos taken between those times.<eos> Mm.<eos> Did you see your son while you were up there?<eos> He was running nearby.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'd drunk a couple of glasses by the time we spoke.<eos> OK. If you say so.<eos> - Do you buy that?<eos> - Well, maybe.<eos> She's not linked to the deceased.<eos> Doesn't seem like the kind of person who'd chuck a rock through somebody's window.<eos> Clearly has an alibi, even with the time change.<eos> But she seems more interested in lawsuits and insurance.<eos> Maybe something's being covered up here.<eos> Something to do with that building.
The Dork Docs will see you now.<eos> - Dude...<eos> - You did it.<eos> It worked?<eos> Enjoy the brilliance.<eos> So we punch in nice and tight right there, and...<eos> Oh, now what do we see there on the gun barrel?<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Father's in hospital there.<eos> Pacemakers, etc.<eos> Don't sweat it.<eos> Who is she?<eos> Why hasn't she got a phone with GPS like a normal person?<eos> Because she's slippery.<eos> I was in East Anglia today and I went past the place where... .. where my unravelling started.<eos> That's hard to remember.<eos> Like it never happened.<eos> But it did, didn't it?
- Where's Annie?<eos> - Erm... with Jason.<eos> He's taken it really badly.<eos> As he should, the little shit.<eos> He's a kid.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's not his fault.<eos> I told Kevin I believed he didn't do it.<eos> And I said I'd prove it.<eos> And I didn't.
I can try to track her down.<eos> 'After the break, we return to the party leadership contest and an interview with the clear favourite, Matthew Wild.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> You've done it.<eos> Already over 50% of the vote and rising!<eos> You've bloody won!<eos> Thank you, mate.<eos> This is incredible.<eos> I told you it would happen, didn't I?<eos> You did.
- Yeah.<eos> Just go.<eos> Go, get out.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'll take care of the laptop.<eos> No, I think I'll scorch this motherfucker myself.<eos> Tommy, I have to figure out what Markham was gonna do with the recording.<eos> Just destroying his laptop won't confirm that there was only one copy.<eos> All right.<eos> You better do it.
Yes, the check was a loan to pay a security firm that I hired some time back to secure my three nightclubs.<eos> And why did you need to go to your friend Tommy Egan for this?<eos> I mean, you're a successful businessman.<eos> You have three nightclubs.<eos> Why not a bank?<eos> Tommy's my friend.<eos> I was in negotiations with the Bassett Hotel Group at the time.<eos> I'd invested all of my liquid money with them, so I needed the immediate cash.<eos> I'm sure that put your family in a pretty tough spot.<eos> It did.
Take your clothes off.<eos> Take your fucking clothes off now!<eos> We're gonna make this look like a suicide.<eos> They fought.<eos> This kid killed him, and realized what he did, and he didn't want to take the death penalty.<eos> Now, switch clothes with him.<eos> How'd it go in court?<eos> Not well.<eos> I thought you were going to your bosses with the information you got.<eos> I did.
The surveillance footage from Truth nightclub from the night of Greg's murder until the arrest of Mr. St. Patrick doesn't show him or anyone else placing the murder weapon in the location that it was found.<eos> It is clearly exculpatory.<eos> Clearly.<eos> And to whom did you report this information about the surveillance video?<eos> Mike Sandoval.<eos> And how did Mr. Sandoval respond?<eos> That he wasn't going to turn the tapes over to you because it shone a bad light on the prosecution.<eos> I also reported doubts about Mr. St. Patrick's guilt to John Mak, who, in turn, ensured that I was formally kept out of strategy on the case.<eos> Do you now believe that my client is innocent of killing Agent Knox?<eos> Yes, I do.
Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Who's Devon?<eos> Uncurl the toes, please.<eos> Twelve.<eos> Open wide.<eos> So Mitch went to jail, and you and Topher struck it rich.<eos> What then? I couldn't understand why I wasn't happy, so I spent my money.<eos> Hoping things, material possessions, hallucinogenics, would bring me peace.<eos> They didn't.
Plane crash girl and the super Max body both had brains in their stomachs.<eos> Do you think there could be some connection between the two massacres?<eos> I mean, anything's possible, but...<eos> You examined the bodies from the boat party, didn't you?<eos> I did. Several.<eos> And?<eos> And...<eos> Did any of them have brains in their digestive systems?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
But there is other business too.<eos> You ever been to Los Angeles?<eos> No, I don't like dry heat.<eos> I would like you to consider taking a trip out there soon.<eos> Meet some mutual friends.<eos> We are expanding our reach.<eos> We'd like to see if you can run both coasts.<eos> But Ghost can't be anywhere near it.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I support a whole family on my check, all right?<eos> So do I.<eos> But Greg's killer is still out there.<eos> Enjoy your lunch.<eos> The interview is a bad idea, period.<eos> Yes, they dismissed the charges against James, but there's no guarantee they won't try again.<eos> He's already made up his mind.<eos> I can't stop him.<eos> - I don't have to do it, though.<eos> Actually, you do.
- Jerry.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Come in.<eos> You're the last person I expected to see.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can I get you anything to drink or...<eos> No, no, I'm good.<eos> I couldn't stop thinking about what you said, Angela.<eos> Did you know that Saxe was in the MCC when Lobos' would-be hitter was shanked?<eos> No, I didn't.
I was hoping you had a minute. Sure.<eos> Come in.<eos> Can I get you anything to drink?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just came by to check in.<eos> I feel like you and I need to talk.<eos> Sure.<eos> What'd you want to talk about?<eos> You sure you don't any?
Guess this is you doin' right, huh?<eos> What's right for you!<eos> - Maybe I need to start doin' that, too.<eos> - Please, Taystee, wait!<eos> All right. Now I have a question.<eos> How many of y'all took the stands at your all's trials?<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> Wow!<eos> Ain't that some bull?<eos> Well, neither did I.
Yeah.<eos> But he landed bad and shattered his pelvis.<eos> Couldn't dance after that.<eos> You know, that's not a bad idea.<eos> I should do something like that. This is big news, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> Mine is gonna be so much better.<eos> How she even get pregnant?<eos> She didn't.
How does one destroy an army of clones?<eos> I missed that movie.<eos> Hey, maybe go blonde.<eos> Throw 'em off your scent.<eos> Yeah, I'll be completely anonymous around here as a six-foot-tall blonde.<eos> Yeah, well, change is very important, actually.<eos> When my mom would, uh, catch my dad cheating, she would just... get a new hairdo, wax the bush, try some new eye shadow.<eos> Whatever. - Yeah. And that worked for her?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> But fucking his brother did.
I worked really hard on that.<eos> Uh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you want to go to the Poo?<eos> - 'Cause I can make that happen.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Not now. Not now.<eos> Anybody else got somethin' they want to say?<eos> - You want some, too?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
You gotta turn this car around.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I gotta talk to my daughter.<eos> Uh, okay, family goes behind this barricade over here.<eos> I'm not family.<eos> I'm her mother!<eos> Daya, it's me!<eos> Don't tell them anything!<eos> You got rights!<eos> - Does she?
I'm good!<eos> Please!<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good,<eos> - I'm good, I'm good.<eos> - Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne!<eos> It's time for your medicine.<eos> - I don't take medicine now.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I'll see if I can get you something harder.<eos> Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.<eos> - For me?<eos> Please, don't do your thing right now.<eos> Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.
Jefferson?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> This was all me.<eos> I risked my ass like Moses, leading these people to freedom.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She cut a hole in the fence.<eos> Are you saying the hostages weren't released as a result of negotiations?<eos> Negotiations?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I did it for the deal.
That's it.<eos> Easy, easy. Ok.<eos> I got you.<eos> What about the others?<eos> We'll monitor Adria closely for the next few hours.<eos> If her symptoms improve, then we'll treat the adults.<eos> Thank you.<eos> His father got floated for stealing medicine to save him.<eos> Who knew he had it in him?<eos> I did.
Who's gonna be the next President of the United States?<eos> I know who I'm voting for.<eos> I'd like to thank everyone who made the last 24 hours possible.<eos> All the... the technicians and crew.<eos> And if we all work together the way they have, then I promise, we will truly make this the first of many, many new days for the greatest country in the world.<eos> Good morning, America.<eos> God bless America, and thank you.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> You did great.

That was their battle cry... 1903.<eos> The day after the Russian Orthodox Easter.<eos> They celebrated resurrection then brutally murdered hundreds of our people.<eos> This was but one of many pogroms.<eos> Ukraine, Poland, even Argentina.<eos> Babies ripped from mothers' arms.<eos> Slaughtered.<eos> My God.<eos> So, of course, they fled.<eos> As our ancestors did from Egypt.
I've just given him an insulin treatment.<eos> He's not likely to talk for a while.<eos> Hello, Teddy.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.<eos> I will do all that I can to help you feel well.<eos> Then when you are feeling better... you can come to America and live with me.<eos> I should have been better to you, I know that now.<eos> I am much better at theory than practice.<eos> I do hope you know, though... hope you've always known... how so very loved you are.<eos> Perhaps you didn't.
Don't make me answer that.<eos> You want me to take him for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanna hear you say it.<eos> Uh...<eos> What the fuck kind of friend are you? !<eos> - I don't love him!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you don't.
Can we go somewhere and talk about this?<eos> - I don't wanna fucking talk to you.<eos> - I wanna...<eos> I wanna kick your ass.<eos> And then I never want to see you again.<eos> No!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'm not gonna fight you!<eos> Fight her!<eos> Do it!
Hitler is a madman.<eos> Imagine how he would use such a weapon.<eos> He could obliterate London, Moscow.<eos> Many years ago, Fritz Haber tried to convince me his poison gas would end the war more quickly.<eos> It only made it more horrific.<eos> Science must never be used for violence.<eos> Do you think Adolph Hitler shares your moral reservations?<eos> You must contact Roosevelt. He will listen to you.<eos> That's the trouble, Leo.<eos> What if he does?
Have you seen. the "Twilight" movies?<eos> Specifically the last one?<eos> No.<eos> Huh. That's probably for the best.<eos> Your problems extend beyond your uterus.<eos> The fetus' élan vital is... entangled with your soul.<eos> I mean, I have read about this, but I've... I've never seen it in person.<eos> You will need to find a Mudang.<eos> It's their area.<eos> Yeah, we did.
No, if I make you feel so shitty, just go.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm the reason.<eos> If I'm the reason, then...<eos> 'Cause that doesn't feel right either.<eos> I don't know what's right.<eos> My best friend in the world does crazy shit and doesn't trust me and doesn't listen to me.<eos> It is not that simple, and you know it.<eos> I don't...
You seem pretty invested in what he has to say.<eos> What happened out there?<eos> Got a call about a gang fight up an alley off Peter.<eos> Pulled up, there were four guys beating on him.<eos> Uh, I am gonna need to get in touch with his next of kin.<eos> I can help you track down a number for his parents.<eos> They're overseas.<eos> How'd you know it was a gang?<eos> Those guys have a look, you know?<eos> No. I don't.
Take your time.<eos> You, uh... they page you for this?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yes. Um, but, uh...<eos> Well, I had a situation recently with a violent patient, and I'm still feeling a bit shaken.<eos> Well, I'll be in there with you.<eos> He's no problem.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I still think I'll just observe from here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I did a psych rotation in residency.
I wish I were with you.<eos> Me, too, but you have to be there.<eos> Once we create this Nightblood serum, we're gonna have to distribute it very quickly, and we need peace for that.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Stay safe, Abby.<eos> Be in touch when you find the lab.<eos> I will.<eos> You stay safe, too.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> What did I do now?
I will untangle this war shit somehow.<eos> I know the High King has the power, but I will hunt Ember to the ends of the world to have that stupid rule rewritten.<eos> Everything El promised, I'm gonna deliver.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen to High King Bambi.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> I do.
If they're working with spies, I'll find them.<eos> I imagine you are highly motivated.<eos> It's healing well.<eos> Sabine will be pleased.<eos> I could protect marigold better if I knew what it was,<eos> Obergruppenfuhrer.<eos> I have the rsd for protection.<eos> The fuhrer's guard doesn't normally take assignments.<eos> Outside of his protection.<eos> They do for an operation.
CLERK: Number four on the list.<eos> The state versus Hoffman.<eos> I just told them you were entering employment.<eos> I could be struck off for that.<eos> -I appreciate that.<eos> -Tara, please.<eos> Get your stuff out of our house.<eos> I want to sleep there tonight.<eos> -Where'd you sleep last night?<eos> -I didn't.
A man he'd never met before spoke to him in the changing room at that club.<eos> Said if he didn't leave two grand in his jacket next time he came, they'd expose him.<eos> Fran, I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you don't seem rattled by any of this.<eos> I knew what he was up to, more or less.<eos> He was always a little sexually incontinent, perhaps.<eos> But we all have different ways of getting our kicks.<eos> He's my husband.<eos> But I don't own him.<eos> Do you want to talk to him or will I?<eos> I already did.
He's our client.<eos> Tara's well within her rights.<eos> She didn't sign a contract with us.<eos> We never got 'round to it.<eos> Get the wedding back on.<eos> Offer her a partnership.<eos> I don't care what.<eos> But I do care about having to uninvite half of Dublin's biggest hitters and of looking as big a fool as you already do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I do.
I have a hole burning in my gut because I know what it feels like to be cornered.<eos> You don't.<eos> This is just a notch in a posh desk for you.<eos> You win this, and you get to feel good about yourself.<eos> You lose and you sigh, and I get shipped off to some lad who wants to hurt me 'cause he's been hurt himself!<eos> This is real, Vincent.<eos> This is my life.<eos> Ray.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Plead guilty.<eos> Let me use my words.<eos> Gamble on your guff?<eos> So, tell me what you want me to say in the affidavit, and I'll say it.<eos> It doesn't work like that, Eve.<eos> You need to tell me the truth.<eos> Why?<eos> Ada didn't.<eos> No, she did, because Sean was trying to sell the fireplace.<eos> Yeah, but he didn't.
The parties enter into a caretaker's agreement.<eos> She'd also like to meet in your offices.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She said something about being promised hair pulling.<eos> Oh.<eos> PETE: Rafferty Towers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> How much did you say the rent would be here?<eos> I didn't.
It was a party, like.<eos> And they just took Sammy away.<eos> We want him back.<eos> Why don't the two of you go and get a coffee, maybe some breakfast?<eos> I just need to have a quick chat with Ray.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Social services don't just take away people's children for no reason.<eos> Don't they?<eos> No, they don't.
He grew vegetables.<eos> And this is his hut, all boarded up -- for a long while, by the look of it.<eos> Mm. Okay.<eos> Well, I didn't go in, but I took a peek.<eos> There's a pile of books in there and stacks of papers.<eos> Wow. Okay.<eos> Thank you so much, Meg.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm leaving.<eos> But you can't...<eos> England is too changed.<eos> I never thought I'd say this to you nor to anyone, but...<eos> - I am afraid. - What of?<eos> They're barbarians.<eos> I am so sorry, Lizzie, for your plight.<eos> Oh, you are so beautiful.<eos> You had such promise.<eos> And I still do.
I sent out food and money.<eos> Physicians to attend the sick.<eos> You did what?<eos> We are not monsters!<eos> You cannot just let people die.<eos> It is not at our hand.<eos> It works to our advantage. Surely you can see that, Lizzie?<eos> Did you write to Francis Lovell?<eos> Order him to kill the king?<eos> Of course I did. I...
Send him back?<eos> And he would just obey, go, would he?<eos> Find a peasant wife in Flanders, realize that's what he wanted all along.<eos> That is not what I said.<eos> What, then?<eos> Because he will not give up the crown while he is breathing.<eos> Even if he wanted to, his mother would not let him.<eos> You have changed your tune.<eos> I thought you wanted him as dead as I do.<eos> Of course I did.

There was no move.<eos> You fronted like the whole thing was wired.<eos> Was that bait? Or were you the bait?<eos> I swear.<eos> If you didn't set Mr. Axelrod up, who set you up?<eos> Nobody.<eos> It's a thing that happened, not something anyone did.<eos> That is the kind of thing I'd say.<eos> You vetted the info yourself.<eos> I did.
Then you get perfectly flat, perfectly controlled corners.<eos> It is a bit like driving a Honda Civic!<eos> There are people who would say that technology like this in a car, helping it feel secure, will make it dull.<eos> But it doesn't feel dull to me.<eos> It feels tremendous.<eos> I'm going fast and I'm relaxing.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> But the futuristic four-wheel drive isn't the only piece of 23rd-century engineering on the NSX.<eos> The aerodynamics, for example, are so clever, they can cool all the motors while providing vast amounts of grip-enhancing downforce to the front and rear wheels.<eos> And it does all this without anything as old-fashioned as huge wings and spoilers.
But even the German car-makers can't seem to make the concept work.<eos> We've got this from Audi. The RS Q3. Which is a dismal car.<eos> BMW have the X4, I think that's called. Don't want one of those, either.<eos> Mercedes have this horrible monster.<eos> They're all just rubbish.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You have a solution.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - God.<eos> Yes, I do.
That's the most sensible thing that's ever been said on this show.<eos> - You are weird. - I'm not weird.<eos> He is weird!<eos> We were coming through the airport here the other day, coming through Chicago, and he went, "Jeremy, smell my jacket."<eos> He said what? ! - Yeah.<eos> - He did.<eos> He said, "Smell my jacket." I said, "Why?"<eos> He said, "Because it smells of old record players."<eos> - Mate, that is weird.<eos> - But it did!
Why don't you come at me for a change?<eos> Gotta stay grounded.<eos> Keep a low center of gravity.<eos> See?<eos> Even this imbecile can pick up on your weaknesses.<eos> Imagine fighting someone with half a brain.<eos> This imbecile wasn't even in the room when you took him down, so you should ask yourselves,<eos> I have a notoriously high center of gravity.<eos> It's true.<eos> He does.
But I need someone to talk to to make sure I stay awake.<eos> Well, then go see the Android.<eos> Unlike me, she doesn't need to sleep.<eos> She's in her charging station.<eos> Then go bother someone else.<eos> I cannot bug anyone who can knock me unconscious.<eos> So that leaves you.<eos> You forgot five.<eos> Nope.<eos> I didn't.
When did you learn to speak French? Today!<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I'm trapped in a time loop.<eos> You had me going there.<eos> If anyone needs me, I'll be effecting repairs to the ship.<eos> L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans l'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> What did you say?<eos> L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans l'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> He said one of the antimatter transducer feeds has been compromised by an impairment in one of the particle accelerators.<eos> I did.
- I don't know.<eos> It's been months since I ran away from Draco7.<eos> And that's a long ways from here.<eos> What happened?<eos> He spotted me in the mezzanine market and followed me down here.<eos> - San?<eos> - That isn't my name.<eos> What have you done to my android?<eos> She isn't your android. She doesn't belong to you anymore.<eos> The hell she doesn't.
I'm gonna miss you.<eos> They're not gonna make it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Fonsei Teku, you stand before us, a free man for the first time in many years.<eos> As Emperor, I offer you a life far from the politics and gamesmanship of the royal court, a home in the countryside, and a considerable stipend that will allow you to live out your retirement in quiet retreat.<eos> What say you, Teku?<eos> You are most generous, Heika.<eos> But, in order to receive these gifts, you must publicly recant.<eos> Do you renounce your actions against the throne?<eos> No, I do not.
I double-checked the system.<eos> Seems fine.<eos> I found something.<eos> This is a magnified image of the nearest star, approximately half a lightyear away.<eos> Mass and spectrographic analysis show it to be an exact match for Pollux.<eos> We were just in the Pollux system.<eos> [THE ANDROID] That's correct.<eos> So we just traveled half a lightyear?<eos> That still doesn't explain why the stars are out of position.<eos> [THE ANDROID] Maybe it does.
[Ryo] Well?<eos> The needle was poisoned as we suspected.<eos> One scratch, and you would've died within hours.<eos> Who is this man?<eos> Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.<eos> [Teku] This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.<eos> Discontent is growing.<eos> Teku is overreacting.<eos> You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.<eos> I do.
If not, then you're a dead man.<eos> This isn't you, Amber.<eos> You've been brainwashed.<eos> Adrian.<eos> [Adrian] There's a name for it.<eos> It's, like, o-Oslo syndrome, or something like that.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> Did you really think you had a shot with me?<eos> I... I didn't...<eos> I... Of course you did.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.<eos> It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.<eos> Wouldn't you agree?<eos> I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.<eos> You're complex.<eos> I'm hoping we can talk.<eos> I can leave, but you know I'll be back.<eos> Now that we know you're here, we will find you... Eventually.<eos> I know you.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Previously on "The Mist"...<eos> - There's something out there.<eos> The Black Spring.<eos> It's like our version of Santa, but instead of not getting gifts, if you don't behave, you'll be torn apart alive.<eos> My family's at the mall.<eos> I've gotta get to them.<eos> What if it doesn't have any keys?<eos> - I'll bet Mia knows how to hotwire.<eos> - Of course I do.
What did you feel?<eos> That it knew me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please.<eos> I have to look out for my boy.<eos> You'd do the same.<eos> You have the only working car.<eos> You're my only chance.<eos> - You understand that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Every day, I tried to say it, but I could never get the words out.<eos> Say what?<eos> I love you.<eos> I wish I had been better.<eos> Don't you wish you could have been a better daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.
Say what?<eos> I love you.<eos> I wish I had been better.<eos> Don't you wish you could have been a better daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, baby doll, yes, you do.
What?<eos> Yeah, I have an idea.<eos> What happened to, "I know where I'm going, sunny."<eos> "You don't need a map, sunny.<eos> I am the map, sunny."<eos> I know exactly where we are.<eos> Oh, not exactly. "Approximately."<eos> But I know where we're going.<eos> You said you knew a shortcut through the wall.<eos> I did, yeah.
- This will work fine.<eos> - This place is insane.<eos> - You like this stuff?<eos> - Yeah. My kids were never really into war stuff, so I've never been here.<eos> - Me either.<eos> My dad works. But we do other fun stuff.<eos> Oh, I don't doubt it.<eos> Butkiss was a fun guy.<eos> - You know my dad?<eos> - I do.

He won't talk to me.<eos>  You know, people grieve in such different ways.<eos>  Fuck you.<eos> Just fuck you.<eos> Just  Brenda, I  Fuck.<eos> Fucking wisdom, fucking Light, your fucking leader fuck all of you.<eos>  If you need to release, fine.<eos> Just release it to me.<eos>  ho, you you have no idea what I have to release, what I have to say.<eos>  I don't, but
It seems we won't have answers.<eos> No proof.<eos> We'll have to take what we have and make sense of it,<eos> As so many have done before.  He killed Steve.<eos> He killed Steve!<eos>  He was already dead!<eos> The moment he had cancer, it told you.<eos> It told all of us that he was a man.<eos> Just a man!<eos> I didn't do that.
I know.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> - Here you go, sir.<eos> - You're on a roll, Seth!<eos> Hey, buddy, you're smoking.<eos> I know, right?<eos> I feel great.<eos> No, dude, you're on fire!<eos> - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Yes, it does.

Cassandra, you are beautiful, and you will find your love some day, but it just cannot be me.<eos> - Are we close?<eos> - Oh, I hope so.<eos> I don't think I can take another bug bite.<eos> Flynn, if you don't like hiking, why did you bring me out here?<eos> I didn't bring you out here.<eos> The clue in the ledger brought you out here.<eos> No, you did.<eos> Charlene didn't know the name of the Alaskan town I lived in as a kid.<eos> You did.
Even if there is a secret lab under the spa, that doesn't mean they didn't do it.<eos> Look, someone is trying to crack the secret of the moissanite to allow you to day walk outside the retreat.<eos> What they haven't figured out yet is that grinding down the rock and isolating the particles and ingesting them isn't enough.<eos> Not by itself.<eos> Wha... what do you mean?<eos> What is it, then?<eos> We haven't had a proper kill in quite a while.<eos> I'm going to really enjoy this.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Yes, I do.
And so are you.<eos> You've already made up your mind, haven't you?<eos> Then change it.<eos> His crimes are public knowledge.<eos> He has nothing to gain by killing you.<eos> Everything to gain by converting you to his cause.<eos> That's my argument, you know.<eos> All right, fine, it makes no sense that it's a trap, which is exactly why it has to be one.<eos> You're going to accept.<eos> I already did an hour ago.
We have to hear him out.<eos> If he's in bed with the Martians...<eos> He holds all the cards here.<eos> Make him a peace offering.<eos> I'll grovel, even if it's from a prison cell.<eos> He won't speak to you, Sadavir.<eos> Chrisjen, this may be our only chance to stay in the game.<eos> They're already making weapons. - They're testing them...<eos> - You honestly believe that Mars would use this protomolecule to destroy Earth?<eos> Yes, I do.
MCRN Karakum is on route to Ganymede Station and under no circumstances is the ship to be interfered...<eos> MCRN is securing a landing corridor for an inbound burner.<eos> Those scientists were packin' up the lab to leave with that thing.<eos> I'm guessin' that was their ride.<eos> They're not gonna be too happy when they find out their lab rat is loose.<eos> Even more reason to kill it now.<eos> I guess you got your wish.<eos> Mars is in the protomolecule business now, just like everyone else.<eos> You know we don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah. We do.
Ah.<eos> Ralphie, right.<eos> You forgot, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> I never forget about Ralphie.<eos> Would you like me to go have a talk with Ralphie and ask him if it's okay if you could have a bath?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he doesn't like girls.<eos> - He doesn't?
I never get to talk to any girls, and you're so nice.<eos> Fine.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Yes!<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> Sex.<eos> Where did you hear that word?<eos> My dad.<eos> I think it's something that you should talk to your dad about.<eos> I already did.
You haven't noticed yet.<eos> By the time anyone notices, it's usually too late, but that place has a way of obscuring, corroding, eating you from the fucking inside.<eos> And you have a rare chance to survive.<eos> You're so far ahead of where Axe and I were when we were your age.<eos> We hadn't made hard choices.<eos> You know yourself better.<eos> And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me."<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I don't like to lie."<eos> I don't.
He's already made one, hasn't he? Yes.<eos> You know, I don't know if it was part of your plan or a happy accident, but Axelrod has decimated the part of the state where I poll weakest.<eos> He's shown you his neck.<eos> He has.<eos> And you get to become the defender of the people.<eos> And... you'll get the governor's mansion for your efforts.<eos> And Connerty's started.<eos> You got one of those Cheroots?<eos> Fundadores.<eos> Yes, I do.
Three and two, count is full.<eos> I grew up playing stickball.<eos> You wanna grab that broom handle and stand in?<eos> I'll get too intense.<eos> Okay.<eos> People are telling me I can't miss your party.<eos> No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores.<eos> They have no fucking idea why we do what we do.<eos> I don't think I'm any better than them.<eos> Of course you do.
Really. We have plenty of money.<eos> You mean you do.<eos> There's an imbalance.<eos> I'm just trying to remedy that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> Why are you just in the neighborhood?<eos> Do you ever feel alone, a little scared sometimes?<eos> I do, but you don't.
Congratulations.<eos> You know, it occurs to me the reason you were in the neighborhood earlier.<eos> The thing we were gonna discuss in therapy, we haven't discussed.<eos> There's this person I... haven't liked much lately, maybe fairly, maybe unfairly.<eos> But she knew you and I were going through tough times. So she was extra smug and condescending when it came to the sanctity of her own marriage.<eos> And then I learned something that I knew would hurt her.<eos> And I just couldn't resist punching her in the face with it.<eos> It's a natural urge.<eos> But it didn't make you feel good.<eos> No, it did.
I got another call from the publisher.<eos> We need to buckle down and start writing the book, okay?<eos> What if we started with when Hughes selected you as his veep?<eos> I mean, the lies.<eos> The flagrant self-interest!<eos> Do you have any memory of that moment?<eos> Any details, any specifics?<eos> You know, during my first win for Congress, he was cheating on me during the entire campaign and said it was my fault.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> Okay. - Yeah, absolutely he did.
Oh, I like your puffy hairdo.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Is this for me?<eos> Thank you, darling.<eos> Do we have a photographer?<eos> 'Cause I don't wanna do this again.<eos> - Gonna snap some for you right now.<eos> - Get a picture of this.<eos> It's very sweet and thoughtful of you.<eos> - Oop, I did a selfie.
Why am I getting this sense of déjà vu?<eos> No, no, no, I'm not talking about the Green Room.<eos> That was just a good, old-fashioned hate fuck.<eos> Selina, I do not and never have hated you!<eos> You got that right!<eos> You loved me.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - You still love me now.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - You do!
You'll ruin your mascara.<eos> - Hey! Hello.<eos> - Hello, Mr. Walsh.<eos> I did not vote for you, but I do respect the office.<eos> Okay, well, you didn't have to say that, - but thank you very much.<eos> - I understand.<eos> You know what, I saw that Tom James being interviewed on the television about the two of you.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> You saw that?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
- Gab...<eos> Just don't.<eos> Don't backpedal.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Cal.<eos> - I came as soon as I heard Hawk was in trouble.<eos> - Why didn't you call me?<eos> - Look, I am so scared.<eos> I've called Libby DeKaan a thousand times, and I'm really afraid I messed up.<eos> - No, no, no, no, you did not.
- Is it okay if I listen?<eos> - What's your book say about it? Your little Ladder book.<eos> Yeah, I did my research.<eos> What's your book got to say about what's happening in America?<eos> - It was written in the '70s, so...<eos> - And you think all this shit wasn't happening in the '70s?<eos> White man who wrote your book left it all out, didn't he?<eos> - No.<eos> Doc acknowledged that we were destroying ourselves with violence and pollution.<eos> He didn't, but the...
You never touched it.<eos> Thanks, Inspector, but I must respect the skipper.<eos> You'd be welcome to church any time.<eos> I mean joining... joining.<eos> - Would I have to be baptised?<eos> - You mean you'd like to convert?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but we should go.<eos> I have essays to write.<eos> - Converting would suggest that I already follow a religion.<eos> - You do.
I don't drink tea.<eos> Why?<eos> You think there's more to it than whatever made the rest of us ill?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Why did you decide to cover for Annie?<eos> You saw Geoff at the cricket.<eos> He's hardly Zafar's biggest fan.<eos> I doubt he'd welcome his daughter seeing him.<eos> You knew?<eos> Of course I did.
Amanda, this is going to be hard enough as it is.<eos> We can't do this any more.<eos> I'm still leaving him, it just can't be for you.<eos> It's... it's too difficult.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You know?<eos> How it looks.<eos> What it means.<eos> - It shouldn't matter, but...<eos> - But it... does.
♪ It's not even my birthday but... ♪ You know what?<eos> I don't need to have sex.<eos> I'll just play golf with you.<eos> Uh, I play golf to get away from my wife.<eos> Well, I'm exhausted.<eos> I need a nap.<eos> After I dance is when we usually lose most of the class.<eos> Now, before I teach you the actual moves, I want you to just feel your body and let it go.<eos> Who wants to give it a shot?<eos> Oh, I do!
It's ass past two.<eos> Well, your ass isn't getting past me.<eos> Ooh, now that I can dance, I'm sassy too.<eos> Let's tease.<eos> And tease.<eos> Did I do that?<eos> Did I do that?<eos> And tease.<eos> And tease.<eos> I did do that.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I got five of the macaron back from the birdcage.<eos> I'll get your Snuggie back to you by tomorrow.<eos> I'll give to Bobby in the morning when he leaves Caroline's.<eos> You said you slept at Brian's.<eos> You lying to me now?<eos> Ma...<eos> I was with Caroline last night.<eos> But I didn't see him naked.<eos> I did.
Uh, we're watching something.<eos> Can you two talk somewhere else?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll turn it up.<eos> Where... where's the remote?<eos> Whoa, Ma, I... I only got engaged to be engaged 'cause Dad was sick, and I wanted you to be happy.<eos> But now I'm with Caroline, and...<eos> Caroline makes me happy.<eos> - I do?<eos> - She does?

Still nauseous.<eos> Well, I bet you Bobby's into doing dead people.<eos> Yeah, he just has that look.<eos> Bobby, for the love of God, just tell me.<eos> Whatever hobby you have, it can't be worse than that.<eos> Fine, Caroline, I'm just gonna come out and say it.<eos> I like to bowl.<eos> And you're sure you don't wanna go with the dead people thing?<eos> But bowling's just a hobby, right?<eos> Something you only do...
Max, Max, she's got spunk!<eos> And she's only slightly drunk.<eos> I haven't been slightly drunk in five beers.<eos> I think we got this.<eos> Thanks for horribly maiming Frank.<eos> Two more pins and we're going to Detroit.<eos> Waiting for my ball to drop.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> This guy knows what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't.
I lost him the minute I lost her.<eos> How do people get through the loss?<eos> How are you getting over Benedict?<eos> Did you know that the trails that airplanes leave in the sky contain biohazardous toxic waste from hospitals?<eos> So many horrible things in the world.<eos> Just awful.<eos> Bad people, bad, bad people hurting the very thing that gives us life.<eos> And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You're blinded by society, but deep down, you know.<eos> You know, and it's not your fault.<eos> You just need to open your eyes.<eos> Tell me how to open them.<eos> Feel your purpose.<eos> - I don't know what my purpose is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
!<eos> Eve!<eos> Eve!<eos> Let me out!<eos> Come back!<eos> I bet you haven't even cried.<eos> Your mother had the biggest heart you could ever imagine.<eos> I've cried every day.<eos> You don't know how to do that.<eos> Of course I do.
She wouldn't leave you.<eos> I wasn't gonna let her be a victim.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're messed up, all right, and that's why she finally went out there.<eos> That's why she was so scared that night.<eos> She loved me!<eos> No one could love you, not the real you!<eos> Alex loves me.<eos> Until she finds someone that could fuck her!<eos> I did!
Not today.<eos> Where's the school?<eos> This way.<eos> They're here!<eos> Come on.<eos> We have to warn the others!<eos> Off the hour. It's a warning.<eos> The germans must already be there.<eos> They were supposed to come by train.<eos> They didn't.
Jesus, Carson, I'm allowed to have a conversation.<eos> Just, you know, talking.<eos> No one's bothering anybody.<eos> - Not a chicken doinker, so.<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause it looks to me like you freakin' chicken doinkers...<eos> Mega freaking chicken doinkers!<eos> Were trying to dominate those three young girls, and that does bother me.<eos> Did you not see us?<eos> Because we definitely did, fair and square.
Even probably harder than you guys are.<eos> Yeah, for sure more than me, 'cause it's pretty overcast.<eos> Yeah, it is a little shitty looking, admittedly.<eos> The only thing that would make it better... no clouds and a little hickey on my neck, but oh well.<eos> Hey.<eos> You want me to give you a hickey, don't you?<eos> No, I don't, but thank you for offering.<eos> You're a sweet man.<eos> He wants me to give him a hickey.<eos> - He doesn't.
Yeah, for sure more than me, 'cause it's pretty overcast.<eos> Yeah, it is a little shitty looking, admittedly.<eos> The only thing that would make it better... no clouds and a little hickey on my neck, but oh well.<eos> Hey.<eos> You want me to give you a hickey, don't you?<eos> No, I don't, but thank you for offering.<eos> You're a sweet man.<eos> He wants me to give him a hickey.<eos> - He doesn't.<eos> - I don't.
You want another taste?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna be a zombie?<eos> - What?<eos> - A zombie.<eos> It's rad, I swear.<eos> If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.
I don't know.<eos> A woman.<eos> Older.<eos> I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
The United States of America doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.<eos> I am the only thing preventing Mac from releasing what he has.<eos> And my guess is, whatever it is, it'll implicate you, too.<eos> Am I wrong, Doug?<eos> Someone close to Senator Mitchell woke me up with the news.<eos> Get me the vice president on the phone.<eos> That is not going to help.<eos> Well, how do you intend on dealing with it?<eos> Donald.<eos> -Don't do it.
But I think it was them.<eos> Passports.<eos> Need photocopies of your passports, ASAP.<eos> The police are here and they're asking questions.<eos> - They found Mia Hinkin.<eos> - Where has she gone?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Do you want to see these photos?<eos> Aye, I do.
- Well, unreliable.<eos> Not always coming when she said.<eos> And sulking with me for no reason.<eos> So would you say her behaviour recently was out of character?<eos> She just seemed more desperate, poor thing.<eos> She was so fixated on getting out of the village.<eos> She was a bit trapped, wasn't she?<eos> No way of getting out off her own back.<eos> Parents never paid her a penny.<eos> Ah, but you did.
Nothing special, don't think.<eos> I'm boring.<eos> Either here or out running.<eos> Or down the pub with Jack.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or down the pub with Jack.<eos> What about the evening, say after six?<eos> We were definitely in all evening.<eos> You remember. We talked about how awful it'd be to be sleeping in some muddy field.<eos> We did, yeah.
It wasn't consistent with the rate of tissue decomposition.<eos> Maybe her body had been stored somewhere cold.<eos> - Dead five weeks?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Well, that means she couldn't have sent those texts to her brother.<eos> And if she didn't send them... .. well, who did?<eos> I take it you did go home last night?<eos> Mia was killed five weeks ago.<eos> So she didn't send those texts to Jason.<eos> No, she didn't.
Whatever you got to do to keep me conscious, okay?<eos> And part of the decision making.<eos> We'll take this one step at a time.<eos> But you are gonna have to trust me.<eos> Now, when we are on the bowel, you will feel some discomfort.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I'll take over from there.<eos> Okay, we'll ride this out together.<eos> So, we have a plan.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we do.
They're smarter, and they play tricks and...<eos> Ow! What was that?<eos> That's a trick.<eos> At least my version of one.<eos> Okay, that's the procedure.<eos> You're all done.<eos> You just stabbed me in the back?<eos> No...<eos> Well, technically, yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
You want to be prepared to win the fight.<eos> It's not going to do any good, Charlie.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Meaning this is going to happen over and over.<eos> Why...<eos> Are you my personal savior?<eos> A-Are you my spiritual guide?<eos> 'Cause you're just as lost as I am.<eos> I didn't want to lie to you, Charlie.<eos> Truly, I didn't.
- Just relax!<eos> Everyone, just relax.<eos> It's not a weapon.<eos> It's a human heart.<eos> This is the man who tortured me at the black site.<eos> Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
She is adorable.<eos> Stepulov finally gave me something.<eos> A Dabbur Zann attack on New York, tonight at 6:00 p.m.<eos> But he won't give up the target until Henrik's out of surgery, so we're kind of on a clock here, pal.<eos> No, Kurt, you can't trust him.<eos> Does the FBI wanna tell that to the thousands of Americans whose lives are at stake?<eos> You're on US soil.<eos> That's FBI jurisdiction.<eos> Our building has a first-class medical suite.<eos> We do the surgery there.
You have one, single paralyzing memory of being stuck in that orphanage, and walking out of here isn't going to help.<eos> Let me help you, Roman.<eos> Or stay stuck here in this room, and in your mind.<eos> What happens when Roman finds out that I lied to him?<eos> That I was the one that wiped his memory?<eos> He'll never trust me again.<eos> I'd say getting your memory wiped was the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.
I got a job offer in Colorado.<eos> It's a promotion, with... with a raise, and, um, Conor put in for a transfer as well.<eos> I know we decided to do this baby thing together, so if you don't want me to take it, I'll...<eos> I'll stay here, I'll turn it down.<eos> Well, I mean... you really wanna move to Colorado?<eos> Well, experience in other offices would give me a shot at an executive position someday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, you said you wanted me to take a desk job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I did.
Sandstorm could launch their next attack at any moment.<eos> We have to chase down every lead that we've got, no matter how risky it is.<eos> If that means using Roman to get to Shepherd,<eos> I'd say it's worth the risk. Any objections?<eos> Good.<eos> Let's see how Roman feels about this.<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> This is a chance to prove your value to the team and get you out of this cage.<eos> Don't you want that?<eos> Of course I do, but...
Now we're good.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Jeez.<eos> You okay?<eos> He knew we were wearing vests, right?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> I hit them in the vest.<eos> Those vests have seams.<eos> What if you got them between the plates, - or if you missed?<eos> - I didn't.
Hey.<eos> Kat, what are you doing?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You've been lying to me all day.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> Look me in the eyes and tell me that you're not working with the cops.<eos> Kat, listen to me.<eos> We're not working with the cops.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> And neither does Abel.
Thank you for...<eos> Sorry for bothering you.<eos> You're not bothering me.<eos> I'm sorry about Kat.<eos> I lied.<eos> When I told her I loved her.<eos> What?<eos> I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did.
Well, I wish that surprised me.<eos> I did a lot of terrible things.<eos> And I'm trying to make up for them.<eos> But if you spend all of your energy trying to dissect who you were then, you'll... you'll never be free to live as the person you are now.<eos> - I'm not free.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But I swear I am going to get you out of here.<eos> You think I really loved her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Which is why we should get back on the road.<eos> He needs to regain his composure, and I don't think his prison cell in Zero Division is a good place to do that.<eos> Let's let him catch his breath, okay?<eos> Then we'll get right back out there.<eos> Okay, fine, but make it quick.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Place is a bit sparse.<eos> Haven't had much time to decorate.<eos> At least your doors open when you want them to.<eos> They didn't always.
I wanted to know why she left Zero Division.<eos> Look, that file doesn't tell the whole story.<eos> It says that she was there... when Sandstorm infiltrated your group.<eos> And that she voiced concerns about the team member that later turned out to be compromised.<eos> But no one listened to her.<eos> I didn't listen.<eos> Because you were too close to the mole?<eos> How did you get over it?<eos> That feeling of... being betrayed.<eos> I... I didn't.
Mother, I'm not gonna sit here<eos> - and listen to you. - What?<eos> No.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> You don't have to, because you know it already.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> Because I do.
Oh, my God.<eos> He's gonna leave me.<eos> He's gonna leave me for some... some hot, not crazy dental hygienist named Stephanie who doesn't forget his birthday.<eos> I guess you're not home, huh?<eos> This is Rebecca.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who wants to go to the grocery store? Huh?<eos> All of you do.
Are you having an affair with Heather?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Huh?<eos> I would never have an affair.<eos> I wouldn't do that to my kids.<eos> - So what then?<eos> - What?<eos> What happened, huh?<eos> And don't tell me that you just, you drifted.<eos> - We did, Jack.
Truly.<eos> You know, after we split up, I moved back in with my parents.<eos> I dated a bunch of jerks. I even married one of them.<eos> And surprise, surprise, that didn't work out.<eos> I wasn't in a good place.<eos> For a long time.<eos> But I'm happy now.<eos> I like my job and I have an apartment with exposed brick.<eos> - You love exposed brick.<eos> - I really do. Yeah.
I miss them, too.<eos> Jack...<eos> Somebody replaced the soap dish.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you want to see if we can... break it off again?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. I do.
Jack...<eos> Somebody replaced the soap dish.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you want to see if we can... break it off again?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. I do.<eos> - You do. - Yeah.
It's doing the thing.<eos> Why are all of the Madonnas in here?<eos> - Where's your sister? - I don't know.<eos> - Jack... - I'm on it, I got it.<eos> - Hi, baby. - Hi.<eos> Why aren't you with all your friends at Kevin's party?<eos> No one wanted to learn how to Vogue. What?<eos> Why not?<eos> They all like Kevin more than me.<eos> - Everyone does.
- No, no, we should have a...<eos> - We are not talking about this!<eos> Guys, did you know about this?<eos> Honestly, I just assumed.<eos> I got to work on my paper.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay, okay, so who was your first celebrity crush?<eos> Aladdin.<eos> - Did you say Aladdin?<eos> - I did.
- We won't even worry about that yet.<eos> - Come on, we can have the reception in the Lazy River.<eos> - What?<eos> - People floating around with drinks.<eos> - Toby. - Huh?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, you've said three whole words since we left the show.<eos> Are you gonna tell me what the problem is?<eos> - I don't have a problem, Rebecca.<eos> - Yes, you do, Jack.
I didn't want you going on tour then, either.<eos> But I...<eos> I was trying to be supportive,<eos> I was trying to be a good guy.<eos> - You were trying to be a good guy? - Yeah.<eos> Wow, I didn't know you had to try so hard to be a good guy, Jack.<eos> I thought that you deserved something for yourself.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I thought...<eos> - And now I don't.
You're embarrassing me, and you're embarrassing yourself.<eos> I'm gonna make-make a phone call.<eos> Every morning and afternoon, Grandpa would put on his old man hat and walk around the neighborhood.<eos> So now we're gonna go on his walk.<eos> Come on, everyone, get your hats.<eos> All right.<eos> Uncle Kevin, Grandma?<eos> - Picking the green one?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You gonna do that one?
They will.<eos> Can I ask you a personal question?<eos> Uh, I don't know what the signals are like in your culture, but in mine, when we spend an evening helping someone take apart vibrators to smuggle into a foreign country, it's a pretty good indicator that it's okay to get personal.<eos> What's your sexual orientation?<eos> Out and proud hetero.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It wasn't a come-on.<eos> Oh, it would be okay if it was.<eos> I could do worse, and, you know, honestly, I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.
Titties.<eos> Having titties.<eos> Did you?<eos> If that were me, all day, I'd...<eos> Stop looking at me like that, man.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> You killed me, and I got to say, not cool, man.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.
We'll have the mango salad, uh, crab fried rice, and a veggie green curry... medium spicy.<eos> Navid, do you want something else?<eos> No, I'm not that hungry.<eos> And for you guys?<eos> Um, is there any specialties of the kitchen?<eos> The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our most popular dish.<eos> It's fantastic.<eos> We don't eat pork.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do.
Right.<eos> Is there any clues as to what Tim was doing getting Hana to come to his flat?<eos> No. We're running background checks on Hana, but she still appears to be an innocent party.<eos> Her explanation holds up as to why she was the last person contacted by Tim.<eos> Either Tim sent the text himself, or, if he was dead already, the killer did.<eos> Well, that fits with the phone being stolen by the killer.<eos> Tim had a hi-tech security system installed in his flat, and the cameras fed direct to his computer.<eos> There's no images stored anywhere else.<eos> It's another reason we need to find his phone and computer.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
- What we just heard does not leave this room.<eos> - Jesus Christ!<eos> Stop.<eos> Move.<eos> - Beast's made a right mess for himself.<eos> - I didn't do it.<eos> - Someone else must have.<eos> - Beast makes a mess,<eos> - Beast gets to live in it. - I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't do it.
So we have this vehicle crossing this junction and then coming back a few hours later.<eos> Now, the reason we're interested in this particular junction is because it serves an address just a few hundred yards away where, on the night in question, a member of the police forensic staff was murdered.<eos> Timothy Ifield.<eos> I... I've got nothing to do with any murder.<eos> We also have a witness saying a vehicle matching this description and a driver matching your description was seen outside the address where the murder took place.<eos> Are you seriously suggesting that Nick is a suspect?<eos> No.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> I'd just like to know if Mr Huntley saw anything on the night in question that might help us with our inquiries?<eos> No, I didn't.
You're running a fever.<eos> I think I should sign you off on sick leave, until the specialist sees you.<eos> There's no way I can take time off work, I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> The high street youth club, with a tenner between them.<eos> Nando's.<eos> On a school night?<eos> You don't want to talk to me, Roz?<eos> Of course I do.
As a precaution against potentially disloyal elements within our own ranks.<eos> The safest action was to secure. As much intelligence as I could first, Then to bring it straight to berlin.<eos> Tell us how exactly you convinced. The camp x spies to trust you.<eos> Why did you need to communicate with him in secret?<eos> To establish a personal level of trust between us.<eos> So, making secret plans with the enemy is more important. Than your own people knowing what's going on?<eos> I suppose so when you're sending agents to their death.<eos> It had to be done, neil, And I know that is hard for you to understand.<eos> They didn't have a chance.<eos> No, they didn't.
According to your report, you arrived. And discovered forst dead.<eos> He had been shot in the attack.<eos> As were the other soldiers on the convoy.<eos> Forst was the only one. Bludgeoned, severely beaten, and then shot.<eos> He was a senior officer.<eos> It's likely that the attackers tortured and questioned him.<eos> Or perhaps he discovered you had facilitated.<eos> The escape of the spies. And it was you who killed him?<eos> He didn't.<eos> And I didn't.
Don't lecture me.<eos> If it's distracting you. From the bigger picture.<eos> I'm not lecturing;<eos> I'm just concerned about you.<eos> I might be attracted to him?<eos> That he might be playing you, using your trust...<eos> I told you.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I don't anymore.
And you took this job because no one else would hire you.<eos> Who are you now, Robert Evans?<eos> You haven't done this before.<eos> - You haven't done anything.<eos> - GLOW is my idea!<eos> So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
Friends.<eos> And you spent some time together that evening?<eos> Shortly after you arrived?<eos> Yes. Walking around, checking out the city.<eos> Mr. McClaren was stabbed shortly after he says you parted company.<eos> Where did you go after you left the company of Mr. McClaren?<eos> I was expected at a business dinner.<eos> With my superior, Leslie Claret.<eos> What time did you attend this dinner?<eos> I didn't.
You know what, Leslie?<eos> I do mind.<eos> Your saying'.<eos> And I'll tell you why.<eos> All ears, Tom.<eos> You're reading John wrong, Leslie.<eos> How so, Tom?<eos> He's a terrific kid.<eos> You'd be glad to know him, Leslie, if you knew him.<eos> I do, Tom.
Ooh, child.<eos> You are in for a treat.<eos> Maybe we should have a safe word.<eos> Something we say if it's, like, mission abort?<eos> Well, who is that real-estate guy whose name was on a bench outside your old apartment?<eos> Human Mabubifarti?<eos> Yeah.<eos> God, I love that name.<eos> Um, does anybody know how to play piano or keyboards?<eos> I do.
I like George Lazenby.<eos> At least he's the right age.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Roger Moore is by far the best Bond.<eos> Nobody thinks that.<eos> Well, I do.
- No, it's great. It's perfect.<eos> Give me the checks.<eos> - You should hug her.<eos> - No, we don't do that.<eos> I just work on my shit so fucking long and then, boom.<eos> Someone else gets there first.<eos> I mean, it's like why bother even trying to make anything that you really care about?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> You're probably the only one who still cares about my work.<eos> I do.
The duck who believed so deeply he could become a swan, he actually became one.<eos> My father always said, "Believe hard enough in something and you can change your fate."<eos> What did you say?<eos> You can change... your fate.<eos> If we believe in something strongly enough, we all have the power to change our fate.<eos> It was you.<eos> What was me?<eos> When I was a kid, in my world, you gave me some advice, and it changed my life.<eos> You became the swan.<eos> Yeah, I did.
But using the shears would have robbed him of that.<eos> And, yes, I was gonna use them on him before, but I was wrong.<eos> And you think he'll make the right choices now?<eos> But I hope he still may.<eos> I know you don't believe that's what I want, Belle, but it's true.<eos> When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
They gave her a crib and diapers and everything... all in her cell.<eos> And her mom just dropped the baby off every morning, like daycare.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> What?<eos> It's... just a movie.<eos> Yeah, obviously, I know that.<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> Nobody thinks you're stupid.<eos> Oh, s does!
She's gonna miss you every day.<eos> But she'll be okay.<eos> What happens to Kristen now?<eos> She'll recover here a few days, then go back into gen pop.<eos> For how long?<eos> The rest of her sentence...<eos> 20 years to life.<eos> That's longer than she's been alive.<eos> You want to know what she did to end up in here?<eos> No. I really don't.
Richard.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> It's Maggie.<eos> - Cathy.<eos> - She's safe.<eos> You are to see her.<eos> I'm to help you.<eos> "Richard."<eos> You believe me then?<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, I used to.<eos> Have they... Did you tell them where he is?<eos> No. I don't know.<eos> I haven't seen him since... Did you?<eos> No.<eos> After he left the hospital, he stayed with us for a few nights, but...<eos> Did you know... He wasn't sick?<eos> That... that he had powers?<eos> He spoke of voices, visions.<eos> Did you?
What?<eos> Yeah, I-I got that part, man.<eos> But if you're not the monster, then...<eos> I'm you.<eos> Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown...<eos> a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.<eos> You did.
Now the big question.<eos> Larry Henderson, did you murder your wife?<eos> His answer after the break.<eos> You're doing really great.<eos> Sorry about all the murdering stuff.<eos> Eh, it's what's in the air.<eos> Larry, stop!<eos> As your attorney, I'm advising you not to answer anything.<eos> Heidi, you have no authority to subject him to this test!<eos> Actually, I do.
That was exciting.<eos> Holy moly, that is some freaking momentum.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It's inadmissible, and you know it.<eos> Only makes me want to fight harder.<eos> And now you'll have to.<eos> See you in court.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.<eos> We should probably let go.<eos> I already did!
- We miss them, too.<eos> But we have questions about them.<eos> They never told us about you.<eos> They never told us about Uncle Monty.<eos> I have a feeling there's lots of things they never told us about.<eos> Your parents, Baudelaires, wanted to raise you in a quiet world, far away from the fiery injustices that were threatening all of us.<eos> They were trying to keep you safe.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - No.<eos> No, it didn't.
Yeah, that was always annoying.<eos> You've got everything you need already.<eos> Think.<eos> What do you see?<eos> The end.<eos> The dying man.<eos> And this place.<eos> The mausoleum.<eos> But I don't know when this is.<eos> Yes, you do.
It was easy.<eos> So... I showed her some interest.<eos> She's, um...<eos> She... She's, uh... She's beautiful...<eos> - Smart. - Hmm.<eos> She, um... She lives in L.A.<eos> I've been to her church.<eos> But, uh... none of that matters because... I woke up with someone who... who thought I was a good person.<eos> And... And I'm not.<eos> So, what I did...
And you?<eos> Well, you saw my ranking.<eos> I failed.<eos> Is there anything else you want to talk to me about?<eos> Is there something you want me to talk to you about?<eos> So, the AIC hasn't contacted you yet?<eos> I told you I'd tell you if they did.<eos> Yeah, well, you told me a lot of things in our time together, and not all of them have been true.<eos> I thought we made a deal, that you wouldn't persist with this if I decided that...<eos> We did.
But I'm human again, so we're back to square one. Or two.<eos> Or I've lost count of the squares.<eos> Nazi!<eos> And stuff with Peyton?<eos> She made her choice with Blaine,<eos> I probably drove her into his arms.<eos> Nazi!<eos> I left a lengthy apology on her voice-mail.<eos> How'd she respond?<eos> She didn't.
If it's true, then the cure works.<eos> And if the cure works, well, you know what that would mean for Liv.<eos> Where'd you hear this?<eos> A guy, from Blaine's old crew.<eos> No doubt a paragon of honesty and integrity.<eos> I know how this sounds.<eos> I thought about not even telling you, but...<eos> You should've stuck with that.<eos> I just, thought you should hear.<eos> And I did.
Hello?<eos> Major!<eos> Mom!<eos> I should've talked to you about it.<eos> But I was in high school, I was confused, and dad was a wreck.<eos> I felt like I had to pick a side, and it was so much easier to choose the parent who didn't have a new girlfriend.<eos> So, now you have to tell me everything.<eos> I mean, the last I heard, you were engaged to some woman, and she just broke it off.<eos> Liv.<eos> She, uh... She did do that.
Oh, my God, it's Charlotte!<eos> - Who's Charlotte?<eos> Hi!<eos> - Get down!<eos> Get down!<eos> Not what it looks like.<eos> That's Felix's one-night stand, and I was not staring at her chest.<eos> Except for one, but that's it.<eos> Okay, I believe you.<eos> You do?
Oh, did you take one of the pills from my purse?<eos> Okay, please leave.<eos> Get out, get out, get out, be gone, you foul temptress!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You're crazy!<eos> Dude, I was ready to leave two days ago, but you asked me to stay for breakfast.<eos> You told me to take a bath and lay out on the balcony!<eos> I gave you a Jacksonville jiggler, which, you know, puts a lot of strain on my lower back.<eos> I have never been so happy to leave and go back to my boyfriend.<eos> I did it.
Everything okay?<eos> Bram's been leaving the bunker.<eos> What?<eos> He met a girl in the camps.<eos> Fell in love.<eos> She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.
I can't play in my apartment.<eos> My dad's got old picture frames and trophies and stuff.<eos> Is that mustache real?<eos> No, I glued it to give myself more authority in situations like this.<eos> Well, you look like black Tony stark.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to your arm?<eos> Fighting off the ladies.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Or maybe you don't.
Sorry.<eos> Any mention of Blaine hurtles me into the abyss.<eos> Peyton left me a message saying she wants to talk.<eos> She wants to talk?<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> Well, I'm fairly certain it means she wants to talk.<eos> Okay, is she the single most selfish person on the planet?<eos> She literally made you eskimo brothers with Satan.<eos> - She doesn't deserve face time with you.<eos> - She doesn't?
I'm done taking orders.<eos> From you, from franz.<eos> And you can tell him I won't come to his party either!<eos> What party?<eos> For his promotion.<eos> Everyone will be there.<eos> My father wants me to look pretty. And play the happy wife.<eos> If he only knew.<eos> Listen, I don't want to tell you what to do...<eos> Then don't!
And I presume she's not going to be there.<eos> But all the top brass are.<eos> We may not get a chance like this again.<eos> We were thinking that we could mingle, listen.<eos> Plant some false intel.<eos> Schmidt's gonna be there?<eos> That's right.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Does helene bauer know how to dance?<eos> Of course she does.
I hear the panzers have joined the 6th army in stalingrad.<eos> I wonder what route they will take to come back.<eos> I don't think you should worry about it.<eos> You know, because...<eos> Do you think they will come back through france?<eos> More likely norway.<eos> I was recently in oslo.<eos> Our informants report increased. Allied activity in the north sea.<eos> So it went well?<eos> What did?
You won't get any parades.<eos> Hello, mags.<eos> The official secrets act means. You don't talk.<eos> Ever.<eos> Your family will never know what you did.<eos> But everything you do. Will affect this fight.<eos> The people you see, The people you don't.<eos> The people you save...<eos> Ania?<eos> The people you don't.
If not, I won't.<eos> He's right.<eos> You should, uh, get some rest.<eos> - Dinner can wait.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but... I don't.
Is that it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Get all this cleaned up.<eos> And send that other troublemaker home, and tell him to lay off the sauce.<eos> Right away, sir.<eos> I might be able to prove my innocence, but only if I can get out of here.<eos> The inspector will never allow it.<eos> But...perhaps there's another way.<eos> Did you get rid of that drunkard like I asked?<eos> I did.
What makes you say that?<eos> I'm not accusing you of killing Detective Chief Inspector Webb.<eos> Then, what?<eos> I'm accusing you of concealing Inspector Mallory's innocence.<eos> I suspect it's something personal.<eos> Do all priests read minds, Father?<eos> No.<eos> I was so pretty, so young.<eos> Do you know, the camera adored me?<eos> Everyone did.
He was... happy!<eos> I definitely didn't picture him, like, happy without me.<eos> He talked a lot, didn't say anything about me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Talked about Mom's laugh, his stupid tuxedo, coffee.<eos> I felt really stupid.<eos> You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even... He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.

We can...<eos> We can reschedule.<eos> You don't have to do it yet.<eos> What if I said I wanted to have it, what would you say?<eos> I would say bringing a life into this world is a really big responsibility, Sarah.<eos> And I'm too messed up to do it?<eos> Spit it out, S.<eos> Do you want to have this baby?<eos> Raise a child.<eos> Do you?
Bring her to the roof.<eos> We can't go anywhere yet.<eos> She's about to deliver.<eos> Look, I'm coming down.<eos> No, stay where you are.<eos> Send me some help and get everything ready to go.<eos> What?<eos> Virginia!<eos> Sir, I think it would be best if you stayed here.<eos> - Do you?
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> I need help decorating or I'm never gonna get to shopping.<eos> Okay, but bath time first?<eos> I really need to hit the road.<eos> Ooh, of course, Mr Regional Manager.<eos> Concrete floors don't pour themselves, do they?<eos> Well, I don't pour them but I do help the clients with the designs.<eos> - Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, you do.

Listen to me.<eos> Eddie, listen to me, please.<eos> When Johnny died, I had nothing.<eos> I had no answers as to why it happened.<eos> I had no one, I just... I had nowhere to go.<eos> And you?<eos> You found somewhere to go.<eos> I mean, you... I mean, you... you found a place that has the answers that you need, you know?<eos> It probably saved your life.<eos> Yeah. It did.
Why do you think? Because I'm supposed to be moving forward.<eos> You can have a relationship that's moving forward and still make space for yourself.<eos> That's "hive mind."<eos> Thanks, Chelsea.<eos> We try to point out to each other, when we're thinking from the "cult mind, hive mind,"<eos> as we call it, because that mind tells us our private thoughts can hurt.<eos> But the truth is, Eddie, we're entitled to our own thoughts.<eos> What do you want your baby to know, Mary?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
There are two tasks, right?<eos> Observe and analyze.<eos> I bet it would be really hard to make a thoughtful observation if you... say... couldn't hear.<eos> So...<eos> What do you know about Phase Two?<eos> I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.
30 years with the Bureau.<eos> This morning, his body was found under a pile of rubble.<eos> Michael's daughter was supposed to get married this Sunday.<eos> You killed him.<eos> No... I didn't do that.<eos> I don't even know who that man is.<eos> How can you know what you have or have not done?<eos> I thought you couldn't remember anything.<eos> Unless, of course... you do remember.<eos> I don't!
- I know.<eos> - But I think she means...<eos> - It's a face.<eos> It's his face.<eos> This is this young man's future we're talking about, his entrance into the room, his hello to this world.<eos> It's his first impression on employers, his glance across a crowded bar at his future spouse.<eos> I am saving the thing his mother loves the most.<eos> Wow. You're fancy.<eos> And you just want to waltz in here and have our young surgeons practice on all of that?<eos> Because what? 'Cause he did a hand?
The woman's incredible.<eos> Maggie!<eos> Oh, good!<eos> I'm going to binge-watch TV.<eos> Tell her she can move in.<eos> Mom, I really wish that you...<eos> - Hey, Maggie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I invited Dr. Avery.<eos> Of course you did.
Come on.<eos> You told Bailey to replace me.<eos> No, baby, no.<eos> I told Bailey there was a problem.<eos> - You told her there was a problem.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You see a problem in our marriage, will I hear about it, or will some consultant come and kick me out of our bedroom?<eos> Stop.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> No, Catherine, right now, I don't.
- Don't do what?<eos> - That.<eos> It was cute in the beginning, but it's not anymore.<eos> You'd rather sacrifice your students than swallow your pride and admit that someone found a better way to teach them.<eos> - All right, scissors.<eos> - Instead of... you want to devote your time to bringing this hospital down and me along with it.<eos> Hey, I can't stop you.<eos> And I am done.<eos> Steri-Strip and dress the wounds, please.<eos> - Yeah, well done.
- All right, scissors.<eos> - Instead of... you want to devote your time to bringing this hospital down and me along with it.<eos> Hey, I can't stop you.<eos> And I am done.<eos> Steri-Strip and dress the wounds, please.<eos> - Yeah, well done.<eos> - Yeah, uh, good job, Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, don't you think so?<eos> No, I do.
There was no folding.<eos> If you say so.<eos> If you're into the guy, why not just be with him?<eos> - Because I don't want to be with him.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to be with him.<eos> Okay. You do, though.
- And what?<eos> It's just embarrassing being demoted.<eos> You were not demoted.<eos> From Chief of General Surgery to Trauma Attending?<eos> - It looks like that.<eos> - April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.<eos> Grey is very good, but when she wasn't here, the person they turned to was you.<eos> Oh, I know...<eos> Do you?
Not to pet strange dogs?<eos> Not to give her heart away?<eos> Not to leave the sprinklers on?<eos> We didn't exactly talk a lot in those days.<eos> I regret that.<eos> I wish we had.<eos> I thought you said you and Dr. Cohen - had clean margins in the mastectomy.<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> But then, a spot showed up on the latest scans alongside the chest wall here.<eos> - So you didn't.
Oh, right.<eos> Oh, and, uh, Mr. Boseman is here to see you.<eos> He... what?<eos> Did we have a negotiation?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> No, no, we didn't.
Thank you.<eos> This is Diane Lockhart's office, and I'm her assistant, Marissa.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> It's Dr. Ainsworth at Harbor Hospital.<eos> - Do you want to call him back?<eos> - Please.<eos> Diane.<eos> You didn't like any of the applicants?<eos> For the assistant's job?<eos> No, I did.
- Aw. But is there a better entertainment source than the billboards of America?<eos> Apparently, syphilis is making a comeback.<eos> Plus, you had me to keep you company.<eos> Lorraine?<eos> Lorraine was my babysitter growing up.<eos> She was also my first crush and also the star of my first, um...<eos> "funny dream."<eos> Yeah, Lorraine used to bring out - the holy terror in Phil.<eos> - Oh. It seemed like he wanted to be spanked by her.<eos> No, I did not.
Why would I be nervous?<eos> "Prince Charming" doesn't set the bar high at all.<eos> Well, I am overdue to wake up Snow, but I won't tell her the news until it's official.<eos> I appreciate that, David.<eos> I...<eos> I appreciate all of it.<eos> So, you talked to Robin?<eos> How did it go?<eos> Did you tell him about the baby?<eos> I did.
Do you know that I went to Hell for him?<eos> I even helped save his scrawny, little human, who I much prefer dead.<eos> This is getting weird.<eos> Yeah. It's been two weeks and no word.<eos> I mean, a mother has needs, don't you agree?<eos> Okay, uh... I got to go.<eos> You're a terrible kisser.<eos> Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer.<eos> He hates it when people manipulate him.<eos> I didn't.
Um, and then, right next door is, it's where the kids do their justice circles.<eos> I need you to show me where they teach lessons on controlling your emotions.<eos> She's having emotional problems?<eos> Who?<eos> The child.<eos> Sure.<eos> Probably.<eos> Listen, what would be really helpful is turning feelings into something, like a weapon.<eos> Well, I think I know just the class.<eos> You do?
Has Dad ever visited Earth before?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> And besides, why would He do so now?<eos> I don't know, maybe because we're plotting to overthrow Him.<eos> Even so, Luci, that's not the way Dad operates.<eos> If He has a problem, He sends an emissary, like me, or maybe a burning bush.<eos> So how does this God Johnson know Samael?<eos> My name.<eos> Wait, I know.<eos> - You do?
Apparently, your co-worker, Lucifer, just escaped and took God Johnson with him.<eos> What's he doing here, Lucifer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You married him.<eos> Well, it kind of ruins our plans to storm the Gates of Heaven and destroy him.<eos> Well, I'm thinking we might not need to do that anymore.<eos> I will never forgive him, if that's what you're getting at.<eos> The point is, Mum, that I think Dad...<eos> sincerely misses you.<eos> Well, of course I do.
Okay.<eos> Action.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> I think she's going into labor!<eos> Help me! How can I help when I'm supposed to kill my own father?<eos> And cut.<eos> It's a little dark, buddy.<eos> - Hmm. - You know, just try to have fun with it.<eos> But I thought you told me this helped you work through difficult personal matters.<eos> I did.
Yes, I was involved in Chet's death, but not in the way you think.<eos> Well, correct me if I'm wrong. You killed him.<eos> You hired a cleaner to take care of the body.<eos> And then you killed the cleaner.<eos> Is that it?<eos> The cleaner's dead?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, that's unfortunate.<eos> I certainly had nothing to do with that.<eos> But if you didn't, then who did?
I am not helping them.<eos> You met with them!<eos> I met with them as a favor, as I seem to be doing for you.<eos> - You met with them.<eos> - I recommended lawyers.<eos> That is it.<eos> That's not what I was told.<eos> Well, then you were told wrong, and I'm happy to recommend some to you as well.<eos> I am sorry for your troubles, but I have no stake in this.<eos> You do now.
to the question "Is he or she fit to wear the NYPD uniform?"<eos> The Rices filed for separation before the adoption was finalized?<eos> According to public record, the separation was filed by Andy Rice on September the third, 2011.<eos> And the adoption?<eos> Finalized the 12th of November, the same year.<eos> So that's it.<eos> The Rices didn't update their case worker...<eos> So they violated their affidavit.<eos> And if the Reddings found out, then they've got a case for custody.<eos> Which they clearly did.
Like responding to a trespassing beef and then turning it into a custody case.<eos> I didn't turn it into a case; it was one.<eos> Your only case... was the trespassing beef.<eos> Now, I'm sure you meant well, but I'm not sure it's professional.<eos> Professional would've been to just walk away from the real beef there?<eos> Yeah. I think there are boundaries.<eos> I know.<eos> You're probably right.<eos> Well, you got me into this, so I felt like I had - a right to say something.<eos> - You do.
The NYPD places great value in your experience.<eos> So we're gonna take a mulligan here.<eos> Just as in your military unit, the NYPD... takes care of its own.<eos> So, I'm gonna give each of you the chance to thoroughly explain why you feel you are fit... for this duty.<eos> Face-to-face.<eos> Retail.<eos> Cadet Martin Brown.<eos> Let's start with you.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How you doing, Martin?
Anyway, so, I wasn't sure if Maggie was okay, but I think she's fine, and if she's fine, then it's okay for me to go to dinner.<eos> If Maggie's fine, you get to eat?<eos> - Dinner with Riggs. - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner.<eos> Mm. With Riggs.<eos> When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
I would like to remind you that I am allergic to Cross.<eos> I'd like an MRI next.<eos> Do you have any idea how expensive that scan is?<eos> I have Obamacare, I have a year left, and I'm us...<eos> Look, an MRI wouldn't hurt.<eos> It would hurt me, because there's zero indication he needs one.<eos> Smoking-related mesenteric ischemia...<eos> It could be that.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> My grandmother did.
I'm trying to remember what the protocol is, and if you stop with the questions, I might remember it.<eos> You're sure there is a protocol?<eos> - I mean...<eos> - J... Stop.<eos> Oh, there's a protocol.<eos> Oh, hey, don't mind me.<eos> I'm sure you have all the answers.<eos> I'll just be over here, all gnarled up.<eos> Do you know what the TB protocol is?<eos> Well, in fact, I do.
You cheated with her sister?<eos> - No. No.<eos> - God, no.<eos> No, there was no cheating because there was no us.<eos> She's oversimplifying it.<eos> I'm going to stretch my legs.<eos> What are you...?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, you said to come in here.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- God, no.<eos> No, there was no cheating because there was no us.<eos> She's oversimplifying it.<eos> I'm going to stretch my legs.<eos> What are you...?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, you said to come in here.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> You did that thing with your eyes.
- I'll open up his vessels.<eos> It could save his life.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
Because that's what you'll get if you set your ego aside and listen to me instead of dismissing me the way you keep dismissing your own damn husband!<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Doctor...<eos> Avery.<eos> Good night.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I had a patient full of worms today.<eos> Did you take any pictures?<eos> What?<eos> Did I...
- Is this him?<eos> - Yes. Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Corey?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, that's me.<eos> Hi. Did you tell Holly I'm here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen, Corey.<eos> We did, we did.
We told her we would do the impossible.<eos> Right, but we'll be taking away any quality of life she has.<eos> I mean, it sounds awful to say, but she's adapted to this.<eos> She's learned to live with it.<eos> You're saying I have to tell her I can't do it?<eos> Can we speed this up a little?<eos> I want to get out of here.<eos> This is getting you out of here, so...<eos> I don't want you making any more decisions for my child.<eos> We didn't.
- It's okay.<eos> What if they're all dead?<eos> They're not.<eos> But what if they are?<eos> We haven't seen or heard from anyone.<eos> They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
What if they're all dead?<eos> They're not.<eos> But what if they are?<eos> We haven't seen or heard from anyone.<eos> They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time.<eos> She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.<eos> You mean from my dad.<eos> Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> You?<eos> Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm a faggot.<eos> I mean, God's love is everywhere.<eos> It's about accepting it.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> Well, often the first step is baptism, to open your heart... to let the sin out.<eos> Being gay is not a sin.<eos> Isn't lying a sin, Father?<eos> You lied about my son, didn't you?<eos> No, I didn't.
What did you mean?<eos> All women are two people.<eos> Here.<eos> Read "Madame Bovary."<eos> Please don't jump off a cliff.<eos> You're thinking of "Wuthering Heights," and nobody jumps off a cliff.<eos> Okay, well, then explain it in a nonliterary fashion.<eos> I write about owls, remember?<eos> You know who I was before I met you.<eos> Do I?
Or what?<eos> Don't.<eos> We should be fighting Grendel together.<eos> There is no Grendel, Bae.<eos> There never has been.<eos> Your father's right.<eos> The only monster down here is the Dark One.<eos> You killed those villagers.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did.
Yes?<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I'm sorry, um...<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I just... I don't know if you accepted my apology.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> No, I don't.
- Wait, wait, stop, stop.<eos> - Right there.<eos> I'd recognize that Heywood jawline anywhere.<eos> - April 13th, 1970.<eos> "Mission control works to save 'Apollo 13.'"<eos> come on, could your grandfather get any cooler?<eos> - I think I may have found a way to track commander Heywood.<eos> - Don't worry, Mr. hunter.<eos> We've already found him.<eos> - You did?
FuelontheLem iscloseto zero.<eos> Thefoodandwaterprovisions weredesignedto lastdays, notmonths.<eos> So,yeah, I'mgonnahavetoscience thecrapoutofthis .<eos> -Whatareyou doing?<eos> - I'm filming us for posterity.<eos> Incasewe don't...<eos> Makeitback.<eos> -I 'mnotdyingonthemoon.<eos> -Sign--signingoff.<eos> - Certainly not doing it in a tin can with the likes of you.
- "We"?<eos> - Long story.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> - Rip, how's our trajectory looking?<eos> - Keep her steady.<eos> - Martin, are you sure about these calculations?<eos> I'mpilotingmanuallyhere.<eos> - Did I or did I not win six carlins?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, I did.
You speak as someone who's seen the future.<eos> Haven't all students of history?<eos> Those who suffer heal.<eos> Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.<eos> And our towers grow a little taller every time.<eos> I should like to believe you.<eos> Tell me, why do you seek the grave of Gawain?<eos> Eh... it's a long story.<eos> I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.
I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> In short, my fellow travelers and I...<eos> Fellowship, if you will.<eos> We're on a journey to destroy an object.<eos> One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
What if Thawne is trying to destroy the Spear?<eos> Impossible. You need the blood of Christ to destroy it.<eos> That's why Rip broke it up into so many pieces.<eos> Unless he figured out there's another way, by incinerating it.<eos> But why would Thawne want to destroy the Spear?<eos> No.<eos> If he destroys the Spear, that means this reality cannot be rewritten.<eos> Okay, we better get that Spear before he can make that happen.<eos> But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.<eos> Rory does.
Stone Age technique saves the day.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I had to marry Halligans to pop a door.<eos> While I wasn't there to mock you.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> - Timing's everything.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> Hey, did I ever thank you?<eos> For being there for me when I was laid up?<eos> Yeah, you did.
He took my savings.<eos> I'm a fool.<eos> We're hypocrites!<eos> We stand up there and we preach in certainties.<eos> "If you behave like this, you'll be rewarded, if you don't, you'll be punished."<eos> We are preaching to ourselves, too.<eos> We can all learn from God's words.<eos> - No one expects you to be perfect.<eos> - Yes, they do!<eos> The Church does.
- Yep.<eos> Okay, but you can still...<eos> Nope.<eos> - But what if you just... - Uh-uh.<eos> So right now you must feel totally...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's Rich Eisen.<eos> You know Rich, right?<eos> Did I tell you I asked him to be the co-host of my TV show?<eos> No, you didn't, Michael.
I want you to tell me everything you know about this, about what's happening.<eos> Why?<eos> Because one of us is getting pulled out there soon.<eos> Listen, I know you never thought I was cut out for this job, but I was, and I am.<eos> So finish what you started telling me on the way to the bunker.<eos> Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
Yeah, even if we find him, how do we get him out of here now that his name's been flagged?<eos> We get him new papers with a new alias.<eos> It doesn't have to be good, just enough to get him over the border.<eos> Street quality, like common criminals use.<eos> Well, I'll have you know street quality is far superior to what the U.S. government use, and when it comes to common criminals,<eos> I may know one or three.<eos> Why don't you two go and get Owen's IDs while we work on finding him?<eos> How?<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
You don't know that.<eos> Gunned down on her way home from work?<eos> Who deserves that?<eos> After everything you've been through, you should be stronger than this.<eos> And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is.<eos> I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.

- Do it.<eos> - No.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He wants to die.<eos> No!<eos> Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!
- No.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He wants to die.<eos> No!<eos> Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!
Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> I've been there, and I've pulled the trigger!<eos> Trust me.<eos> It won't end what you're feeling right now, and it will not bring her back.<eos> It will not bring her back, Owen.<eos> Boy, pull the trigger!<eos> Do it! Do it!
No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> I've been there, and I've pulled the trigger!<eos> Trust me.<eos> It won't end what you're feeling right now, and it will not bring her back.<eos> It will not bring her back, Owen.<eos> Boy, pull the trigger!<eos> Do it! Do it!<eos> Daniel, give me the gun!<eos> - Do it!
But if you really don't want to die, if you really want to get through this, you have to stop lying to me, to them, to yourself.<eos> It wasn't all lies.<eos> I did have something for you at the hotel.<eos> I hacked Lydia's e-mails.<eos> Those are her communications with recruits at the Farm, past and present.<eos> SDRs, test aliases, recruiting assets.<eos> This is your curriculum.<eos> They're encrypted.<eos> It's a code very few people would recognize.<eos> But you do.
Wouldn't you describe it as a feeling in your soul?<eos> Oh, thank God, it's starting.<eos> What's this one about?<eos> Tosca is a tragic love triangle.<eos> Is there any other kind?<eos> It's about a happy couple and an evil man named Scarpia intent on stealing the woman away.<eos> He's a bad, bad, evil man.<eos> Does he get away with it?<eos> No!<eos> He doesn't!
- What does that mean?<eos> - Well, look at you.<eos> You're all beautiful and classy and cultured, and I'm, you know, me.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> What kind of a future are we going to have if we're so different?<eos> I literally just raked that.<eos> Is that why you've been acting so weird?<eos> I don't want someone exactly like me.<eos> I love that we challenge each other.<eos> You do?
You took an oath, sir!<eos> - The vault cannot be unguarded.<eos> - Oh, listen to Mr Boring...<eos> - I'm acting under your orders!<eos> - See how reliable I am!<eos> - What's a fluid link?<eos> - No idea.<eos> But the TARDIS can't go anywhere without it.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> - You did!
Exactly.<eos> We never wanted to fight.<eos> We lived in peace, and then you came and laid waste to everything and everyone we loved.<eos> All you understand is war.<eos> No. He understands.<eos> Don't you?<eos> And now he's wondering why.<eos> You speak Latin?<eos> I don't!<eos> Neither do I. Not a word.
And I don't speak whatever they speak either.<eos> It's him.<eos> It's you, isn't it?<eos> Yes. It's me.<eos> Something to do with the TARDIS, maybe?<eos> Telepathic field?<eos> So now that we all understand each other, how do we all sound?<eos> You sound like children.<eos> You sound like children, too.<eos> You all do.
Bollocks.<eos> You may wanna call your boss.<eos> What the hell are you saying?<eos> Okay-<eos> - What?<eos> Slow do-- hey.<eos> Hey, you said the diamonds would be at the warehouse.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I said you'd get them back if you went to the warehouse.<eos> You didn't.
They split up.<eos> Margot and Sasha are leaving the country under aliases--<eos> Eva Taylor and Lily Hum. Aram, can you--<eos> - Tracking them as we speak.<eos> - Look, what about the list?<eos> Emma took it.<eos> You were right.<eos> - Elizabeth, you know her.<eos> - Clearly, I don't.<eos> You do. More than any of us.
She chose to testify.<eos> And while she helped to bring Alexei Lagunov to justice, she also forfeited the rest of her life in doing so.<eos> She's on that list.<eos> Who is she to you?<eos> Maureen Rowan is Kate's sister-- uh, Mr. Kaplan's sister.<eos> I didn't need to find her.<eos> I just needed to... make sure no one else can.<eos> This doesn't excuse what you've done.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
♪ Yeah, he's just a friend ♪<eos> ♪ Titus, you ♪<eos> Please stop... whatever this is and say what you need to say.<eos> I swear, babe, on my Pupazza's Ping-Pong ball eyes,<eos> Jeff is just a buddy.<eos> - We met at the gym.<eos> - The gayest place to meet someone!<eos> Titus, you were away for months on that cruise.<eos> Was I not supposed to have any friends?<eos> I didn't.
What do you mean?<eos> You wouldn't use me?<eos> We'll just cross that bridge when we get there.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Then guess what.<eos> I quit!<eos> You just lost the best client you ever had.<eos> Have fun sitting in court by yourself!<eos> I-I don't think he understands how this works.<eos> He does, okay?
I've lost my way.<eos> Robbie and Meghan, they are who they are because of me.<eos> I brought God's wrath down on my own family, and I stabbed my own son.<eos> Maybe we can help each other.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know what I want.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> - Owe you one.<eos> - Get what you wanted?<eos> We both did.
You can't go for more than two minutes without banging on about a bloody shoe you found!<eos> - Course I can!<eos> - You can't!<eos> All right, then, time me!<eos> Come on, Chris, time me! Two minutes.<eos> - There's no need...<eos> - No, she thinks I'm insane.<eos> No, I didn't say you're insane, I said it's insane!<eos> We'll see who's making an absolute mountain out of a molehill!<eos> Do it.
Now, if you don't mind, I think I'd rather be alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> So sorry for your loss.<eos> God bless.<eos> I'm telling you, that woman was lying through her teeth.<eos> And right to our faces.<eos> She's having an affair.<eos> That could be it.<eos> Deceiving her husband before he was killed.<eos> So, maybe she did it.
At least that's what I told the guards.<eos> Shed a few tears.<eos> It was quite the performance, even if I do say so myself...<eos> Where's Flynn?<eos> He's tied up... literally.<eos> And if you want me to let him go, you give me what you're wearing round your neck.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> You killed him.<eos> Of course I didn't kill him.<eos> Yes, all right, I did.
- Where are they?<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on, you two.<eos> - Cheers!<eos> - Cheers!<eos> A thief and a bigamist.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> Why?<eos> Doesn't Cora know about your other wife?<eos> Of course she does.
When you found out?<eos> What do you believe happens to us when we die?<eos> You're avoiding my question.<eos> You're avoiding mine.<eos> I believe in the universe - nature.<eos> It's the only God I know.<eos> Cora, what are you burning?<eos> Please, will you read?<eos> You don't even believe in God.<eos> Ronnie did.
How stupid am I?<eos> Why didn't you take the boys to school yesterday?<eos> Me and Richard... ..we wait until everyone's out of the house.<eos> Did Jacob know?<eos> No.<eos> Perhaps he saw you together.<eos> I wouldn't hurt him!<eos> This is my fault, isn't it?<eos> I didn't take care of them.<eos> No one did.
It wasn't love at first sight, me and Cathy.<eos> But there was this moment.<eos> It was a few months in.<eos> We were saying goodbye at a train station.<eos> She walked away and I couldn't stop watching her.<eos> She looked back.<eos> Oh, my heart...<eos> I don't deserve to be forgiven.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> We all do.
Yes, you do.<eos> We all do.<eos> God forgives you.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Well, then, I forgive you.<eos> As a friend.<eos> And as someone who loves you.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Geordie... I forgive you.<eos> What did he like, your boy Oscar?
I could do with a drink.<eos> You're not the only one.<eos> Ahem.<eos> You look wonderful.<eos> - Leonard!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> ..and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> And who giveth this woman to be married to this man?<eos> I do.
D-Do you want to break up with me?<eos> I...<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Of what?<eos> I like you.<eos> A lot.<eos> But...<eos> I've never had a boyfriend before.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.
In fact, my wife has never been happier.<eos> Uh, I'd like to reiterate that I am offering a $50,000 reward for whomever finds the murder weapon... Larry Henderson's walking/murdering stick.<eos> Technically, if it's the murder weapon, we'll have to turn it in to the prosecution.<eos> But the stick is gonna come back clean. Right, Larry?<eos> I told you... the dog must have buried it.<eos> You wouldn't find any signs of Margaret, anyway. She hated my trekking poles.<eos> She said the very sight of them made her want to bash her own head in.<eos> Wait.<eos> - You don't think...<eos> - No. I do not.
Cannonball accidents almost never happen in New York.<eos> ...Not only is Jeremiah Davis a potential suspect in the murder of Margaret Henderson, but he's trying to kill me, too.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo!<eos> Those are some serious allegations, Counselor.<eos> You better have evidence to back them up.<eos> I do, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Davis... is the chief benefactor of the East Peck Historical Society, who fire the commemorative cannonballs.<eos> Shortly after I approached him with incriminating information, a cannonball flew through my window.<eos> That doesn't just happen.<eos> Actually, it does.
I have to know my son will be safe.<eos> We can't guarantee his safety if that happens.<eos> No one can.<eos> We'll do everything we can to keep you safe.<eos> There's a lot we can do to prevent bad things from happening.<eos> Look...<eos> What?<eos> She's frightened with a kid.<eos> If we're honest, she'll know she can trust us.<eos> Hey, do me a favor.
I just realized, there are much more important things in the world than me.<eos> It's a good thing to realize that there are things bigger than you.<eos> Most people never figure that out.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Jesus spent his whole life teaching us that.<eos> And realizing it leads to empathy, but empathy leads us to help others, to make sacrifices in our own life for the benefit of someone else.<eos> His crucifixion was the ultimate example of that.<eos> Yeah. Of course, you're important, too.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> I do.
I'd asked my boss's boss to make this thing happen.<eos> I didn't know if he was gonna do it or not.<eos> He was really not happy about it.<eos> No one was.<eos> And when my boss called me in, he told me the thing I pissed everybody off asking for, well, they did it, it happened.<eos> Which, I don't even know if he knew the part about...<eos> Forget about that part.<eos> Anyway, then he told me the bad news is his boss... My boss's boss... Is so pissed, he wants me fired.<eos> Well, can he do that?<eos> Just because you did that?
Revenge isn't that important.<eos> And I don't think it would be to frank.<eos> He would want revenge.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Henry.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-sure.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> S-so... You know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.
Men.<eos> Nobody suitable.<eos> Well, as soon as your language improves, we'll see to it that we find you a job at a paper or in publishing, translating.<eos> Y-you'll meet people.<eos> Clark thinks about you, Martha.<eos> He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
- Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> We'll see you then.<eos> - Great. - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Bye.<eos> See ya.<eos> Why does this bother you so much?<eos> It just does.
We'll see you then.<eos> - Great. - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Bye.<eos> See ya.<eos> Why does this bother you so much?<eos> It just does.<eos> The Centre has nothing to do with them, come on.<eos> And so what if they do?
Mom, Diego's again?<eos> A week ago, you loved it.<eos> If ghosts aren't real, what happens to people when they die?<eos> They stay in our hearts.<eos> What about the people in the hospital?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, sometimes you can't save their lives, and they die.<eos> Yeah, it happens.<eos> You keep them all in your heart?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I... I got to work out constantly.<eos> I can't have a beer with my friends. I can't eat junk food.<eos> Do you know that Gavin made me go full veg?<eos> I mean, fuck soy, man!<eos> But to people like you, I'm just a beautiful bag of blood.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I got some pretty good fucking ideas, and Gavin actually listens to those ideas.<eos> It took a while, but he respects me.<eos> And you know what, Richard Hendricks?<eos> You clearly fucking don't.
Wow.<eos> I didn't feel sick at all, not once.<eos> Not even going up the hill?<eos> No.<eos> No... no nausea at all.<eos> Yeah, I felt fine the entire time.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Did you reduce the latency?<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did!
And you, you're gonna hold this kill switch, and then you're gonna walk into the most densely populated area you can find. All right?<eos> If you see the security coming, remember, you press that button and, poof, you're gone.<eos> Yeah? Okay.<eos> I'll get as many of those motherfuckers as I can.<eos> We'll be rewarded in the end.<eos> When the fuck were you gonna tell us?<eos> - Tell you what?<eos> - You know what, fat sack of shit.<eos> - Richard, do you know what?<eos> - No, I don't.
- What about your squatter?<eos> - Oh, he's been out for months.<eos> He left to go sell cocaine at the Keystone Pipeline protests.<eos> I've just been staying in the garage out of solidarity.<eos> You can't leave.<eos> - Don't beg, Richard.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.<eos> You... you read the handbook?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
All right.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I think we can actually make it.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit.<eos> We must've left the work lights on all night.<eos> Well, do we have jumper cables?<eos> - Jared did.
You can't erase any of that, but you can help Alice.<eos> You can help Alice now.<eos> - You look worried.<eos> - Just thinking about Alice.<eos> She's gonna be really pissed at me.<eos> - Yeah, but when she has her shade back, she'll get it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Um... Speaking of shades, since this is probably the last time I'm going to have one...<eos> - Look, you do not have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What we are gonna do is teach you magic.<eos> - I'm not a magician.<eos> - No, you're more, which is why it should be easy for you to learn.<eos> I mean, we don't have the juice to take Reynard on, but you do.<eos> - Can you tell me again what the dragon said?<eos> - You know Mayakovsky banned me from seeing Alice for 48 hours?<eos> He said that I am upsetting her.<eos> - Well, he's not exactly wrong.<eos> - Trying to help.<eos> - You did.
I saw my old man.<eos> That ain't never a good thing.<eos> Now we got four people dead.<eos> Whatever's causing people to act crazy up here, we need to know what it is, do you hear me?<eos> 'Cause I ain't dying on this motherfucking dust ball, you hear me?<eos> Wait.<eos> Doctor Severin said it could be pressure on the optic nerve.<eos> Morgan told me to say that.<eos> - What?<eos> - He did?
Wanted to know why I didn't stop him.<eos> Couldn't help him.<eos> But whatever I said, it didn't matter because he realized then that he couldn't have them and me.<eos> He had trapped himself in.<eos> There was no way out.<eos> And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran himself through with it.<eos> Well, not once, not twice.<eos> Three times.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I did.
You were right.<eos> Ready to go home.<eos> I fell for him, Nimah.<eos> I fell for a mark.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Harry.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Now's not the time.<eos> - I told her.<eos> You did?
He seems a little off when you really get to know him.<eos> I can tell you, no one around here complained when we broke up.<eos> They were just as happy to be rid of him as I was.<eos> So, Ryan worked here?<eos> He quit when we broke up, which was kind of a shame, 'cause I really wanted to fire him.<eos> I'm surprised he didn't try to stay.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, this is a good place to shop for victims.<eos> A lot of your immigration cases deal with at-risk women.<eos> No, Ryan never did any field work.
I vetted a dozen candidates:<eos> Decker's former colleagues, high school chums, even some online associates.<eos> None of them seem remotely capable of keeping Preeda Boonark in human bondage.<eos> Well, they're in here somewhere and we are gonna find them.<eos> I thought Shinwell was coming over for a lesson.<eos> He was, but he's been very busy lately.<eos> He's working on a drug deal.<eos> It's taking up all of his time.<eos> He's eager to impress the, heads of SBK, and that doesn't concern you.<eos> Of course it does.
I have another call I have to take.<eos> I'll... I'll meet you there.<eos> Hi, Joel.<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> You said don't buy a gun.<eos> What?<eos> You said don't buy a gun.<eos> You said that you would help me.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I do.
It's fine.<eos> I got this.<eos> Good-bye, Mary.<eos> Joel!<eos> Joel!<eos> Joel!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What I should've done in the first place.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
The river Styx, why not take a yacht?<eos> Where's the cat?<eos> I think I might have, uh... Left the window open.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But there's a reason I've never been responsible for anyone Or anything else.<eos> Except for lives, as a doctor.<eos> Yeah, look how that turned out.<eos> Well, it's a long way to fall.<eos> Ow. Why did you do that?
Do you think I'm a criminal?<eos> What you're doing is very illegal.<eos> What's illegal?<eos> Talking to people about options?<eos> About Switzerland?<eos> About death?<eos> If that's illegal, arrest me.<eos> If you think I'm a criminal, arrest me.<eos> You don't get to play god, Mary.<eos> None of us do.
I really think we need to help charlie.<eos> Sid, would you get dr. Mary harris of 228 maple drive. What she came here for tonight?<eos> Smile.<eos> You sound like your mom.<eos> I told her I took her drugs from the shed, And she said she wouldn't tell anyone. If I cleaned up my act.<eos> Wait. She knew about it?<eos> I, troy dixon, choose to take my life.<eos> I think you might know my husband, troy dixon.<eos> You don't get to play god, mary.<eos> None of us do.
What are you, a cop?<eos> Ben, Nicole.<eos> Nicole, Ben.<eos> My sister.<eos> My... stalker.<eos> Yep, he's a cop.<eos> Mary, Mary.<eos> What have you gotten yourself into?<eos> You realize you're trespassing, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Big shot plastic surgeon, lost your license because you were operating while you were high.<eos> I mean...<eos> It's hilarious, I mean, that's... That's pretty funny, right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - You make a living putting double-D's in 20-year-olds, and you can't even get that right.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> But here's the thing.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Mary, I believe she wants to help people.<eos> I do, I do, but you?
I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> Well, I mean, yeah.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Maybe there's something wrong with all of us.<eos> Am I crazy like Mom?<eos> No.<eos> You are nothing like her.<eos> What the hell, Nicole?<eos> I was just seeing if you still had the will to live.<eos> You do.
Yes.<eos> Annie, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to get you involved, but I've got it all under control, I promise.<eos> You promised when we started this that everything was going to be fine.<eos> It is so not fine.<eos> You are being followed by the police, and now you're helping somebody escape police custody.<eos> I don't even know what this has become.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - I didn't have a choice.<eos> Well, I do.
- I have money today for real.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Have fun.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you bailing on me?<eos> - Because you're a psychopath.<eos> - Jess.<eos> Jess, I need you.<eos> I love you.<eos> No, you don't.
You know, like, I could have tests and stuff.<eos> Do you have a test today?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, then, come on.<eos> Come in!<eos> Christ.<eos> Did I order you?<eos> No.<eos> Mary did.
What do you got?<eos> Car service receipt.<eos> Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.<eos> Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.<eos> One last hurrah.<eos> I know that look.<eos> He went to meet Mary.<eos> All right, let's go check out the Larimar.<eos> I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it.<eos> Okay, well, you did at one point.
Shit.<eos> So you're saying Mary had... nothing to do with this.<eos> That's right.<eos> The truth is, I couldn't pay my drug debt because of the whole lost license ordeal.<eos> Grady knew about my work with the terminally ill.<eos> He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid.<eos> Go to Grady's house.<eos> You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital.<eos> You like scotch?<eos> I do.
We should probably...<eos> Yes. Michael?<eos> Yes.<eos> You came.<eos> Of course I came.<eos> The fucking best man has to.<eos> If any man or woman knows just cause or impediment why these two should not be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.<eos> Do you, Michael Sadler Berryman, take Flora Agnes Talbot to be your wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you, Flora Agnes...
I don't want a divorce.<eos> Please, Michael!<eos> It wouldn't be fair to Robert.<eos> But I... I... I don't want to make you wretched.<eos> I never want details.<eos> You must never get caught.<eos> We will never speak of it.<eos> But, darling, I...<eos> Please, don't you love me at all?<eos> Of course I do.
On the back.<eos> I do hope this is all right. She always over-seasons.<eos> You're looking a bit flushed.<eos> It's, er, it's London.<eos> Hm. You're like me. I hate crowds.<eos> Am I like you?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Dinner with Claudie next week, before her twins arrive.<eos> Well, she'll make a better mother than I ever did.<eos> You did all right with me.
I don't want any trouble.<eos> Let's just take this down a notch, before...<eos> Before what?<eos> You think just 'cause you're a cop you ain't got to watch where you're going?<eos> Hey.<eos> What? You got something for me, cop?<eos> Over there!<eos> I don't see him.<eos> I thought you said he went this way.<eos> He did.
So, as the man in charge of the response to the Thorpe attack, you could make sure the city chose to buy your filters, making you very rich.<eos> Is this about me failing to reveal a conflict of interests, or are you accusing me of orchestrating the attack?<eos> You tell us.<eos> If it's the first one... guilty as charged.<eos> And I'll pay whatever penalty I'm due.<eos> But the other one, that's, that's a fairy tale.<eos> Are you saying that I hired Raymond Thorpe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> Actually, you do.
God damn it!<eos> - Where's Quentin?<eos> - What?<eos> Shit.<eos> Julia's not here either.<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard? - No, you do.<eos> I do what?
What did he say about Shades?<eos> Something like he knew someone who was obsessed with them?<eos> I do know-- or I suppose I knew someone who was interested in Shades-- was.<eos> Ah, it's rather confusing.<eos> Confusing why?<eos> Because you know her too.<eos> It's Alice.<eos> Honestly, I don't think that she knew anything about Shades.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> That Alice didn't.
[sighs] I'm not going mad.<eos> Well... no.<eos> You're not.<eos> It was a fairy, okay?<eos> Look, the day The Wellspring failed, I made a deal to save Eliot's life.<eos> You did, too.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You agreed to do whatever it took to save him.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> Well, you did.
weed, but I mean... if you buy a whistle, I'll... I'll throw in some of the sticky icky, huh?<eos> I'll take two, brav.<eos> - Oh. - Tell your friends we are in business over here. Give us a call, okay?<eos> And you have a nice one.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, we're doing this?<eos> And that's two whistles sold.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I hate this. This thing is really stupid.<eos> You just sold two?<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't like this kind of stuff.<eos> Oh, you don't like this?<eos> What about this? Ah! Ah!<eos> You getting chubby now, huh? Ahh!<eos> You're getting real chubby down there now, huh? Ahh! I'm the dom here.<eos> Don't forget it.<eos> ♪ ♪ Okay.<eos> Adam.<eos> Alice has something that she wants to say to you, Don't you, honey?<eos> - Yes, I do.
They don't ask questions on a college tour, right?<eos> Luke and I, Gloria, and Manny are going on a college tour!<eos> Safety school for Manny, long shot for Luke, which hasn't been great for his self-esteem.<eos> Luckily, as a former cheerleader, I haven't lost my gift for lifting spirits.<eos> Though I can no longer make an N with my body.<eos> This is a great workout.<eos> No!<eos> Sorry, sorry!<eos> Guys, come look!<eos> I did something very bad.
Are you into hockey?<eos> I know of hockey.<eos> Um, I've never been to a game, though, or watched one on TV.<eos> - But I've heard it's fun.<eos> - It's fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I grew up watching a bunch of sports with my dad.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do you watch any sports?<eos> I do not.
Yes, ten years.<eos> Wow.<eos> Ten years.<eos> I mean, this is what you do, right?<eos> After ten years that you are with a person, you just... you just get married.<eos> Right?<eos> How did he propose?<eos> Did he pull out all the stops?<eos> Do you know what "pull out all the stops" means?<eos> Yes, I do.
How's your head?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I heard you stopped by Med the other day to see Anna.<eos> She wouldn't see me.<eos> No.<eos> It was us that wouldn't let you see her.<eos> At the time, you represented hope for her, Kelly.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> No, no, not that.<eos> But yes, something did.
Somebody took a shot at me.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> Leave me be.<eos> And that's it?<eos> Why did you have Charlie use my gun to kill Stennis?<eos> Who said I...<eos> Duwan, I did 12 years.<eos> You owe me the truth.<eos> Now, you told me to draw Charlie outside, and give him a beatdown but you never said nothing about shooting him.<eos> No, I didn't.
That is why I have placed you in command of our armies.<eos> I trust you completely.<eos> It's why I always used you.<eos> You loved athelstan.<eos> Right?<eos> You love ragnar lothbrok.<eos> You love Judith.<eos> Right?<eos> Do you love me, father?<eos> Do you?
So we Blood Eagle Ecbert and then we move on.<eos> We raid this entire land, so that they never have a chance to assemble another army again.<eos> Why would we even want to stay here?<eos> It is what our father wanted.<eos> He didn't just want to win battles.<eos> He wanted land here.<eos> He wanted to make settlements so our people could live and they could work.<eos> And we all know what happened.<eos> Yes, but in those days he did not hold a king to ransom, nor did he have a great army.<eos> We do.
I'm here on behalf of the King.<eos> Tell me about the Church's refuge, St. Genevieve, An institution for lost souls.<eos> They take the children of whores.<eos> Such charity is misplaced.<eos> Sinners must pay their own debts.<eos> The Church has no such place.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I have authority over all France. That includes you.<eos> Do you know a priest in Paris, Father Etienne?<eos> No, I do not.
Not for me.<eos> Don't.<eos> What?<eos> The little shrinky smile thing that you do; Don't do it.<eos> I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know?<eos> Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
Gina, get your wackadoodle out of here.<eos> It's been two hours, and nothing on the last guy.<eos> He's gonna get away.<eos> Where are you, number nine?<eos> Think.<eos> If I was an escaped murderer, where would I hide?<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, I have no idea.<eos> I just thought if I gasped I could force an epiphany.<eos> And I did.
These files, they... they show a soldier who betrayed her country.<eos> A terrorist.<eos> That's not what I feel when I look at her.<eos> It's something different.<eos> Something warm.<eos> You were taught to follow her your whole life.<eos> It makes sense that you would feel this deep connection to her.<eos> But if I have these feelings toward somebody who is such... a monster... what does that make me?<eos> You could have stopped this months ago.<eos> You didn't.
You kept me from going to Washington.<eos> Why?<eos> You were supposed to be a National, but your career is with the Mets.<eos> Ellen wanted to keep me in New York.<eos> You're the face of the franchise, her star player.<eos> Why is she so invested in me?<eos> You're a Met.<eos> You have to be a Met.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I don't.
We've reached our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.<eos> Y'all get ready to watch Big Momma's House.<eos> Our in-flight entertainment today will be Under the Tuscan Sun.<eos> Ooh, I like that.<eos> I hear it's good.<eos> Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?<eos> Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.<eos> W-What do you mean, "a break"?<eos> You don't have to fly the plane?<eos> Of course I do.
I know how to fight.<eos> I believe I can learn to use that sword.<eos> I just don't want everything that comes with it.<eos> You mean your family?<eos> I'm a disgrace to them, Ezra.<eos> A traitor.<eos> But that's not true.<eos> To them it is.<eos> You don't know.<eos> No one does.
It's ankle-length and fitted.<eos> I won't bring it; it's too nice.<eos> - Well, I always keep my laptop in this bag, but this morning, it was gone.<eos> - Nine times out of ten, in a case like this, it's a stalker.<eos> Whoever jimmied the lock didn't know what they were doing.<eos> - I concur.<eos> This was a real hack job.<eos> Hi, mark Devereaux.<eos> - He plays detective Cole tracker on the show.<eos> - Yeah, he does.
He was offering 500 bucks a tracker.<eos> He said he only wanted primo cars.<eos> Well, the tracker on that Maserati's still hot.<eos> Whoever's monitoring those things is probably close by.<eos> All right, this surveillance just turned into a decoy sting.<eos> Get up.<eos> You're gonna call Mike and tell him you got a primo.<eos> My bad.<eos> I didn't know that you had feelings like that for Severide when you guys dated.<eos> I didn't.
That's what we're trying to prove.<eos> Can't you release him and then continue to investigate?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> It'll look like favoritism.<eos> You know what, Hank?<eos> It feels like I'm being stiff-armed here.<eos> You and me got history. Is that what it is?<eos> I thought we'd buried all of that.<eos> So did I.
Sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to cancel my room.<eos> I hope to make it there sometime in the future, too.<eos> _<eos> That's right.<eos> A wonderful day... all planned.<eos> The only thing off the cuff is this speech, and, you know, it's still, you know, kind of... I think... very great.<eos> Well, congratulations, Ray.<eos> You win.<eos> We all do.
I tried and failed to fit in two other places before I didn't fit in here.<eos> You all suck, and I approve this message.<eos> Good morning, JJ.<eos> I just paid the hotel bill.<eos> We are still up 40 bucks, and all from selling stuff that nobody is gonna miss.<eos> High five.<eos> Ugh! What happened to the flat iron?<eos> ! Who cares?<eos> Your mom doesn't use it.<eos> No, she doesn't!
Yeah, I'm on my way.<eos> But I haven't told you what I need, and you don't know where we are.<eos> I'm exiting the school!<eos> You're not in the school, correct?<eos> - I've missed this.<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> He'll come.<eos> Oh, the things some people will do to take down a vacation.<eos> I made it.<eos> You did.
- We've been through this...<eos> Make me a zombie.<eos> We've all been through a lot.<eos> We've lost a lot of good men.<eos> Twelve.<eos> We lost 12.<eos> You need to know what becoming a zombie now means.<eos> - I think I do.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> You don't.
One good blast from the Gargantua here and your army would be on ice forever.<eos> Trapped in an eternal winter like... like Frozen!<eos> It's a movie.<eos> You would destroy yourself at the same time!<eos> That's a price worth paying, isn't it?<eos> It's a simple choice, Iraxxa, the oldest one in the book.<eos> We must live together.<eos> Or die together.<eos> You dare to touch me?<eos> Yes, my dear. I do.
Why do you want to do this?<eos> She's my friend.<eos> She's my oldest friend in the universe.<eos> You've got lots of friends.<eos> Better ones.<eos> What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Got it.<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> In my vision, I was getting hanged.<eos> Getting hanged?<eos> - Not hanging yourself?<eos> - Yep.<eos> So weckler didn't commit suicide.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> - Did you see who did it?<eos> - She never does.
Long way to go to hire a couple of detectives, don't you think?<eos> Sit.<eos> I've been trying to get you to help me for years.<eos> Well, you sure as hell can't ignore me now.<eos> You're gonna figure out what happened to Connor.<eos> Even if you found the person who assaulted your son, that's all we can charge him with... assault, not murder.<eos> Well, he could go to jail for years.<eos> If he's got priors, it could be decades.<eos> You don't know what will happen when you find him.<eos> Nobody does.
We'll be fine.<eos> One more thing.<eos> What?<eos> My son was attacked exactly five years ago today.<eos> Which means the statute of limitations on his assault runs out at midnight.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> Today is the last day anyone can help Connor.<eos> It's five after 8:00.<eos> You got about 16 hours to find the man who attacked my son.<eos> And if you don't...
Mr. Canales, you're a lawyer.<eos> You know very well that love is often the motive for the most gruesome of crimes.<eos> It is, but I was on vacation in Aruba when it happened.<eos> Check my credit card statements.<eos> I have photos, too.<eos> The man in the diner, you said he'd give you till midnight, right?<eos> I'll answer your questions all day long, but I'm telling you right now I'm not your guy.<eos> All right, well, what about your husband?<eos> We cracked the code you two used.<eos> Maybe he did, too.
Restricted. I just wanted him to be happy, but I can't be there every single second.<eos> Then why'd you shut out Fran?<eos> Maybe I was afraid he would like her more than me.<eos> It's me.<eos> Look, I still don't know what time I'm gonna be home.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll let you know as soon as I can, okay?<eos> Thanks, honey.<eos> - Did you find something?<eos> - Uh, we did on the security footage.
_ Yes, a Hispanic woman with a young child.<eos> - I got the alert on my phone.<eos> - This one?<eos> That's her. Checked in last night.<eos> Kid was asleep in her arms.<eos> Okay, and what about the boy? Is this him?<eos> Yeah, looks like him.<eos> Car's gone.<eos> You didn't say she checked out.<eos> She didn't.
Six months?<eos> Right, and you think I'm gonna train her?<eos> Well, yes, it would be easier if you did.<eos> But still, I think we can cobble together a training regimen that'll get the job done.<eos> You son of a bitch. Oh.<eos> What did you think would happen?<eos> That you'd get on your proud, little soapbox, make your speech, and they'd just, what, slink away into the darkness?<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> You asked me to pick a side.<eos> Well, I did.
Look at you, camped outside of my house, doing this, trying to scare me a little.<eos> You know, if I think about it, I'd say that you and I, we're not that different.<eos> Well, you know, there is one thing that's different.<eos> I ain't ever killed a cop.<eos> Right?<eos> There's a difference.<eos> Well... not yet, anyway.<eos> You really thought it was a good idea to represent him... my former partner, current captain.<eos> Good morning, honey.<eos> And yes, I did.
The L.A. Sheriff's Boy's Home.<eos> Assault weapons for a charity?<eos> Right, except for it wasn't an official department charity, it was a personal charity, founded by your boy.<eos> Luke Barton.<eos> Let me guess, a large contribution was made to this charity right before Wade Davies' release?<eos> More proof that Davies hired Barton to bust him out of custody.<eos> All right, let's tell Avery.<eos> Okay, now we get a warrant.<eos> We make a legitimate arrest.<eos> We do this by the book.
He got to the final of the crossword competition six years ago.<eos> And he won!<eos> He beat you fair and square!<eos> But you challenged him on a word. Do you remember?<eos> "Auteur" saying the first U looked more like a V.<eos> And the committee found in your favour.<eos> The old boys' network looking after their own.<eos> And Simon was disqualified.<eos> Do you know what he did?<eos> Do you, you pathetic old man?
Well, why did you fit yours with a petrol-powered range extender?<eos> Well, that's just a little generator that keeps the battery topped up if I need it.<eos> What you're saying is you can't rely on new technology.<eos> And your seats, they're made from the contents of a Hoover bag.<eos> Oh, says the man...<eos> Says the man whose seats are made from Jackie Stewart's old trousers, which they are.<eos> - It's- -<eos> - Whatever!<eos> The fact is, in the office, we decided we'd had enough of them bickering and told them to go out and do a proper road test.<eos> So we did.
Oh, yes! Yes!<eos> I've connected the steering wheel to my feet.<eos> This is a whole new feeling.<eos> Ha-ha, JÃ©rÃ´me, you French... drift-and-ski-instructing dude, you.<eos> He'll be impressed with this.<eos> And he was, so we immediately progressed to the next level.<eos> Just before we start, JÃ©rÃ´me, are you going to make this look really annoyingly easy?<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> OK.<eos> He did.
- No, Dad.<eos> - And I j... I just...<eos> Once you're on the other side of this... I hope we can...<eos> We can.<eos> We will.<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You risk everything for your country, and I hope I can live up to your example.<eos> Is Harry gone?<eos> I don't know, and I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Between me and Fran!<eos> Connie, I can't get into that now.<eos> The future's precarious enough!<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What's got into him?<eos> Dunno, maybe he got the E.<eos> He has to sack one of us. What?<eos> !<eos> How do you know?<eos> - I just do!
Which is when we heard the scream and you went to investigate.<eos> At which point, everyone in the hotel, apart from Ernestine, was downstairs.<eos> All the guests were with you in the dining room and all the staff were here in the hallway.<eos> Then, I suppose one of them was already up there waiting for him.<eos> Or they snuck upstairs after the... victim went into his room, killed him, and then snuck back down again before the body was discovered.<eos> Yeah, but that's the thing, you see.<eos> There's no other way up to his room apart from this staircase.<eos> And I had full view from our table in the dining room the entire ten minutes.<eos> I would've noticed anyone going up and coming back down again.<eos> - And I didn't.
I-I didn't get much sleep last night, Dwayne.<eos> Me and Rosey had our first row.<eos> Wait.<eos> Your first row?<eos> - How long have you two been together now?<eos> Six months, isn't it?<eos> Yes, and three days.<eos> And in all that time, you've never had one argument?<eos> I-I guess we just, you know, sort of, get on.<eos> Or rather, we did.
Ah... I guess so.<eos> Hey. What's the problem?<eos> Look, I just don't want it to feel like I'm saying sorry to... to have an easy life, you know?<eos> Then, when you say it, mean it.<eos> And the next time you and Rosey have a row, maybe she'll be the one to apologise.<eos> It's give and take.<eos> Isn't that what they say about a good marriage? Huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're right.<eos> They do.
- [bleep] Janet. - Would you forgive me?<eos> Of course.<eos> But, hey, you have to admit, I knocked you on your ass.<eos> Yeah, emotionally, you knocked me on my ass.<eos> - Right. - Hell yeah.<eos> [laughs] Oh! Okay!<eos> Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! Not really.<eos> He didn't really knock him on his ass.<eos> - Felt good. [laughs]<eos> - Kinda. Emotionally, he did.
Worth the risk.<eos> If the nazis get their hands. On that much oil, the war's over.<eos> How did the americans respond?<eos> Butler wants our intel.<eos> On marigold asap.<eos> Course he does.<eos> He wants to know how we got eyes and ears into poland.<eos> So you told him all he has to do is turn.<eos> A high-ranking ss officer?<eos> I did not.
Then why did you say it then?<eos> Well, I'm sorry I did.<eos> I don't like using a forger I haven't personally vetted,<eos> Resistance or not.<eos> Well, we're running low.<eos> On options.<eos> You're telling me faber. Can't pull a few strings to get us papers?<eos> What use is he then?<eos> You don't trust faber?<eos> Course, I bloody don't.
And, um... what about the woman?<eos> And the hotel room?<eos> Was that his doing?<eos> Was there anyone that-that had it out for your husband, or had a grudge against him, anything like that?<eos> Um, a couple of months ago somebody threw a brick through our window in the middle of the night.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's a start.<eos> Do you know who?<eos> No.<eos> But-but Dale did.
I'm gonna go put an end to this.<eos> Roger, don't.<eos> Don't interfere.<eos> If we push, RJ will push back.<eos> So what do we do, just sit back while his life - goes down the drain?<eos> - No, it's a phase.<eos> RJ will turn around.<eos> I mean, when he finds out how much a ticket to New Zealand costs.<eos> You love her?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Hey, if you wake up in a couple hours, and you think about driving home, do me a favor, don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> I cheated on my wife.<eos> What?<eos> Last night.<eos> I drank too much, and, um...<eos> I didn't intentionally do it, but I cheated on her.<eos> Want talk about it?<eos> We just did.
All right!<eos> All right.<eos> Alistair thought his, his fancy education made him a genius -- always making "improvements" to the process, never telling anyone.<eos> After the fire I found out he'd altered the system.<eos> A pipe cracked, Robert tried to fix it, but, yes, the fire was Alistair's fault.<eos> I agreed not to tell anyone if he supported me to take over as General Manager.<eos> Are you satisfied?<eos> I brought Alistair down a peg or two those last few months.<eos> He hated it, but I won.<eos> And I didn't do anything criminal.
Jerome offered to bail me out.<eos> He was a good friend.<eos> Here, we found this e-mail in Jerome's draft inbox.<eos> It's addressed to you.<eos> Would you be so good to read it?<eos> - What's all that about then?<eos> - I really don't know.<eos> Your garage carries out assessments of vehicles involved in crashes on Saint Marie.<eos> You looked at Torey Martin's car after the accident.<eos> - Yes, yes, we did.
Archer hid the gun in our engine?<eos> Exactly -- and then ripped his overalls - when he came to collect it later that day.<eos> - Man alive!<eos> - That takes a big pair of...<eos> - Thank you, Dwayne.<eos> Sir, the insurance company confirm they looked at Torey's car.<eos> - And? - It's as Archer said. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever.<eos> All the evidence points to Archer blackmailing Jerome Martin.<eos> - We just don't know what he was blackmailing him over.<eos> - No, we don't.
- I have orders from Miranda, and you're not going to like them.<eos> Ooh, hot.<eos> I didn't know you were into this sort of thing.<eos> Let's be honest, I'm not surprised.<eos> I want my phone back, Harry.<eos> But you've already got one.<eos> I've seen you 'gram all those inspirational quotes with it.<eos> You're not leaving.<eos> This ends now.<eos> What does?
There are certain lines you just don't cross.<eos> Come on, Josh. What would you do?<eos> You're exactly like me.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> But I would...<eos> I would listen to my lawyer, who is telling you that nothing good will come out of confronting Rutger.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> To... get some fresh air.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
Sorry, boss, there's something I need to attend to.<eos> Looks like new guy has diarrhea.<eos> Not so attractive now, huh, Jackie?<eos> Nah, I'm still in.<eos> What's this?<eos> Coming out of the sky, a man in a golden helmet is lifting the bus to safety.<eos> Hey, now, we all just saw Alex run out of here, and then...<eos> - you don't think...<eos> - About him naked?<eos> Yes, I do.
The truth is a little bird.<eos> It's cooped up in a cage.<eos> It's either open that door, set it free, let it fly out on the wings of... feathers...<eos> I don't... It's a bird, so it...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... look, it's 1,000 bucks.<eos> Grasp the furniture.<eos> Teddy ratted you out.<eos> What?<eos> He did?
My emergency contact?<eos> Who did I put down for my...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Jackie!<eos> I am so flattered and also so glad you're okay.<eos> Calm down, I had to put somebody down, and you're kind of sort of reliable and capable in a middle school hall monitor kind of way.<eos> Oh, locker break-ins dropped 24% on my watch.<eos> I have no doubt they did.<eos> Look, I know I overstepped my bounds...<eos> Yeah, you did.
- What's wrong with your kidneys?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Stop fussing.<eos> Go.<eos> Should I be concerned?<eos> You may be dying, but I am here to make sure it's not fatal.<eos> Do you remember who I am?<eos> John.<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> But no one else does.
Cosmetics.<eos> Why would Neolution be expanding into cosmetics?<eos> Well, because it's a $700 billion industry, for one.<eos> - More research dollars than cancer.<eos> - Piss off.<eos> Serious.<eos> Well, it's got to be connected to LIN28A.<eos> Did Krystal just fall arse backwards into something big again?<eos> I do not know how the girl does it.<eos> Seriously, you don't?
- I know he's at the door.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> This is how you're gonna play this, Krystal.<eos> You're gonna go out there...<eos> Krystal, get out.<eos> Now.<eos> What's this?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - You stole this from me.<eos> Brie did.
We're fixing it.<eos> Yeah... that's what they're afraid of.<eos> The statement's about the FBI.<eos> Everybody trusts the FBI.<eos> Hey, who's Lisa Williams?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, somebody from the Herald called.<eos> They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
If he loses, I still lose.<eos> He cannot be on the outside looking in.<eos> He'll win.<eos> - You actually believe that?<eos> - Sure... why not?<eos> It was a wager.<eos> The potential gains made it necessary.<eos> It was a complete waste of my time.<eos> If you don't start turning things around, you're going to be out on your fucking ass. You understand?<eos> I do.
Excuse me.<eos> - She doesn't like me.<eos> - She will.<eos> Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.<eos> You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood, - even if you win in the House?<eos> - I'm working on that.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> He needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> So does the country.
Even if Conway took the presidency, we would've had a foothold with you.<eos> We could've sabotaged, just like we did with the Walkers.<eos> - The Conways are not the Walkers.<eos> - It wasn't your decision to make.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> You're only acting.<eos> I agreed with Usher because he will sacrifice everything to get Brockhart into office, which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.<eos> I thought you saw what I saw.<eos> I did. I do.
Moretti talked about it as, uh, the last day of her life before she corrected herself.<eos> Spent every spare second with the kids. They were building a go-kart. They were pretty close to done.<eos> -Okay. -I got more.<eos> -No, I got it.<eos> -What were you looking for?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -What?<eos> You wanna tell me what happened in the White House today?<eos> No, I don't.
- Doug, it's Claire.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> Francis and I were wondering if you could come up to the residence tomorrow evening.<eos> For dinner.<eos> It'll give us a chance to take a breath with all that's been happening.<eos> Hello?<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Come on, you must know by now.<eos> - No, I don't.
Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss. I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.<eos> You don't know what I'm going to do next.<eos> Isn't that it?<eos> Isn't that what really bothers you?<eos> Don't think I haven't been watching you from the moment you stepped on board.<eos> You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.<eos> The information about Macallan is still out there and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.<eos> You've been sabotaging me from the moment you stepped into my house.<eos> You don't care for me very much, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
We made love this morning.<eos> With all the bells and whistles.<eos> And, Robert?<eos> He's a little under the weather.<eos> So, um, when do you head off to your little... bunkery place?<eos> We have to wait a little bit.<eos> They make you take a physical before you enter, so...<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
The fact is, this is now a murder inquiry and we understand you saw Tom Lewis the night he died.<eos> Yeah, he was telling us about his boat.<eos> - Ah! After a spot of fishing, were you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can't say I blame you, I would've done the same myself if I was out in the Caribbean.<eos> It was me and Dominic that were talking to him, - but it was, what... a few minutes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I asked him if we could use his boat the next day for a fishing trip for a party of five, he said yes and to meet him at the harbour at two o'clock the following day.<eos> And did you see him again after this conversation?<eos> No, no, we didn't.
There's something wrong.<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where is he?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Emma.<eos> No.<eos> - Emma.<eos> - Dad.<eos> You woke us up.<eos> How?<eos> It was easy.<eos> We just all shared a tiny bit of your curse.<eos> I take it Emma hasn't told you my secret.<eos> Oh, she did.
You think I don't know?<eos> You have his heart.<eos> You were always such a clever boy.<eos> How did you figure it out?<eos> You ordered him to destroy the Pixie flowers.<eos> It seems he kept one alive.<eos> A true believer wouldn't do that, now, would he?<eos> That's not possible.<eos> He wouldn't disobey me like that.<eos> And yet he did.
His buddies tipped me 50 bucks to slip him my thong. And that's all?<eos> Trevor wanted to hang out after I got off of work, so I took him to a fight club.<eos> The one in Humboldt Park on Le Moyne?<eos> That's right.<eos> I thought he just wanted to watch, but once we got there, he said he wanted to fight, so they set up a match for him.<eos> He kicked some dude's ass.<eos> I wasn't planning to hook up with him, but after he took his shirt off and dominated in the ring, I was like, "Come to mama."<eos> Seriously?<eos> You should've seen him.<eos> I did.
I got to say I did not see that coming.<eos> Chalk one up for the underdogs.<eos> Good news. The writ was denied.<eos> The video is in.<eos> Except you're not going to use it.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Why?<eos> Personal experience has taught me military secrets should stay secret.<eos> With all due respect, just because you served in Vietnam doesn't give you a monopoly on national security protocol.<eos> In my office, it does.
There's never a good reason to veil the truth.<eos> Then why not open your case files to every defense lawyer you face?<eos> I'll tell you why not: because it's war.<eos> You do not give aid and comfort to the enemy, unless you're a misguided fool like Edward Snowden.<eos> I do not accept your analogy.<eos> Then maybe you can accept this: if you value your rights and your freedoms, sometimes you have to ask men and women to go to far-away battlefields to die for them.<eos> And if you ask your fellow Americans to risk their lives for your liberties, then you don't get to second-guess it all after the fact.<eos> You realize this would probably cost us our case.<eos> I don't give a damn.<eos> I do.
My son joined up because he felt there was a cause more important than his own life.<eos> Those ideals... He came to realize they weren't all they were cracked up to be.<eos> That's not how I see it.<eos> He was writing a book that defied his chain of command.<eos> Every soldier needs a way to let go of the weight he carries.<eos> Trevor found his way.<eos> Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.<eos> Do you even want to know what it was gonna say?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
So, you're Dad's unofficial taxi?<eos> You know, whenever Dad needs to get home from the pub.<eos> - What'll I get you?<eos> - Lemonade, please.<eos> Not seen him smile like this for a while.<eos> Yes, he told us about your mum.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Bet he didn't tell you it was only a month ago.<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
How sure are we this is our guy?<eos> Mrs. Durning said that's who she saw when she left the house right before her husband's heart attack.<eos> She also remembered he was carrying a briefcase.<eos> Good bet it contained a hypodermic needle and whatever tools he needed to break into the Durning home.<eos> Local PD are circulating the sketch, but we're gonna take it over to the morgue in Paramus personally, see if anyone there saw this guy make contact with the M.E. who missed the murder.<eos> I've been trying to get a warrant for Kotite's phone records.<eos> I'm hoping we can track this guy down from the call that Kotite must've made after you goosed him at his club yesterday.<eos> A warrant would be worthwhile, but I can guarantee you that he did not call his assassin after I left.<eos> Obviously, he told the guy to go down to the cemetery to clean his mess up.<eos> He did.
I realized I'd seen him as well.<eos> Drew that sketch myself.<eos> Hello?<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> It's only half past 8:00 here.<eos> I told you, I'm not sure when I'll be back.<eos> This will take as long as it takes.<eos> Margaret, stop!<eos> You got my text.<eos> Yes, I did.
My boss asked me to come down here and put a lid on it, personally.<eos> Your boss asked you to come down and defend a child abuser.<eos> Come on, Danny, you think I'm happy about it?<eos> You think I'm not as mad as you are that we have to let this guy go?<eos> D.A.'s office cannot prosecute a diplomat.<eos> You want I should show you the pictures of what he did to his boy?<eos> You could just say that you forgot that you have an appointment.<eos> At 7:00 on a Thursday?<eos> You just said you don't want to go.<eos> I don't.
This case is not in your jurisdiction, Commissioner.<eos> This city is my jurisdiction.<eos> I know that you were behind the push to get Child Services involved.<eos> To rescue a little boy.<eos> To interfere in diplomatic protocol.<eos> For the sake of that boy.<eos> Cut the crap!<eos> It's not crap, Ms. Sanders.<eos> You remanded Malik into foster care?<eos> No, our system did.
No.<eos> Because if I had a penis, it would be all right that I took out two armed robbers.<eos> No. No, no. It wouldn't be all right.<eos> It would be applauded. And I would be getting phone calls and texts from Josh, looking to hook up, because he would be so turned on that I was so heroic and brave and awesome.<eos> But I don't have a penis, so when I take out two armed perps, it's an assault on my date's manhood.<eos> If it's any consolation, I think that what you did was brave and heroic and awesome.<eos> Yeah. Because you're my partner.<eos> You're not my boyfriend.<eos> But if you were my boyfriend, you would feel emasculated, because chicks, we're not supposed to be the heroes, we're supposed to be the damsels in distress, waiting to be rescued by guys like you,<eos> not the ones doing the rescuing.
You might try and run off again.<eos> We're not there yet, but we will be.<eos> I know we will.<eos> It's gonna happen.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who put you in there?<eos> Is this a sick joke?<eos> You did!
I turned it down.<eos> He's here.<eos> All clear.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Wrong door, sir.<eos> You're the ugliest chambermaid I've ever seen.<eos> Myron, my sincere condolences.<eos> - Who died?<eos> - You did.
I just want you to know, that I know.<eos> You know what, Riggs?<eos> That you went to go see Cahill as a patient, and I think that's great, and I just want you to feel free to tell me anything.<eos> She told you that?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> You know.<eos> She thought that it'd be healthy for, you know, for you, for us, if I know all of your... you know.<eos> Nope.<eos> She didn't tell you squat.<eos> No, she didn't.
- She didn't say.<eos> - No.<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - Hard to tell.<eos> You know Cahill.<eos> I told her to take some time off, but...<eos> Too many crazies to fix?<eos> Now, I just wanted to point out a first in your partnership.<eos> You didn't take the shot... but he did.<eos> Yes, he did.
- No.<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - Hard to tell.<eos> You know Cahill.<eos> I told her to take some time off, but...<eos> Too many crazies to fix?<eos> Now, I just wanted to point out a first in your partnership.<eos> You didn't take the shot... but he did.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Yes, he did.
You lock the door, you stay put till I give the all clear.<eos> That thing is in the house.<eos> Be quiet, Ira, close the drapes.<eos> - Chickens coming to roost.<eos> - These are not my chickens.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Listen to her, Susan.<eos> How are you going to exploit Kira's mutation?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> - No, no, I don't.
Why?<eos> I expect he still has the authorities there in his pocket.<eos> The front entrance is a zoo.<eos> No way Helena's in there.<eos> Enger's driving past the front entrance.<eos> - They've stopped to the East.<eos> - They're taking her to the Old Wing.<eos> That's where we used to work.<eos> I thought they closed down the Old Wing.<eos> We did.
Please.<eos> Mark is sick.<eos> - Coady said she could help, but...<eos> - Coady?<eos> !<eos> - We are family!<eos> - I know.<eos> I knew it when I saw you, which is why I told him I couldn't find you.<eos> - Didn't tell them where you are.<eos> - You didn't?
You keep putting yourself in more and more danger every year.<eos> Every day.<eos> And people are dying all around you.<eos> I don't know how to respond to that.<eos> I'm not going to read this.<eos> - This is nonsense.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Because my source was quite certain that Reddington has donated millions to your foundation.<eos> - You have no proof.<eos> - But we do.
How do you work for 20 years in a place and not make a single friend?<eos> Anyone have an Axe to grind with the guy?<eos> About what?<eos> Taking someone's lunch out of the break room fridge?<eos> Look, he kept to himself.<eos> Nobody here would bother to waste a word on the guy, let alone a bullet.<eos> It was a knife.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You asked to see me, Your Majesty?<eos> I most certainly did.
He was murdered.<eos> Who works in mysterious ways.<eos> Let me save you a lot of time and trouble.<eos> Lee Bukowski was... less than human.<eos> He was a savage who took the lives of the most important people in my life, with reckless abandon and never showed an ounce of remorse.<eos> I'm not sorry he's dead.<eos> But I'm not happy, either.<eos> More importantly, I didn't kill him.<eos> Not sure anyone would blame you if you did.<eos> I didn't.
Sounds about right.<eos> Where are you?<eos> On the shop floor.<eos> Is that where you want to be?<eos> Not sure I follow.<eos> Well, you've got the education, you certainly have the talent.<eos> You've got the drive to go above and beyond, and... I'm still on the shop floor making barstools.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You see what I'm getting at?<eos> I do.
Jack or Sean, say grace now, okay?<eos> Sean, just say it.<eos> Just, yeah.<eos> Why do I have to do everything no one else wants to do?<eos> Because you're low man on the totem pole, that's why.<eos> Now let's go, come on.<eos> I cannot wait until you get married - and have a kid. - Whoa!<eos> Do you know something I don't know?<eos> That you're insane?<eos> Please, somebody just do it.
For most of us, there is no Richard Gere.<eos> It's a fantasy.<eos> Libena and the boy seemed to be in love, and he offered to pay off her debt, so I gave them their chance at the fairy tale.<eos> And then what?<eos> You figured if Tendu was able to identify you and the agency's owners, other people could, too?<eos> You burned down your office to cover your tracks?<eos> $100,000 is more than enough to replace some old computers and open a new office.<eos> Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?<eos> He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.
Come to think of it, I'm gonna double-check our building distance as well.<eos> - I see you filming, Linetti.<eos> - What's in the yogurt?<eos> - Normal stuff. Nothing you'd use to make a sidewalk with.<eos> - Attention squad, I just got word from Peralta and Boyle.<eos> - Did they make their bust?<eos> - They save the precinct? - No, they decided to try to bring in a bigger fish.<eos> They're not gonna make the hearing.<eos> - So Jake's doing the right thing instead of the selfish thing?<eos> You did this to him.
Look. I don't know who you people think I am.<eos> You're Jimmy Capone, born James Vincenzo Capone.<eos> My name's Richard Hart.<eos> You left Brooklyn when you were 16 and changed your name for a fresh start, and wound up becoming a Prohibition Agent.<eos> And you haven't seen your family or your brother ever since you left.<eos> But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
- Of course.<eos> - She's my best baby. - Blech.<eos> But also, you're the best,<eos> Okay?<eos> The bestest.<eos> I just want her to remember that.<eos> How about I remind her, huh?<eos> Tonight.<eos> Might help if you returned my lipstick, though.<eos> I did.
Such as?<eos> Creating one of the most powerful spells ever to exist, one that will allow me to travel back in time.<eos> And where exactly do you plan on going with this time-travel spell?<eos> Back to the beginning, to when my mother gave me up, to show her I'm more powerful than my sister, that I'm the one she should have kept.<eos> Seems like you're going to an awful lot of trouble to be with someone who didn't want you to begin with. Careful.<eos> The last person to speak so freely to me is now peeling bananas with their feet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you wouldn't be so upset unless what I was saying was true.<eos> Do you have a better idea of how I can get what I want?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
If you leave me here to rust, you might walk away from here with your power, but you'll be alone a very long time.<eos> That's a risk I'll just have to take.<eos> Sorry, stanum.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Magic is what made me special.<eos> And I won't give it up. Zelena.<eos> Zelena.<eos> Enjoy life as a statue.<eos> Maybe Dorothy will come back and save you.<eos> She did what?
The black fairy's back to square one.<eos> We should call mother superior. She can get the dwarfs to start mining this stuff.<eos> It could come in handy.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> She was the first person I called to locate that wand fragment.<eos> I left a dozen messages, but I haven't heard back.<eos> Gold.<eos> Gold's got her in the back of his shop.<eos> I-I'm not not proud of what I did, but I did what I thought was best for myself.<eos> We both did.
- Excuse me, sir. Do you have a camera?<eos> Can you please document this excessive use of force?<eos> Excessive, and I should let you know.<eos> I am close friends with Harvey Levin of TMZ!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, Leo.<eos> - Listen, listen, listen.<eos> - Okay.<eos> A few people died today down at that shop.<eos> Don't you want to help us know why?<eos> Of course I do.
Enjoy your lunch.<eos> I hope it's okay that I'm sitting with you.<eos> There aren't too many people here who like to talk.<eos> Well, don't get used to it.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, I'm not... I'm not gonna be here much longer 'cause I'm putting in my notice next shift.<eos> No.<eos> No, you... you can't let him win.<eos> - Well, he did.
Oh, and, Peter...<eos> Enormous tragedies make career cases.<eos> You win this one, it could make your career.<eos> But you lose, it could destroy mine.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I loved Lexi.<eos> We all did.
Right.<eos> You don't have kids, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I remember when I could hold Diego in the palm of my hand.<eos> I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession...<eos> I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
Forest didn't object to the document or my question to Anders.<eos> He didn't cross Anders about his sources.<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe Anders has something on him.<eos> It's a little late for Forest's book.<eos> Read the title of chapter three.<eos> "Trials: It's All A Con."<eos> And I think I'm his mark.<eos> I never thought Dylan could do something like this.<eos> But you do now?
I was hoping to help Jesse get out.<eos> Sad I couldn't.<eos> So, what are you, like, his, his manager?<eos> No, I was more like an adviser, see.<eos> 'Cause I know what it's like to have everyone want a piece of you at that age.<eos> So I just try to provide a little guidance.<eos> Golden Glove.<eos> That's right.<eos> Rog, you know who we're talking to here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Call Roger Murtaugh.<eos> Calling Roger Murtaugh on cell.<eos> Hey, what's up, Mike?<eos> Hey, I got a proposition for you.<eos> Come on, you know I'm married.<eos> Consider taking my job.<eos> I'm gonna retire, and I already mentioned you to the guy that makes the decisions here, so...<eos> Ho-Hold on.<eos> I know you love being a cop, Roger.<eos> I did, too.
All right.<eos> How did you guys meet?<eos> Actually, we met online.<eos> Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.<eos> Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.<eos> Oh, he looks sad again.<eos> Well, I really envy your relationship.<eos> Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.<eos> You-you know about that?<eos> Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
- No, I mean for real, full on.<eos> - I will, I do.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> I clipped Indy.<eos> You told them I'm out?<eos> I told them to eat a bag of dicks.<eos> - Yo!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> You said that shit?<eos> Yeah, I did, verbatim.
"And you will know the great evil by the crescent it bears."<eos> Evil was not born this winter.<eos> It was made.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Fiona... it's you.<eos> You are the great evil.<eos> You and your son are destined to destroy each other.<eos> Now that nap time's over, it's time for battle.<eos> You found the other half.<eos> Indeed I did.
Aye, but I'm not staying here tonight.<eos> It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> A seafaring man does not take superstitions lightly.<eos> The last thing you and I need is another stitch of bad luck.<eos> After tomorrow, there'll be no getting rid of me.<eos> - Promise?<eos> - Aye.<eos> So... did they trust you?<eos> Of course they did.
- They would be treating you as the PC's granddaughter, and everything you saw or heard would be filtered through that.<eos> It would be a theme park ride.<eos> - But Uncle Jamie...<eos> - Has sat with you at family dinners since you were in a booster seat, so he should have a pretty good idea how far he can take you.<eos> Which is how far?<eos> What do you hope to see?<eos> The real thing.<eos> The real thing can be real messy.<eos> I know that.<eos> You do and you don't.
Well, great, you were defending yourself against a made guy whose girl you were sleeping with.<eos> Now I got Stevie Angels and Lenny Sick sitting in front of my house.<eos> Really?<eos> He brought Lenny Sick?<eos> Yeah. And you and me both know why they call him that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Animal outside my house.<eos> Where I live, your sister lives, your nephews sleep.<eos> I never thought it would go this far.<eos> Well, it did.
Of course I am.<eos> What, you think they'd tell you?<eos> I spoke to Charlotte Bishop.<eos> She said it happened right after The Farm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
What, you think they'd tell you?<eos> I spoke to Charlotte Bishop.<eos> She said it happened right after The Farm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
No one is meeting you here.<eos> Oh, that's not true.<eos> You are.<eos> So, this is all just for me, huh, the Russian?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, you don't trust me.<eos> I don't trust anyone.<eos> - Well, I trust you.<eos> - No, you don't.
Keep your eyes peeled, stick close to me.<eos> And don't speak unless spoken to.<eos> Your name is Arnold Edwards.<eos> No weapon for me, I'm assuming.<eos> No.<eos> Just act like you have one.<eos> Our appointment's in an hour.<eos> You almost ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, thanks... for doing this.
Sure, or you can.<eos> No, it's fine, I know you don't like the way I drive.<eos> I don't have a problem with your driving.<eos> Are you listening to this?<eos> They deceive each other about everything.<eos> Shh.<eos> Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.<eos> He wasn't in a car, but okay.<eos> Just say you want to drive.<eos> I honestly don't.
If he is, he needs help.<eos> If there's something inside that could help us help him, you really want us to waste time getting a warrant?<eos> I can see how you couldn't tell there was a break-in.<eos> This is drywall dust.<eos> These are drips of paint. They don't match the walls.<eos> Gonna take a wild guess here and say Darren was stealing valuables from his drywall jobs.<eos> Probably fencing them, too, which is why he could afford a second home.<eos> You sure nothing's missing?<eos> I was telling the truth, I honestly don't know.<eos> I do.
We could start by visiting the shop where Cosmo bought the case.<eos> It's where Vennek found out he had it; maybe someone else did, too.<eos> Found something.<eos> Well, I don't think a trip to the guitar shop's going to be be necessary.<eos> This is part of the pick guard of a 1957 Carfax Desperado.<eos> So unless two million-dollar guitars found their way into Cosmo's orbit, we're looking at what's left of the Lady Frances.<eos> Killer was smart enough to clean up, but they missed this bit.<eos> That's blood.<eos> You don't think the guitar was the murder weapon?<eos> I do.
So, the man who threatened you--<eos> I mean, surely you considered him a suspect when Jameel died.<eos> Thought crossed my mind, but I didn't get his name.<eos> I didn't think he got ours, either.<eos> I mean, me and Jameel was in SBK, I figured what happened was because of that.<eos> A rival banger got his address and that was that.<eos> And you're quite certain you can't identify the person from Atlantic City?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> You paid for the time?<eos> Yeah, I did.
♪ Won't rest till I've skinned me a croc ♪<eos> ♪ Gonna skin him a croc! ♪<eos> ♪ Sing a yo ho, you can beg, plead, and whine ♪<eos> ♪ But yo ho, you are wasting your time ♪<eos> ♪ That croc got my hand, want to tear out his spine ♪<eos> ♪ Revenge, revenge, revenge is gonna be mine ♪<eos> ♪ Revenge, revenge, revenge is gonna be mine ♪<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Wait, you want revenge on a crocodile for taking your hand?<eos> Yeah, afraid he did more than that.
See, I could've said<eos> "in the near future," but I didn't say "in the near future,"<eos> 'cause "in the near future" is three more words than "soon."<eos> "In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four.<eos> See "in the near future" is four, "soon" is just one, four is more than one;<eos> saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say,<eos> "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
mind you, when we say "behind the flags," we don't literally mean these flags.<eos> That's just where we have dinner.<eos> Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering how fun with flags began.<eos> So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start.<eos> H-Howard. Flashback sounds.<eos> Could have played that on my harp.<eos> Just roll the clip.<eos> Sheldon: So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born.<eos> I honestly don't remember.<eos> Sheldon: Sure you do.
Yes, starting now.<eos> Bert, you're a good guy; You deserve a woman who's interested in more than just your money.<eos> She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear.<eos> Now the only one doing that is me.<eos> If you're that upset, go get her back.<eos> I tried.<eos> She's not answering my calls.<eos> Which really hurts because I bought her that phone.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> No, you didn't.
Think.<eos> A list, she wants us to make a list.<eos> You have to think.<eos> Mr and Mrs Marin?<eos> We've got something.<eos> Remain in the car, please.<eos> Sir, you will remain in the car.<eos> Joe.<eos> - Do you even know what this place is?<eos> - No, I don't.
I was thinking about your hair.<eos> Maybe there's a way we can discreetly try to get some answers, just the two of us.<eos> I might know someone who can help.<eos> I still think you're being unfair about Eugene.<eos> But, um, who is this friend of yours?<eos> His name is Varian, and he's some kind of wizard.<eos> Wow!<eos> A real wizard?<eos> Do you think he'll have one of those pointy hats, and, like, a robe and a staff and cast spells?<eos> No, I do not.
Tell them they won, they saved the day, and that Senator Baynard's gonna get his.<eos> I've watched my mother's career closely.<eos> I-I know what happens when you lie.<eos> You end up having to cover it up with another and another...<eos> Or you learn to live with them.<eos> Listen...<eos> You want to be a good leader?<eos> Let your soldiers believe in their success.<eos> - And when they find out the truth?<eos> - Maybe they never do.
That's a new one on me.<eos> Whoever did this, they they knew we were there.<eos> Maybe the same person that talked to the reporter talked to the collaborators, tipped them off as to what we were doing.<eos> I don't think that's true.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Will they pull the plug on this operation?<eos> They wouldn't do that.<eos> We just need a new angle, a new plan.<eos> What we need is to admit we screwed up.<eos> We didn't.
She's all right.<eos> No, don't tell me that you compromised yourself for someone who's just "all right."<eos> Okay.<eos> - She's beautiful. - Mmhmm.<eos> But that's not why I did it.<eos> I did it to save everyone else.<eos> Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.<eos> Yeah, I should.<eos> Yet I don't want you to.<eos> You don't?
- You're the best!<eos> They sure do know how to make a girl feel special.<eos> I mean, I've never heard so much applause, and someone actually booed me.<eos> Forget that guy. I wouldn't pay too much attention...<eos> I've never even heard that cheer before.<eos> - It's so exotic.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Do you think he's from overseas?<eos> You don't know what boo means, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I thought you said...<eos> - Dimberries.<eos> No.<eos> - Wait. You've been talking about...<eos> - You mean...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> These were supposed to be bimberries.<eos> You know, for someone who was careless enough to leave...<eos> Don't you know dimberries cause hyperactivity in rodents?<eos> Uh, yeah. Who doesn't?
- Did, Lance.<eos> I don't do that anymore.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> Want a medal?<eos> No, really, want one?<eos> There are like 25 of these things.<eos> Let's just get out of here, Arnwaldo. Hey!<eos> Don't call me Arnwaldo.<eos> Besides, don't you at least wanna know whose basement this is?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Give me that quarter.<eos> Okay, you're three hours away from anyone who knows you.<eos> Are you gonna help me or not?<eos> Help you what?<eos> I'm not a lawyer.<eos> And my sister doesn't need one since she didn't do anything.<eos> She hasn't even been charged.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Your boss does.
You own up to your sins, and you tell the truth to the American people for once in your life.<eos> Roarke calling for the truth?<eos> As much as it pains me to say this publicly, I have seen evidence that Claire Haas covered up what truly happened in the G20 hostage crisis.<eos> She knew the threat was imminent, and yet she turned a blind eye.<eos> And when it was over, she covered it up, and all for one reason.<eos> She financed the attack.<eos> Now...<eos> It's not true.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But the country doesn't.
See?<eos> We're not so different.<eos> We both sacrifice for what we believe is right, Kurt.<eos> That's why I wanted you for our new government.<eos> You're dedicated, you're honorable.<eos> I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Captain.<eos> - Hey. - What is going on in the kitchen?<eos> It's insanely packed.<eos> - They're all just taking a break.<eos> Why is nobody breaking in the new break room?<eos> - 'Cause it's a giant turd.<eos> - It's the worst.<eos> It's unusable.<eos> You guys don't even like it.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Right.<eos> It was transferred in from somewhere.<eos> We just have to trace it back to its source.<eos> Which would be Lieutenant Hawkins.<eos> But those are offshore accounts.<eos> We can't subpoena them.<eos> So we need to break in to the bank's computers.<eos> We need a hacker.<eos> Does anyone know a hacker?<eos> Boyle does.
- Grab me a group together. And not that busted-ass quarterback from last time, all right?<eos> Who, JaMarcus?<eos> He used to play for the Raiders.<eos> - Who the roses from?<eos> - Amber.<eos> Damn, those are nice.<eos> Must be her apology for yesterday's behavior.<eos> Nigga, you sent these to Amber to apologize to her.<eos> She just sent them back.<eos> - I did?
Make this.<eos> Champagne, champagne, Thank you.<eos> and for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice.<eos> No bendy straw, some party.<eos> Hey, a-a toast.<eos> Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project.<eos> And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.<eos> Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.
Why don't we play tomorrow during lunch?<eos> If I win, your "storage room"<eos> goes back to being my office.<eos> - Ha! Steve! - Ha!<eos> If you win, you can turn it into a unicorn stable for all I care because that's a fairytale! Ha! Ha!<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> It is on!<eos> Hey, Teddy.<eos> What you up to, buddy?<eos> What wizard did this to you?
Oh, my God.<eos> She was a who...<eos> No one has ever loved me!<eos> Okay, that's not true.<eos> Your parents put an obscene amount of time and effort into making sure you never experienced even one moment of disappointment.<eos> They must've really cared about you.<eos> You know, you haven't lost at everything.<eos> You did beat me at the Green Arrow game all by yourself.<eos> That's right...<eos> I did.
No, that's really enough." [audience cheering]<eos> I don't think that face needs to repeat.<eos> I've seen your father, and it's not getting better.<eos> She doesn't realize this until after you fuck her.<eos> That's actually when she really knows, is when you're like, "Yeah!"<eos> And she's like, "I'm not having this piece of shit's baby." [audience laughing]<eos> And that's why abortion is the last line of defense against shitty people in the species.<eos> So, we need them to abort every shitty baby. [audience cheering]<eos> I mean, all animals do this.<eos> Animals do it late.
Thanks, Debs.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> Bye. Bye.<eos> - Sorted!<eos> - Oh, you...<eos> - You're unbelievable, you.<eos> - What can I say?<eos> I'm wasted in promotions.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Oh, sorry, you don't.
So, er, now I've got you, and, er, since we're having a moment, - there's been something I've been meaning to talk to you about. - Hmm.<eos> - Sounds ominous. - I've been...<eos> I've been thinking about this a lot.<eos> No pressure, like.<eos> If you... If you're up for it...<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - ..do you fancy being on my Christmas team?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
And, Poovey, book her as a Jane Doe.<eos> A what?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Well, at least let me talk to her.<eos> No.<eos> I told you, you can't.<eos> Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary, down in the sub-basement.<eos> Yeah! And why do you think that is?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> - Wh... because you do!
A what?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Well, at least let me talk to her.<eos> No.<eos> I told you, you can't.<eos> Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary, down in the sub-basement.<eos> Yeah! And why do you think that is?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> - Wh... because you do!<eos> - No, I don't.
So, uh, what are we doing?<eos> Are we just--<eos> Do you not see the phone to my ear?<eos> I- - I do, but-- What?
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.<eos> Well, too bad, because-- Because you're getting it, whether you want it or not.<eos> No. Look- - Look, listen.<eos> I didn't know, okay?<eos> I thought this was gonna be, like, some pull-on fake feet, man, not-- not--<eos> Oh, sweet Jesus Lord God Christ, not some freaky metal robot legs!<eos> [meows] That'll do, Schnuckiputzi.<eos> [meows] And also, it's not just the legs.<eos> No, you crazy Kraut bastard, I don't want any part of those parts!<eos> But your employer, Mr. Trexler, does.
- And if you'd show it to me again...<eos> I don't...<eos> whoever hit me took it.<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> And my service weapon!<eos> And yet they left you your lighter.<eos> Wait. When I got pistol-whipped, I was talking to an English guy.<eos> We don't have an English guy.<eos> I... you have to remember me!<eos> Uh, actually, I don't.

She's... wondering where she came from.<eos> Thinks she's...<eos> she was... adopted.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And is that something on your mind?<eos> - Adoption?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... not "no". I mean, I know...<eos> Know that you have options?<eos> Because you do.
Enjoy your righteousness and your protein shakes.<eos> Waverly wants you to join her at Shorty's for nachos.<eos> Oh! Sounds good.<eos> I just gotta...<eos> Thought we've done this dance before.<eos> You know I'm not a bad guy.<eos> And you got into my truck... after you decked me.<eos> You said you have answers.<eos> About the venomous vixens.<eos> - I do.
Hey.<eos> OK.<eos> - Last night, in the barn... her eyes...<eos> She got a look in her eyes, Wynonna.<eos> Moment on the lips...<eos> I see you're still a bitch.<eos> You have to try this.<eos> Bacon.<eos> They should put this on everything.<eos> They do.
Tucker was associating himself with a couple of women that we've been looking for...<eos> - Just get water. Water.<eos> Water.<eos> - Yes.<eos> OK. - Yep.<eos> Hey.<eos> Am I the biggest cliché ever?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> Of course you do.
- Wynonna... - Hmm?<eos> This baby, what is it?<eos> Ours.<eos> - Is it gonna leave a mark?<eos> - Nah, it's superficial.<eos> - You had no plan out there, huh?<eos> - Oh, I still had time.<eos> They hadn't cocked their guns yet.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you?
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?<eos> You know why.<eos> Because whatever it is, he's got the same damn thing on you.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You should have told me this before.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> You never would've hired me.<eos> I meant when they started coming after us.<eos> I was hoping I wouldn't have to use it.<eos> Well, now I do.
All right, good.<eos> We'll wrap this up tomorrow.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I was wondering when you'd come crawling back.<eos> I'm back, but I'm not crawling.<eos> I'm here to tell you you're backing the hell off my firm.<eos> I know what you're here to do, but let me ask you this.<eos> Does your firm know what it is that you did?<eos> But if you don't let this shit go, they're not gonna be the only ones I tell.<eos> And not just what I did.

Somewhere nice, you know.<eos> Make sure Morgan's all right, too.<eos> You just tell me... ..what happened your sister.<eos> Mary.<eos> That's all you have to do.<eos> I just, er...<eos> I just tell you what happened?<eos> I give you my word on it.<eos> She always wanted me to play with her.<eos> I always did.
For twenty years have I served you and God as the Archbishop to Targoviste Cathedral.<eos> Yet never before have I felt the love of God shine so upon this great city.<eos> A little more than one year ago, many of us suffered a vision during the God-willed punishment of a witch in our midst.<eos> The devil himself came to us and threatened us with doom in one year.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
I got to go buy some steaks.<eos> Good, you're here.<eos> Tell me you figured out what bullshit they're trying to sneak into this deal.<eos> They're not trying to sneak anything into it.<eos> They're trying to get out of it.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> They came to us for this merger.<eos> They must've gotten a better offer, because they buried an escape clause in the addendum.<eos> - You know what we have to do.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You need him for something?<eos> Yeah, I need him to drop that case.<eos> Why?<eos> Because there's a conflict with Masterson Construction.<eos> Mike's pro bono is against some prison.<eos> And guess who builds those prisons.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Are you telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> Harvey, I thought we were in this together.<eos> - So did I.
- Harvey--<eos> - Did they or not?<eos> - They did.<eos> - Drop 'em.<eos> - God damn it--<eos> - I said drop 'em.<eos> - No.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I may not be name partner yet, but you don't get to tell me who my clients are.<eos> Yes, I do.
You told me you were afraid that I was gonna become better friends with him than you, and that's what this is.<eos> How dare you say that to me in front of Donna?<eos> I told you that in complete confidence.<eos> This isn't about my relationship with Alex.<eos> This is about your relationship with Alex and how you're afraid to stand up to him.<eos> You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means--<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.
No, I've been at... .. at the... lecture.<eos> William, this is Maggie.<eos> She's got a fancy for my surgery skills.<eos> - And this is, sorry, what's your name again, love?<eos> - Rebecca.<eos> - Oh, Becky.<eos> Girls, this is William, he's an alienist.<eos> - You won't know what that means.<eos> - Neither does he.<eos> - No-one does.
They had a problem, they wanted it fixed, and I didn't fix it.<eos> Bullshit, you got Pearson Specter to drop it like a hot potato.<eos> That's all you could've done.<eos> No, what I could have done was kill the whole damn thing.<eos> And since I didn't, they found some inmate at another prison to break the case wide open, which is why I just had to eat a ton of shit.<eos> - What did you just say?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Like I said, I need to find Donna.<eos> I want to know right now, do you know where Mike is?<eos> - No, I don't.
And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.<eos> Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.<eos> God bless Mama.<eos> And your little sister?<eos> Oh, yes, and God bless Phoebe.<eos> Amen.<eos> She's gonna be back home before you know it.<eos> I don't want Mama to come back.<eos> Oh, you don't mean that.<eos> You do too.

But I prayed.<eos> In that hospital, I prayed like I've never prayed before.<eos> And it worked.<eos> You see?<eos> He was testing me.<eos> It's all a test.<eos> Every single thing he expects of us... listen to me.<eos> Every single thing he expects of us, we have to do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Do you?
I can't talk about it. - No?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll see you around then,<eos> - I guess, huh?<eos> - Mason, I can... there's a way out back I know...<eos> - Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Thanks, I'll be good.<eos> I know you knew Frankie Belmont.<eos> No, I didn't.
Judge Baird doesn't usually order those.<eos> It gives Tannetti time to change her plea.<eos> We may still have a trial on our hands, gentlemen.<eos> Well, it's not like we're gonna get caught with our pants down.<eos> And we got a case.<eos> Well, yeah, but if we go to trial, we have to establish motive.<eos> And so far...<eos> There's an explanation there somewhere.<eos> I didn't even notice her.<eos> None of us did.
You're a Belmont, aren't you?<eos> House of Belmont, Family Belmont!<eos> Never met them.<eos> Listen, just forget it.<eos> I'll just go.<eos> No!<eos> You're a Belmont!<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
Really.<eos> So, what are you running to?<eos> Did you have a destination in mind?<eos> Are you calling me a coward?<eos> No.<eos> I am calling you defeated, Trevor Belmont.<eos> You fought your battle and you decided you lost.<eos> We didn't have a choice.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But we do.
You're a wreck.<eos> You stink.<eos> You can barely keep your eyes open.<eos> What do you expect to achieve against us?<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> So you're going to die for nothing?<eos> For people you don't know?<eos> I don't know any of you, but that doesn't matter, does it?<eos> My family, the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country.<eos> We do this thing for Wallachia and her people.
What?<eos> I can still rip your throat out.<eos> You can, but it won't stop me staking you.<eos> But you will still die.<eos> But I don't care.<eos> Killing you was the point.<eos> Living through it was just a luxury.<eos> I will incinerate you before your fangs touch that man's throat.<eos> I thought I was your legendary savior.<eos> So did I.
Oh, my boy.<eos> they hung three deserters down in Perry.<eos> Didn't put 'em back in the army.<eos> Just hung 'em.<eos> Yeah, I got a leave.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> A good mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.
Well, he's asking if I'd kill a man for some corn.<eos> I don't know.<eos> See, lieutenant, you steal our corn, we got nothin' to feed the hogs.<eos> If we can't feed the hogs, we got nothin' to put in the smokehouse.<eos> We got nothin' to put in the smokehouse, we starve in the winter.<eos> That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What?<eos> What?<eos> He gone down there.<eos> Who?<eos> He got a gun.<eos> Who?<eos> Moses?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> They took him. They took our boy.<eos> Who did?
I didn't have no choice.<eos> What kind of life will be better for him?<eos> That ain't the point.<eos> I don't want my boy to get lynched.<eos> Or beat.<eos> I want him to go to a school.<eos> I don't want him to drop his eyes every time a white man walk by.<eos> I don't want him to be a "boy" no more once he turn into a man.<eos> Don't you want that too?<eos> Course I do.
Proper union?<eos> Prop--<eos> I was married in this courthouse.<eos> I was married in this courthouse!<eos> But where we gonna go?<eos> We can't get married anywhere else.<eos> Up north, I guess.<eos> We don't know anybody up north.<eos> I understand your client wishes to change his plea, counselor.<eos> Yes, he does, your honor.
Only its possibilities.<eos> You have such a capacity for goodness.<eos> You always excelled... But not because you craved success... But because of your fear of failure.<eos> That's what made me a great doctor.<eos> It's precisely what kept you from greatness.<eos> Arrogance and fear still keep you... From learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.<eos> Which is?<eos> It's not about you.<eos> When you first came to me... You asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan pangborn.<eos> I didn't.
-Jesus.<eos> -Wow. Soiling.<eos> I'd put that at a T3.<eos> T4, if it was poop.<eos> -What?<eos> -Unless you ate something weird.<eos> Then it wasn't the ghost.<eos> Kinda hard to suss that out after the fact though.<eos> I didn't soil myself.<eos> He did.
Abby transferred to my high school, junior year.<eos> Go, Karate Cats.<eos> We started telling ghost stories, and we just kind of bonded right away.<eos> And all the other kids were, you know, getting drunk and going to parties, and we're like, "That's stupid."<eos> Plus, we were never invited to the parties.<eos> No, I think that's because we told very, very scary ghost stories, and I think the other kids were terrified of us.<eos> That's what was actually happening.<eos> So, how did y'all get into ghosts?<eos> Did one of you see one?<eos> Yeah, I did.
-I have some questions.<eos> -Seriously?<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> Hello.<eos> Looking forward to this metal show.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ozzy rocks!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yes.<eos> He certainly does rock.
If the cat is outta the bag, you can't put it back in!<eos> I put a cat in a bag all the time.<eos> But once the cat is out of the bag, aren't you like, "The cat is out of the bag!"<eos> We just want to shove that damn cat back in the bag.<eos> The cat has been out of the bag before, and yet, people lose interest and put it back in.<eos> People always move on.<eos> Sheriff in New Mexico reports a UFO encounter.<eos> The crew of the SS Ourang Medan dies mysteriously.<eos> The entire town of Langville, Montana, goes missing.<eos> It does?
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?<eos> Nothing's gonna stop me!<eos> -Man.<eos> -Kevin!<eos> Come on, Rowan, get out of him!<eos> Thanks for the upgrade.<eos> Rowan, ya big bully!<eos> Hope this guy knows how to ride a motorcycle.<eos> Rowan, not Kevin!<eos> Yeah, he does.
-Yeah. Yes, that's smart.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Whatever you need, going forward.<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Anything?<eos> Anything.<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> Second floor is mine.<eos> You can't claim a whole floor.<eos> -I just did.
But, uh...<eos> From...<eos> What...<eos> - Glass?<eos> You're a piece of work.<eos> Glass.<eos> Okay, MacGyver, no woman's gotten this far, but, um...<eos> You had a plumber cut your water?<eos> No.<eos> I did it myself.
No, you're gonna be the best mom in the world.<eos> Wait.<eos> Just go back.<eos> What was that thing that you just said about the co-op board?<eos> You need to be out by Friday.<eos> But you're allowed to have guests.<eos> Yes.<eos> But my guests aren't allowed to slide down the trash chute, naked.<eos> I didn't go naked down the...<eos> - Robin did that.
Is this one of those fetish things?<eos> Where you're, like, a foot fetish.<eos> Am I the foot?<eos> Do you want to be the foot?<eos> I'm not into feet, but I would like to go out with you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> Really? I...<eos> Do you not want me to?<eos> I do! I...
Four, five, six.<eos> Seven.<eos> Eight, nine.<eos> It's just ten.<eos> It's just ten.<eos> Eleven.<eos> Did you drink this?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You did.
And I think I love you, too.<eos> I mean, I do love you, I don't know why I just said that.<eos> I really love you.<eos> I really, really love you.<eos> I mean, I don't...<eos> I can totally handle all of this by myself.<eos> I'm an independent woman.<eos> My God, seriously?<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> I don't.
Right.<eos> So, Tijuana.<eos> Any sod-eyed muppet with a bloody backpack and a pair of frickin' Birkenstocks is gonna go on about that donkey show, man.<eos> Listen, listen, boys.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen... listen to me now...<eos> it's downright naughty.<eos> Whoo!<eos> We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave.
It's my lunch.<eos> Little piece of shawarma I had earlier.<eos> Look.<eos> Jesse, this isn't just any old gig.<eos> You get that, right?<eos> I'm sure it's the job to end all jobs, Tulip.<eos> I imagine they'll be singing songs about it.<eos> Pretty damn close, actually, yeah.<eos> Tell me you don't want to. Tell me you don't miss it.<eos> I just did.
- Emily.<eos> - No, I know.<eos> We got to do something to keep up with that darn megachurch.<eos> I'm quittin'.<eos> - I'm done.<eos> - Level up.<eos> I'll announce it Sunday service.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Thought I could make it work.<eos> I really did.
We plan our futures like we're the captains of our fates.<eos> But we're passengers.<eos> We go where fate takes us.<eos> Arthur!<eos> This isn't the life we planned.<eos> But it's ours.<eos> And for the first time in my life...<eos> I don't feel alone.<eos> We weren't supposed to find each other.<eos> But we did.
Are you soiling my barstool?<eos> You want to make things, you got to get your hands dirty.<eos> And what have you been making?<eos> Improvements.<eos> Grand Concourse.<eos> First floor.<eos> Gold-class breakfast.<eos> This is deck chief Gus Mancuso.<eos> Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?<eos> Who did that?
Make you feel like you were the only woman in the world.<eos> I first met Daniel in Moscow.<eos> He once took me rowing on the Serpentine and quoted Keats by heart.<eos> He could quote Keats by heart!<eos> "Where be ye going, you Devon Maid?<eos> "And what have ye there in the basket?"<eos> "And what have ye there in the basket?<eos> "Ye tight little fairy just fresh from the dairy,<eos> "Will you give me some cream if I ask it?"<eos> He did it to everyone.
Don't say fucking "erection" at a christening!<eos> Would you like to get some air?<eos> I mean, some more air.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't suppose you happen to have a cigarette?<eos> No.<eos> Gave up 1,891 days ago.<eos> Not that you're counting.<eos> Since when did you smoke?<eos> I don't.
Yeah.<eos> If you've got footage of her punching a horse, I want it.<eos> Bridget, do you want a baby?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I'm 43.<eos> It might be the only chance I'm going to get.<eos> Look, one broken, out-of-date condom I might have believed was an accident.<eos> But two?<eos> You wanted it.<eos> Maybe I did.
No.<eos> I'm a mathematician.<eos> They're silky soft.<eos> Tell me, Jack.<eos> Do you happen to like Chinese food?<eos> Jack.<eos> Let me take you to set.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do, sometimes. Yes.
Sort of.<eos> You see, um, a few months ago, on the fourth of the month, I met Jack at a music festival.<eos> Right.<eos> And we got on very well.<eos> And sort of had, um, relations.<eos> And the next week, that is to say, on the 11th of the month at Jude's baby christening to be exact, uh, following the consumption of quite a lot of alcohol, Mark and I, well, we had similar relations?<eos> And this is the funny part, I suppose.<eos> Owing to these relations, uh, the resulting life form currently residing in my tummy could actually, in fact, be either of yours.<eos> I know I should have told you both before.<eos> But I just didn't.
Bridget.<eos> Camera back.<eos> I still can't believe Mark ducked out like that.<eos> Well, it's not really his fault.<eos> I suppose we just have to hope it's Jack's, right?<eos> I mean, let's face it.<eos> Things could be worse.<eos> He is pretty fucking amazing.<eos> He's richer than God, and he has a very nice-sized puppet.<eos> He does.
No, we're not gonna go.<eos> This man insulted you.<eos> And we're not gonna leave until he apologizes.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Hey, we got a problem here?<eos> - No,no.<eos> - Yeah, we got a big problem.<eos> Your friend, here, really insulted my friend and he needs to apologize.<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> He doesn't.
After he won the election.<eos> Now that seems ridiculous, anyone...<eos> Anyone being jealous of me.<eos> I've buried two children, and now I'm burying my husband.<eos> You know, I was jealous.<eos> Of that dress you wore in Vienna.<eos> I know that it's hard to see it right now, but you have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> That's a terrible thing to say.<eos> That's a terrible, terrible thing to say.<eos> But you do.
Who is it really for?<eos> One more campaign stop along the way to the grave?<eos> Lyndon's people are right.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> It's not worth risking people's lives.<eos> You tell them we're calling it off.<eos> We'll motorcade to the cathedral.<eos> And then we'll bury him, and we put an end to all this.<eos> I don't give a damn anymore.<eos> I don't.
And yet, I'm not burying you today.<eos> There comes a time in man's search for meaning, when one realizes that there are no answers.<eos> And when you come to that horrible, unavoidable realization, you accept it or you kill yourself.<eos> Or you simply stop searching.<eos> I have lived a blessed life.<eos> And yet, every night, when I climb into bed, turn off the lights, and stare into the dark,<eos> I wonder...<eos> Is this all there is?<eos> You wonder?<eos> Every soul on this planet does.
Okay.<eos> Not many.<eos> I'm gonna try to get what I can and salvage these.<eos> David, you should be in the Command Center.<eos> President Whitmore.<eos> Thank God you're okay.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> I had 20 years to get us ready.<eos> And we never had a chance.<eos> We didn't last time either.
Yes, sir.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go now!<eos> Now, now!<eos> Activate the shield!<eos> Shield engaged.<eos> Lt. Whitmore, clear the blast zone.<eos> Surprised to see me?<eos> Do it.
Come on.<eos> Go now!<eos> Now, now!<eos> Activate the shield!<eos> Shield engaged.<eos> Lt. Whitmore, clear the blast zone.<eos> Surprised to see me?<eos> Do it.<eos> Push the button, Tom.<eos> Do it, Tom.
No!<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> I fall out of the cart, then I lose Frank, now I'm being hunted by a douche.<eos> The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?<eos> This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.<eos> I'm such a whore.<eos> Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges... impure thoughts.<eos> We all do.
Oh, Frank, what are you doing?<eos> You, señor, have no bedside manner.<eos> - I got bedside manner!<eos> - You don't respect anyone else's beliefs.<eos> You intolerant piece of shit.<eos> No, it's starting.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Come on. Sing.<eos> - Do it.
And then they figured out how to drive my car, snuck into an AC vent... and that pretty much brings us up-to-date.<eos> Get the fuck away from me.<eos> Frank, I'm sorry.<eos> When you guys fell out of that cart, I could have done something, but I didn't.<eos> Then I did the same thing as...<eos> They killed Carl.<eos> Those fuckers.<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> No...<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he did.
They killed Carl.<eos> Those fuckers.<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> No...<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he did.<eos> They truly are monsters.<eos> Those monsters are gonna kill Brenda.<eos> She's somewhere out there in a cart.<eos> I tried to warn everyone, they didn't believe me!<eos> Of course they didn't.
What kind of parent gives their kid a stupid cunt name like that?<eos> Worry not, friends.<eos> I have a solution.<eos> I have invented a Stargate device that will allow us to travel to their dimension.<eos> Fuck, yeah, he did.<eos> And it's dope.<eos> This guy's smart.<eos> I mean like, fuck-a-guy smart.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, you do.
So... let's just say the next few years were complete shit.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Well, except for one part.<eos> I had krista.<eos> This was last Friday.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I was in a good mood.<eos> - I love spoilers.<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, I do.
What if I gave your dad a hand job?<eos> Oh, Louis, wow, you look so hot with that belt-phone of yours.<eos> Wow. Oh, krista, you're home early.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why... mmm.<eos> Why? Why?<eos> Why do you even like him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.
Get over it!<eos> I swear to god. I swear to god I'm gonna clock you!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Calm down already, man!<eos> - Everybody knows that!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you?<eos> I... I know what this is about.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Fine.<eos> We're not talking about him right now, 'cause it's just too upsetting.<eos> "And too hard and too sad and it gives me a cluster headache."<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You have no compassion.<eos> Actually, I'm just bored, because I know everything you're going to do before you do it.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> - Oh, you don't believe me?<eos> No, I don't.
I will love you.<eos> And you will learn to love me.<eos> It is God's will.<eos> I will kill you.<eos> That would not stop me.<eos> You're mad. Who was that man?<eos> He put foolish thoughts in your mind.<eos> He helped me.<eos> I love him.<eos> No, you do not.
Here's my book.<eos> Many years ago, a splinter faction emerged among our people.<eos> Disaffected peculiars tired of living in loops.<eos> That's... That's Mr. Barron.<eos> He believed that by harnessing the essence of an Ymbryne's powers, he and his cronies could gain immortality, and be able to live outside loops.<eos> He devised an experiment...<eos> He kidnapped an Ymbryne, not knowing or caring whether she would survive the experiment.<eos> But the fate of Barron and his group was more horrifying still.<eos> Why didn't Barron turn into one?<eos> He did.
You know what you are.<eos> A thief, a liar, and a killer.<eos> You can never undo things you've done. and you will never be anything.<eos> Good to see you again, amigo.<eos> Tao Tei movement!<eos> All troops to the Wall!<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - No.<eos> - How do you know he won't betray us?<eos> - I don't.
Quite an honor.<eos> Seems you've made your choice.<eos> Oh, him?<eos> Believe me, I'm already think about trading him back for the powder.<eos> I heard that.<eos> Perhaps we were both wrong.<eos> We are more similar than I thought.<eos> Thank you General.<eos> - Are you sure you don't want to go back?<eos> - Of course I do.
"Then nine days after delivery and the Trows having no further use for them,<eos> "the mothers were sacrificed by having their hearts cut out."<eos> "As part of the burial ceremony, "the mother's corpse had sacred prayers carved into her flesh."<eos> - The details are remarkable, but...<eos> - Well, the guy from Oxford thinks that the Trows were a real religious sect.<eos> - Real?<eos> - Yeah, what if they still are?<eos> And, what? You think Stephen Renney is one of them?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, well, I do.
The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.<eos> They will use it to destroy us.<eos> I'm gonna find it.<eos> And watch them destroy you and your Creed.<eos> You can not kill the Creed.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> The Apple is everything.<eos> Your mother died to protect it.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> I do.
[whistles]<eos> Heard you're installing a camera on our truck.<eos> Which was fine until you ripped out that 50 cal.<eos> You're taking down a gun to put up a camera?<eos> It's the only place large enough to mount it.<eos> [Toll] You guys get that, right?<eos> I know it sounds like a terrible idea.<eos> We prefer to dance with who brung us... Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?<eos> "Dance with who brung you"?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
No good?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> What's the difference between an artery and a vein?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - The boy's accident.<eos> Arteries spurt blood.<eos> And veins?<eos> Bleed.<eos> I think you need to practice your boy/girl dating talk at home before you come out.<eos> Yeah, I probably do.
I can't.<eos> It's strictly military personnel.<eos> Well, then you get one of them to take it in.<eos> They ain't out to help.<eos> They're fixing to bury him.<eos> There is only one question that any military court need ask of the accused.<eos> Do you deny disobeying Colonel Sangston's direct orders?<eos> Well, do you, Private?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I don't.
And then one day, that break you should have been looking for.<eos> Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.<eos> Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo to Havana to Vegas.<eos> He cooked the books for the Gambino family for 40-plus years.<eos> Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano, thought maybe the old man's age made him vulnerable to prosecution.<eos> Ordered his son, Little Tony, to kill Francis.<eos> Kid fucked it up.<eos> Francis ran, became a federal informant in return for protective custody.<eos> Could have turned my career around if only I'd listened.<eos> I didn't.
Give me the layout of the home.<eos> Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.<eos> Go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - What's this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sit down in the chair.<eos> You ever see a match-grade round traveling 3,000 feet per second go through a window?<eos> Nobody does.
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?<eos> To leak-proof your books.<eos> Dana found a mistake, and you wanted to be sure it was safe to go public.<eos> And now you want to kill her.<eos> I'm fond of Dana.<eos> But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!<eos> Men, women, children, I give them hope.<eos> Make them whole.<eos> Do you even know what that's like?<eos> Yes, I do.
You said it was safe.<eos> Four weeks ago.<eos> You stood right there.<eos> This is what you did. "Let's get into this."<eos> -"lbis!<eos> Safer than a savings account!"<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> "Home run after home run...<eos> Walt Camby!"<eos> - I didn't do that!
Oh, I knew you couldn't.<eos> What?<eos> You set me up to fail?<eos> Why?<eos> If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now.<eos> I don't wanna be more!<eos> I like who I am.<eos> You don't even know who you are.<eos> What do you...?<eos> Of course I do.
Best ribbon dancer in the world!<eos> At least, that's what she said.<eos> Look away.<eos> Look away.<eos> No.<eos> You can't, can you?<eos> Dad, why does she keep staring at me like... that!<eos> Try to keep up.<eos> I don't really know how to dance!<eos> Of course you do.
-Not quite.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've done everything you've asked.<eos> I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks, hot tubs.<eos> I am totally at one with my panda parts.<eos> Now why won't you show me?<eos> Because I don't know it!<eos> You what?<eos> I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.
- Okay.<eos> Journey to the-- hey, look.<eos> Shells.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Shells!<eos> Daddy, here's a shell for you.<eos> That's great, dory.<eos> You found another one.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yes, you did.
We need every one of you to help us fight the Others.<eos> This isn't summer camp, Zombie.<eos> You're a soldier now.<eos> So we don't wanna lose you.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You all right?<eos> How are we supposed to fight the Others if we don't even know what they are?<eos> Actually, we do.
- Aye. Don't.<eos> Nothing can save you, Huntsman.<eos> ENOUGH !<eos> We can't leave the Mirror.<eos> But you're as pathetic as you ever were.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> How did you make me strong?<eos> How did you draw the weakness out?<eos> What did you do?<eos> What did you DO?
Okay.<eos> You're the one who pushed me into this, you know that?<eos> With all your constant demands and trendy needs.<eos> I did not tell you to go on Jeff's computer and make a deal with an arms dealer!<eos> Well, you didn't tell me not to.<eos> Jeff... I was at the end of my rope.<eos> The financial pressure was crazy.<eos> Groceries and tutors and... I got four kids under 13 in braces.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you, Jeff?
No, it's just my aim with a spear is not what it was.<eos> Then get closer before you throw it.<eos> Hey! Beautiful!<eos> I meant the snake!<eos> That worked great.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> This time, the bait needs to dangle longer.<eos> I must strike the weak spot from behind.<eos> And how do you know they have a weak spot?<eos> I don't.
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?<eos> Hannah, honey, your daddy didn't leave you.<eos> You're gonna see him this weekend.<eos> He doesn't look at me the same way anymore.<eos> That's my fault.<eos> I told him something that he wasn't ready to hear.<eos> What?<eos> Well, believe it or not, I know something that's going to happen.<eos> I can't explain how I know.<eos> I just do.
You want to show you how to make a daisy chain?<eos> You know how to do it?<eos> Now I'll show you.<eos> We make a small hole.<eos> Can you pass through the?<eos> Check it out.<eos> Beautiful, honey.<eos> Then we can put them together.<eos> - Check it out.<eos> How does a crown?
Like to pay this out in cash or check?<eos> Get some Debbie money.<eos> 4 in cash, rest in check.<eos> Who would you like the check made out to?<eos> Texas Midlands Bank.<eos> Thank you much.<eos> Let's go get a room.<eos> Welcome to the Comanche 66.<eos> Do you have a reservation?<eos> We do not.
The decryption and dissemination of which, other than being scientifically impossible, would surely carry punishments of treason that are so severe, the government probably hasn't invented them yet.<eos> They came from the boy.<eos> It's all from the boy.<eos> - Alton Meyer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay, well, we knew that.<eos> He's your son?<eos> Adopted.<eos> Do you know the birth father?<eos> Yes, I do.
You saved this entire base, Kirk.<eos> Millions of souls.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It wasn't just me.<eos> Never is.<eos> Needless to say the position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice Admirals don't fly do they?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Ah!<eos> I outgrew them.<eos> It broke my heart.<eos> And they don't make those tights anymore.<eos> Not for grown women, anyway.<eos> Strange, that.<eos> Oh, you can mock.<eos> Didn't you ever love anything that much?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
He actually did it beautifully.<eos> That's my Adam's apple, you bitch!<eos> Claire, get me a new lawyer.<eos> There's not gonna be another lawyer if you don't have any money, you stupid ginger!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.<eos> Not that you're ever gonna find out.<eos> Because you will never be invited into my basement.<eos> I don't wanna see your basement!<eos> Yes, you do!
No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ooh, you guys are kissing.<eos> - Heya, Rachel!<eos> Hi. How are you?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Did you sleep over?<eos> - Oh, God, no.<eos> What, have a sleepover here? Ew.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Chug!<eos> What is this crazy joint?<eos> This is Pops' place.<eos> His owner is never home, so it's kind of a hot spot.<eos> Pops knows everyone in this city.<eos> If he agrees to help us, Max is as good as found.<eos> Cool!<eos> Fabulous!<eos> Tell me you got that!<eos> Oh, heck yes, I did.
How does that song go again?<eos> They come from the North, right?<eos> Way up there in the mountains where few people have ever been.<eos> But sometimes, a dragon gets lost from its family and winds up very, very far from home.<eos> They say it lives in these very woods.<eos> That you can hear its roar at night.<eos> They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know... not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.<eos> Except me.<eos> You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.
Jack, he's a monster.<eos> It's not a monster.<eos> It's an animal.<eos> And it's hurt and it's scared.<eos> Grace, wait.<eos> You need help.<eos> You need Pete.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Did you just see that?<eos> I sure did.
Hey, you're late tonight.<eos> I was starting to think you were cheating on me like my last two boyfriends.<eos> Yeah, it's a bit of a crazy time.<eos> Chococadabra.<eos> Bill Adams.<eos> Don't sell the tech stocks. Don't do that.<eos> Milly Willy.<eos> Make a fuss, perv, and it'll hurt so bad you won't believe that it could hurt like that, all right?<eos> Did you tell anyone what you saw today?<eos> - Did you?
You were right.<eos> These cheeseburgers are amazing.<eos> I know.<eos> Being a good girl is hard.<eos> I know.<eos> It sucks.<eos> You were hitting that booze too hard for a nice girl.<eos> You need to get Luke out of your head.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do.
Name calling doesn't work on me, so...<eos> Mike, it'll turn me on if you take that jump.<eos> Turn me on if you don't.<eos> Still not going to, still.<eos> L'm not gonna do it.<eos> Like we would ever do that.<eos> No way.<eos> Come on! Do it.<eos> He's not gonna do it.<eos> Do it!
We have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central.<eos> Find him, shut him down.<eos> So, are all rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you?<eos> Oops.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sly bunny.<eos> Dumb fox.<eos> You know you love me.<eos> Do I know that?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Mm.<eos> Interesting period.<eos> This way.<eos> Schwinns were made in the US, the Raleighs in England, the Italian bikes, French...<eos> For a time, you had real international competition.<eos> You were choosing between very different products with different heritages, sensibilities, techniques.<eos> - Well, that's gone now.<eos> - What happened, in your view?<eos> - I thought you studied our case.<eos> - I did.

And he says, "Alan, what do we need now?"<eos> And I knew.<eos> We needed a needle and thread.<eos> Or... duct tape.<eos> For what?<eos> To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.<eos> We cut up our jackets and we taped them together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.<eos> And we slept there in our long underwear.<eos> - And you shared the sleeping bag?<eos> - We did.
It's good!<eos> It destroyed!<eos> It's good!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> We do not fired that missile, sir.<eos> Did you know I lost my daddy?<eos> Yah!<eos> He gave me Ellie, for my birthday.<eos> If we do not dig deeper, its trunk sticking out.<eos> Do deeper.
You okay?<eos> I don't think I am.<eos> You're a great mom.<eos> That kid up there... he needs a great mom.<eos> You need a kid.<eos> It's a perfect match.<eos> We don't need anything else.<eos> I know that you think you do.<eos> And God knows there's a big part of me it feels the same.<eos> But we don't.
Do you know anything about his birth mother?<eos> There's nothing in the file.<eos> Only that she died.<eos> I assume the way my wife did.<eos> The way your husband did.<eos> What are you hoping to find?<eos> Dr. Tennant told me not to come back without the patient file.<eos> He's try to call.<eos> Do you have the PID?<eos> I don't.
What is that?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Witches.<eos> Our American friends have permitted a breach of the Statute of Secrecy that threatens to expose us all.<eos> I will not be lectured by the man who let Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers.<eos> Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is critical...<eos> You better have an excellent excuse for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
You all right?<eos> Where's Naz?<eos> What?<eos> So, who's "he" in the sentence "he kill her or something"?<eos> Uh, look, man, I was just saying.<eos> You were just saying what?<eos> I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with.<eos> Describe him.<eos> You know, an Arab dude.<eos> No, I don't.
I mean, I tried to warn her, too. Yeah?<eos> How'd you go about doing that?<eos> I just told him right to his face.<eos> But you didn't know him.<eos> Nope.<eos> Never saw him before.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> You know the girl?<eos> I mean, not per se, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
They took my phone.<eos> Talk to anyone? N...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - Here. - Like, who?<eos> It's not a tough question.<eos> Like cops, who else is there?<eos> Uh, I talked to one. - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, why?<eos> Tell me he told you you had to?<eos> He didn't.
Kill them all!<eos> Position! Throw!<eos> Hold this line!<eos> Tribune!<eos> We have Barabbas!<eos> Bring him!<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh's you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God, chooses us over you.<eos> But not today, he didn't.
We are followers.<eos> We follow to find out.<eos> I think he is preparing us.<eos> For what?<eos> Down.<eos> Pilate will not let this rest.<eos> I've endangered you.<eos> They have a tracker.<eos> They can't know we are up here.<eos> They already do.
This threatens them.<eos> To Pilate, Caiaphas and Rome.<eos> There's trouble this way as well.<eos> Have faith, Tribune.<eos> Peter...<eos> Just walk a little further.<eos> Why?<eos> To be close.<eos> Simon, do you love me?<eos> Yes, with all the heart, I do.
Ray of sunshine.<eos> Shethoughtit wascorny asshit.<eos> But it stuck.<eos> IfI 'dhaveknown, Iwouldhavehelpedher.<eos> Youknowthat,don 'tyou ?<eos> I mean, she was always so bright.<eos> Sohappy.<eos> To think she was carrying around all that pain, all that unhappiness every day.<eos> I should've seen it.<eos> But I didn't.
It isn't good.<eos> Could be worse.<eos> We could be walking.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> Don't stop for anyone.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We fucking made it.<eos> We did it.

- ...throughout the last few days.<eos> - Looks like the perfect place... to watch your national team play for what is the greatest prize in football.<eos> - This is a truly international occasion.<eos> - We've seen Donald Trump.<eos> Star of stage and screen, Daniel Radcliffe is here.<eos> Middle East peace symbol Schlomo Khalidi... looking much better, is here too.<eos> So much color and noise.<eos> And there will be plenty of both at the end of the match... because the final whistle will trigger what we are told will be... the biggest firework display ever seen at a sporting event.<eos> When we was kids... did you ever think that we'd end up going to the final together?<eos> Yes, I did, brother.
Don't worry.<eos> I've got this.<eos> Jodie, me gun's jammed.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Excuse me, miss.<eos> Yes?<eos> Go fuck yourself!<eos> Yes! Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> We did it, Seb!
You winking at my girl?<eos> Your girl?<eos> I guess you do look old enough to be her father.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen... is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?<eos> Can I please go to the bathroom?<eos> I think there's something seriously wrong with my eyes.<eos> Fine, Scott.<eos> And afterwards... why don't you stop by the principal's office and explain to him... that you're disrupting class again?<eos> I trust you know the way.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I just heard you in my head.<eos> I'm telepathic.<eos> I read minds.<eos> Well, stay out of mine.<eos> I don't need some weird girl creeping around in there.<eos> Don't worry, Scott.<eos> There's not much to see.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> I didn't tell you my name.<eos> No, you didn't.
No metal.<eos> Some guys at the factory said they saw something today.<eos> Something that didn't add up.<eos> Put your weapons away.<eos> You've been a good citizen, Henryk...<eos> A good neighbor... a good worker.<eos> I want to believe that's who you are.<eos> It is.<eos> But nobody in this town really knows you.<eos> Yes you do.
- We're not leaving without you!<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We'll catch up.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hank, you go with the kids.<eos> - Moira will be waiting on the plane.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Not all of us can fully control our powers.<eos> Then don't.
I'm pumping adrenaline.<eos> I know a place she'll be safe.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I'm not going to a stupid school.<eos> They have a dress code. This is what they wear there.<eos> I know the headmistress.<eos> You'll be safe there.<eos> "Headmistress?" What is it, a convent?<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Do you?
Major Susan Turner.<eos> 110th Military Police.<eos> The Major Turner who's wanted by the MPs for espionage?<eos> You mean these MPs?<eos> These crates are supposed to contain weapons belonging to the United States Army.<eos> In fact, you sold them to insurgents.<eos> And these are now empty.<eos> Do you know who I am, Major?<eos> Yes, General.<eos> I do.
But who says she'll remember you?<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> You're not my father.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> See that woman over there?<eos> The waitress who's refilled your coffee three times?<eos> That's her.<eos> Neither of you had any idea who the other was.<eos> - I knew it all along.<eos> - No, you didn't.
It is time for me to tell you the first tale.<eos> I don't need a tale.<eos> I need a bus ticket for my grandma.<eos> It is time for me to tell you...<eos> Where do you think you are going?<eos> I will be listened to.<eos> I am as old as this land, and I will...<eos> What do you know about anything?<eos> I know everything about you, Conor O'Malley.<eos> No you don't.
I don't need a tale.<eos> I need a bus ticket for my grandma.<eos> It is time for me to tell you...<eos> Where do you think you are going?<eos> I will be listened to.<eos> I am as old as this land, and I will...<eos> What do you know about anything?<eos> I know everything about you, Conor O'Malley.<eos> No you don't.<eos> If you did...
I can't stand knowing she will go.<eos> I want it to be finished.<eos> I let her fall.<eos> I let her die.<eos> That was brave, Conor.<eos> You finally said it.<eos> Why didn't it kill me?<eos> I deserve punishment.<eos> I deserve the worst.<eos> Do you?
It doesn't matter.<eos> You know, Conor.<eos> You and me... we're not the most natural fit, are we?<eos> No.<eos> I guess not.<eos> I guess not either.<eos> But we're going to have to learn.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do know, don't you.<eos> Of course you do.
I just get so scared.<eos> Sure, you do.<eos> But you know how to get over that, right?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> You just start singing!<eos> Do what you love, then you'll be great, 'cause you won't be afraid anymore, because you'll actually be doing it.<eos> Right?<eos> Look, do you love to sing?<eos> I mean, do you really love it?<eos> Of course I do.
We've got a chance here to show our solidarity with the oppressed people of Germany.<eos> It's all a part of the same great hatred.<eos> We can make those in power aware of their moral obligation to fight against the wrongs that we Negroes suffer right here at home.<eos> You think it's gonna make a damn bit of difference?<eos> He stays, they ain't gonna notice.<eos> He goes, he can come back with a drawer full of medals, and they will hate him even worse than before.<eos> J.C.<eos> It ain't gonna make no difference no how.<eos> Do you run, Mr. Davis?<eos> Do I'.
A few nights ago, they sent a girl to my room to wish me luck. She wanted to sleep with me.<eos> Governor Davey sent me a telegram and a case of Coca-Cola.<eos> I should emigrate.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> This girl, she wanted to get pregnant.<eos> I think she was ordered to get pregnant.<eos> Isupposel should be flattered.<eos> I think all things considered, you're actually better off in America.<eos> I don't...
Come on back here.<eos> Both of you, come on.<eos> A little closer.<eos> You're him, alright.<eos> A free man.<eos> After all this time now.<eos> Tsk! It must really be something.<eos> You know, you got a felon on the books here.<eos> You know that?<eos> I do.
I miss you, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> Give me your head.<eos> Do you feel my hand?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You feel it?<eos> I do.<eos> You have me.<eos> You didn't before, but you do now.
Forget it!<eos> I'm not explaining it to you.<eos> 'Cause then it's not funny.<eos> So, daughter of the chief... I thought you stayed in the village.<eos> You know, kissing babies and things.<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to understand... why your people decided to send...<eos> How do I phrase this?<eos> You.<eos> My people didn't send me.<eos> The ocean did.
Brother.<eos> As you were.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where did he say the restaurant was again?<eos> Do you mean the canteen?<eos> Of course, the can-canteen, yeah.<eos> "The restaurant."<eos> You're not in France now, you bleedin' spanner.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> - Do you?
I know.<eos> Okay, so we're playing here and Raphina walks by.<eos> - So where do I jump from?<eos> - Here.<eos> How'd that look, lads?<eos> Yeah, it looked all right.<eos> It's a bit shit.<eos> That supposed to look like they're jumping in or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't.
I say we ask if we can play there.<eos> First gig.<eos> - We're not ready.<eos> - We could be.<eos> We need a deadline, something to prepare for.<eos> We have exams.<eos> We need to prepare for them.<eos> Yeah, they're midterm exams.<eos> They don't mean anything.<eos> Yeah, well, they do to my ma.
Be my guest.<eos> You sure?<eos> Don't just say that to be polite.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Even Nic?<eos> You don't want Nic for yourself?<eos> Nic?<eos> No.<eos> I don't. No.
Kim, today we are meeting Ali Massoud Sadiq.<eos> I sent research.<eos> He's likely to be Attorney General.<eos> - Please hold. - Please come outside.<eos> This is against what I believe as an American.<eos> I am sorry, but we have to go.<eos> My shoes.<eos> Shit.<eos> You wish to interview me, Mr. Ahmadzai?<eos> I do, Mr. Sadiq.
I am now married.<eos> I want to have children.<eos> It will not happen again.<eos> It's not gonna...<eos> "I ride after a deer and find myself chased by a hog.<eos> "I plot to get what I want "and I end up in prison.<eos> "I dig pits to trap others and I fall in.<eos> "I should be suspicious of what I want."<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You do.
He said that you're upset about the air time you're getting.<eos> That's just wrong, because this is not about me.<eos> My frustration is with our priorities and what's best for the network.<eos> Isn't deciding what's best for the network my job?<eos> I'm just saying, as journalists, we have an obligation to this story.<eos> And Afghanistan should be on our air more, period.<eos> With the resources we have over there,<eos> Afghanistan should definitely be on our air more.<eos> But the problem is, as much as everyone loves the troops, they don't actually want to watch them on the news anymore.<eos> They just don't.
But you have to take care of them for me, okay?<eos> I love you all so much.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> We want to see mom.<eos> Plus, grandpa can't oppress us.<eos> - We want to honor her life.<eos> - It's the least you could do.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
No, I like it at home.<eos> Call Megan.<eos> Ask her to come back.<eos> She just quit.<eos> She what?<eos> She just told me she got another job.<eos> Shame.<eos> I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.<eos> Mmm.<eos> So did I.
Hold on. Hold on.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Oh!<eos> Rachel, no.<eos> Ann, get in the house.<eos> Your wife hit me on Friday night.<eos> No.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you did.
Anna, please. Please.<eos> There's...<eos> Okay. Go!<eos> I'm gonna stand right here.<eos> I'm not gonna come closer.<eos> I just need to talk to you.<eos> I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.<eos> Where's Tom?<eos> He's lying to you.<eos> He always does.
Un-fucking-believable!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Megan got into his car that night.<eos> You think I don't remember.<eos> You thought I blacked out.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car?<eos> Did Megan get in your car?<eos> No!<eos> Yes, she did!
...you'll love them.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> You're not doing this to me.<eos> You brought this on yourself, Rachel.<eos> If you'd just stayed away that one night...<eos> Just left us all alone...<eos> You brought this on Megan.<eos> In a way, you killed her.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> You did.
Let's go home.<eos> I want you to play La Marseillaise.<eos> Now, you have asked me some strange things...<eos> Play.<eos> Marianne Beauséjour played La Marseillaise in a café full of Germans in '41.<eos> I want you to play it for me.<eos> I know the story.<eos> She was a very brave woman.<eos> I thought they wouldn't find me here.<eos> But they did.
Please.<eos> Jimmy, you got time for a drink?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Five minutes?<eos> Not drop out... leave.<eos> - She has a plan.<eos> - For Christ's sake.<eos> Well, I'm not entirely happy about it either, Jimmy.<eos> - Why would you not tell her that?<eos> - I did.
So you were at home last night, but no-one can corroborate that?<eos> I live alone. Excuse me.<eos> - Sandy?<eos> - Did you go to St. Ninian's beach at any point?<eos> - I never drink and drive.<eos> - Who said anything about driving?<eos> I just assumed.<eos> It's too far to walk.<eos> So you didn't go to St Ninian's beach?<eos> No, I didn't.
The boy you argued with is now the subject of a missing persons enquiry.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Next time a stranger picks a fight with me, I'm walking away.<eos> Is that what happened?<eos> - He picked a fight? - Aye.<eos> Well, some of the blame is mine.<eos> I was twice his age and at least twice as sober.<eos> I should've known better.<eos> It's just... Sometimes, someone pushes your button, you know?<eos> Maybe you don't.
It's on your bottom!<eos> I gots it.<eos> Seems to know you, gal.<eos> Look.<eos> It is a golden phizzwizard.<eos> I wish I could hear it.<eos> Here.<eos> It be's very soft.<eos> Do you actually hear what these dreams say?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Words.<eos> They's all such a twitch-tickling problem to me all my life.<eos> I knows exactly what words I want to say but somehow or other they all comes out squiff-squiddled 'round.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> That happens to everyone.<eos> Not like it happens to me.<eos> I speak in the most terrible wigglish.<eos> Well, uh, I think you speak beautifully.<eos> You do?<eos> You really do?
- how long?<eos> - Decades.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I gather you have a seat on the council.<eos> I could not be more proud.<eos> It's a shame that your return is not under more festive circumstances.<eos> It is said that the Western Coven was utterly destroyed.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> It's a blessing you escaped with your life.<eos> Well, many did not.
This is David, son of Thomas.<eos> Who I haven't seen for many, many years.<eos> You must excuse the attention.<eos> Our coven doesn't receive many guests, by design.<eos> We do as we wish... - not as others would have us do.<eos> - And what of the Lycans?<eos> We are too far removed for them to take notice... and even if they did, our climate is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.<eos> This coven wouldn't exist... - without your mother's grace.<eos> - You knew my mother?<eos> All vampires do, my boy. No.
We do more than work, you know.<eos> We explore, like, America.<eos> We party.<eos> A whole bunch of shit.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Hey, yo, Jake!<eos> - I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> - I don't.

Losers' Night.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me get the money.<eos> - My sales?<eos> - Just give it to me.<eos> Krystal's gonna be pissed 'cause we missed the pick-up.<eos> So I just need something to grease the wheels, like a peace offering.<eos> But I did the sale. It's my money.<eos> I've got it.<eos> - No. We did the sales.

The underside of that Reaper drone is fixed with a big ass antenna.<eos> Snarfing the hardware ID of anything that broadcasts.<eos> We, then geo locate em'. My friend Tasha here with the Air Force reins Hellfire. There she is now.<eos> Hey, Trev. You liking' the show? -You know it.<eos> We track 'em, you whack 'em.<eos> -And who did we just track?<eos> Not who, what.<eos> We're targeting bad guys' cell phones. Sometimes a SIM card.<eos> Okay. And how do we know the bad guy is in possession of the bad cell phone?<eos> We don't. - Of course we do.
People always said I was kind of a robot.<eos> How is it that you came to be in Russia?<eos> Well, I never intended to come here, you know.<eos> My passport was revoked on route to Latin America, so when people say, why are you in Russia?<eos> I say: "Ask the State Department."<eos> Does that mean you're willing to go back and face trial?<eos> Absolutely. If it was a fair and public trial.<eos> Unfortunately that's not what would happen right now as long as the Espionage Act is being used against whistleblowers.<eos> Do you still think it was worth it?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Yeah I don't mean... this is it...<eos> I mean, this is... it could feasibly be... yeah for... I could be on tour with this...<eos> Do you like the music you're playing?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know... what... what it matters.<eos> Well, it matters because... if you're going to give up your dream.<eos> I think it matters that you like what you're playing on the road for years.<eos> Do you like the music that I play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
What I can't figure out is how you saw him from all the way up there.<eos> You didn't fall down the fucking hill, did you?<eos> Did you fall down the hill?<eos> I had like two, three drinks, tops.<eos> Yeah, that's why you can't walk straight.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> I'm carrying a dead body and I have his schwantz in my face.<eos> So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.<eos> You can't even say Baryshnikov.<eos> You did, didn't you?
You just shot at us.<eos> I think it matters.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I made a film.<eos> I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.<eos> And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> - It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.
All right, you know, everybody, in the corner.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Well, that really worked out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now we just gotta find that fucking Chet before John Boy does.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, that guy said he was going for a drink.<eos> You take the roof bar.<eos> I'll take downstairs.<eos> - Well done, kiddo.
But there are servers that are impossible to hack.<eos> You can hack everything.<eos> Will you mind looking?<eos> I turned off the autofocus and I don't remember where it was.<eos> I am a computer guy.<eos> Well, Gena?<eos> Wait a bit.<eos> I'm selecting the right patch.<eos> Hack, you hacker.<eos> Done.
Each computer has its own password.<eos> I see.<eos> Tell me, what's this golden share?<eos> Our company has two biggest shareholders, Mr. Putman and Mr. Gubsky.<eos> Each of them has approximately 45 % of shares.<eos> For any decision to be made, you need 50 % plus one share.<eos> -So, Novikov?<eos> -Absolutely right.<eos> Did Novikov have any conflicts with the shareholders?<eos> No, he didn't.
And you'll pay me for overtime.<eos> And also raise my salary by 30 %.<eos> What?<eos> You heard everything.<eos> You know what?<eos> Get your things and get out from my house.<eos> I won't go anywhere.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm calling the police.<eos> Please do.
She's got no motive and she has an alibi.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mr. Guskov, where were you this night, between 3 and 5 AM?<eos> -At the place of someone I know.<eos> -What's the name of that someone?<eos> Svetlova.<eos> Our secretary.<eos> Dasha, come to my office.<eos> Mr. Guskov, didn't you arrive at 11:15 PM to Novikova's house?<eos> Yes, I did.
The expert examination showed that there were no traces of extraneous substances in your blood.<eos> Blood has nothing to do with it.<eos> I inhaled it through the nose, get it?<eos> I inhaled it.<eos> Why did you steal Barkov's blood samples?<eos> To synthesize the preparation and understand its influence on me.<eos> Why did you slander psychiatrist Kuleshov?<eos> His real name is Salamatin, he is the father of Polina, who suffered from the doings of Professor.<eos> And he keeps her in a glass dome in some shelter.<eos> Yes, he does!
That's why you get 200,000 people surrendering to 60,000.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> Now, the thing is, politicians, they don't understand tactics.<eos> And soldiers, they don't understand strategy.<eos> But Caesar, he understood both.<eos> Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
Cheese!<eos> You're gorgeous.<eos> Calling it a compound is a joke.<eos> We've got exposure on three approaches.<eos> Overlooked from the south.<eos> And there's a road splitting it in two.<eos> We're wide open.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do we have shovels?<eos> We do.
Hm?<eos> Sir, I'm sure we can find a way to draw ourselves back from the brink.<eos> Then recognize Katanga's legitimate government and president in a United Nations resolution.<eos> That's simply not going to happen.<eos> Then enough of this, Dr O'Brien.<eos> The United Nations went from peacekeeping to peace enforcement.<eos> And your mission has failed.<eos> Did you forget about your fellow Irishmen left out in the field?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Because I didn't.
I've always wanted to come here.<eos> Quit screwing around, Donnie.<eos> Thirty seconds till the cops are at the door.<eos> Donnie...<eos> Shredder and the mutants were definitely here.<eos> And I'm detecting traces of neutronium, the critical ingredient required for creating a controlled black hole.<eos> Which is the only thing capable of rupturing the space-time continuum.<eos> And you know what that means!<eos> No.<eos> I don't, Donnie.
It's not just lying to my cousin.<eos> We'd be lying to everyone.<eos> But you have to remember what's at stake.<eos> We're talking about tens of thousands of lives, and the future of Scotland itself.<eos> Surely that's worth the price?<eos> Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.
That's right.<eos> So outraged she filed an appeal in a probate court in hopes it would agree with her you deserved nothing.<eos> That's right.<eos> Did that outrage you?<eos> No.<eos> I understood why she felt like that.<eos> You understood it but filed a countersuit against her.<eos> Did that help diffuse her outrage?<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.
This is my subpoena, only pretend it has a "C" on it.<eos> You should feel okay.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I do.<eos> Then you're a worse liar than the stepfather.<eos> Any case, there's nothing else to do.<eos> We're out of witnesses.<eos> We're done.<eos> I want to call Naz.<eos> No, you don't.
How many times have you had sex, with women or men?<eos> Once before, with a girl.<eos> Only once before?<eos> And you don't remember anything about this second time?<eos> There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.
And there's not gonna be some kind of consequence?<eos> And keep doing it?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> We got another connection. Friend of yours and my last job before this fucking retirement.<eos> Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
Nobody sells this out.<eos> You sold 15,000 seats.<eos> That's still really good.<eos> No, it's not good.<eos> Hammerleg sold this place out last week.<eos> Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.<eos> They're concerned about ticket sales.<eos> What? But it's an 18,000 seat place.<eos> Nobody sells that out.<eos> Hammerleg did last week.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about this, would you?<eos> Oh! I wish.<eos> This is like genius prank shit right here.<eos> Next level. You would have to be the best prankster of all time to think of something like this, and, well, shit, that's me.<eos> Maybe I did do it.<eos> No, I didn't do it, or did I?<eos> No, I didn't, or maybe I did not do it.<eos> Did you? I didn't do it, or I did.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I don't.
Yo, this is Hunter about to head into the Poppies.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> No, sorry, we're with Snoop.<eos> Surprise, mothafucka.<eos> You're watching my brand new show, Surprise Mothafucka with Snoop Dogg, and, mothafucka, you been surprised.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can somebody move?<eos> Mariah Carey, your hair smells and looks great.<eos> Did you know Aquaspin has hair dryers and flat irons?<eos> No, I didn't.
Do you know what you're doing?<eos> I fix ships, not people.<eos> - God damn it!<eos> - Just hold him still.<eos> Where's Alex?<eos> I'm comin', I'm comin'.<eos> - Oh, Jesus!<eos> - Oh, patch him up.<eos> I'm not Shed, I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> - Neither did he.
Hey.<eos> I went easy on you before.<eos> But now...<eos> You're not gonna pass through the restricted zone on your way home, "bosmain."<eos> We can't go around.<eos> Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.
I don't why but I like it.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> I might take up singing again.<eos> I've always wanted to sing.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> The lift had to be down!<eos> Wait for me.<eos> They'll feed us their vile apricot chicken.<eos> The Vaunoy cook very well.<eos> Sure they do...
I mean, we got kids!<eos> I mean, you owe him that much.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, buddy, it's me.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hi, Dad, I'm sleeping.<eos> I know. I know, OK.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> Dad, did you get my card?<eos> I did.
What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Dad, will they?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You know, I've seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
No, they won't.<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Dad, will they?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You know, I've seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No, you didn't.
It was supposed to be Donny.<eos> I'm just a backup.<eos> Well, I can just repeat that I'm astonished that Joe didn't run this by you, thorough as he was.<eos> Yeah, because he knew what I would say if he would have asked.<eos> Hey.<eos> You want to keep it down, you fucking morons?<eos> My kids are sleeping.<eos> I am so sorry. I mean...<eos> Lee, you want to get these fucking pinheads out of my house please?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's just the logistics.<eos> I just got to work it all out, I swear.<eos> How?<eos> By sending me to Wonkatonka, Minnesota with Uncle Donny?<eos> Minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota. Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one knows where she is.<eos> I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to give you all the things in life that everyone else gets to have and all the things I thought I didn't deserve to have till I met you.<eos> And they might laugh at us.<eos> They might call us names, and they might think we're weird, but it doesn't matter what they think.<eos> Just please... don't die.<eos> Hey.<eos> You made all that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> We did it... together.
Did you order something?<eos> He just got out of jail, he just do what he wants.<eos> He was jailed because of mail bombs.<eos> Yesterday he ate the whole content of the dog's bowl.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Come see.<eos> Get you ass off the hammock now.<eos> I will throw you out, if this continues.<eos> Did you order from the Venus catalog again?<eos> No, I didn't.
You think that your five-foot-four kindergarten teacher is gonna...<eos> Who is, uh, I don't know, 62, is gonna pull out her ak-47?<eos> Well, not every single person has to be armed and use a gun, but the more people that have them makes the world a safer place.<eos> So that's a heck of a long barrel.<eos> Let me ask you somethin', okay?<eos> Just in the world and life, what do you need a barrel that long for?<eos> Great question.<eos> How 'bout it's two o'clock in the morning and some methed-out lunatic is trying to break into your house to rape and murder your kids?<eos> What do you do then?
Frappucino would be nice if anyone's going out.<eos> How's the feet?<eos> Embarrassing. Thanks for asking.<eos> How's the investigation?<eos> Clearer by the minute.<eos> Oh, I doubt that.<eos> I wanna talk to the boy again.<eos> And I wanna live forever.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> You did.
I don't mock the Drowned God.<eos> I am the Drowned God.<eos> From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.<eos> ( wind howls )<eos> ( chuckles ) You're old, brother.<eos> You've had your time.<eos> Now let another rule.<eos> I heard you lost your mind during a storm on the Jade Sea.<eos> They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.<eos> They did.
- Angel, listen to me.<eos> You call him.<eos> You tell him he does this and the Minister becomes a martyr.<eos> I cannot have my presidency built on murder.<eos> You see that.<eos> He will not leave this to the voters.<eos> He does not believe in the American system.<eos> Angel, believe in me.<eos> I can make this happen.<eos> We do.
Bishop!<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> How well do you know this Dante?<eos> Not well.<eos> So keep your eye on him.<eos> Our boy is gonna get himself killed.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> You know this lunatic, Dante?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - Are you?<eos> 'Cause it sure as shit don't look like you're working on anything here.<eos> Well, you should spend more time here.<eos> - It's a process.<eos> - I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.
- How are my strawberries?<eos> - Delicious.<eos> Here.<eos> Do you want more?<eos> Have a seat. Have some strawberries.<eos> I read your book.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - An incredible text on terrorism.<eos> - You never mentioned it.<eos> - What? Sure I did.
Horn Hill.<eos> My father's-- well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.<eos> They'll take care of you both.<eos> "Wherever you go, I go, too."<eos> That's what you said.<eos> I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.<eos> That's all I want-- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.<eos> Us and everyone else in the world.<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

There, that's a start.<eos> - Only the girls.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Not that.<eos> Of course not that.<eos> Innocent games.<eos> Fun games.<eos> Drinking games.<eos> We do not drink.<eos> Until you do.
Steve's with my associate, Dr. Kalgary, about to undergo an irreversible, fabulously risky, height-boosting procedure.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Steve will be sliced into pieces, and when he's reassembled, he'll be exactly like the boy you remember, only taller and with a lot more bones... if he lives.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why would Steve do something like this?<eos> Wait, does he think he stopped growing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do?
Yes.<eos> Well, I must say, I think you're absolutely ideal.<eos> Did I mention that I also compose?<eos> - And he also composes.<eos> - Yes, I'm sure he does.<eos> Well, you know, there are some other candidates to hear, Bunny.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Some more.<eos> - Do you know any of them?<eos> - I do.
Then you absolutely must come to Keep Fit.<eos> Regular leg-overs would make all the difference.<eos> Trixie, do stop trying to inveigle everyone to signing up for your wretched class.<eos> You'll be standing on the Commercial Road soon, throwing shark nets over every girl who passes by.<eos> KNOCK AT DOOR<eos> I just think that both you and Barbara stand to benefit.<eos> Besides, I'm terrified no-one will come.<eos> Hello, Phyllis.<eos> - Ooh, do you want to join Trixie's new Keep Fit class?<eos> - I do not.
No, don't.<eos> Please...please don't.<eos> I've had an accident.<eos> Oh, it's not the end of the world.<eos> It was that exercise.<eos> Me clothes are soaked.<eos> Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me, so's I can go out through the hall?<eos> Of course.<eos> Has this happened to you before?<eos> Well, it does, doesn't it, to women?
- I'm not.<eos> - I'm going home to Wales.<eos> - Really?<eos> There's nowhere suitable for her to live, Sister.<eos> She's been so poorly.<eos> Your daughter is welcome to lodge here with us.<eos> I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.
We attend Spanish classes together.<eos> That is of no consequence.<eos> Mrs Smith's wellbeing clearly is.<eos> Please. Let me explain.<eos> No, no explanation is required, Mr Smith.<eos> Everything is perfectly clear.<eos> Could I buy you a cup of tea?<eos> We've a great deal to do and no time for tea.<eos> I shan't ask you a thing about it but you don't have to pretend nothing's happened.<eos> We all do that too much of the time.
Have they told you when she'll be allowed home?<eos> Er, not yet.<eos> But they said I can take Marina in to see her soon.<eos> Only bad thing is, er, Jeanette keeps asking for her Nana Meg.<eos> Meg hasn't seen her?<eos> Thinks she'll make her sick again.<eos> I keep telling her she won't, but don't make no difference.<eos> Jeanette don't care about her being a carrier.<eos> She just wants her Nana Meg back.<eos> We all do.
Look.<eos> Hot water, whenever you need it.<eos> Space for a fridge.<eos> You don't even need to take the rubbish out - you just drop it down a chute.<eos> And think how easy it would be to clean.<eos> No need to scrub those poor hands till they bleed.<eos> I'm always going to have it, aren't I?<eos> Meg...<eos> I know what typhoid can cost a family.<eos> I really do.
And quite soon, I think you're going to be saying it for real.<eos> This morning, I went to the doctors.<eos> I'm in the family way.<eos> Ian!<eos> Ian!<eos> Look, you can run all you like, but it won't go away!<eos> We love each other, don't we?<eos> You said you loved me, when we did it.<eos> And I meant it.<eos> I really did.
Sister, this was the kinder way.<eos> We couldn't even tell whether it was male or female.<eos> May the Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> May he make his face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you, and grant you peace.<eos> I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
It's the third baby we've delivered with these sorts of malformations in the last 12 months.<eos> May I tell Mrs Cottingham, when she wakes from her operation?<eos> The rules state that we don't go into the postnatal ward.<eos> Yes.<eos> And sometimes rules are best broken.<eos> But leave it till tomorrow.<eos> I'm not drunk, Mr Hereward.<eos> Giving up something you really want is hard.<eos> I know that.<eos> You do?
And it wasn't possible for us to save it.<eos> Did it die?<eos> Yes, Ruby.<eos> In my arms.<eos> Sister.<eos> Was it a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> Always knew.<eos> Yes. Yes, you did.
Yes. Yes, you did.<eos> Did she cry?<eos> A little.<eos> But when she took her last breath, she was warm and safe...<eos> .. and I believe she was aware she was loved.<eos> I wished so hard for her.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I'm being punished.<eos> - But God knows I love my boys...<eos> - He does.
Because I'd rather lie all my life - all your life, and his - than tell the world to take a running jump.<eos> People are going to wonder where your bump went.<eos> And if they ask me, I'll tell them the truth.<eos> Can I hold him?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> Just take him.<eos> He's yours.<eos> I'm a mum, Mum.<eos> And I don't even know where to start.<eos> You just did.
Oh, don't cut it yet!<eos> In a minute, then.<eos> There's worse things than being completely part of someone, being part of something bigger.<eos> Even just for a little while.<eos> But we know where we belong, don't we?<eos> - Are you coming with us?<eos> I shall be following behind, just to be on the safe side.<eos> But you don't need me -- you've got him.<eos> You really have -- and he knows how to take care of his family.<eos> Yes, I do.
But King James is the truth.<eos> LeBron can ball.<eos> [Pop chuckles] Yeah.<eos> Now pay up, Luke.<eos> You said "bullcrap."<eos> "Bullcrap" ain't a curse, man.<eos> I don't curse.<eos> - [imitating Luke] "I don't curse." - [laughs]<eos> You don't cut hair either, negro.<eos> Like, really, what do you do up in here, bruh?
And... from where I'm at... that idea seems like bullshit.<eos> [scoffing] You innocent?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> [sighs]<eos> You are.<eos> I'm guilty of a lot of things that people will never know about.<eos> I guess it's karma's way of reminding me... that she can be a bitch.<eos> You should tell the group that.<eos> You really do care, don't you?<eos> I do.
What's there not to like?<eos> Zip and Amos picked up the truck from the docks right after I shot Scarfe.<eos> Domingo got his guns back last night.<eos> Everyone else will fall in line.<eos> Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans.<eos> Hell... even the Koreans.<eos> All loyal.<eos> We're all good.<eos> So... when do I get my Judas?<eos> You don't.
Neat.<eos> Mariah?<eos> How the hell did you get in here?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Alone.<eos> So, this Luke Cage was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?<eos> Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.<eos> He was filling in for Dante that night.<eos> One man is linked to a criminal, the death of four people, the destruction of a restaurant, and you don't find him suspicious?<eos> Of course I do.
Next to the dishwashing station.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.<eos> Nice sweatshirt.<eos> You box now?<eos> What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
[yells and breathes heavily]<eos> [Shades] You having second thoughts?<eos> [Shades sighs]<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> I'm not having any thoughts.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> As long as you stay on the clock, it doesn't matter.<eos> The secret to every great lie is it has to run parallel to the truth.<eos> Every moment wasted brings you one step closer to jail.<eos> So what do we do?
- No, no, no.<eos> That's not your shield.<eos> That shield belongs to the city of New York and its people.<eos> And when you lose control, go upside somebody's head because you had a bad day... or you feel powerless...<eos> - or you screw the wrong person...<eos> - I didn't screw anybody.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> You don't deserve to represent the people of New York, let alone protect them.<eos> That's not true and you know it.<eos> I do.
So it stops with me.<eos> I am my brother's keeper... whether I like it or not.<eos> It's on me.<eos> This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Yes, it does.
Listen, his name is Diamondback.<eos> I believe you, Misty.<eos> There are dozens of other people to talk to.<eos> And Luke is still wanted for Albini's murder, Cottonmouth's murder,<eos> -and attacking those cops.<eos> -You are not listening to me.<eos> Luke Cage is innocent of everything.<eos> And after we have him in custody, we'll verify it.<eos> Look... I trust you.<eos> I do.
I'm a regular guy, just trying to live life on his own terms, one day at a time.<eos> Are you single?<eos> [reporter 2] Do you have anything to say to Councilwoman Dillard?<eos> [all clamoring] [reporter 2] Have you received any medical treatment?<eos> [reporter 3] How does it feel to be vindicated?<eos> You can take a seat.<eos> Mr. Cage.<eos> My name is Inspector Priscilla Ridley.<eos> You realize there is a warrant still out for your arrest.<eos> I do.
You ready?<eos> If you see Ren, tell him that I loved him too.<eos> I will.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - What happened to the girl? - She was going to kill you.<eos> - I had to take her.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> She disappeared.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I'm at Union Wells High School in Odessa, Texas, the same place she went to school.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Tommy, I know you're out there, and I really hope you get this message.<eos> I'm at Union Wells High School in Odessa, Texas, the same place she went to school.<eos> It has been changed.<eos> As far as I know. That's all I have.<eos> Otomo patched up his prison in "Evernow," and check out what was just recorded in a high school three miles from here.<eos> I called your new hit woman, and I sent the team in to back her up.<eos> I'm at Union Wells High School... That's all very good, but if Tommy has seen this, we need to send Otomo.<eos> I already did.
Tell her, Mr. Church.<eos> Oh, a true vision, my dear.<eos> The dress is perfect.<eos> Come and stand next to your mother so I can get a picture.<eos> Well, put it on a timer.<eos> - We need a picture of the three of us.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> - Come on now.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Oh, ma'am, you shouldn't be up.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> I... I heard the music.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have turned that down.<eos> NO, I-I like it. I...<eos> I was imagining Charlie dancing in her dress.<eos> Do you dance, Mr. Church?<eos> There are those who play music... and there are those who dance to it.<eos> And the rare person who does both.
- Yeah.<eos> - Feel it.<eos> Isn't that fabric wonderful?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Aunt Poppy plans to spoil you rotten.<eos> These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
And in the house, he found the kindest woman... and her beautiful little girl living there.<eos> And the man told the woman... that he apologized for coming in the house this way... but he was following this ladybug... and that he looked everywhere all over the place.<eos> He couldn't find it no more.<eos> He promised her that he'd leave.<eos> But the woman said, "Don't leave.<eos> She said, "Stay here with us."<eos> She said, "We don't have much, but everything we got..."<eos> we'll share with you."<eos> And did he stay?<eos> He did.
She said, "We don't have much, but everything we got..."<eos> we'll share with you."<eos> And did he stay?<eos> He did.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because for the first time, he felt safe.<eos> For the first time, he wasn't afraid.<eos> He felt happy-<eos> And he promised that if he ever saw... that ladybug again... that he was going to thank her.<eos> Did he?
They said all boys needed to pay!<eos> They kicked me, and they hit me, and then they held me down and drew this vagina on my face!<eos> They said it was to send a message!<eos> That's a vagina?<eos> Yeah, see?<eos> Here's the top of the vagina, and there's the balls.<eos> It's starting, you guys!<eos> None of us are safe anymore!<eos> I didn't know vaginas had balls.<eos> Yeah, no, they do.
According to the Codex, the weaker the Ellcrys gets, the stronger he becomes.<eos> But he will not be truly free to walk this Earth until the last leaf has fallen.<eos> Kill the Chosen, kill the Ellcrys.<eos> Until then, he will dispatch his Demons to carry out his murderous biddings.<eos> Like he has done here.<eos> Can my father and I please have the room?<eos> Father, you need to send this Druid away.<eos> People are starting to talk, they don't understand why you're under his thrall.<eos> You mean you don't understand.<eos> No, I don't!
Amberle was secretly corresponding with her.<eos> I found them hidden in her room.<eos> Why would the princess need to write in secret to her aunt?<eos> We had a falling out many years ago.<eos> She fell in love with a Human.<eos> And when she asked for my blessing, I refused.<eos> Because she didn't love an Elf?<eos> Because she loved you, Allanon.<eos> I thought she understood that there was no future for us.<eos> Well, evidently, she didn't.
She cancelled on me this morning.<eos> I don't know.<eos> And she's not my girlfriend.<eos> So what, you're not a lesbian now?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Here.<eos> What's this?<eos> The speech.<eos> I wrote it.<eos> I did the speech for you.
Notice something between the mother and the attendant?<eos> First name basis.<eos> Thomas this, Thomas that.<eos> I don't call my shopkeepers by their first names. I don't even know them.<eos> You think there might be some hanky-panky going on?<eos> She's back to normal.<eos> - "She's back to normal"?<eos> - What?<eos> Kaminski said "She's back to normal".<eos> Did he now?
- Do you believe that there was one?<eos> Why would my husband lie?<eos> I read everything you did.<eos> I know everything you made her do.<eos> I didn't touch her, Mr Redmond.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself?<eos> Did you enjoy taking her virginity?<eos> Did you enjoy making her a woman?<eos> - Did you?<eos> Did you?
She spoke to me in confidence.<eos> - About what?<eos> - I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I'm not you.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You've broken confidences.<eos> - Only when I thought it necessary.<eos> - I can't break the rules like you do.<eos> - I don't break the rules!<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Look, I'm a doctor.<eos> Just give me enough tablets until I get a prescription.<eos> Have you seen your sister today?<eos> Why don't you ask the ferrals?<eos> She one of them now, ain't she?<eos> What about last night?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you see Chloe last night?<eos> Jesus, Adam?<eos> No... I didn't.
Someone heard screaming.<eos> They don't have to live with her going on about aliens and shit.<eos> You want a beer?<eos> No thanks.<eos> Don't know why you come round here all high and mighty.<eos> What you think you're gonna achieve?<eos> Patronizing me, you fucking hypocrite.<eos> What are you on about, Travis?<eos> See, I know what you're up to.<eos> - Do you?
What does that mean?<eos> Max said you were talking about Dr McKenzie.<eos> - I asked her.<eos> - What?<eos> What did you ask her?<eos> I wanted to know about Gillian.<eos> Why would you ask about that?<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, no, I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
You saw them?<eos> She had packets in the car.<eos> - I think it was ecstasy.<eos> - How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> She was saving up to leave town.<eos> I think she was selling for someone.<eos> It would help us if you answered the question, Miss Macy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> Doctor.<eos> I didn't.
What's his address?<eos> We're not going there again, are we?<eos> Chloe Holloway. She had the same markings.<eos> - The same?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's vital that I see him.<eos> I need to get a blood sample.<eos> I'm not supposed to give out addresses.<eos> There's lots of things that aren't supposed to happen here,<eos> Sandra, but they do.
- Roy!<eos> Roy!<eos> Roy!<eos> Jesus, Max, calm down.<eos> Somebody knows.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> My family was threatened and now my daughter's dead. Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there. What we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.
- Yeah I'll have a look around.<eos> There's something not quite right around here, Fergus<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> It's the lights.<eos> They always bring trouble.<eos> You can see here, the indentation on the head, neck, and lower spine.<eos> Weapon?<eos> Some kind of angled iron.<eos> Maybe a part of a machine or ... - So basically you don't know<eos> - No, I don't
You can't bear me being happy, can you?<eos> You never liked Travis.<eos> He's never stood up beside the likes of Max or the other men in this town.<eos> You think I don't know how you and the others talk about him?<eos> We worry about you.<eos> Don't. Be happy for me.<eos> What do you really want, Barbara?<eos> I want to know what happened to Chloe.<eos> I'm sorry. Of course you do.<eos> We all do... We all...
Never mind.<eos> He's probably at the Cygnet office.<eos> Fergus?<eos> Think we can rule out a university professor.<eos> More than half the town still thinks Anna did it, you know?<eos> So?<eos> More than half the town believes in spaceships.<eos> But you don't believe she did it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
The way he's taken off.<eos> You think Travis killed Chloe?<eos> Travis left because of me.<eos> Not because he killed somebody.<eos> I know my grief drives people away.<eos> No one can understand the pain.<eos> Renae ... It's Chloe's funeral today.<eos> Roy should have stood by you, all those years ago, that's the truth of the matter.<eos> He had his faults.<eos> We all do.
Mr. Strobridge.<eos> - Janie, go around and grab me some other flies.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Mr. Bohannon.<eos> Little troublemaker.<eos> Watch out now.<eos> Huntington's gonna fire you, you don't fall in line.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I won't blow myself up?<eos> Did four clean sweeps today.
- Get to it, Major.<eos> - We have to call it off.<eos> - No chance.<eos> I ain't risking the rope to walk away with empty pockets.<eos> There's no money, John. Campbell won't pay.<eos> John Campbell cannot afford the political fallout of my death.<eos> - He will pay.<eos> - He's brought the cavalry onto us.<eos> And they have Indian trackers, who are going to find us.<eos> - And when they do...

I think I've a notion of who you're wantin' for this.<eos> I've not seen my cousin anywhere since this whole thing started.<eos> Pains me to say it,<eos> but that's what I'm figurin'.<eos> Your own blood.<eos> He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.
You can end this.<eos> Just leave me here and make a run for it.<eos> I don't like to leave things unfinished.<eos> You're a therapist.<eos> Oh, did I give that away with "aberrant functional connectivity"?<eos> How many times have you told your patients that just because they make one mistake doesn't mean they have to make two?<eos> Hundreds of times, darling.<eos> But I talk to prisoners.<eos> They rarely listen.<eos> - And when they do?
Uh, don't worry. I'm...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You went through hell.<eos> Nobody expects you to be fine.<eos> Please don't say anything to Jane.<eos> - I-I don't want her worrying about me.<eos> - Like you could ever stop her?<eos> But I, uh... I understand.<eos> You know how much I care about you, Maura?<eos> - I do.
A thief? !<eos> Cop, thief ...<eos> it could have gone either way.<eos> - Just saying.<eos> - Well, smart kid.<eos> Come on, Vince.<eos> Who doesn't love a gondola?<eos> Ma, she could get seasick.<eos> You never know.<eos> - Does she?
I'm moving too fast.<eos> I-I got swept up, and I-I pushed for something that you're not ready for.<eos> No, no, that's not it.<eos> I would love to go away with you.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But, um... dropping everything and jetting off to Europe...<eos> I don't know why, but... it's hard for me imagining myself getting carried away like that.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - You do?
I'm starving.<eos> Is there a lot of people out there still?<eos> Packed, right?<eos> Is this the cheeseburger?<eos> Kato, you like them burgers, huh?<eos> Oh, I love them.<eos> You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mm-hmm. You did, huh?
Scott, Lucy, in the conference room!<eos> Let's go over the Lopez prep.<eos> Mr. Cochran, is Ms. Lopez present here today?<eos> She is, Your Honor.<eos> And do you anticipate that we can hear what she has to say in one day?<eos> I would expect so, Your Honor, barring any acts of God or further child-care crisises from Ms. Clark.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> I am offended by Mr. Cochran's remarks, as a woman and as a mother.<eos> Mr. Cochran may not know what it's like to work a 70-hour work week and also take care of a family, but I do.<eos> And many other people do, too.
I know it.<eos> I'm gonna find out how he did it, and when I do... there's gonna be hell to pay.<eos> But it was him.<eos> So, it was Bob Shapiro who made you live a double life while you were married with Barbara?<eos> I shut the press right down today, baby.<eos> You'll never hear another word about it.<eos> I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.

The idea of O.J. just standing there, in front of the cameras and the jury, wearing those gloves...<eos> Chris, come on.<eos> We're going downstairs to get our conviction today.<eos> We have his gloves with all the DNA, everybody's blood, the fibers, all of it.<eos> We have a receipt that proves he owned them.<eos> We're done.<eos> We've been dealt a king and a ten.<eos> I don't know why you want to ask the dealer for another card.<eos> Because I know it's an ace.<eos> No, you don't!
Oh, certainly.<eos> The matching process is many, many times more accurate than a fingerprint.<eos> "Many, many times more accurate than a fingerprint."<eos> And what were the results of the blood analysis from the Bundy crime scene?<eos> Well, the RFLP pattern from item 47 shows us that...<eos> Oh, let me rephrase.<eos> Other than the two victims, did this incredibly precise DNA matching show anyone else's blood and DNA at the scene of the murders?<eos> It did, uh, just one individual.<eos> And does this same DNA match the blood you found on the back gate at Bundy?<eos> Yes, it does.
Now you're talking. Now that's what I'm saying.<eos> Hold on a second, O.J. What?<eos> It is a terrible idea!<eos> I mean, are you doing this just to screw with me?<eos> Amazingly, this is not about you, Bob.<eos> This is about winning this case.<eos> What is your idea?<eos> Another plea bargain?<eos> If Marcia Clark cross-examines him, it will be an unmitigated disaster, and you know it.<eos> What if we do a mock-cross?
What matters are these tapes.<eos> We must get them.<eos> "Get niggers"?<eos> "Frame niggers"?<eos> That takes my breath away.<eos> These tapes will allow Mr. Simpson to walk free.<eos> Well, let's not get... too cocky.<eos> I mean, we haven't heard them.<eos> Look, lucky breaks don't just fall from the sky.<eos> Oh, yes, they do, Mr. Scheck.
Johnnie, stop!<eos> You're turning this into a referendum.<eos> Now, granted, it's a mixed decision, but Ito's given us enough to work with.<eos> Bob, you're blind.<eos> He's knocked out the manufacturing of evidence.<eos> That's what gets us to the planted glove.<eos> Now, look, I appreciate your passion.<eos> But we've been hired to defend a client, not to burn down a city.<eos> Now, I'm sorry that you're disappointed, and I understand...<eos> No, you don't!
It is about O.J. Simpson and the "M" word, "murder."<eos> I'm not afraid to point to him and say he did it.<eos> Why not?<eos> The evidence all points to him.<eos> In February 1992, Nicole filed for divorce.<eos> She was running away from the man who said he'd kill her.<eos> She saw the explosion coming.<eos> Why else fill a safe-deposit box with threatening letters from the defendant, a will and police photos of past beatings?<eos> She knew that the bomb could go off at any second.<eos> And then it did.
You look absolutely beautiful.<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Tommy's orders.<eos> No upsets tonight.<eos> Your hair, everything.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
But it's very hard when you're man and wife.<eos> We were late coming down because we were having sex.<eos> Afterwards he told me everything.<eos> Royalist Russians buying weapons to fight the Bolsheviks in Georgia.<eos> A lost cause, Tommy says.<eos> Churchill is the go-between but it's against government policy so everything must be kept a secret.<eos> You know it's begun.<eos> They started the business tonight.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
And you're sure you know what that is?<eos> Same thing men always want.<eos> And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.<eos> You're a good talker.<eos> I like that.<eos> You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.<eos> That so?<eos> I had to work hard to get him talking.<eos> But he talked.<eos> They all do.
You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother.<eos> Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.<eos> Come and see.<eos> Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."<eos> Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.<eos> His father's dead.<eos> Ramsay killed him.<eos> - And now he has Rickon.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Mazin, Hornwood.<eos> Two dozen more.<eos> Together they equal all the others.<eos> We can start small and build.<eos> The North remembers.<eos> They remember the Stark name.<eos> People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.<eos> No, but I do.
I carry it with me every single day.<eos> Good.<eos> I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.<eos> And now we must fight them together.<eos> We need each other.<eos> I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.<eos> At a certain age, it's hard to recall.<eos> But the truly vile do stand out through the years.<eos> Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?<eos> I do.
Stay safe.<eos> The night is dark and full of terrors.<eos> "Seven save you, friends."<eos> I'm a fucking septon.<eos> What was I supposed to say?<eos> They don't believe in your Seven.<eos> They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.<eos> Aye, well, all are welcome here.<eos> Anyway, we got nothing for them.<eos> Sure, you do.
Anyway, we got nothing for them.<eos> Sure, you do.<eos> You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't.<eos> And you've got women.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Fight them?<eos> Kill them?<eos> It'd be you against all of them.<eos> I mean, these people don't know how to fight.<eos> You do.
What's left for you here?<eos> You wouldn't be safe.<eos> Not while she's looking for me.<eos> Who?<eos> She doesn't have a name.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
I'd like to see that.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Milk of the poppy.<eos> I don't want any.<eos> Sleep is the only way you'll heal.<eos> Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?<eos> Course we do.
I truly do.<eos> How do you live with yourself?<eos> All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we?<eos> You have to sleep at night.<eos> How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?<eos> I was your sister's prisoner once.<eos> She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She should have killed you.<eos> Perhaps, but she didn't.
All right, tell me.<eos> What should we do?<eos> How do we get Rickon back?<eos> We'll never get him back.<eos> Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.<eos> As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.<eos> We can't give up on our brother.<eos> Listen to me, please.<eos> He wants you to make a mistake.<eos> Of course he does.
I see that now.<eos> I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.<eos> The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair.<eos> The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice.<eos> But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.<eos> I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires.<eos> My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven.<eos> May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.<eos> You understand fully what this means?<eos> I do.
According to the Codex, the weaker the Ellcrys gets, the stronger he becomes.<eos> But he will not be truly free to walk this Earth until the last leaf has fallen.<eos> Kill the Chosen, kill the Ellcrys.<eos> Until then, he will dispatch his Demons to carry out his murderous biddings.<eos> Like he has done here.<eos> Can my father and I please have the room?<eos> Father, you need to send this Druid away.<eos> People are starting to talk, they don't understand why you're under his thrall.<eos> You mean you don't understand.<eos> No, I don't!
Amberle was secretly corresponding with her.<eos> I found them hidden in her room.<eos> Why would the princess need to write in secret to her aunt?<eos> We had a falling out many years ago.<eos> She fell in love with a Human.<eos> And when she asked for my blessing, I refused.<eos> Because she didn't love an Elf?<eos> Because she loved you, Allanon.<eos> I thought she understood that there was no future for us.<eos> Well, evidently, she didn't.
That's... my... ear!<eos> Little one.<eos> You came back.<eos> You owe me another ear.<eos> Sure you want to do that?<eos> It happened when I hit the water.<eos> I floated downstream, and it slammed into this jagged rock.<eos> Thought I was going to drown.<eos> Do you think he made it?<eos> Of course he did.
Because that kiss...<eos> That was nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Wil, It's like you said, we can't let our feelings get in the way.<eos> Just so we're clear... my feelings aren't "in the way."<eos> My feelings for you are what keeps me going.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Elf Hunters, huh?<eos> Do you know anything, or not?<eos> Of course, I do.
Yeah, I mean, either/or...<eos> Orange or blue, whatever one you're standing on, it's gonna look good.<eos> I was thinking about that, um... you know the blue rug.<eos> Maybe we don't get it, like, for my place, but...<eos> Like, what if we got it for, like, our place?<eos> You wanna move in together?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -I mean, do you?<eos> Do you--
This bracelet, her hair...<eos> It's a memory.<eos> And memories are powerful things, kubo.<eos> Never lose it.<eos> One more question?<eos> Last one.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> The armor?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
You look.<eos> Golden heron.<eos> It's believed they hold the souls of the departed.<eos> Carrying them over to wherever they need to go.<eos> Hm.<eos> What are they singing?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Many say the song's about what happens when we die.<eos> How we don't just disappear.<eos> We don't?
Mostly I unclog people's toilets.<eos> Keeps me grounded.<eos> Well... you seem good.<eos> You always had that look in your eye.<eos> Like you knew something about the world that other people didn't.<eos> You're talking about me in the past tense.<eos> Look, I didn't know what to expect coming here.<eos> I mean, when I saw you the other night, you seemed different.<eos> Well, you just said I seemed good.<eos> You do, okay?
One of us is always with her.<eos> When you came to pick me up at the station, she was alone<eos> Locked in her room.<eos> I don't like locking her, Julieta.<eos> I do it to protect it her.<eos> That's no life.<eos> Julieta, we're all doing as well as we can.<eos> Do you know what it would cost to put your mother in a nursing home?<eos> I thought you hired a woman to care for her.<eos> Sana'a does.
Help me to the refuge.<eos> Let me stand by His Holiness as I have stood by him since his birth.<eos> We cannot take the chance.<eos> Mongols!<eos> You.<eos> Come with me.<eos> - Did you find him?<eos> - We're close.<eos> - You know you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Get off of him!<eos> Hey.<eos> - Ok. Stop. Stop.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Enough!<eos> We have to move it.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's been cut down.<eos> Bellamy: You don't know that.<eos> We do now.
Okay, let's wrap up the one-man show and get you up to dry land, okay?<eos> Oh, what do you care?<eos> You still love her.<eos> Yeah, but I still don't want you to die of a rare pond disease.<eos> Oh, what am I doing?<eos> Fuck!<eos> What am I doing, Ray?<eos> I don't know how to be a husband.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Yep. We almost... we almost won the bet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We almost did it! W-W-We almost won the bet?<eos> We're gonna do it! We're gonna win the bet!<eos> We're gonna win the bet!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Here it is, paid in full:<eos> one year's rent.<eos> Free rent for a year! We did it!<eos> We did it! Free rent for...
Helene... you know, she knows what she wants.<eos> She doesn't second-guess herself.<eos> It's really sexy.<eos> See if it's safe to leave?<eos> - I want to have sex with you.<eos> - We don't need that.<eos> - I'm on the pill.<eos> - Cool.<eos> You can't have a boy in your bed.<eos> - You do.
Or should we ask them which fucking language they'd prefer?<eos> I'm not clear.<eos> You said while this business was going on in London you wanted peace at home.<eos> And the only way to guarantee peace is by making the prospect of war seem hopeless.<eos> If you apologise once, you do it again and again and again.<eos> Like taking bricks out of the wall of your fucking house.<eos> - Do you want to bring the house down, Arthur? - Ah...<eos> If you're soft on rebellion, it'll grow.<eos> Bloody "soft on rebellion".<eos> You did the right thing, John.
A man who wants to live a clean life, here you are signing up for the biggest robbery of all.<eos> I have to hand it to you, Tom, you're a smart man...<eos> Are you in or out, Charlie?<eos> Curly?<eos> - Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - It's all right. - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> No, honestly, it's all right.<eos> Vodka!<eos> I sewed your buttons back on.<eos> I wanted to see if I did a good job.<eos> Yeah, you did.
And this... specimen... this is just one sad, pathetic skell.<eos> There are plenty of scumbags out there.<eos> Plenty.<eos> So stop waving your pom-poms and go catch some!<eos> Yes, stare all you want.<eos> Big whoop.<eos> You got me. I'm cool.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I said I'd catch him.<eos> And I did.
It was him, Doc!<eos> It was him!<eos> I'd say that's learned him, Master Bruce.<eos> We were supposed to have a training session.<eos> Yeah, well, I got held up in the city, didn't I?<eos> Besides, I thought your chat with Dr. Thompkins would keep you occupied.<eos> And I thought you were against therapy.<eos> Well, that's before I realized you're so keen on keeping secrets.<eos> If I had told you what Selina and I had planned, you would have stopped me.<eos> Because I didn't,
Yeah, I guess.<eos> No.<eos> I.A. is reopening the investigation into Galavan's murder.<eos> Why?<eos> An eyewitness came forward.<eos> You told me it was over, Jim.<eos> You swore to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew in my heart that it wasn't, but I let you lie to me.<eos> I didn't.
And who doesn't like to play God?<eos> Bruce!<eos> Bruce!<eos> Please let me go.<eos> Bruce, listen to me.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Alfred told me everything.<eos> He shouldn't have done that.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
Bruce!<eos> Please let me go.<eos> Bruce, listen to me.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Alfred told me everything.<eos> He shouldn't have done that.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I don't.
The public, the people of Gotham?<eos> The ones you and I serve?<eos> They have to know, they have to see that we're impartial, you understand?<eos> The people of Gotham can eat my socks.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Walk away in a huff?<eos> Now I know you know something.<eos> If you're providing aid and shelter to Jim Gordon, anything-- a glass of water-- I will bust you like a bum I never met.<eos> Cap, I wish I knew where he was.<eos> But I don't.
Ginny.<eos> How's my favorite I.A. Sugar plum, huh?<eos> Well, why do you think I'm calling, baby?<eos> Heard you were getting married.<eos> She changed her mind.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> Oh, you're an animal, Bullock,<eos> - you know that?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> I do, I do.
Well, if you would allow us to apply rigorous dream therapy, we would know, for sure.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> We do have a very useful hammer, Ms. Peabody, but not all of our patients are nails.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What the hell happened last night? ?<eos> Ah...<eos> Stumbled onto a mugging.<eos> And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.<eos> Where'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
- My help? - ?<eos> I didn't kill Pinkney.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> ? Yeah. Yeah, I do.<eos> I need to find the man who framed me.<eos> Whoever it was, he covered his tracks well.<eos> But I have something.<eos> A recording of his first call to I.A.<eos> I.A. secretly records everyone who calls in.<eos> They do?
Yes, you should have done.<eos> But you didn't, did you?<eos> You can't unfry an egg, as my dear old mum used to say.<eos> So why don't we leave Master Bruce's situation alone and why don't we discuss yours.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Right, so you were framed for the murder of that other police officer.<eos> You escaped from prison, you then tracked down the man that framed you and you were promptly shot in the leg.<eos> Right, so, answer me this, Detective.<eos> Do you have any idea how you're gonna get out of this awful pickle?<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, good choice.<eos> Hey, Jim.<eos> Be careful out there.<eos> Always.<eos> It's gonna be a bad day for the hit men of Gotham.<eos> I said, where's The Lady?<eos> ! No one knows!<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> Someone knows.<eos> I don't.
We should get back to work.<eos> - Or we could fall asleep for five to seven days and see how we feel.<eos> - I will not rest till justice is served.<eos> There's no time to waste.<eos> This case is urgent.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> All right, listen. The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> Um... I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> - You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> - I did. I did. I did.
- I can't even imagine what you're going for.<eos> I was being devastating!<eos> Look, man, I get that you're pissed, but I am telling you, Ozerov is dirty.<eos> Maybe, but if we had staked the bar out, we could've built up cases against a dozen guys here.<eos> This place is filled with criminals.<eos> I brought him in last month.<eos> - Hey, Detective Boyle.<eos> - Hi, Isaac.<eos> The only good thing is, now this whole trio doesn't have to work together anymore.<eos> Yes it does.
Gina, come on.<eos> You can do your Internet socializing in the truck.<eos> Okay, cool, I just have to tie my shoe real quick.<eos> Tying it.<eos> Call Jake Peralta.<eos> Gina, hey, how's the stalling?<eos> Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.<eos> Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?<eos> Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.<eos> You did.
- Oh, she started stripping?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Boss impaled her on a pole when he caught her skimming tips.<eos> Ooh! Damn, dude.<eos> Look, coming back from 12 years undercover is not easy for anyone.<eos> I'm sure Diaz gets it.<eos> She's so in touch with her feelings.<eos> And me, hmm.<eos> After what I've seen, after what I've done, I don't know that I deserve to be happy.<eos> Of course you do.
Jake Peralta, will you do me the honor of being my best man?<eos> Best man?<eos> Adrian, this is all so sudden!<eos> - Rosa told you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But I would be honored.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - I'm gonna kiss you now.<eos> - Oh, you don't have to.<eos> - Already did it.
- What?<eos> - Come with me.<eos> Stand back, everyone.<eos> You're all in the splash zone.<eos> This ute's gonna boot.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What the hell?<eos> We agreed you weren't gonna do that.<eos> You disobeyed a direct order from your handler.<eos> Yeah, I did.
What's he done?<eos> He's been great.<eos> It's just...<eos> I think they might wanna take him away and maybe he'd be better off back here.<eos> I get returns all the time.<eos> Some cats just don't take to their new family.<eos> When I met your father, I hoped it would work out.<eos> I know it's stupid, but sometimes I feel like my dad's looking out for me through the cat.<eos> You miss him.<eos> I do.
Not...<eos> I mean...<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> It's really beautiful, Abbie.<eos> Do you want to fool around...<eos> with me?<eos> Really?<eos> [Abbie] Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
with me?<eos> Really?<eos> [Abbie] Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> You know, I'm recovering from cervical cancer.<eos> I know.<eos> Your hair smells good.<eos> I make my own shampoo.<eos> Of course you do.
I, uh, I love you.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I think that I'm too close to you... to have sex with you.<eos> I know it's confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can... I can help you get over that.<eos> I don't want to get over that.<eos> Yes, you do.
You know your guns.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Wasn't a compliment, son.<eos> Dominique.<eos> I'm excited about watching the game with you tonight, sir.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I invited Carl to watch the DePaul game with us tonight.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Wasn't a compliment, son.<eos> Dominique.<eos> I'm excited about watching the game with you tonight, sir.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I invited Carl to watch the DePaul game with us tonight.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
We have a deal.<eos> - A deal for what?<eos> - D... p...<eos> Fucking ki...<eos> For you to kill my daughter's asshole of a fiancé, fuckhead.<eos> Killing someone.<eos> Wow.<eos> Pretty sure that would be illegal.<eos> What, are you trying to rip me off?<eos> I already did, you moron.
No.<eos> Stop. I have a-a duty... to walk my daughter down the aisle and to give her away.<eos> Jesus, are you high?<eos> Yes, I am, actually, but that's beside the point.<eos> Come on. Come on, Frank.<eos> Let's go. Nobody wants you here, Frank, just go.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> I may not have always been a great one, but I'm still your father and I'm gonna walk you down that fucking aisle.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> Uh, no, we don't.
I'm not trying to get back my ex-wife, Ray.<eos> And please stop calling me Neal.<eos> Well... can't you get them to change their mind?<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to rally the teachers and get them to support me, but like I said, nobody likes me.<eos> Who cares about the teachers?<eos> The students like you. Don't they?<eos> The students.<eos> See? They like you, right?<eos> No, they don't.
Do you have a coffee mug like this?<eos> "World's best principal."<eos> Where's your fucking coffee mug, Neal Gamby?<eos> Why does fucking Belinda Brown deserve to have it?<eos> Fuck this mug!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> - Eat shit, Belinda Brown!<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> You see how it just went everywhere?<eos> Fuck yes, I did.
Dos cien.<eos> Hola, Bud!<eos> Yeah, listen, Ernesto.<eos> I want you to tell your nephew to back off with my daughter.<eos> Bud, why would I do that?<eos> They're happy together.<eos> They've been going out for four years.<eos> What? !<eos> You knew about this?<eos> Sure, everyone did.
I respect your choices.<eos> Yeah, Ma, I did it.<eos> It was great.<eos> Later, y'all.<eos> I gotta pee so bad, dude.<eos> Okay, me too.<eos> Got it?<eos> Oh, my bladder is quivering.<eos> Do you know Steve Jobs stunk and cried all the time?<eos> I did not.
Goddammit.<eos> Something's wrong with this stupid bike.<eos> Hit the gas harder, Neal.<eos> You got this!<eos> I don't think it's gonna work, but I'll try.<eos> Come on.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Yes, Neal!<eos> Twelve o'clock!<eos> Holy shit! I did it!
Thank you very much.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Better hurry.<eos> It's a kill shelter.<eos> Kill shelter?<eos> What's that mean?<eos> Jesus, you're the most clueless pet owner I've ever known.<eos> No wonder the fucking thing ran away.<eos> - Did you remember to give it a thing called "cat food"?<eos> Yes, sir, I did.
Did I... Did I do something?<eos> Was it me?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> No, no, it was an honor working with you, too.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> I... I'm sure we will cross paths again.<eos> Okay.<eos> They just killed me off the show.<eos> - What?<eos> They did? - Yeah, they did.
Do you handle cash in that hotel of yours?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I suppose you stole some of it?<eos> Or all of it?<eos> Would anyone notice straight away?<eos> Not if I was clever about it.<eos> Ah, well, luckily you are clever, Jonathan. 'Cos I checked.<eos> Did you?<eos> Course you did.
No.<eos> Oh, T.E. Lawrence... of Arabia.<eos> The lonely genius who wished only to be a number.<eos> Would you put that back, please?<eos> Whose initials are these?<eos> They're my father's.<eos> It's private.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't realise it meant that much to you.<eos> Yes, you did.
He was undercover in Belfast, wasn't he, your father?<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> Same regiment as you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I read that they had to put his uniform back on before they buried him.<eos> What do you want, Ms Burr?<eos> I want to make you an offer.<eos> Come and work for me... and afterwards when it's all over, I will look after you.<eos> Resettlement, new name, new identity, new life.<eos> An offer to do what?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.<eos> Does Jed know?<eos> No, of course not!<eos> Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.<eos> Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.<eos> Do you think I should tell her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> If it's worry for your boy, forget it.<eos> He knew what he was getting into.<eos> Did he?
Notes.<eos> Doesn't matter which currency, dollars are best.<eos> - That's all I have.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm going to get you out of here.<eos> I promise.<eos> I took a photograph of your list on my phone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why on earth did you do that?
Hi.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - This is your American friend.<eos> What news?<eos> Authorisation received by US military to seize and search the convoy of 20 aid trucks, 1800 hours local time at the Syrian border.<eos> - You're a good man, Joel.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> The convoy has been identified and is being tracked by US military satellites.<eos> - You want a visual?<eos> - 'Course I do.
Doesn't sound like fun.<eos> Yeah, no shit, doll-face. I was doin' the chopping'.<eos> So then... you don't wanna read that book to me?<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> Then don't.<eos> Shit on a biscuit!<eos> Colorful language.<eos> You've always been good with words.<eos> Don't act like you know me.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I will...<eos> Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you.<eos> Oh, this won't take up much of his time.<eos> Sorry to bother you, sir.<eos> There's a Mr. Thorn here to see you?<eos> Thank you, Arlene.<eos> I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge.<eos> Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in?<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Yes, I do.
She...<eos> She what?<eos> She... ugh.<eos> Look, man, I get it.<eos> You've been through a lot lately.<eos> What do you say we get out of here and get some much needed RR?<eos> We got a few weeks before we head out.<eos> I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh... Harold Rolston.<eos> We don't work for Reuters.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now.
What can I do for you?<eos> Are you here about that fracas in Syria?<eos> No.<eos> I need some information.<eos> I'm not quite as inside as I used to be.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> We all know people, Damien.<eos> Ann Rutledge.<eos> You know her?<eos> I do.
The tree that Brent, his wife, and three young daughters had so beautifully decorated with angels and twinkling lights mysteriously caught fire.<eos> Their house in Georgetown went up in flames while the family slept.<eos> Everyone was incinerated.<eos> Another fire.<eos> The hospital where I was born in Rome... burned down.<eos> They said it was an accident.<eos> Be careful, Damien.<eos> I've seen more than my fair share in my day.<eos> Not much surprises or frightens me.<eos> Ann Rutledge does both.
I'm not certain that's in the cards.<eos> From everything we know about the boy...<eos> He's 30.<eos> He's a kid that doesn't know his ass from his elbow.<eos> Turn him over.<eos> We can't put a gun to his head and just say, "Bring about the apocalypse."<eos> There are very mysterious forces at work.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> Remember, Ann?<eos> Oh, I do, John.
Are we going, then?<eos> Oh, well, great, you're coming.<eos> Dad isn't back yet.<eos> So?<eos> Well, I just thought we could all go together.<eos> Do you want to go see Alice? I'm here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well...<eos> I can't keep coming around.<eos> Then, don't.
I suppose you have some fee in mind for this service.<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes a service is its own reward.<eos> Just let my friend and me walk away right now and we'll call it even.<eos> Start walking.<eos> You're not just gonna let her walk out of here?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hey, Miss Nobody.<eos> Did you really think that I was gonna let you leave?<eos> No, actually, I didn't.
I'm getting while the getting's good.<eos> But before I do... figured I'd pay my tab.<eos> Where the hell did you get this?<eos> Now, you know better than to ask.<eos> Point is, you spent your retirement fund getting me out.<eos> Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you.<eos> - He does.

I can't thank you enough, Count Rostov, and you, Countess, for your kindness to me.<eos> Nonsense it's our pleasure.<eos> You're one of the heroes of Austerlitz.<eos> Nothing to be proud of, sir I'm just a man who loves to fight.<eos> It's all I know, to my shame.<eos> Don't disparage yourself, Fedya none of us will believe it anyway.<eos> Then I'd better say nothing about myself at all.<eos> How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?<eos> Well, we thought we were doing very well, until Denisov told us we were doing it all wrong.<eos> - You did.
To choose or be chosen.<eos> And then, that's our lives settled... for ever.<eos> It's frightening.<eos> You just have to choose right, that's all.<eos> But how will I know?<eos> You will.<eos> But will I?<eos> I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.<eos> Why on Earth not?<eos> Everyone else does.
Evolving?<eos> Men don't change!<eos> If you could drain the blood from their veins and put in water, there might be no war!<eos> You're talking old women's nonsense, sir, but I'm happy to see that there are still a few idealists left on Earth.<eos> I want you to go to Otradnoe.<eos> The marshal there, Count Rostov, has failed to produce half the men required of him.<eos> The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.
Well, I think you should ask her yourself.<eos> I'll go and fetch her.<eos> (CLEARING TH ROAT)<eos> Dearest Natasha.<eos> I know I've been a clown and wasted my life, but I have to ask you.<eos> Say no, and I'll go to Petersburg, and never bother you again.<eos> But...<eos> Do you think you could love me?<eos> Yes. Yes, I could.<eos> Yes, I do.
Surprises me though, to be honest, that... someone of your success, big-time innovator like yourself would have time to care about such things as family.<eos> He's all I care about.<eos> You've changed.<eos> How so?<eos> Oh, well, you know, you used to be so, uh, forward thinking, driven to make it, change the world, all that stuff.<eos> Well... people can change.<eos> I suppose you think I've changed.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I remember we had, uh, a few laughs in college, but it's been a while.<eos> Oh, yes, we did.
Prometheus?<eos> Thief of fire.<eos> Does it ring a bell, Ken?<eos> Hmm?<eos> You stole my ideas and you pawned them off as your own.<eos> What ideas?<eos> No, tell me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You know just as well as I do, Ken.<eos> No, I don't.
Dawes?<eos> Police.<eos> We need to talk to you.<eos> I did go by her parents' place.<eos> How come?<eos> Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?<eos> As a matter of fact, no, she didn't.
Nope.<eos> That's number four.<eos> What's number one?<eos> Number one.<eos> Does it have anything to do with those twins in Barbados?<eos> No way.<eos> That's nine.<eos> Nine?<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
Every year you come here expecting the 44th to win, and every year you lose.<eos> Last year, your runner came in what, 19th?<eos> With a running time of 27 minutes 9 seconds.<eos> Year before that, your runner came in 25th, - which sucked!<eos> - All right.<eos> Care to put your money where your mouth is, memory queen?<eos> - Okay. 100 bucks.<eos> - All right, done.<eos> You got it.<eos> - Done.
Maybe you could try checking it out.<eos> Oh, we will.<eos> We'll check it out.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Okay, what have you got?<eos> Okay, so check it, boss.<eos> I got a search warrant for Rhonda's personal computer.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I remotely accessed it, and it's got mostly personal stuff on it except for one large protected file, heavily encrypted.<eos> Yeah, but you cracked it, right?<eos> - Of course I did.
I'm gonna give it another 20 minutes.<eos> I don't wanna come home empty-handed.<eos> All right.<eos> Love you too.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You know you want it.<eos> You're in over your head, cop.<eos> Trust me, you don't wanna do this.<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
Maybe he knew about Russo framing Tendler.<eos> He was gonna give sealed testimony in front of a closed grand jury.<eos> You think Sandra Russo, a decorated police officer, our captain, murdered Shane Barton to cover a lie that she told?<eos> This is a lot to swallow, Al.<eos> We have to follow the evidence, and the evidence right now points to her as the prime suspect.<eos> I can tell you've got something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are not gonna believe this.<eos> Look, now, I spent the whole day on Gibson Rowan's computer.<eos> He definitely did Barton's murder.
It's, uh, been a long time.<eos> I didn't know you were in town.<eos> Yeah, um... back about five months now.<eos> I wish we were seeing each other under different circumstances, but I'm glad you're here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hold on, Reverend.<eos> I didn't come to see the boy.<eos> Not to help, at least. I came 'cause...<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Sure you do.
- Mm! One of them looks like Will Smith.<eos> And the other one, he...<eos> Well, I bet he's real nice.<eos> Well, you gonna get to know 'em today, okay?<eos> I need you to stay in here all day and keep your eyes on these two.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You want me to watch your kids the entire day?<eos> Well, what...<eos> Well, I don't think that this really falls under my job description.<eos> Well, it does today, Mr. Russell.
One for all.<eos> What about that?<eos> Four years is a long time.<eos> We learned to live without you.<eos> Constance, you asked for me?<eos> What's the urgency?<eos> Well, I think you're going to be needing this.<eos> What are you up to now?<eos> You have every right to live any life you wish.<eos> We all do.
Little things matter.<eos> All right, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Bye, Carrie.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Cody?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What's holding your attention on this little screen?<eos> Uh, here, look.<eos> I could send you the clip if you want it.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
Why'd you want to go there?<eos> 'Cause I might be able to do one thing.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Bang, got you, you're dead.<eos> Come on, Ellen, now you're dead.<eos> Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!
'Cause I might be able to do one thing.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Bang, got you, you're dead.<eos> Come on, Ellen, now you're dead.<eos> Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!<eos> - You do?
I admit I got a little ahead of myself.<eos> A little exuberant and for that, I apologize.<eos> But the headline here is, I think we've gotten nearly 200 phone calls since this one airing.<eos> Cliff, since you and I spoke last night, 72 more.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Right there.<eos> - That's the sound of victory.<eos> - Jimmy, stop selling.<eos> And don't act like you don't see the problem here.<eos> - I don't.
It's a simple question, Kim.<eos> Did you or did you not know about this commercial?<eos> I...<eos> Yes. - He showed it to me...<eos> - He showed it to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> A few days ago.<eos> - And you didn't say anything to anyone?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Really?<eos> From where?<eos> Schweikart Cokely.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Rich Schweikart said that they would even pay off my law school loans.<eos> That's great!<eos> Please let me be there when you tell Howard. Please.<eos> So why the sad puppy eyes?<eos> What, you don't want that job?<eos> No, no, of course I do.
And the most important part, the schools are good and the neighborhood is great.<eos> I called the local precinct and asked about crime stats, they're some of the lowest in the city.<eos> Plus, I got a good vibe from him.<eos> They sounded really responsive.<eos> That sounds perfect.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> If you're happy, I'm happy.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Wow.<eos> It's great!<eos> Good.<eos> Not Wexler-McGill. But Wexler and McGill.<eos> We find an office, share the housekeeping costs, the rent, electricity, everything.<eos> But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law, and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law.<eos> Both free to practice as we see fit.<eos> Separate firms under one roof.<eos> We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?<eos> You do things your way and I do them mine.
No, not like this, but we learned about fractions in school.<eos> You did?<eos> What fractions?<eos> 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.<eos> You know, I gotta tell ya, you are much smarter than I was when I was your age.<eos> Maybe you needed better teachers.<eos> That could be.<eos> Can I do the drill now?<eos> - You promised. - Oh.<eos> I did, didn't I?
- See ya, Ernie.<eos> So, Chuck, ‭what's the deal with the locks?<eos> Kim, I was hoping to have this conversation with you and you alone.<eos> However... I guess it's time to clear the air once and for all.<eos> Clear the air about what?<eos> He sabotaged me.<eos> Buddy, what are you, uh...<eos> Please. Don't bother.<eos> You and I both know ‭exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't.
- Aye.<eos> - What key?<eos> The musical key.<eos> Whoever wrote this had a diabolical sense of humor.<eos> Oh, aye, diabolical.<eos> Two flats means you take every second letter, beginning at the start of the section.<eos> Three sharps means you take every third letter, beginning at the end.<eos> Does it make sense?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, it does.
I doubt we'll be that lucky.<eos> Dismissed, all of you.<eos> Dismissed!<eos> Move it!<eos> Bloody sheep.<eos> A word with ye, Uncle.<eos> Listen, lad, I ken ye're trying to do what ye think is best, but I was teaching men to fight while you were still sucking your mother's tit, God rest her.<eos> So I think I know a wee bit more about this than you do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
You get the point.<eos> UNCLE JACK: Uh, Your Honor, I'll-I'll, uh,<eos> I'll keep it brief.<eos> I just have three things to say.<eos> Uh, one: Liam McPoyle has a history of lying.<eos> My client is a loving family man.<eos> And three: He is innocent.<eos> Deandra Reynolds, you were the one that told the police that Bill had spiked the punch with bath salts.<eos> That's correct. But you didn't actually see him do it, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
-Hang on.<eos> OK, I see it.<eos> -Look!<eos> Yeah, that's the one.<eos> Tom Kha Gai, yes.<eos> With shrimp...<eos> Just a sec.<eos> Go ahead. -Shrimp, galangal, coriander seeds... Remember the scarf?<eos> It was knotted, on the pillow, and you said: "Look! They've even tied the knot!"<eos> I did?
Then go on and call the police!<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> Already this morning, you were on edge.<eos> Enough, shut your mouth!<eos> ...then I saw for the first time that confused look on his face.<eos> He looked just as confused when I told him I got into university.<eos> But he confused me the most when he caught Relu smoking.<eos> I don't know if I told you...<eos> Relu the rebel?<eos> No, you didn't.
- Center door. - Okay.<eos> Fuller?<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm here to find your file.<eos> Should I come to you, or go get the file?<eos> - Go get the file.<eos> Is Big Man okay?<eos> - It's, uh, it's Amituana.<eos> - You know, he's a member of the Samoan royal family.<eos> - Huh. No, I didn't.
-Vanilla.<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Mm. It's good.<eos> How's it going in here?<eos> -Not what you'd expect.<eos> Noisy. Um... lonely.<eos> No privacy.<eos> You know, my wife's gone.<eos> - No, I didn't. - Mm-hmm.
She's the one I can do without.<eos> The moment I believe you are no longer necessary to this endeavor, you go on that ship, that ship turns back for London, and soon thereafter, you swing over Wapping.<eos> Except that you can't actually do any of those things.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you don't know that Samuel Wayne has never once paid for a drink.<eos> Because you don't know that the Boyd brothers can't be in the presence of anyone from Captain Moulton's crew.<eos> 'Cause you don't know which of the street merchants is in the pocket of the brothel madam.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know... you don't know.<eos> But I do.
Nor would I be a ward of yours.<eos> I've made something for myself here.<eos> I'll make it again somehow, but I've come too far to go back.<eos> You'll take the pardon, I presume. Who knows?<eos> I haven't got that far yet.<eos> But wherever we land, Anne and I will be taken care of.<eos> Taken care of?<eos> How?<eos> You set aside some of the gold?<eos> She did.
Maroons.<eos> Escaped slaves.<eos> They must have a camp upriver.<eos> She is everything here.<eos> Priestess, governess, warlord.<eos> She's not to be underestimated.<eos> Spain. What did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would secure the remains of the Urca De Lima's gold and return it to Havana.<eos> You set aside some of the gold?<eos> - She did.
What?<eos> The reports from the Bahamas.<eos> English operations in the area and a dossier on the new governor.<eos> Part of an invasion plan in case they decide to go in.<eos> No, this isn't remotely a plan.<eos> It's just someone's notes. Fragments.<eos> Is there anything of value in it?<eos> Not unless we have an interest in invading Nassau, which I don't think we do.<eos> Do we?<eos> No, we don't.
What step?<eos> We'd need to change our names.<eos> Eventually, the money will protect itself.<eos> It'll hire guards, it'll make us friends, it'll shield itself with investments and partners, but as long as it is in its current form, it is as vulnerable as a newborn babe.<eos> To protect it, given the attention our names will draw to it, we'll need recourse to the law.<eos> And at the moment, the only thing the law wants with Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny is their necks in nooses.<eos> To have that protection, we'll need to assume new identities.<eos> So we change our names for a bit.<eos> - Who gives a shit?<eos> A little bit. I do.
Will you please make sure, when the governor's men visit the inn, they are serviced by girls you trust?<eos> There will be no more information seeping out of the inn.<eos> Of course.<eos> Will you tell her?<eos> Miss Guthrie.<eos> Will you inform her of our suspicions about the source of the leak?<eos> Davis...<eos> Davis, you remember the time the captain...<eos> Do you know him?<eos> I do not.
The point is that while you were doing it, you heard a voice telling you that disciplining him would prevent him from repeating the offense,<eos> a voice that sounded like reason, and there was reason to it, as the most compelling lies are comprised almost entirely of the truth.<eos> But that's what it does.<eos> Cloaks itself in whatever it must to move you to action.<eos> And the more you deny its presence, the more powerful it gets, and the more likely it is to consume you entirely without you ever even knowing it was there.<eos> Now, if you and I are to lead these men together, you must learn to know its presence well<eos> so that you may use it...<eos> Rather than it use you.<eos> You have some experience with this, I imagine, living in fear of such a thing within you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry. But I'm here now, and we will find somewhere else to stay.<eos> I promise you that.<eos> I think it was one of the mountain men.<eos> The whole thing was an elaborate hoax.<eos> They are desperate to scare us away, Matt.<eos> We can't let them.<eos> We can't leave. Not when every cent we have is tied up in that house.<eos> If it was a fight they wanted, it was a fight they were gonna get.<eos> Looking back, I understand why the court gave Mason full custody.<eos> What kind of mother does the things I did during those times?
Yes, of course, yes.<eos> We'll be here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> He's really pissed, but I think I talked him off the ledge.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I understand.<eos> Really I do.
SCOTTY: That's so insane.<eos> Dad, look, he even got in your signature "crotch chop."<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> STEPHANIE:<eos> All right, this here is where we develop a few apps for the Apple and Android platforms.<eos> Hey, gang, say hi to the Flemings. - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> Wait, I don't understand.<eos> Do your employees live here?<eos> Uh, maybe some of them do.
Ned. Don't get the wrong idea.<eos> It was not sexual at all.<eos> It was so much more than that.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Did you have intercourse or not?<eos> Scotty, shut it.<eos> Dad, I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> Look.<eos> Yeah, we did.
There's so much room.<eos> So much room.<eos> It'd really mean a lot to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I owe you two an apology.<eos> When I get nervous all kinds of crap comes flying out of my mouth and I know that's not how you guys roll.<eos> No.<eos> I was just trying to make a good impression. Yeah.<eos> Well, you did.
You'll thank me later.<eos> There we go, girls.<eos> Okay.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, I thought I was gonna make it.<eos> I know.<eos> You almost did, but...
Not long.<eos> You keep going down this path, at this rate, not long.<eos> You're clearly not in a place to listen to me right now.<eos> So I'm gonna go.<eos> Thank you, Pops, for the guidance.<eos> - Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> * A bad mother fucker standing next to me Boom!<eos> Boss, let me get this straight.<eos> You want me to hack into Stephanie's boyfriend's computer and find out if there's any record of him starting a foundation?<eos> Yes, I do.
One second. - Scotty, come here.<eos> - SCOTTY:<eos> Yo, what's up?<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Yeah? I want you to tell Laird about the business idea you mentioned on the plane.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Wait, really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Told you to get that seat at the table, bro.<eos> You did.
The Mail room, yeah so thats...<eos> Yeah, sure, to maybe begin with.<eos> If something comes up in the mail room, I could let you know.<eos> OK so... so there nothing here, now then?<eos> Unless... put you working for me.<eos> Come up with some cock-a-meme title.<eos> I always have some errands to run.<eos> Oh! I'll do anything.<eos> You know anybody in town?<eos> No. I don't.
I want to marry you and take care of you for the rest of your life.<eos> I don't believe you cooled on me so quickly!<eos> And Christ sake! With who?<eos> My nephew?<eos> He's a nice kid, but where the hell is he going?<eos> You said it yourself that it's possible to have feelings for two people.<eos> You love him too?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Well believe it.<eos> I do.
Ok we will bring her along..<eos> I met Judy over Billy Wilder's party. So I know Judy.<eos> See you Thursday.<eos> See you Thursday.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here pleading.<eos> I love you.<eos> I have loved you for over a year.<eos> I handled the best I could.<eos> Maybe it was handled poorly at times.<eos> But in the matters of heart, people do foolish things.
Oh! No, I didn't like it.<eos> I'm not an addicted personality.<eos> It was good?<eos> It was good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But Mongols made me feel sexy.<eos> The Mongols?<eos> The reefers.<eos> But you called them, what?<eos> He did.
What if the damage this could cause Stella Gibson's career was a possible motive for her failure to protect him in the forest?<eos> Spector's whereabouts were leaked by a detention officer within the custody suite.<eos> What if Gibson was in on that leak?<eos> What if Spector's life was deliberately put at risk by Gibson through police misconduct?<eos> Everyone knew Tyler was out there with a loaded gun and a clearly stated aim to find and kill Spector.<eos> And she let it happen.<eos> Let's make her pay.<eos> Do you have your own room key?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
This is my client, David Alvarez.<eos> David, this is Detective Sergeant Tom Anderson and PC Dani Ferrington.<eos> Thanks very much for talking to us, David.<eos> I haven't yet.<eos> You understand that it's in connection with your conviction for murder?<eos> - Frazer's explained, yes.<eos> I wonder, do you recognise this man?<eos> For the purposes of the tape,<eos> I'm showing David a picture of a male individual.<eos> I do, yes.
"Green, David, yes."<eos> I think I know why that bowl was there.<eos> And it relates to the modus operandi of Paul Spector, Peter Baldwin.<eos> Are you sure he killed all those girls?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
Henry?<eos> Henry, are you still there?<eos> Henry?<eos> Are you there?<eos> I have to go.<eos> I heard.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I love you, Henry.<eos> I really do.
Doesn't help, Thirsty.<eos> Fine.<eos> If I go down there right now, will you two please leave the building before the cops get here?<eos> Please. Get the charter, 'cause I ain't going nowhere.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Help.<eos> Help.<eos> Hey, Keem.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't do this to our family.
We know that, Mrs Douglas.<eos> We just wanted to ask a few more questions about Michael Freeland.<eos> Please, go ahead.<eos> Before he died, Michael said something.<eos> - Three numbers.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> '11, 12, 13.<eos> I heard him.'<eos> - Do you know what he meant?<eos> - 'Yeah, I do, I do.
You want to know who killed Michael Freeland.<eos> I can help you.<eos> He came to see me.<eos> You know that.<eos> He had stumbled onto something and wanted my advice, and... he gave me something.<eos> Now, this here is a copy of the Our Child accounts.<eos> - He asked me to look at them.<eos> - Why didn't you tell us before?<eos> Because I didn't know who you were.<eos> I do now.
How much is a taxi?<eos> It'll be, like, a fiver.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You missed your exam.<eos> You're a fucking brunette now?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> Why have you been telling lies about Paul?<eos> I haven't.<eos> You said he left comments on your videos.<eos> He did.
- Yeah. Take this t-shirt gun and make yourself useful.<eos> Go for Baskets.<eos> Chip?<eos> Hi, darling, how are you?<eos> Don't call me that, okay?<eos> Look, I need $40 for HBO.<eos> D'accord ?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you get that job?<eos> Yeah, I did.
His name was Arthur Delacroix.<eos> He was 12 years old.<eos> Waits confessed to killing him.<eos> O'Shea's planning to run for mayor.<eos> So this Waits case? Pure political Viagra for him.<eos> Mr. Waits is gonna direct us to the crime scenes, and we will be on top of his every move.<eos> Maybe we should loosen his shackles.<eos> - We don't need a lawsuit here.<eos> - No fuckin' way.<eos> Bosch, just do it!
I got a couple LAPD guys on staff.<eos> - Retired?<eos> - Some.<eos> Some moonlighters.<eos> It's a state of the art set-up.<eos> Cameras everywhere, total coverage.<eos> Remote control.<eos> You can punch in on a pimple.<eos> - You know rich people.<eos> - No, I don't.
Got jammed up by IA, on some petty bullshit.<eos> Had to resign.<eos> Went from working murders to working the gate for a bunch of rich people.<eos> Talk about losing what you got.<eos> - Thanks, Carl.<eos> - It's good to see you, Harry.<eos> Tony went to Las Vegas frequently for business.<eos> Did he always drive?<eos> He didn't like to fly.<eos> Oh, who does these days?
And when he married the next woman that came along...<eos> Oh, I tried to get over him, I tried so hard...<eos> But you couldn't.<eos> I thought I had.<eos> Until that... one night of weakness.<eos> And a few weeks later, he contacted me and invited me out here.<eos> Which I don't understand.<eos> That's the type of man he was.<eos> I think that he even thought that if I met his wife I would come to like her.<eos> But you didn't?
If X then Y, if X then Y... I thought he was going to propose to me.<eos> I always thought she was one of those people who wasn't interested in relationships.<eos> That's why you'd say that.<eos> And, finally that's how you get to and from the coral reef.<eos> Of course! It's the riddle of the two barbers!<eos> The what?<eos> The riddle of the two barbers!<eos> Understand that, Florence, and you understand who killed Dan Hagen.<eos> You know who killed Dan Hagen?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Aka Trunkmaster Flex.<eos> - Meh. - Oh, whatever.<eos> And what happened?<eos> How'd you screw up a simple handoff?<eos> Wha...<eos> He didn't bring the money.<eos> Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?<eos> I didn't bring it, because... because I don't have it.<eos> - Wha...<eos> Well, who does?
- Ivy, I'm not a hit man, I'm a--<eos> A father, a father who'd like a space at Country Day for his...<eos> I guess, what, mulatto bastard?<eos> I think technically she's an octoroon bastard, but our whole parenting philosophy is sort of, uh, post-label?<eos> Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, so how do you wanna die?<eos> Home invasion.<eos> You break into my house, I startle you, you shoot me.<eos> I assume you have access to a firearm?<eos> I do, yeah-
Suppressing fire!<eos> So, do you have more bullets, or...<eos> No. Oof!<eos> Cyril, I am so mad at you right now, my mouth tastes like copper.<eos> Well, but are you actually mad at me,<eos> Yes!<eos> or... - the bullies who tormented a scrawny teenage boy with no friends?<eos> - You! Because I find it interesting that you were bullied in school, and now as an adult you're a bully.<eos> Do you want to talk about how you bully me?<eos> I do, Cyril.
Phrasing, boom.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Shut up.<eos> And then talk again, but only to help me think of a way to kill Barry.<eos> Why don't we just find his mother?<eos> Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um...<eos> Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
'Cause it's like, up here, so...<eos> Wow.<eos> Name a handsome Hollywood power lawyer who is having major second thoughts about hiring you people.<eos> - Mr. Shapiro!<eos> - Boom!<eos> Square gets the square!<eos> And I get going.<eos> You guys validate?<eos> Mr. Shapiro, please, as I said on the phone, the Figgis Agency values your business, and I can assure you this internal affair doesn't reflect our ability as investigators, so...<eos> - Yes, it does.
Maybe there's a workshop with pliers, a car battery...<eos> And find out where Veronica Deane is with that damn necklace!<eos> Well, she's not in the basement.<eos> - Or in the attic.<eos> - Or in the refrigerator.<eos> Why would she be in the refrigerator?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You said look everywhere.<eos> - Yeah, he's right.<eos> You did.
Nothing.<eos> You're going to have sex.<eos> With a... person?<eos> - What are you...<eos> - I'm gonna double the bet.<eos> - What bet?<eos> - No, shut up.<eos> I would think "person" was implied.<eos> Yeah, no, I just didn't wanna get in that head space and then, you know...<eos> No, I don't.
Take the bet.<eos> Double it.<eos> Is this mirror not working or...<eos> Don't be shitty.<eos> I'm in progress.<eos> And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.<eos> Spanish Fly.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.
Archer, we all had to...<eos> - Where were you on waterboarding day? - Uh...<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> I think I'm supposed to be somewhere.<eos> But I also think I want the lavender instead of the sandalwood.<eos> Right?<eos> - Oh, who remembers?<eos> - I do.
Narrowly missing several crew members.<eos> And yesterday, there was some kind of malfunction with a stuntman's airbag.<eos> That poor devil may be paralyzed.<eos> Well, it certainly sounds suspicious.<eos> But why come to us?<eos> Why not the police?<eos> - I...<eos> - I don't know, Cyril.<eos> Maybe he wanted to be interrupted every five seconds.<eos> I don't, actually.
Oh, really, 'cause I'd like to meet those guys.<eos> Come on, stop.<eos> First of all, not a Smith Wesson.<eos> I know, but I was going for the whole...<eos> - Second of all, this.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> I needed that.<eos> No, you didn't.
Come on, stop.<eos> First of all, not a Smith Wesson.<eos> I know, but I was going for the whole...<eos> - Second of all, this.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> I needed that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
Wait.<eos> You had sex with her.<eos> Yeah, but she was all tore-up drunk.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Plus I was wearing a stra...<eos> - Eww!<eos> - What?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> You'll gag.<eos> She certainly did.
Oh, you're serious.<eos> Well, then, shit.<eos> Where to begin? Umm...<eos> And there is a bit of a clock on this, so...<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, he and Veronica have been in her dressing room for a while now.<eos> And since apparently Archer's penis is like a crack pipe...<eos> What, in size and/or shape?<eos> They said if he has sex with Veronica, she'll fall head over heels for him.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
- Shut up!<eos> So wait...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> So, your alibi is that you were busy committing felony assault.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - She's a real menace.<eos> Shut up, and they all saw me.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> Yes, you did!
Goddamn it, wash everything!<eos> Geez!<eos> Make up your mind, America!<eos> And I need to talk to you.<eos> Now.<eos> All right, Grabney Coleman!<eos> What?<eos> It's about the murder.<eos> Oh, Sterling, I know exactly what you're going to say.<eos> - You do?
Make up your mind, America!<eos> And I need to talk to you.<eos> Now.<eos> All right, Grabney Coleman!<eos> What?<eos> It's about the murder.<eos> Oh, Sterling, I know exactly what you're going to say.<eos> - You do?<eos> - And I know exactly what to do.<eos> - You do.
Hey.<eos> No, you...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> I like a change of music.<eos> How the hell is this your era?<eos> - You hid from me.<eos> - One, I did not.
It has to be digitally stored and ready to be trotted out, should he even think about backing down..<eos> I'm going to send you a photo of Clara Thomson. She'll be front left, wearing a...<eos> ...one shoulder black crepe dress.<eos> If we're lucky, it'll be the only one in the room.<eos> Hey Alex, tell me it's feasible that a doctor wouldn't have time for all this social media bullshit.<eos> But he'd be on Doximity, probably... the medical version of Linkedln.<eos> Could you not just have stopped when I said great?<eos> Good morning! Light reading?<eos> Do you even know what pulmonology is?<eos> Yes, I do.
Of course, you wouldn't have any role the Senate's ethics rule prevent lobbyists from arranging overseas travel for members of Congress.<eos> Indeed!<eos> You know what this is?<eos> Perhaps we can get you a copy.<eos> Are you familiar with that form?<eos> Yes, it's a private sponsor certification form...<eos> It's a copy of the same private sponsor cerification form that was submitted to the Senate Ethics Committee to pre-authorize Senator Jacobs' travel to Indonesia.<eos> Look at the handwriting on that form, Ms. Sloane.<eos> Do you recognize that handwriting?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm not here to cause trouble.<eos> I just need some information.<eos> Is there somewhere else we could talk?<eos> She the one got killed in the papers.<eos> She's the one you saw the night she got killed.<eos> At the gas station.<eos> There's a security tape.<eos> What was going on there?<eos> You know.<eos> I don't.
And so his strength left him.<eos> And she said to him,<eos> The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.'<eos> And they bound him in shackles, brought him to Gaza and gouged out his eyes."<eos> That's what he thinks of women.<eos> And he followed them in his hearse.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> He waited for them to leave. There's no other reason.<eos> And the cops haven't even bothered talking to him.<eos> But you did.
Unlike most cats, tigers are comfortable in water.<eos> You see that, right?<eos> That's recording us, and it will be used in court.<eos> How do you think that's gonna come on?<eos> "She was nice, I liked her, but I killed her anyway."<eos> Detective, what made you so sure so quickly<eos> The mountain of evidence.<eos> So why bother questioning him?<eos> Sometimes a suspect wants nothing more than to confess.<eos> - Did he?
I'm sure, at least not much.<eos> It's my job.<eos> And it's your right.<eos> Is that all?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My dad's the only person in the world who believes me.<eos> Your mother does too.<eos> No.<eos> Well...<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> Should I say it again?<eos> I'm trying to understand this.<eos> You're saying you took it from the crime scene, - and gave it to him?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he needed it.<eos> He was distressed. He was having trouble breathing.<eos> So, instead of taking him to the hospital, which is how it's supposed to work when something like that happens, you removed evidence from the crime scene?<eos> Yes, I did.
What do we do now?<eos> The orders are clear, No prisoners.<eos> Schöll found him, it's him who Will kill him.<eos> It may be easier,<eos> When you have the authority to Order someone something.<eos> Even if it's not worth doing it.<eos> Come on Schöll!<eos> Show us you're a man!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> Do it!
I've found something and I don't know what to do.<eos> I've come to you because...<eos> Well, don't get me wrong, you know about these things.<eos> You have experience.<eos> I wonder if you could look through these accounts from Our Child.<eos> - You know we don't talk about work.<eos> - We do if there's something wrong.<eos> You should have gone to the gala.<eos> Hm?<eos> Why didn't you?
Yeah.<eos> Do you think it's just a coincidence?<eos> What else could it be?<eos> - What are you suggesting?<eos> - I don't know, Lisa.<eos> You tell me.<eos> Look, we raised nearly half a million pounds last night.<eos> Do you have any idea what difference that's going to make?<eos> You just don't get it, do you?<eos> No, Lisa, I don't.
Drop the gun, bitch.<eos> You drop yours, asshole.<eos> Why the hell would he do that?<eos> 'Cause if he doesn't, I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.<eos> Well, since you asked so nicely...<eos> It's okay, son, I got this.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> So, is this a social call?<eos> 'Cause my memory could be failing me, but I don't remember inviting you to visit.<eos> - You didn't.
This is where the magic happens.<eos> I want you to sit down. Sit down on the couch. Get comfortable.<eos> You want to check out some of the posters or, you know, some of the DVDs? I'm gonna get us some cocktails and then we're gonna start the audition, okay?<eos> We're gonna make it vodka.<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> You got me.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> A concerned citizen.<eos> I don't think you want to mess with me.<eos> I do.
- Oh, shit. Shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Calvin.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Where the fuck are you?<eos> I can't... I can't do this, Kurt.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not always gonna be like this.<eos> You think you can still get him out?<eos> No, I don't.
Now take Nikita to the kitchen.<eos> Give me and Sugar a minute.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were just doing what we all wanted to.<eos> Just everybody disappeared all at once.<eos> You know?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Job knew the risks.<eos> We all did.
They did a real number on him.<eos> - He'll be okay.<eos> - How about you?<eos> I really need to get the fuck out of here.<eos> Hello, Ted.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Innocent and Brock knows it.<eos> Well, the evidence says otherwise and the sheriff has to follow up.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I did.
So how you doing?<eos> - You look better.<eos> - Yeah, I'm a real fashion plate.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - What about me?<eos> I hear you went native while I was away.<eos> That's one way of putting it.<eos> - You got another way?<eos> Listen, Job, I tried to find you.<eos> We all did.
I think he killed my father.<eos> Randall's dead?<eos> They left together and then... and then Calvin... and he was covered in blood.<eos> And... and then he... it was... he was terrifying.<eos> It's okay.<eos> That's my mother's sweater.<eos> It is.<eos> She never wears it.<eos> - It looks good on you.<eos> - Most things do.
I'm guessing you were once made to for a very long time and you didn't like it.<eos> You check the corners every time you enter a room.<eos> That's not police training. That's survival.<eos> Your demeanor towards me is complicated.<eos> You have trouble making eye contact.<eos> It's not lack of confidence.<eos> You've got a secret.<eos> Or secrets.<eos> Maybe I just don't like you.<eos> But you do.
That I never stopped loving somebody else!<eos> - I know, I have to stop this fighting.<eos> - No.<eos> What kind of shrink are you?<eos> This is not the shrink talking. This is the father in me.<eos> And I know that until you make peace with this, you can't be the parent that your children need.<eos> So go finish it.<eos> Where's my drugs?<eos> - They took everything.<eos> - Who did?
Mm-hmm?<eos> I think maybe my phone isn't working right, 'cause guys don't send me pictures of their junk on it.<eos> I think maybe I'd like to... take a picture of yours.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want to make you say "cheese."<eos> You're an animal!<eos> An animal!<eos> This feels good!<eos> Oh, don't stop!<eos> Don't...
He's stronger than I am in a lot of ways. Just...<eos> He just has a different kind of strength is all.<eos> "A different kind of strength."<eos> And what kind of strength is that?<eos> He has the strength to believe in himself and believe in me.<eos> Susan, keep seeing him if you have to, live with him, I don't care, but do not marry him.<eos> I understand what you see in Edward.<eos> I get it. - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't. No, you don't.

No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What do you mean, where did it come from?<eos> You bought it for us, remember?<eos> It was part of the series like eight years ago.<eos> - It's great, isn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, my God, it's so cool.<eos> It's this app that lets me watch Willow while she's in her crib. Really?<eos> Do you not trust your nanny?<eos> No, no, I do.
You and your goddamn rights.<eos> Speaking of rights, I just wanna let you know<eos> I'm recording this entire conversation.<eos> There.<eos> You clear?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - All right, let's go, Tony.<eos> Now, we're going to a place you might remember, and you can help yourself out by telling me about it.<eos> But if you don't remember,<eos> Tony does, all right?
- All right, let's go, Tony.<eos> Now, we're going to a place you might remember, and you can help yourself out by telling me about it.<eos> But if you don't remember,<eos> Tony does, all right?<eos> Hey, I'm sorry you lost your folks, man.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> But I didn't have nothin' to do with it.<eos> - What's this place?<eos> - You know this place.<eos> - Honest to God, I don't.
- 'Cause I could have made it work.<eos> I could've.<eos> When I said I wanted to be monogamous with you, I meant it.<eos> I didn't want you to make a promise you couldn't keep.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> How'd you know I wouldn't keep it?<eos> Anyway, that's not why we broke up.<eos> - We just weren't right for each other. - No, no, no.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just did.

Kara is in trouble.<eos> And nothing I am doing is working.<eos> I do not have sufficient data regarding this species...<eos> Damn it!<eos> Kara is relying on me!<eos> She has always relied on me...<eos> Ever since you sent her here.<eos> I'm sure you had hoped that she would find people that would take care of her.<eos> Who would love her like she was their own.<eos> I did.
We will never let you leave.<eos> (LOUD RUMBLING) - Alex!<eos> - I got you.<eos> I got you.<eos> - (GASPS) - JAMES: Alex, thank God.<eos> (ALEX PANTING)<eos> You pulled me out?<eos> How could you?<eos> I told you to stop him!<eos> - I did.
- Exactly like my name.<eos> - Wait, I am so sorry.<eos> I need to atone for this.<eos> I would never, ever have said that if I knew it would stick.<eos> Really, it's fine.<eos> And I didn't even care, like, at all, because it was you.<eos> What... what?<eos> I had, like, a huge crush on you in high school.<eos> You knew that.<eos> No, I did not.

Later.<eos> I'll be right out.<eos> From slowly peeing.<eos> Definitely not pooping.<eos> Eliot is in Jersey, 'cause Attica's actually got a huge Purina audition.<eos> Wow.<eos> Um, who else?<eos> We need more friends, obviously.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> We don't?
I'll get around to it.<eos> Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach was triggered by the photograph that he found.<eos> I've reviewed every dissonant episode I could find.<eos> The reaction is immediate every time.<eos> This guy makes it all the way back home.<eos> It's like he's mulling it over.<eos> You think he had an existential crisis?<eos> I think there's something fucked up going on with his cognition. And I think you feel exactly the same way that I do.<eos> Do we know where the error originated?<eos> We do.
She tells me Reggie's out of town.<eos> Yeah, for a few weeks.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> No. No reason.<eos> It's just some business he has to take care of over there.<eos> I'd be happy to look in on you guys if you'd like.<eos> No need.<eos> We're managing.<eos> We always do.
That's nice.<eos> Allen had a jumbo first and a home equity loan.<eos> Say Veronica sells for 4.4.<eos> With commissions and capital gains, she'll be lucky to clear 200K.<eos> I wonder why he was using his house as an ATM.<eos> Let's keep an eye on probate, see how the estate settles.<eos> The thing is this guy was a money launderer.<eos> Who knows what he's got squirreled away and where?<eos> The widow, maybe?<eos> Yeah. Maybe she does.
A loan shark who works for Joey Marks?<eos> - That's why they brought me in?<eos> - What they said.<eos> - Do you know Marks?<eos> - I know of him.<eos> Look, it's garbage, Harry.<eos> I talked to the captain.<eos> You're going home.<eos> But he wants to know about you and Kirsch first.<eos> He does or you do?
I know. It has a little cleaner in there, too.<eos> Always important.<eos> Do we want to get coffee?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - On the way out?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, I thought this new contract was supposed to guarantee us separate accommodations?<eos> It does.
No!<eos> No.<eos> No fuckin' police.<eos> - They said no police.<eos> - They always say that.<eos> Look, until I know what I'm dealing with, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> This isn't our town.<eos> We don't even know where to begin.<eos> I do.
Of course.<eos> Have a nice dinner.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You have to go to work?<eos> Not before we eat.<eos> It's open.<eos> My son was working undercover for Internal Affairs.<eos> Special Operations Division.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> No one did.
Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> You need to come back to your house.<eos> Now.<eos> We're gonna have that talk.<eos> Yeah, you know I can't do that, right?<eos> I've seen the video from the store.<eos> I saw how upset you were.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I know you didn't know what was going to happen to my son that night.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll be back in time to take you guys for lunch.<eos> Maybe we can stop at the beach on the way to the airport.<eos> Maddie'd like that.<eos> I moved back to L.A. a few years ago after my husband passed.<eos> I was born here. I wanted to die here.<eos> I had no idea you'd grown up to be a detective till I saw your name in the paper... yours and Marjorie's.<eos> That case had nothing to do with my mother.<eos> It was just a lawyer dragging her name through the mud, trying to get to me.<eos> You said you know who killed her.<eos> Yes, I do.
So you did nothing.<eos> When they found Marjorie, I was so scared, I left town.<eos> At Union Station, I made an anonymous call to the police.<eos> I talked to a detective.<eos> I told him about Mitch.<eos> Then I got on a train, and I left.<eos> I left the town, I left the life.<eos> What about the detective?<eos> Do you remember his name?<eos> No, I don't.
So is that enough?<eos> I can work with this.<eos> We'll dig deep into Father Tabakian, find out all about him, all his secrets.<eos> Right now, he's the victim.<eos> By the time we get to trial, you will be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Detective Bosch.<eos> Ms. Chandler.<eos> Didn't I say our paths would cross again.<eos> Yes, you did.
Babies with eyes color of the sea.<eos> No.<eos> The Prince...<eos> Jingim has real affection in his heart for you.<eos> Tell me you love me, Marco.<eos> Tell me you love Nergüi.<eos> Kokachin...<eos> Go now.<eos> I won.<eos> I did it.
- Would you...<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> Here's one.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This just all feels so sudden that, uh...<eos> - I don't know what to say.<eos> - Just say yes.<eos> Well, I want to say yes.<eos> I really do.
- It looks even better than I thought.<eos> Flight 262 from Mumbai, your luggage is now arriving at baggage claim 2.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> - Take five.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, I just got a voice mail from my mom, 'cause she is at the airport.<eos> Did you... did you fly her in for the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Please, wait.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> I thought we could sway you with the power of dance.<eos> You really think a dance is all it takes?<eos> Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.<eos> Or what I imagined.<eos> I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.<eos> None of us did.
- Hotel owner.<eos> Sorry, Winston, I mean, this is all my fault.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, Cece, you're fine.<eos> You were right.<eos> You really were.<eos> I mean, KC and I were, we weren't going anywhere.<eos> Let's be honest.<eos> I just want to find somebody, Cece;<eos> I really do.
I want some you.<eos> Yeah, the wine can wait, right?<eos> I mean, that stuff gets better with age.<eos> Marty...<eos> Mark... y, Marky, Marky.<eos> Did you just call me Marty?<eos> No.<eos> Did I slur?<eos> I think I'm just tired and a little drunky.<eos> Mm. So you did or you didn't?
Plekanic is a fucking cowboy.<eos> Davis is a glorified paper-pusher.<eos> But you?<eos> You make me nervous.<eos> Franco, I haven't decided on anything yet.<eos> I like you, John.<eos> We've known each other for a long time.<eos> But this job is a lot more complicated than putting away bad guys.<eos> - I think I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
How do you know he's really Danny's son?<eos> - I don't, but I think I believe him.<eos> - Okay, so what does this mean?<eos> I'm not certain. I just thought that you guys should know.<eos> Jesus Christ, Danny was a fucking father?<eos> Listen, it doesn't seem like they had much of a relationship.<eos> Still, John...<eos> Still what, Kevin?<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> It doesn't?
The drugs they found in Danny's apartment in Miami...<eos> Think it's possible someone else could have put them there?<eos> Doesn't fit with what we're working on or what we know at this time.<eos> I mean, it's possible, yes.<eos> Why?<eos> When did you know he was dealing drugs?<eos> I was suspicious when he had all that money.<eos> I knew he wasn't making all that money working here.<eos> You never said anything to me about it.<eos> No, I didn't.
- But you just said, "insurance scam".<eos> I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I'm not a detective.<eos> - You show up at my place, bring me here...<eos> - Okay. Okay, we can stop.<eos> My brother was fucking killed!<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - Kevin...<eos> - Do you?
Yeah, Marco.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> You gonna make him stand out there all day with your pizza?<eos> All right, you're doing the dishes.<eos> Monroe County Sheriff's Department.<eos> We're executing a warranted search of this property.<eos> - Step aside, sir.<eos> - This is fucking harassment.<eos> I'm calling my lawyer.<eos> You do that.
What have you done?<eos> What have I done?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I killed him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, I did.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Gene is dead because of me.<eos> It's not because of you, Martha.<eos> I did it.
So, let's focus on what's best for you.<eos> You've said all along that you wanted to understand who they are.<eos> Well, do you think you could ask them to tell you more about what they do?<eos> I guess.<eos> I could try.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> And then we'll figure out what to do next.<eos> When did you get Henry that cologne?<eos> I didn't.
Again?<eos> It's like... it's like, my God, man, like, mix it up.<eos> Kiss!<eos> Kiss!<eos> Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!<eos> Kiss! I'm sick of this bit.<eos> How did they do that?<eos> It's a conspiracy!<eos> - Well, I guess we have to!<eos> - You don't!
- No husband.<eos> Oh.<eos> Mr. Amberson, we had two teachers scheduled to chaperone the dance this Thursday.<eos> Mrs. Squillace has a sore throat, and Mr. Martin's mother is ill.<eos> Again.<eos> Ms. Dunhill has volunteered, but it's not possible for her to chaperone alone.<eos> Will you help?<eos> This Thursday?<eos> Oh, I-I hate to say no.<eos> Then don't.
- He's in a bad mood.<eos> What do you do all day, Marina?<eos> I have been changing diapers and...<eos> I never got much time with your pop before he was taken from me.<eos> I work all day long, and I come back, and I would relax...<eos> You two should appreciate all the time you have.<eos> We're getting nowhere.<eos> All that guy does is complain.<eos> Comfort her. Pick her up.<eos> Why don't you do it?
Yes, it's my name above the door.<eos> How much would something like this set me back?<eos> 4,000.<eos> 4,000?<eos> Quid?<eos> You're not serious.<eos> It's neoclassical.<eos> I don't suppose you know what that means.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I don't.
Do it, freak!<eos> God, it gets me every time.<eos> - Assholes.<eos> - I think it's kinda cool.<eos> It's like you have superpowers or something.<eos> Like Mr. Fantastic.<eos> Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.<eos> So, did he call?<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> Did he?
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties are still available in the office.<eos> Oh, this is weird.<eos> -He's never this late.<eos> -I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.<eos> I thought you liked his plan.<eos> Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.<eos> If his mom found out a girl spent the night--<eos> He's in deep shit right about now.<eos> Hey, what if she slept naked?<eos> Oh, my God, she didn't.
Yeah, the neighbors might see.<eos> This is so stupid.<eos> I'm just gonna drop you off.<eos> Calm down, Barb.<eos> Come on.<eos> You promised that you'd go.<eos> You're coming.<eos> We're gonna have a great time.<eos> He just wants to get in your pants.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger?<eos> He sounded a lot like that.<eos> Did you guys not see what I saw?<eos> They pulled Will's body out of the water.<eos> He's dead!<eos> Well, maybe it's his ghost.<eos> Maybe he's haunting us.<eos> -It's not his ghost.<eos> -So how do you know that?<eos> -I just do!
- I know everything.<eos> - All right, who are you working with?<eos> Nobody.<eos> But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times.<eos> He's gonna blow this thing wide open.<eos> You're just a junkie.<eos> A small town cop who had a really bad week.<eos> Took one too many pills this time.<eos> You made a mistake coming back here.<eos> No, I didn't.
What are you two doing?<eos> And why have you taken your shoes off?<eos> Armed police!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It worked.<eos> - I can't believe it worked.<eos> - What worked?<eos> We got the phone out, we managed to call you.<eos> No, you didn't call us.<eos> He did.
You can't have one without the other.<eos> - You say it was found on a building site?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, there's almost certainly something very exciting underneath.<eos> A Mithraic temple.<eos> Perhaps an entire complex.<eos> I just hope they have insurance.<eos> Unexpected archaeological discovery insurance.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> Of course we do.
The pizza's just really fucking good.<eos> Take a bite.<eos> Mmm. It's good.<eos> Good?<eos> That is a thing of beauty.<eos> That's why we lived in here when we were kids.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't usually open for breakfast, guys.<eos> You want another?<eos> I do.
Found a few that raised a red flag that hadn't gone all the way through the system.<eos> Huh. That's some fucking hunch.<eos> Don't hand me that card.<eos> I gave you that card.<eos> Raul.<eos> Okay, you went this far, get right to it.<eos> You have a problem.<eos> You greased some fellows in my union.<eos> If you say I did.<eos> I do.
Your mom... she won't have to work so hard, not at all, unless she wants to.<eos> Time to take your seat at the grown-ups' table.<eos> That's not who I am.<eos> I can't picture it.<eos> Oh, I think you can picture it now.<eos> The Bryan Connerty at the settlement conference... he would've stormed out of here the moment I walked in.<eos> But you stayed, and you listened.<eos> Hmm. And like you said... I stare at the lions at the zoo, too.<eos> Doesn't mean I wanna be one.<eos> Sure, it does.
Hello ...<eos> My mother heard that Christian comes back today.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> -Yes.<eos> I stole it from my father.<eos> You are all black around the mouth.<eos> -You too.<eos> Do you think Christian was afraid to be ... gay?<eos> I do not think he did.<eos> But what if he did?
Well, I won't be on my own anyway.<eos> Next stop on this train...<eos> Grand Central Station.<eos> - Next to last stop.<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> He is the only thing that has kept me sane this last year.<eos> And I love him.<eos> - Ugh. - I think.<eos> No, you don't.
Bye.<eos> Well, they said he was in serious condition, but now he's been upgraded to critical condition, so...<eos> - Well... - Oh, you mean...?<eos> Well, it's definitely moving in the right direction.<eos> I don't wanna think about life without him, but if he wakes up, he's gonna be so mad at me!<eos> When he wakes up.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They said it was a severe heart attack brought on by a combination of factors, including that thing that I did with the gun, which I totally didn't mean to do.<eos> Of course you didn't.
- But...<eos> - Okay, I don't want any more.<eos> - I don't want any more.<eos> - I'm trying to be helpful.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I thought I wanted to know all the details, but you know what?<eos> This is just too much details.<eos> Okay, well, I'm happy to stop, because this is just...<eos> Did you ever tell him that you loved him?<eos> N-no... no, I never did that.
Very challenging at work lately.<eos> And work is challenging.<eos> But it's great.<eos> What's going on with you guys?<eos> - Are you still in ballet?<eos> - We were trying to have a conversation with the kids.<eos> Do you r... you remember?<eos> Did... did Grandpa die?<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, shit, did he?
You're not going to convince me with that, you know?<eos> A friend of mine is a lawyer.<eos> I told her to call him.<eos> I have nothing to do with that kid!<eos> Nothing!<eos> - So, you don't know what he said?<eos> - With the fuss, I didn't understand.<eos> Where was Charlie between eight and one o'clock?<eos> - He was with me.<eos> - Doing what?
We're there in 5 minutes.<eos> She's getting in another car.<eos> - With the briefcase?<eos> - Affirmative.<eos> - Copy, 348, follow her.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - Do you have the money?<eos> - We do.<eos> Switch the GPS on.<eos> Done.
Hunter.<eos> Nice. To. Meet.<eos> No, that's too robot.<eos> Just say it normal. Just say it normal. Here we go.<eos> Nice to meet you!<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Junior.<eos> Hunter.<eos> You know why I built my office entirely out of glass even though birds can't see glass?<eos> I do not.
You're fantastic!<eos> Really?<eos> Because I just blew up most of the factory.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What a twist!<eos> Well, it means...<eos> I'm putting you in charge of your very own department.<eos> You are the new head of Letter Sorting.<eos> I didn't even know we still got letters.<eos> We do!
Like, what are you gonna do?<eos> I prefer not to talk about it right now.<eos> - Do you not know?<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> You don't know.<eos> - I know.<eos> If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't.
- Spill it.<eos> Well... it's just you guys are so amazing.<eos> And it's really rough out there, and it's nice to be around something so great.<eos> And I-I'm not really a love match with your son, but I think I might be in love with you guys.<eos> Jess, we-we are glad that you think that<eos> - we're amazing.<eos> And we think<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - That you're amazing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Cut these guys off.<eos> Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> We'll give them a night in lockup, then have one of the girls at the Mariposa bring them a key hidden in their breakfast.<eos> If the guests are squared away, let's wrap it up.<eos> This is a shade.<eos> Sacred native lore.<eos> They make figures of them.<eos> 60.<eos> And what does the shade do?
We're not exactly in a culture where we can just let loose.<eos> I would have thought the head of narrative could do whatever he wanted.<eos> My artistic freedom is constrained, what, with QA breathing down my neck and behavior programming the damn things to go off script.<eos> The robots can go off script?<eos> Just little gestures.<eos> You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
I know.<eos> Which is why I need to show you something.<eos> - Talk to her.<eos> - You first.<eos> Look, I didn't want to retire her.<eos> Iknowshe's, like,yourfriend, or- -I guess.<eos> But--but ifI didn'tdo it , they--they'djust getsomeoneelseto, andthenthey'dbe suspiciousofme ,so ... soI saidyes.<eos> ButI didit foryou.<eos> Always doing things for other people, aren't you?<eos> Time to do one more thing.
Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.<eos> Look, I know I made some mistakes. I wasn't perfect, but I'll get better.<eos> I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches, like that guy at fucking Twitter.<eos> Richard, it's done. Laurie already found a new CEO. What?<eos> Already?<eos> You said that you didn't want to be part of the interview process, so they picked someone this morning.<eos> Jack Barker.<eos> He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.<eos> I don't care who he is, okay?<eos> None of us do.
Our mystery one-legged man.<eos> Hoggard and... what was the black fella called?<eos> Arthur Solomon.<eos> He the one with the sock shoved down his throat or the other one?<eos> Other one.<eos> Solomon only had his throat blowed open.<eos> So, Solomon comes home, right? Did some pretty heinous shit in Vietnam...<eos> - Allegedly.<eos> - "Allegedly" does some pretty heinous shit in Vietnam, but nothing comes of it. It gets swept under the rug.<eos> Or maybe he didn't do nothin'.
Mama!<eos> Marcus won't tie my shoe!<eos> Keep it down in there, please.<eos> - Do it yourself, you baby.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you... have you... have you heard any more, - from the cops?<eos> Why, you talk to 'em?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Aw, get on.<eos> She just wanted a little "Shaynie Special."<eos> Yeah, her and me both.<eos> Get on in here.<eos> Gumby?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Uh... something's chasing me.<eos> Pokey, every time I turn around you think something's chasing you. - What is it this time?<eos> - You forgot to latch the door.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Uh, he dyes and grooms dogs, so they look like wild animals.<eos> You know, pandas, zebras, tigers.<eos> It's a thing.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> -Camels.<eos> -We're done now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come out.<eos> We know you're in there.<eos> No, you don't.
She trained under Florence Nightingale, you know.<eos> "Lo, in that house of misery, the lady with a lamp, I see pass through the glimmering gloom and flit from room to room."<eos> That's Emerson, you know.<eos> Longfellow, I believe.<eos> Well, they have their lady with a lamp in the Crimea, and we have Anne Hastings in Alexandria.<eos> She is God's gift to the boys.<eos> And I might add, to us doctors, as well.<eos> I got the impression Dr. Summers disapproves of lady volunteers.<eos> For Miss Hastings, he makes an exception.<eos> We all do.
Always following me around, never leaving me alone.<eos> I warned you you would get hurt.<eos> I told you to stop.<eos> Because we're connected... Bonded.<eos> And that's why I killed Cray...<eos> For you.<eos> No, no, no. That...<eos> That's on you, not me.<eos> - I never asked for that.<eos> - Of course you did.
Do not walk out on me right now.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> Put your hands behind your back... now.<eos> I knew he'd never kill me.<eos> I'm the only one who understands him.<eos> Who did this?<eos> ! The devil.<eos> The devil did this.<eos> I almost killed someone tonight.<eos> Why didn't you?
You set up my guy in the, uh, interview room?<eos> Yep.<eos> Good to go.<eos> Oh, his, uh, doctor's in with him.<eos> - What doctor?<eos> - The shrink.<eos> She was called for a psych eval.<eos> She said you knew about it.<eos> Damien didn't mean to hurt me.<eos> Oh, but he did.
We might could find a nigger family to sell to. But even then, you'd be getting 70, 75% of your purchase price.<eos> I think there's already some moving in across the way.<eos> Probably a good idea that y'all are cutting your losses.<eos> We're not trying to cut our losses, Lloyd.<eos> Then why you want out?<eos> Y'all looking to upgrade?<eos> Having kids?<eos> No, not any time soon.<eos> - Nothing like that. - Is that why he came to see me and asked me for money?<eos> He did?
Whether or not I fucked her is not the goddamn issue. Something is off with this fucker.<eos> "Off" ain't no charge.<eos> So I'm not supposed to give a damn at Conway probably murdered my friend?<eos> Do you actually know what they were accused of doing in Quan Thang?<eos> Pretty sure our jurisdiction don't extend that far west of the Mississippi. - I'll check a map, though. - It's heinous, Verne.<eos> It's the very worst in this war. Now he's brought this shit back here to Memphis.<eos> So you want justice for Quan Thang, Senator McGovern, or is it your dead friend? Which is it?<eos> You didn't serve, Tommy.<eos> Now what the hell does that have to do with anything?<eos> I did.
I like Tootsie pops if you got 'em.<eos> What the...<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, shit! Ow!<eos> - You remember us? - Ow.<eos> Oh, come on, 'course you do.<eos> It's not every day you see the two most handsome men in Memphis.<eos> Now, you're gonna tell us where your boss keeps his stash, you understand?<eos> Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> I don't...
Bully for me.<eos> Matron, I noted, as did Dr. Foster in his inimitably collegial way, that the morning meals were late and sparse.<eos> Were they now?<eos> I wonder if it would not be too forward of me to offer my perspective on the dietary need.<eos> The steward, Mr. Bullen, does as he deems fit, given the challenges and supplies at hand.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - You've got God and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss.<eos> Yes, I do.

I messed up bad, Art.<eos> - Margaret Chen.<eos> - No idea?<eos> Beth?<eos> I shot a civilian.<eos> I shot a civilian, Art.<eos> They're gonna take you to I.A. to be formally interviewed.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know.<eos> You saw a gun.<eos> No, I didn't.
Peggy.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The lady of the lake killer.<eos> Right.<eos> Thompson said you requested backup.<eos> Yes, yes. Yes, of course.<eos> Unless you've solved it already.<eos> No, no, no. I...<eos> I was expecting... You didn't put the request in.<eos> No, I did.
He struck February 13th through '90 and '94.<eos> He always targeted couples.<eos> And always put a groom for a wedding cake topper inside the male victim's mouth.<eos> And what about the female victims?<eos> All the women were found dead by midnight on Valentine's Day.<eos> I was in college.<eos> Trish Kellogg and I spent every Valentine's Day just hiding out, eating milk duds.<eos> I'm not sure that had anything to do with a serial killer.<eos> Didn't the police catch this lunatic?<eos> They did.
Meredith, do whatever you can to get the database up and running.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Jake: Our murder scene is much bloodier than the original cases.<eos> More spatter.<eos> Maybe St. Valentine drugged his male victims.<eos> That would explain the cleaner crime scenes.<eos> Except none of those men had drugs in their system.<eos> How in the world?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But, maybe this guy does.
Got something.<eos> What you got me?<eos> Back in 1994, the hotline got an anonymous tip on a guy living in a house at 115 Conyer Street.<eos> So did they follow it up?<eos> No, because two hours later they caught Glen Baker.<eos> (Sighs) And the case was closed.<eos> Or so they thought.<eos> What're you getting at?<eos> Tax rolls show a Wayne Lewis owned the house back in 1994.<eos> Still does.
- Is that yours?<eos> - Kate's.<eos> Kate has a white iPad.<eos> I was with her when she bought it.<eos> Guess she had two.<eos> Did you know she had a P.O. Box?<eos> What?<eos> She got a text message about a package.<eos> I didn't even know that she had a post office box.<eos> I didn't, either.
Get the fuck out of here.<eos> I shit my pants for nothing?<eos> I didn't do this for my amusement.<eos> What happened to Steven Birch...<eos> Who I am sure will be cleared of any wrongdoing...<eos> It could happen to us.<eos> So we need to be prepared.<eos> To that end, say "hello" to our new and improved compliance department.<eos> These assholes work here now?<eos> That, they do.
He's a widely respected source with connections...<eos> He's a fucking rent-a-quote.<eos> I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.<eos> If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?<eos> 'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.<eos> What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
Now, I like you a lot, I do... but this whole thing... it's not for me, so, please...<eos> I don't think that whiskey is a part of your juicing cleanse.<eos> What are you afraid of, huh?<eos> She's just a... feeble, fragile, little old lady. So that's what you think, huh?<eos> That's what she wants everybody to think.<eos> Hmm...<eos> You're afraid... that if this gets out, it'll be a scandal. Yeah, you're afraid you're gonna lose all that love you got for "Boom Boom Boom Boom."<eos> Trust me, this gets out, it's not good for nobody.<eos> It ain't gonna get out, Lucious.<eos> Just as long as you do right by your sons.
Our job is to find out how the Taliban knew about it.<eos> We have any ideas?<eos> Name's Brent Tomlinson.<eos> He's an Army military advisor who had advance knowledge of the shipment's schedule and payload.<eos> We think the Taliban paid him off?<eos> Could be.<eos> They're well funded with Saudi money via Qatar.<eos> Maybe they gave him some of that money.<eos> That's what we need you to find out.<eos> And if they did?
Just the way it is.<eos> We didn't make the world like this.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> I'll be leaving your name out of my report.<eos> As far as the Agency is concerned, you're still dead.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Might be because you could've killed me the other night but you didn't.<eos> Or maybe I like knowing you're out there, a ghost, still doing what needs to be done.<eos> How'd you know it had a false bottom?<eos> I didn't.
Have you considered recoding Her with a more defensive stance?<eos> You mean arm the Machine?<eos> More like equip Her with the tools She needs to better protect herself.<eos> Self-preservation is a very close cousin to aggression.<eos> A child, your child, needs to learn to push back on the playground.<eos> That's not an instinct we should hope to nurture in any artificial super intelligence.<eos> Not even one that we call our own.<eos> She's our only ally in this war.<eos> You need to learn to trust Her.<eos> But I do, Ms. Groves.
First time on the job, you know?<eos> You knew her?<eos> No, I mean, we weren't friends.<eos> I knew who she was way back in high school, and to be honest, I never even really liked her.<eos> Got the best grades, but I always thought she was kind of a kiss-ass.<eos> Turns out she's out there changing the world while the rest of us are wearing headphones, and now she's gone, and nobody cares.<eos> You care.<eos> Another missing persons, three days gone.<eos> You know how this ends, don't you?<eos> No, and neither do you.
Sounds like a big job.<eos> It is.<eos> But surely you would not enjoy a wedding.<eos> Even I appreciate a fairy tale ending, Harry.<eos> Family politics, over-cooked meat, monogamy.<eos> What's not to love?<eos> Bear takes one scoop of kibble twice a day.<eos> Oh, and if you could answer the pay phone, should it ring.<eos> Mr. Reese, have you managed to secure an invitation to the wedding?<eos> I did.
Oh, yeah, they've been here since I was a kid.<eos> They're always accusing Daddy of something.<eos> You know they're actually taking us to trial next month?<eos> There I go with all the tequila talk.<eos> You want another drink?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sounds like the protestors have been out to get her father for years.<eos> Think they're about ready to make good on their threat to put him down?<eos> I'm more inclined to think that someone in the Turner family wants to make sure that this wedding doesn't happen.<eos> Because if it does,
I don't know.<eos> If I step out of here, they could pick up the scent.<eos> You're right to exercise caution.<eos> We gotta get to Greer.<eos> Cut off the dragon's head, the body will die.<eos> A well thought-out plan takes time.<eos> We haven't survived this long by virtue of rash decisions.<eos> Yeah, 'cause actions aren't really your thing, huh?<eos> Did you even look for me?<eos> Of course we did.
I killed the bastard.<eos> They planned for us to find that USB.<eos> Greer said it was a kill switch, just not what we were expecting.<eos> It was a trap.<eos> I think it was a Trojan horse.<eos> What if it signaled Samaritan when we plugged it into some kind of network device?<eos> They would know where Finch is, the Machine, and they'd attack.<eos> Come on.<eos> Finch, do not plug the USB into anything that is not air gapped.<eos> I already did.
Me.<eos> I shot Reese.<eos> And now I'm gonna kill you too.<eos> So why haven't you?<eos> Because somewhere... in your sociopathic heart,<eos> you know we belong together.<eos> We'll work through this, but first... I need to get you to safety.<eos> But nothing's safe.<eos> Do you know where we are?<eos> What they did to me?
No.<eos> We can't.<eos> - Shaw...<eos> - The simplest way to break someone is to rob them of their reality, and they did that well.<eos> And maybe you're right, maybe I am safe... but as long as I'm alive... You'll never be safe.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I could turn on you at any moment, and even if I don't, I could lead them to the Machine.<eos> That'll never happen.<eos> I don't know if I'm calling the shots anymore...<eos> And neither do you.
- Don't know yet.<eos> Which is precisely why you should put some distance between us, John.<eos> It's not worth the risk.<eos> Street's clear.<eos> - You weren't followed.<eos> - Ms. Shaw.<eos> It's good to have you back home.<eos> Harold, do you know how they found you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
It's monitoring everything we've ever done.<eos> You said this morning we were just surviving.<eos> By then my fate had been sealed.<eos> But not yours.<eos> I would hate for my mistake to mean punishment for the rest of you.<eos> And please tell Ms. Shaw this is not her cross to bear.<eos> This lapdog has the same card.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> You want to tell me how this all-seeing eye thing doesn't see us coming?<eos> It does.
We're good.<eos> Our supervisor will be right with you.<eos> That was Harry.<eos> I gathered.<eos> He think I'm the reason his cover's blown?<eos> He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
How 'bout you give me your full name?<eos> Harold Osprey.<eos> Good choice, Harry.<eos> They're common around here and so funny-looking.<eos> Stay right here.<eos> Officer Reed there is a good man, just not a very smart cop.<eos> There we go.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> I didn't teach you how to love.<eos> Of course you did.
- Could you?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good seeing you, John.<eos> So you're a detective now.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> What are you doing here, Pierce?<eos> I guess you could say I'm championing a new cause.<eos> Champagne, social elite.<eos> Don't you usually hate these things?<eos> I do, don't I?
Sorry, pal.<eos> I'm giving you the opportunity to save your Machine, which you so clearly love and loves you in return.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> Samaritan would consider your Machine a much-needed peer for what promises to be a fantastic voyage.<eos> This virus you uploaded is nothing but a tragic mistake.<eos> Tell me, after it's eradicated both ASIs, what then?<eos> Then we go back to letting humanity determine its own fate.<eos> Surely you're not that naive.<eos> You know another ASI would soon arise.<eos> Not for certain I don't, and neither do you.
Sure.<eos> Everyone dies alone.<eos> But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone or love someone, if even a single person remembers you...<eos> Then maybe... you never really die at all.<eos> I know I've made some mistakes.<eos> Many mistakes.<eos> But we helped some people.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
That's our red dragon, and for it to breathe fire, oil refinery right behind it.<eos> - So the guy's cabin in the woods...<eos> - Well, from the cabin, for it to seem like it was breathing smoke from the head, it could be anywhere from here down to here, and given line of sight on a clear day, it might go back four miles.<eos> So all deep woods, hardly populated, perfect cover.<eos> This is our search area.<eos> Get a team together and let's move.<eos> Got it.<eos> I never should have taken these down.<eos> I gave up.<eos> Well, we all did.
Come on, baby.<eos> Let me... let me get your number.<eos> Are you deaf and dumb?<eos> - I told you I'm with someone.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Who?<eos> Him.<eos> You haven't even talked to that guy.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> We don't do a lot of talking.
No. This is therapeutic.<eos> It's so sad.<eos> Yeah. Anything else?<eos> Usually after work, he goes to a small dog park in Brooklyn, even though he doesn't own a dog.<eos> Just sits there for hours.<eos> Does he write letters to the dogs?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Well, that would be like the home run, right?<eos> I mean, that's what we need.<eos> - Does he?
My daughter was dying, I prayed, uh...<eos> Not to God or the universe, but to Death.<eos> I offered a trade.<eos> Take me, leave my daughter.<eos> But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...<eos> So, who won that round?<eos> You or the porcelain?<eos> Porcelain's undefeated.<eos> I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.<eos> Yes, they did.
And she asked me who I was about to lose.<eos> And I told her.<eos> And she looked at me and she said,<eos> "Just be sure to notice "the collateral beauty."<eos> I mean, she...<eos> She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
Who are you talking to?<eos> Howard, who are you talking to?<eos> That's enough. It's enough.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You made the point, I think.<eos> Just turn it off.<eos> You hired people to follow me?<eos> Make video?<eos> No, that wasn't the initial intention.<eos> No, we did.
I'm taping it so we can show a doctor.<eos> She needs a doctor, Nancy.<eos> Honey!<eos> Prairie, let go.<eos> Prairie.<eos> Nina!<eos> Prairie believes her father's alive and sneaking her messages about where to find him in dreams.<eos> She also believes her dreams are premonitions, and that the Russian Mafia are after her.<eos> Kids tell tall tales.<eos> I did myself.
Maybe she needs some wide open space, Nance.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Here you go, bud.<eos> Eat.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Last bite, last bite.<eos> You gotta go brush your teeth, all right?<eos> I did.<eos> No, you didn't.
Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> You called it a near-death experience?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -So you had one?<eos> Uh, here, ketchup at midnight, mustard at four o'clock, mayo at eight o'clock.<eos> Good stuff, okay?<eos> Did I have an NDE?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't, but I, uh...
Excuse me. Mrs. Johnson?<eos> Nancy Johnson?<eos> - Hi... - Excuse me.<eos> I don't. I...
And when I began working exclusively with near death experience survivors, the work took off.<eos> They have an almost limitless potential for being revived.<eos> Now, whether that's...<eos> He was killing us.<eos> Over and over and over again.<eos> What was Hap recording?<eos> What did it mean?<eos> He was recording the soundscapes of our NDEs, trying to map out what it was that people call "the other side."<eos> Yeah, I... I put that part together.<eos> Bullshit you did.
- They medicated me.<eos> - I know.<eos> - They thought I was crazy.<eos> They're not my parents.<eos> But they are your parents.<eos> You could have stayed with Khatun.<eos> With your father.<eos> But... you chose to come back.<eos> I didn't choose to come to Crestwood.<eos> Well, maybe you did.
Oh, there you are.<eos> We had a 10:00 appointment, remember?<eos> You said you'd fit us in.<eos> - It's an emergency.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> - Lorna left me.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she, she walked out, left a note and, and I'm so upset!<eos> Well, we're gonna break up too unless there's a major change.<eos> But my wife already did.
Excuse me for one moment.<eos> What the hell?<eos> You cannot just interrupt a class like that.<eos> She needs answers.<eos> Come here.<eos> All right.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Oh, yeah. Um...<eos> I really liked your poem.<eos> No, he didn't.
Stupid fucking little hammer.<eos> Why do we even have this little hammer?<eos> Because my mom gave it to me my freshman year.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Do not do this for me.<eos> I'm doing this for me, Marn.<eos> I'm doing this for me.<eos> Desi, I like the wall.<eos> - This fuck... this fucking...<eos> - I do.
This is all your fault, you little bastard!<eos> (GROANS)<eos> Come on, let's get you comfortable.<eos> (GRUNTS IN PAIN)<eos> CRACK!<eos> (SCREAMS)<eos> SCREAM ECHOES, BIRDS CAW<eos> (GROANS)<eos> I don't really think you're a bastard.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I heard a noise.<eos> A noise downstairs.<eos> No, I didn't hear anything.<eos> Well, put your hearing aids in, and then you'll hear, honey.<eos> I don't need my hearing aid.<eos> I can hear well enough.<eos> Sid.<eos> Don't you hear that?<eos> - Listen.<eos> - I don't.
I have a friend who I've been talking to and who has been giving me books.<eos> Does that mean you're on LSD?<eos> LSD?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Were our forefathers on LSD when they went out and shot their British oppressors?<eos> And let's not forget the Boston Tea Party.<eos> Speaking of that, did you read that a study found that green tea is very good for you?<eos> Much healthier than the kind we drink.<eos> I don't like Chinese's tea.<eos> I do.
Chairman Mao says that a calm heart stills all panic.<eos> Screw Chairman Mao.<eos> You... you and I will be in prison.<eos> Chairman Mao will be in his palace eating spare ribs.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> If I wind up in prison, I am never gonna take a shower.<eos> I can promise you one thing, that she will not be here long.<eos> Yeah, meanwhile, her accomplice was captured.<eos> You know, thank God the guy doesn't know where she is.<eos> Um, he... he does.
I shouldn't say this, but we've hit the jackpot.<eos> WE NEED TO TALK<eos> 3 YEARS LATER<eos> - Good morning, my love.<eos> - Morning, gorgeous.<eos> Happy anniversary!<eos> Happy anniversary?<eos> - You didn't remember.<eos> - Yes, I did. - What day is today?<eos> - Okay, I didn't.
Nuria, what is this?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Don't be such a pain!<eos> Run, damn it!<eos> In here!<eos> Jorge!<eos> Yeah, I do this almost every day.<eos> It's just... you're crazy.<eos> I don't see what's so funny.<eos> I do.
How are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> You guys took a while.<eos> We went to buy food.<eos> We're going to barbecue tonight and come see the bonfires after.<eos> That's great.<eos> Hey, I didn't know there was a shortcut to get down here.<eos> You know it, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Sure we do.
Sorry, Nuria.<eos> My wife's not answering and I lost my car keys.<eos> No problem, we'll take you home and you can fix it tomorrow.<eos> Impossible.<eos> My house keys are on the same key chain.<eos> Fix me a cup of coffee and I'll say hi to your parents.<eos> You have no idea how much I miss all of this.<eos> If it weren't for Jorge's ideas, we'd still have it.<eos> He only wanted to give us a hand.<eos> And he did.
Does Yoli look like a Head of Human Resources?<eos> Let's run away, I'm telling you.<eos> On three...<eos> Not until you tell me if there's more.<eos> We lost this house, I've been seeing Victor for a year, he proposed and I said yes, so do what you want, but I need to get out of here.<eos> I'm leaving on the count of three. It's my only way out.<eos> - Why did you lie to me?<eos> - I didn't lie to you.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Perfect, because it's a milestone.<eos> A Spaniard stealing an Argentinian's girlfriend is as huge as lniesta's goal. What the hell?<eos> Even bigger, because Argentinians are love predators.<eos> -It's in their genes.<eos> - Of course. They've banged half of Spain, damn it.<eos> Take it from me, I'm from Albacete and we've got our thing too.<eos> You sure do.<eos> You've got me hooked.<eos> -L'll handle it.<eos> - Do that.
Oh, um, I'm glad you kept your job.<eos> I'll see you in class.<eos> Prepare for a long day and tough questions.<eos> You will take the stand to defend your case as an FBI agent.<eos> Welcome to our courtroom.<eos> Trainee Chang, how are we supposed to believe that our client killed his sister when you haven't even produced a body?<eos> Because the circumstantial evidence is enough for a murder conviction, assuming that we have excluded all reasonable hypotheses.<eos> Have you?<eos> The FBI believes that it has.<eos> I, on the other hand, do not.
No.<eos> Walk.<eos> Simon, I'm not moving.<eos> You think just because I can't kill a deer that I can't kill you?<eos> No.<eos> I think you can.<eos> But you won't because if you wanted to kill me, you would have pulled that trigger already.<eos> Just like you would have done to yourself.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about!<eos> Actually, I do.
- that leads right into downtown.<eos> - We can exploit this, set a trap for whoever's using the tunnel.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I have a daughter. She matters more to me than anything.<eos> This is a special book.<eos> It has all kinds of secrets in it. Your son Charlie is alive.<eos> Those assholes were close enough to take a picture of my son, and we still don't have him home.<eos> How long you been spying on me, lying to me, selling me out to those killers you work for?<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> - Bullshit! - You did it for you.
Who are these lovely creatures?<eos> - This is Hudson, my son...<eos> - Hudson.<eos> My niece, Gracie, and that's Minny.<eos> Hello, Hudson.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Up top.<eos> They don't... you guys wouldn't want to go for a swim, would you?<eos> - I do.
- This is Hudson, my son...<eos> - Hudson.<eos> My niece, Gracie, and that's Minny.<eos> Hello, Hudson.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Up top.<eos> They don't... you guys wouldn't want to go for a swim, would you?<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do?
- Is everything all right, honey?<eos> Honey? Do you have any idea what's going on out here?<eos> - No.<eos> What's wrong? - The whole damn bloc is being blown up because of what you did.<eos> Now where are you?<eos> You need to call your father, have him take you and Gracie and Hudson and go up to the Green Zone.<eos> I need?<eos> You need to tell me where you are.<eos> Can you do that for me?<eos> Maddie already did!
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> You just gotta breathe.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> - Just breathe.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, one is, like, going raw dog on me.<eos> I'm so impressed, Shoshanna.<eos> I feel like you used to be really work-driven and now you've learned to slow down and just enjoy life.<eos> Yeah, I did.
More than anything, I want to learn it.<eos> Well, that's a beautiful sentiment, but when have you ever stuck to a single thing?<eos> You can't expect me to sink my money into another whim.<eos> - Well, it's not your money.<eos> - It takes a certain passion to see things through and you've never had that.<eos> Maybe it's because Mum was always easy on you or your face is so symmetrical, but it's left you soft.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry to be the one to tell you things that you don't want to hear, but I know you, Jessa.<eos> I know you.<eos> No, you don't.

Ass-to-mouth, by the way.<eos> Just so that we are speaking the same language.<eos> Oh, we are.<eos> Sometimes on the drive home, I'll roll it over in my mind.<eos> You know, what is it about a woman taking it into her mouth after a little raw-dogging that just seems so right? That just seems so right?<eos> And it's this... That I'm accepted as I am.<eos> Completely.<eos> For my good qualities, sure, but also for all... of my filth.<eos> And I appreciate a woman who is that giving.<eos> I truly do.
And he has been like a second father to Hutch And he has been like a second father to Hutch once Hutch II passed on.<eos> And I do not think Purk would look upon this in a friendly way at all.<eos> So leave your letter.<eos> Put it on a billboard if you want.<eos> This meeting's over.<eos> ♪ Tense music ♪ So it's all about Purkheiser.<eos> Now we know that for sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you see her react?<eos> - I did.
You're my rapacious scumbag.<eos> This is what love is.<eos> They put me on fucking hold?<eos> Yeah, a man of your stature.<eos> Damn right.<eos> Man of my imperious...<eos> You ready to sweet talk me?<eos> Statue of Liberty bombing attempt.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
- Stay here.<eos> And wait for your mistress to return.<eos> Boys asleep?<eos> Just about. Read a couple of chapters. Just about.<eos> - We're at a good part.<eos> - Fun. That Dolores Umbridge sure is a bitch.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> She wrote a book?<eos> - Yes, she did.
Welcome back, asshole.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> He arrived on Mr. Cole's tether.<eos> We destroyed the virus, but nothing happened.<eos> No, Dr. Railly, something did happen.<eos> You changed history.<eos> You're stuck.<eos> Nobody wants you anymore.<eos> Why didn't stopping you change things?<eos> It did.
It starts here.<eos> This place... I've seen it.<eos> Primaries.<eos> It's all in my head.<eos> Pieces, pictures, places.<eos> You... and her.<eos> Why do I always have to do bad things to get your attention?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I have nothing left.<eos> Of course you do.
Go and find your purpose.<eos> You do have one.<eos> One that's right.<eos> Just go.<eos> Leave all this behind.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're here to shoot me again?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> I never did.
Nothing to really sneeze at.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Are you acting weird because I had sex with Dale?<eos> I'm sorry, Chip.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> Martha told me that you found out about our little sex romp in the van.<eos> - Can I take your order?<eos> - And you know, you're my brother, and I wanted to come to you and let you know that<eos> I love Martha, okay?<eos> - No, you don't.
Refuse and we'll ruin your life."<eos> Either way, the results stay the same...<eos> Calvin Chadwick wins a seat in the Senate.<eos> The arena club knows what's happening tomorrow because they're making it happen.<eos> Do you have any idea the can of worms you're asking me to open?<eos> Rigging an election is a serious accusation.<eos> All the more reason to listen to Peggy.<eos> Where are those newspapers?<eos> I-I had to leave them behind.<eos> Well, of course you did.
We need him.<eos> All right.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Dr. Wilkes has designed a containment chamber to stabilize himself, but he needs a sample of zero matter.<eos> I intend to get that sample from Whitney Frost.<eos> Okay.<eos> The best chance that we have of getting close to Whitney without being detected is her husband's campaign fundraiser tomorrow night at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.<eos> Not an easy ticket to get.<eos> Howard Stark donates money to all the political candidates to ensure good favor with whomever wins, so Mr. Jarvis has two tickets secured.<eos> Of course he does.
It's okay to be wrong from time to time.<eos> Believe it or not, I've been wrong before.<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I'm not wrong. Not this time.<eos> How much you willing to bet on it?<eos> Everything I've got.<eos> That's a lot to lose.<eos> But I won't lose.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> And when you do...
And that's what makes you so beautiful.<eos> And you should never have to hide it... From the rest of the world.<eos> There's my girl.<eos> Rain check.<eos> They're here.<eos> Bring him out!<eos> Agent Carter.<eos> Jason, you're solid.<eos> - How?<eos> - Peggy, don't do this, please.
It's only been tested on the rift.<eos> It's possible...<eos> Well, that doesn't really matter, does it?<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's me.<eos> Peggy?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting you out of here.<eos> Peggy, you need to leave.<eos> We both do.
You've been like a second father to me.<eos> I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> Yeah, I can tell.<eos> The biggest lesson I've learned is never let a good opportunity pass you by.<eos> You're doing that now!<eos> Sorry it has to end like this.<eos> Do you want to do the honors, Chief Thompson?<eos> No.<eos> From what I hear, your way is a lot cleaner.<eos> Don't do this, Jack.
I treated Lewis just like I treated you.<eos> An ultrasound twice a year.<eos> There was no sign. Nothing.<eos> One day, it just gave way.<eos> Don't be scared, Maureen.<eos> What happened to Lewis is very exceptional.<eos> You can get up.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> You just need to keep avoiding both intense physical efforts and extreme emotions.<eos> Like Lewis did...
There are invisible presences... around us, always.<eos> Whether or not they're the souls of the dead, I don't know, but...<eos> When you're a medium, you just are attuned to a certain... vibe.<eos> What do you mean by, vibe?<eos> It's an intuition thing. It's a feeling you...<eos> You see this door...<eos> It's only like slightly ajar.<eos> I also this that... the soul... continues to exist after death.<eos> I don't really know if I believe in that.<eos> But Lewis did.
You know how they say, the dead watch over the living?<eos> I've thought about that quite a lot.<eos> Not just because Lewis was a medium.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> For me, he was someone deeply intuitive of others.<eos> He understood things that went unspoken.<eos> He did.<eos> Maybe because he knew he was going to die.<eos> I mean I felt that he saw things which I didn't.<eos> Maybe you do too.
All I mean is that with Lewis, nothing seems impossible.<eos> Many religions believe that the soul wanders around for a while before leaving this world.<eos> Did he speak to you about that?<eos> He was convinced of it.<eos> Years ago, Mum died, he was sure that... he was visited by her.<eos> That she came to say goodbye to him.<eos> That it felt like a dream, but not, that it was very real.<eos> He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.

It should be a fun party. Huh?<eos> It's a Shaun party.<eos> It's gonna be awesome.<eos> Oh, definitely.<eos> We're gonna have a blast. Yeah.<eos> - Have you been here long?<eos> - No. No, not too long.<eos> Really?<eos> She said you were the first one here.<eos> She did?
It's like, this happens all the time.<eos> It's like, I meet somebody, and then they like me initially, and then I just, like, fuck it up and they get tired of me or something, you know?<eos> It's like, you know, you're, like, my only friend, who, like, grew into liking me, seriously.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Okay, that's true.<eos> But you were like... When I met you, you were like...<eos> - You were like... - "Hi, I'm Gus.<eos> What's your major?"<eos> I didn't say that all the time.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Now you listen to me, Manfredi.<eos> You can't just walk into a man's home<eos> - and take his butler hostage. - Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, you can't steal my underwear.<eos> I told you then, and I'm telling you now... you can't wear your skivvies in a schwitz.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here, you handsome son of a bitch!<eos> You glorious kook!<eos> - You know Joe Manfredi?<eos> - Yes, we do.
I just went to check in on Daphne this morning, all right?<eos> And she said she wasn't feeling well.<eos> And then, out of nowhere, she starts saying, like, I don't believe her, or something, getting all upset, and in comes running Tandy like she's the calvary to save the day...<eos> - ... like I'd done something.<eos> - All right, well, first of all,<eos> - you know that's Tandy.<eos> Um... And I-I'm sure Daphne's a little anxious.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You get to talk to Maddie at all?<eos> Yeah, I did, and... and...
Where have you been?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. I will be.<eos> But it's gonna take time.<eos> I'm not one of those people who has it easy.<eos> You know, who can just bounce back, pretend like nothing ever happened.<eos> So, you two just had a civil ceremony?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you and Juliette honeymoon?<eos> We didn't, actually.

Got her voice-mail.<eos> We still got her scheduled to work.<eos> See if she shows up tonight, I guess.<eos> Or today.<eos> She's supposed to come by the offices and meet with Bucky and me.<eos> Let me know if she does or if I need to hire somebody for that shift.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you got going on today?<eos> Hear our buddy Riff Bell's coming out of retirement?<eos> Yes, I did.
Hey, I asked you to let this go.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - There's other ways... we could've handled this, Frankie!<eos> Yeah, like listening to me in the first damn place!<eos> I was right about her, Deacon.<eos> I was right!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you even come to bed last night?<eos> Yeah, I did.
All right? !<eos> What was I supposed to say?<eos> !<eos> "Excuse me, young man.<eos> When you're done groping my daughter's leg, can I have a little word with you over here?"<eos> - What was I supposed to do? !<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I do know what it is to be a 16-year-old girl and have a fight with your father and leave the house forever.<eos> And I don't want that for Maddie.<eos> I don't, either.
I don't, either.<eos> I'm just scared to death, and I don't... know our next move.<eos> I thought of one place we haven't looked yet.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Going off the deep end like that seems so unlike him.<eos> Does it?<eos> Come on.<eos> He was always like this on the road... the parties, the groupies.<eos> You must remember.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Jeff was threatening to... expose some details about my personal life.<eos> - There was a woman that I was was involved with.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I never wanted you to know, but you have to understand that your mother has always had your best interests at heart.<eos> So, all my parents are liars, then.<eos> Maddie.<eos> Look correct me if I'm wrong here, but didn't you originally<eos> - drop Will from your label?<eos> - Yeah, I-I did.
Maddie!<eos> Maddie, please just talk to me.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> About Edgehill, about my dad?<eos> Because it's my job as your mother to protect you from things that are gonna<eos> - break your heart.<eos> - Like what? !<eos> The truth? !<eos> - You just... you kept it from me!

I'd be pretty mad about that.<eos> I'm more jealous than anything.<eos> I mean, not the fact that he joined the Army, but just that he can make his own choices in life.<eos> Look, feeling trapped sucks.<eos> But maybe it'll make good fodder for a song.<eos> What is the point of writing any if no one will ever hear them outside of this room?<eos> Look, I thought the same way when I was your age.<eos> I wanted to get in front of people so badly that I actually snuck out and played cafés.<eos> Wait.<eos> What if I do that, too?
Oh. I mean, I wouldn't say that, exactly.<eos> And then you guys dated, right?<eos> 'Cause you are The Exes, after all.<eos> - Uh, y-yes.<eos> Yeah. - Was it serious?<eos> Mm!<eos> It was so serious!<eos> I can see.<eos> You guys live together?<eos> Uh, yeah, we did.
Oh, well, that was all Scarlett, actually, yeah... lyrics and music.<eos> Well, it definitely wouldn't be what it is without Gunnar, so...<eos> Well, I am just glad we all found each other.<eos> 'Cause I really do think this is gonna do great things for y'all.<eos> Our next guest is a very special last-minute...<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Hey, anytime you tell me there's a new talent I should see, I am there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What'd you say this girl's name was?<eos> - I didn't.
She's a child!<eos> She's my child, all right?<eos> !<eos> You got no right to take her anywhere, least of all some bar where she's up onstage so she can...<eos> What?<eos> What, so she can thrive?<eos> So she can bloom?<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> I mean, do you even understand how talented she is?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Well, thank you.<eos> It was great to see you out there again.<eos> I miss performing.<eos> I just do.<eos> And I'm sorry about our conversation earlier.<eos> You know, I think as cool as it is to be on the cover of Businessweek,<eos> I've lost sight of why I wanted to work with these artists because I've lost sight of myself as an artist.<eos> And I have to admit, the tour for Layla is probably as important for me as it would have been for her.<eos> Want to do 10 dates for the hell of it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Helps that it's private.<eos> 'Cause the plaintiff's a minor, only those named in the case or invited by either party can be present.<eos> Then what's he doing here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Cash asked me to come.<eos> Couldn't say no to my daughter.<eos> You understand that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, how do you think it's going?<eos> Look, I know this judge.<eos> She's got kids of her own.<eos> Really think you're winning her over.<eos> Honestly, if we don't turn the dial up, she won't rule in our favor.<eos> We need to use our alternate strategy.<eos> Look, I know that you don't want to do that.<eos> - I don't.
If it weren't for you, none of that would've ever happened.<eos> Well, if it weren't for you, I would've never been born.<eos> I am what you made me, Dad.<eos> I'm your son.<eos> Not the son we wanted.<eos> Do not speak for her.<eos> You never knew what Mom wanted, because you never took the time to ask.<eos> We had a belief system.<eos> That doesn't mean you couldn't love me.<eos> Mom did.
Except that Daddy basically kicked me out, and all I've been doing is fighting for her to stay.<eos> This is not the end of the story for you two.<eos> Sweetheart, this family... there's a whole lot of road up ahead of us.<eos> You two are gonna find your way back to each other.<eos> I want to believe that.<eos> I don't know how to get us there.<eos> You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.
And with everything that you started... your lawsuit still going on...<eos> I'm... I'm curious.<eos> A couple years ago, Alicia was killed in a shootout... Chicago P.D. and two armed gunmen.<eos> I'm... I'm so sorry. I...<eos> Should have never happened.<eos> The cops screwed up, and three people died in the crossfire.<eos> There was an investigation, but in the end, Chicago P.D. stuck together.<eos> They blamed the ATF, and they blamed the state police, and they blamed the FBI.<eos> I just wanted somebody to stand up and tell the truth, like I had in the NFL.<eos> But they didn't.
You need to evacuate immediately.<eos> Do you recognize the voice on that recording, Mr. Asher?<eos> Elias Harper.<eos> He blew up Grand Central, and then, four days later, he blew up the FBI's emergency command center.<eos> And do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Let me remind you we are an impartial committee, and it's important the views you express here today are yours and yours alone.<eos> I'll ask again...<eos> Do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Actually, I was just leaving.<eos> No one ever leaves.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why would anyone want to?<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Did you get what you came for?<eos> Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.<eos> So, yeah.<eos> I did.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Stand down, Titus.<eos> _<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.<eos> Now sit.<eos> We have more important matters to discuss.<eos> Yes. We do...
Oh, come on.<eos> That's like setting the launch codes all zeros.<eos> And yet it's better than anything we've come up with.<eos> I'll check the president's office.<eos> We'll keep working the tech angle.<eos> Hopefully, one of us'll get lucky.<eos> Like that's ever happened.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Protocol would be to leave someone behind.<eos> They did.
They had impressive security.<eos> I'll give them that.<eos> This is useless.<eos> I'm better with hydrazine and gun powder.<eos> - Reyes... - I give up.<eos> We're too late, anyway.<eos> It's already dark.<eos> Raven...<eos> The Raven Reyes I know doesn't give up. She does now.<eos> No, she doesn't.
This prisoner is banished from my land.<eos> He will live, but he will live with the ghosts of those he has lost, haunted until the end of his days by the knowledge that he... is the last of his kind.<eos> May you live forever.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> - How you holding up?<eos> - I've been better.<eos> Yeah. We all have.<eos> We need to talk about your sister.<eos> Two of our people died today because of her, not to mention the ash-poisoned soil, making the land useless.<eos> The Grounders did that.
Clarke?<eos> Clarke's opinion in this matter is not exactly unbiased.<eos> Titus is right.<eos> I would do anything to save my people.<eos> You know that, but I know them.<eos> Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike.<eos> Kane doesn't.<eos> Octavia doesn't.<eos> Your people did not vote for Kane.<eos> Some of them did.
All the naughty bits are covered.<eos> A little too much in my opinion.<eos> Where's Simon?<eos> Who?<eos> Kidding.<eos> He's in good hands with the boys.<eos> So, um... you, Alec, and Jace are... what, like, family?<eos> Translation, you want to know if Jace and I are a thing.<eos> Why would I care?<eos> Because you do.
Get at that hummus, dog.<eos> - Pine nuts on top, very jiggy. - Mmm.<eos> Hey, Wyatt, uh, so the Lakers won last night, I was thinkin' of ya.<eos> You were thinking of me?<eos> That's cute.<eos> - Oh, like, 'cause you like the Lakers... - Uh-huh. ...and then I saw the Lakers won, so...<eos> Lot of people like the Lakers, bro.<eos> - Hey, Wyatt.<eos> - Yeah. You know Gus here wrote a Witchita script, right?<eos> You did?

- That's a bad first start.<eos> What else we got here, uh...<eos> - Guys, Gus is coming over... - soon.<eos> - Who's Gus?<eos> - He's this guy I think I might be into...<eos> - Do you have butterflies?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I have butterflies, and I have a heart murmur, and I got the Hershey squirts.<eos> - But I thought you liked him.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do.
Hey. Mickey.<eos> You're still here?<eos> Can I talk to you for one second?<eos> Uh... okay.<eos> - Hey. - Um... - What's up?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> What is up? I thought we had a good time the other night.<eos> - Did we not have a good time?<eos> - Yeah, no, totally.<eos> - We totally did.
Show Francine I get what she's going through.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Show, don't tell.<eos> And the best way to do that is to make the consumer feel like you don't just get them, you are them.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Did we land dentine ice?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I repurposed the dentine pitch.<eos> But you see what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Sorry, I repurposed the dentine pitch.<eos> But you see what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Oh, one last thing.<eos> If you were an exec at Dentine, would that pitch have worked on you?<eos> Of course, I would have replaced the word "Francine"<eos> with "Dentine Ice" in most instances.<eos> Roger...<eos> I like it.<eos> I really do.
Fusion device.<eos> Armageddon.<eos> And Lockheed was there. We had a...<eos> Call for you, Mr. Mannix.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, he has it now?<eos> No, have him stay on set, I'll go to him.<eos> Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.<eos> Still do work there, for the day anyway.
Well, technically, yes.<eos> There's gonna be a ransom?<eos> I'd hardly call it a ransom.<eos> Benedict there.<eos> That's Benedict de Bonaventure.<eos> He wrote The House of Ahasuaris.<eos> Enormous hit.<eos> Made the studio millions of dollars.<eos> Did you see any of those millions of dollars, Ben?<eos> I did not.
I-I like to travel, see new places and... meet new people.<eos> But, I mean, you choose a job before you really know if you'll like it, right?<eos> I mean, when you're young, you don't... know anything... who you are, what you wanna do, be.<eos> You pick something because it fits what you like, what... what you need.<eos> But life changes things, you change, or... or something.<eos> And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.<eos> You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a shit about.<eos> You...<eos> You don't wanna do it.<eos> You just don't.
Don't try anything new, son.<eos> I could've married a woman who didn't look exactly like me.<eos> But that would've been crazy.<eos> Hey, newbie.<eos> Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Oh!<eos> Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do. Yeah.
What the hell is his strategy?<eos> He knows we're not gonna give up the hunt just because he closes.<eos> Maybe he wants to quit while he's ahead.<eos> No one quits while they're ahead.<eos> This isn't France.<eos> It's America.<eos> We think noblesse oblige is a new entrée at Olive Garden.<eos> You know, there's a book that could help you with that.<eos> Sarno?<eos> It didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> Met Bill at a conference a few years ago.<eos> Liked him right away.<eos> His father was a farmer, so we had a lot in common.<eos> He knows what it's like to wake with the sun, tend the animals, live off what you raise.<eos> His father was a shoe salesman... in Philadelphia.<eos> W-well, he talked like a farmer, knew his stuff.<eos> We became friends and, uh...<eos> And he helped you out.<eos> Yep, he did.
I was starting to get nervous it was real.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> It was real?<eos> For a minute there.<eos> More than a minute.<eos> Felt like... freedom, you know?<eos> Like I could taste it.<eos> The Galápagos?<eos> I almost got on my boat today and didn't get back off.<eos> Why didn't you?
So there we were, scraping our sacks in the sandbox.<eos> Open targets in the dunes.<eos> All of us sweating and swearing.<eos> Sure as hell beat sitting on our asses 30 clicks to nowhere waiting for our humpbacked friend to defecate the keys to our transport.<eos> Camels don't eat keys.<eos> They do, it did.
Because...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just one.<eos> It sounds like it's stuck.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey.<eos> You did good finding this place.<eos> Tried to tell you you weren't ready.<eos> We both did.
That's a solid double.<eos> Axelrod... that's bigger.<eos> You speaking for the Attorney General or is this off the cuff?<eos> I speak for everyone.<eos> It's fundraising season.<eos> The administration needs Wall Street money to compete.<eos> Nobody wants this to look like some kind of crusade.<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> I don't think about what it looks like.<eos> Well, the AG does.
We had him boxed up.<eos> He broke like a Mexican condom.<eos> He agreed to cooperate right away.<eos> I wanna help you, Lara.<eos> And Bobby.<eos> Oh. Great.<eos> And I would if I were sure, you know?<eos> Sure?<eos> You're the one who told me.<eos> I did.
'Cause as we've talked about, I don't think you have anything to be ashamed of... in a relativistic sense.<eos> You were scared, you didn't know what was happening, so you did what you knew how to do... you traded.<eos> It was a tough position I put you in before.<eos> I know.<eos> It was.<eos> If we pretended today you worked for me, you know what I would tell you to do.<eos> Go home.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming down.<eos> I did it.
I hope it's not too serious.<eos> It doesn't look good.<eos> Look, I love this place.<eos> There's just one thing that worries me.<eos> What about the arts center project?<eos> I happened to see the file.<eos> If it goes ahead, the building work will last a year.<eos> Then, it'll be very noisy at night.<eos> I have no idea, but I can call the agency.<eos> Yes, please do.
She was supposed to come over last weekend.<eos> And what day was that?<eos> Saturday.<eos> She didn't come.<eos> She texted.<eos> Can you remember what time, love?<eos> I was...<eos> I should've called her.<eos> I just...<eos> I just didn't.
If it was, you'd make damn sure you clung onto the cash, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think he felt for her.<eos> I mean, I'd be more inclined to think jealousy, or something like that.<eos> But... Oh, push for the DNA. Let's clobber him with that.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Say he's telling the truth.<eos> Why did she want cash quickly?<eos> And why not turn to the family?<eos> We done a background on them?
What are we missing?<eos> What bit of her life is not on our radar?<eos> - Work?<eos> - She didn't work.<eos> Well, it's just I'm inputting the statement of the girl who found the body.<eos> She says she went to the pub because she worked there.<eos> Withholding information is as good as lying.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> Just didn't occur to me, that's all.<eos> She did a couple of shifts now and again.
How far's this from where the body was found?<eos> It's a good half-mile.<eos> There's a connection, isn't there?<eos> Cruelty to animals, cruelty to people.<eos> So they say.<eos> And it fits with the manner of her death.<eos> That was cruel.<eos> Kicking her when she's down.<eos> I know you think I didn't see ya.<eos> But I did.
Was she really picking up fellas in the pub?<eos> How about chasing blokes younger than herself?<eos> Because if it is true, and you failed to mention it in our earlier interview --<eos> It's not true.<eos> I was just being a cow and making stuff up.<eos> Are you sure you're telling me everything you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what's your motive for writing these comments? Hm?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just did it.
Because she asked me to.<eos> What, when we came to break the bad news?<eos> So why lie about your sister's whereabouts?<eos> I'm guessing she was seeing some fella.<eos> Oh, so your story is you're covering an infidelity?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And if I was, so what?<eos> Well, for a start, you've obstructed an investigation into your mother's death.<eos> - That not bother you?<eos> - Of course it does!
- Training on a bike?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And that's exactly how you got home, isn't it?<eos> On a bike.<eos> See, you're not as clever as you think you are.<eos> 30 odd miles, that's nothing to a fit bloke like you, is it?<eos> Not when you're in a nasty mood.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> I didn't go anywhere.<eos> Yes, you did. You liar.
Oh. - Careful.<eos> You get the... killing it.<eos> Woman: Here you go.<eos> Oh, we're not gonna need that.<eos> And can you bring us another round?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Make his a double.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> What is that?<eos> Claire, what did you do?
So I drank a beer, and I turned on the damn game, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> - It sounds lame, John.<eos> - What?<eos> It sounds like a made-up story.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It just...<eos> Would...<eos> Would you like to ask me something?<eos> No, don't.
Willa!<eos> It wasn't you.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Oh, I found Danny's secret stash.<eos> Guess where it was.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Mm, ah. I know alcoholics drink for volume, not flavor, but this taste like burnt hair.<eos> Did you even look at the talking points?<eos> You know what?<eos> I didn't.
I can't help you with that.<eos> We're done here.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Cover of "The Trib," "USA Today,"<eos> "The Herald," "The Post,"<eos> "New York Times"...<eos> page three over the fold...<eos> - Well, no one reads that one.<eos> - I do.
- ... with almond milk. ... to the Adam Warren case.<eos> What does your bang buddy think?<eos> He's suspicious, but he's too close to it to tell.<eos> So, he lets the fox into the henhouse to figure it out for him.<eos> That's ballsy.<eos> Somebody get me an almond-milk latte.<eos> - Gus!<eos> - What? - It's his family.<eos> - So? So, I promised him I would give him a heads up before we ran with anything.<eos> Well, I didn't.
You wouldn't believe how many women take their panties off for the dad who lost his son.<eos> First of all, Lynn has asked me to thank the good people of Maine.<eos> It's because of your tips, your initiative, your coming together when she needed it the most that she has her son Brian back.<eos> - [Applause] - Yes!<eos> You know, I don't know if you all believe in miracles.<eos> You know I do.<eos> Today's miracle was created not just by the citizens of Maine, but by its tireless law-enforcement officers, particularly Supervisory Special Agent Gabe Clements of the FBI and Detective Nina Meyer.<eos> On behalf of the whole city, let's thank them for being our heroes!<eos> I-I meant to give it to you for Christmas.<eos> Why didn't you?
The data flow itself is uninterrupted.<eos> My bet is that Axelrod built an enclosure that blocks external electric fields, making electronic surveillance impossible.<eos> It's really smart, actually, if you think about...<eos> Just clean up the audio file best you can.<eos> Donnie wasn't right.<eos> I think he's got the yips or something.<eos> We need to make sure he's not crashing.<eos> We'll go scoop him up.<eos> DeGiulio knows about our informant.<eos> Of course he does.
What can we do?<eos> We can, from this moment forward, remember how the game is supposed to be played.<eos> We'll play perfect strategy.<eos> We will retreat so we can attack when it is to our advantage.<eos> And then someday soon, we will be standing here, and it will be our turn.<eos> I don't wanna stop you, Chuck.<eos> No, we were just finishing up.<eos> All right, get out there and make some fucking money.<eos> You got a handle on this?<eos> I do not.
Might as well be you.<eos> I bet Dollar Bill is doing exactly that with a giant fucking smile on his face.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Well, we've lost the Axe case.<eos> Wilcox cut the Dollar Bill thread.<eos> We need to get circular with our thinking.<eos> Turn the impediments into our own blockers.<eos> Don't worry. I know what I'm talking about.<eos> He wanted to see me?<eos> He did, but not right now.
If I could get one of those nights back... I'm not saying I'd give up all these nights, but, uh... [footsteps approach]<eos> Yeah, I probably have a few things like that I should say.<eos> Then why the fuck are you still sitting here with me?<eos> [exhales sharply] 'Cause one thing's for sure, you got absolutely no game. 'Cause one thing's for sure, you got absolutely no game.<eos> I never cried over Donnie, you know.<eos> You wanted to?<eos> I think I should have, maybe.<eos> Last time you did?<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> - Sure you do.
Nah.<eos> We're just gonna joyride.<eos> - No. [helicopter blades whirring]<eos> ♪ - Are you ready? - Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> [helicopter blades whirring] [beer sloshes] You know, I think you're right about me, Lu.<eos> I'm not your ballsy big sister who doesn't give two shits.<eos> I'm not your ballsy big sister who doesn't give two shits. The old me would've told Bobby to go fuck himself for blowing me off to talk to Wendy Rhoades all night.<eos> So why didn't you?
I wouldn't want to drink it gay either.<eos> Wow, that was bad.<eos> So bad. Horrendous.<eos> See? I'm not closed off.<eos> I was very open to the fact that that was an awful joke.<eos> I didn't say you're closed off about everything.<eos> Just everything emotional.<eos> It's just standard dude stuff, I guess.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't want you to think I'm being super critical.<eos> No, I don't.
- You sold me out!<eos> Tell me how.<eos> Dad said only as a last resort.<eos> Perizad sent me.<eos> We went to Princeton together.<eos> No.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> I didn't know where else to turn.<eos> And now we do.
As far as she can go in one heartbeat.<eos> You're my new best friend.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here.<eos> Two figures, not moving but alive.<eos> Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> The other figures moving in the room... assume bad guys.<eos> One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.<eos> To that end...<eos> At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
May I?<eos> Feels real.<eos> Feels like the others.<eos> It's not the hand.<eos> It's me.<eos> Maybe you're not supposed to get over it.<eos> Some things you can't move past.<eos> They scar you, change you permanently.<eos> I don't know what happened there, on that planet.<eos> I do.
I'm not the one who needs to be silenced.<eos> You'll tell them nothing.<eos> Lincoln!<eos> Cover me.<eos> Kom nau!<eos> All available guards to lock-up.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I don't suppose you know anything about this.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
He keeps it in the pod.<eos> Just stay there. I'll be quick.<eos> You killed her.<eos> I pulled the trigger, but it was you.<eos> Titus... you made Lexa a promise, remember?<eos> Give me the kit.<eos> I know you don't want Ontari to get the Flame.<eos> She murdered those kids, children you raised.<eos> Lexa's spirit would never choose - to do something like that.<eos> - Yes, she did.
This abomination will never ascend.<eos> Kill him.<eos> He's right.<eos> We need him.<eos> For Lexa.<eos> Announce my ascension.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> Don't talk to me as if I'm a fool, Roan.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> He does.
Everybody take your seats. Now!<eos> I'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about Earth skills.<eos> Oh, great. In that case...<eos> Sit down.<eos> How would you feel about assisting me with today's lesson, Mr. Murphy?<eos> Sign me up.<eos> What the hell was that fo...<eos> I know all about you, John Murphy.<eos> - Ah, you do, huh?<eos> - Yeah. I do.
I don't need the country club.<eos> I don't miss it at all.<eos> Cool. Yeah.<eos> I'm just excited to be 100% focused on Idea Bin.<eos> Speaking of which, do you guys ever read that?<eos> Just curious.<eos> I don't.<eos> If I wanted to hear some college kid whining about how being 19 was hard, I'd ask Tamara.<eos> - What about you, Matty?<eos> - I don't.
Right.<eos> I don't know what the hell you are, angel doll, but you're one tasty treat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like to help me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- Thank you so much for meeting us today.<eos> - Gang's all here.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> May and Hunter, you secure the Prime Minister.<eos> Daisy, Bobbi, Mack, contain the General.<eos> Try to get him outside.<eos> We'll send the containment module down to the South exit.<eos> Yeah, be careful.<eos> He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet.<eos> Perhaps we do.
I'll have your things sent to you.<eos> And frankly, you should be more careful when making your vacation plans next time.<eos> We are so sorry, sir.<eos> - It's all yours, Inspector.<eos> - Merci.<eos> So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency. - No.<eos> They do not.
I was at work.<eos> Grace was home with the kids.<eos> Was this Jamie's?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> He wasn't religious.<eos> So do you know why he stayed with the Reverend Haleford over Christmas?<eos> Church just down the road from you.<eos> Oh... We... We thought he was at the fairground.<eos> - Oh, I thought you kept in touch.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
Come on, this way.<eos> So, what were you doing at the fairground? Mm?<eos> I wanted to ask about Brendan.<eos> Looked like you were trying to start a fight.<eos> - I'm not wanting to press charges.<eos> - Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.<eos> I just wanted to ask that fairground owner whether he knew Brendan.<eos> And did he?
No.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> Why were you both running away?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just wanted to be together.<eos> I'm sick of my mum trying to break us up.<eos> Was that the only reason?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Does Harris love you?<eos> - Yeah, of course he does.
Brendan had his head caved in.<eos> So did the pair of you have a fight?<eos> He turns up at the fairground.<eos> You think he's gonna do your caravan over and you whacked him one?<eos> - No!<eos> - So did you whack him a bit too hard?<eos> - You killed him.<eos> - No.<eos> You don't remember when Harris broke his arm?<eos> Well, yeah, of course I do.
I'm sorry I'm so late.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, I can't promise I won't do it again, but what I can promise is that I won't--<eos> You need to shut up now.<eos> - Mm. - Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna shut off your brain... and breathe into your body.<eos> - Close your eyes... relax... and let me do all the work.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
When Mom and Dad left you the house, they had to leave this, too?<eos> Dad wouldn't let Mom take it.<eos> I put it up on eBay.<eos> Turns out, not as valuable as Mom thinks.<eos> Okay, uh, so here's the plan.<eos> Uh, lunch, beers, finish up the bike.<eos> Good?<eos> Good.<eos> I picked up a couple steaks.<eos> No, you didn't.
Like I handle everything, like with Mom and Dad...<eos> I help out.<eos> I helped you move them into the condo.<eos> You showed up three days after I moved them in.<eos> Even now, I'm the one that has to keep everything here afloat.<eos> We can't all just run off to some other...<eos> No one put a gun to your head!<eos> You didn't have to take this house.<eos> You could've sold it.<eos> But I didn't.
I'm sorry I've been away for so long, Chocko.<eos> I can't believe you're moving.<eos> Me too. I have to go back to New York, and I wish I could take you with, but I don't have a place for you, and there, they make horses pull carriages full of disgusting tourists, and that is no life for you.<eos> Shh, don't interrupt.<eos> This is beast-to-beast catharsis.<eos> But I promise I will make sure they take good care of you because you were the best horse ever.<eos> A true friend.<eos> Even if sometimes I might have taken you for granted, you were always there for me... and you never held it against me if I got a little bitchy because you knew how much I loved you, even if I didn't say it<eos> as much as I should have.<eos> But I did.

Yeah.<eos> Nice.<eos> So do you and Caleb see much of each other in DC?<eos> Uh, yeah, we do.<eos> I mean, I don't really see much of anybody except for my phone.<eos> But of all the people that I don't see I don't see Caleb the most.<eos> Or the least.<eos> Uh, it's nice you keep in contact.<eos> I barely see any of my friends from high school.<eos> Oh, we didn't, uh, for a while.
Are we somehow being punished for what we did?<eos> Does my husband bear the brunt of God's anger -for sins he doesn't even know? -You think life is that simple, child?<eos> We will find them.<eos> You're warm.<eos> Do you bleed?<eos> -No.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.
- I killed their horses.<eos> You killed them?<eos> The Khan's sons aren't capable of walking half a day to a way station?<eos> Then why, Orus, have they not arrived at a way station?<eos> The Vice Regent's horse... fell on his leg.<eos> And you left them there.<eos> I thought you'd left me.<eos> Well, I said I was coming back.<eos> - You did?<eos> Yes, you did.
-Entirely.<eos> But you sanctioned the raid?<eos> -Mmm. -I give you my word.<eos> Should your sons not be returned to you, you may take mine to do with as you wish.<eos> Now let's focus on what matters.<eos> Ahmad was injured.<eos> My best guess is they've sought shelter.<eos> You mean your best hope.<eos> You know the likelihood of surviving the steppe, on foot, north of Khantai Gorge.<eos> I do, very well, as do my trackers.
It's the truth.<eos> You, the first woman Khan.<eos> That's what he said.<eos> What would that make me?<eos> Keeper of the hearth?<eos> Maybe.<eos> -That's not what I'm meant to be.<eos> -And I am?<eos> -So you want it?<eos> -What if I did?
Adventuring with Captain Nemo?<eos> Not battling sea creatures or sinking frigates, exactly, but still...<eos> New horizons.<eos> I had a wife, you see.<eos> She passed away just over a year ago.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, I'm just finding my feet again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
I didn't talk to your dad.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, that just felt like something that he would do, you know?<eos> I mean, I thought I got into Wharton, too, until I found out that he made some phone calls.<eos> Oh, my God, your dad helped you get into Wharton?<eos> Ugh. Rich-girl problems are the worst.<eos> Look, you may have called, but I still said yes.<eos> I was excited to come here.<eos> I actually thought that I might meet someone.<eos> Oh, and you did.
We lie to ourselves... all the time.<eos> We're men, so we have trouble asking for help, but tonight, we're gonna help each other.<eos> And it's gonna hurt, but we're gonna get clarity.<eos> You want to start?<eos> No, you... you... You lead it off.<eos> You show me how it's done.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cynthia was right.<eos> I stole my kid.<eos> I did.
They're not gonna be fine.<eos> They're gonna look terrible.<eos> Hi, so, um... who was asking for the kill list?<eos> That would be me.<eos> It was you.<eos> Awesome.<eos> - You're fired. - Hey.<eos> That's my focus puller.<eos> You can't fire him.<eos> And yet, I just did.
Where the hell is my suitor?<eos> Oh, no. No, no, no.<eos> He's my suitor now.<eos> You want to talk to him, you got to deal with me.<eos> - What the hell, Rachel?<eos> - What?<eos> Chet has the suitor?<eos> How did you let Darius out of your sight?<eos> You should've had a P.A. superglued to his ass.<eos> - I did...
Rachel.<eos> Go for Rachel.<eos> Put Brandi in the hole.<eos> When we did that in Season 8...<eos> Just do it!<eos> Copy that.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt her.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> She stepped on my hand.<eos> I really didn't.
Honesty is the most important thing to me.<eos> Okay, I need you to go tight on Brandi.<eos> No, tighter!<eos> I've heard the truth, and I've decided to cut...<eos> Brandi.<eos> You lied about foster care today, - even after I told you about my cousin. - What?<eos> You lied about everything your mother, the scars.<eos> That's not right.<eos> - Not right at all.<eos> - I didn't.
See?<eos> This show has enough footage to make you look good.<eos> We spin it so you tweaked your back saving some girl from drowning, that you have to leave to do some physical therapy.<eos> He doesn't know what he's talking about, okay?<eos> We don't even have close to enough footage.<eos> You have gone on a couple of dates and kissed, like, two girls.<eos> Rachel, he's leaving.<eos> This show is not worth...<eos> Do you know that there's a reporter on set?<eos> Do you?
Ladies, come on, come on, come on!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi. Guess what.<eos> In a short while, Darius is gonna be leaving on a stretcher for the hospital.<eos> Okay, it is a very grave situation.<eos> Very grave.<eos> Rachel said he was okay.<eos> Well, Rachel doesn't know what she's talking about, okay?<eos> - I do.
You demote me to my face.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> It's Chet.<eos> You decent?<eos> Still in your dress, huh?<eos> Um, my zipper got stuck.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Jeremy can't get away with this.<eos> He didn't.
You have got to be kidding me.<eos> What's that look like?<eos> Look, I know we could make this...<eos> I told you I loved you on national television, and you cut me.<eos> You dropped me like a hot rock.<eos> You know what that looks like?<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> You told the whole world that I was too demanding, that I was some kind of sassy, stuck-up bitch.<eos> - I never said that, Ru...<eos> - You did.
Now, you have every right to be upset, but here's the deal... there is not gonna be a problem with this whole immunity thing.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Because I like you.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You are a perfect match for Darius.<eos> Tiffany's not the only one who can be a football princess... or a queen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally... someone who gets me.<eos> Aww. I do, honey.<eos> I really, really do.
- You know you're not supposed to be here.<eos> - Look, I know,<eos> I know. This is important.<eos> - Just hear me out.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Coleman told me.<eos> - Him and Yael, they...<eos> - Yeah, I know all about them.<eos> No, no, you don't.
Quinn, are... come on, Quinn.<eos> God.<eos> - I'll give you a minute.<eos> - Why? You afraid of my undies?<eos> Zip it up.<eos> So I guess I have you to thank for Booth reaching out to me, huh?<eos> Oh, no, it was all his doing.<eos> Turns out the network really loves their little boy wonder.<eos> No, I'm saying you told him to cut Rachel out.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Sure.<eos> - You look amazing.<eos> Thank you, Rachel. Hey, how are you doing?<eos> Oh, thank God, you're so sweet.<eos> I'm actually doing really fine.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Good. - Yeah, I am.<eos> You know, Madison wants to get you in hair and make-up<eos> Are you taking orders from Madison now?<eos> Yeah, just doing my job, just doing my job.
You better, Jay.<eos> If you're worried about your reputation, don't you think walking out now is gonna make you seem like even more of an entitled, prissy cock tease?<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't think that.<eos> I don't. I really don't. It's all social media.<eos> I forget that you guys don't get to see it.<eos> That is not fair!<eos> Just because I'm trying to stay classy in a room full of skanks, like...<eos> I get that.<eos> I totally do.
So they're coming here today.<eos> Gideon.<eos> So glad you could join us.<eos> I'm honored that you would visit our home.<eos> To what do we owe this pleasure?<eos> I felt it was time.<eos> Time for what?<eos> To reveal my true self.<eos> You said you killed him.<eos> I did.
I found this last night... down the back of the ladies' lav.<eos> Money's all there.<eos> Must have fallen out of her pocket or handbag.<eos> Are we square, then?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're square.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She'd been very upset a couple of months ago in class.<eos> I gave her my number, in case she wanted to talk.<eos> And did she?
I'm Daniel.<eos> My name.<eos> Hello, Daniel.<eos> I'm Chloe.<eos> Well, that didn't help.<eos> Which means it did.<eos> Playing Tonk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> - No, you di'int.<eos> - Yes, I did.
And my heart stopped.<eos> But she got up and...<eos> calmed that horse in a way that made me more proud than anything I'd ever done.<eos> And that was the day I told her about Hydra.<eos> - Brought her into the fold.<eos> - Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse.<eos> I taught her to have faith in it as a god.<eos> And she did.
After the hearing, we all went back to the hotel and we got trashed.<eos> And?<eos> We collapsed in my room.<eos> But now the police think that we snuck out and we killed A or Charlotte.<eos> Well, I was thinking maybe... maybe you could say that you-you came to my room and you-you brought me take-out and we talked until the sun came up.<eos> You know what?<eos> Forget that.<eos> Um, I'm sorry I even asked.<eos> - You want me to be your alibi? - No.<eos> No, I don't.
I know.<eos> I know you probably believe that.<eos> Goodnight, Katherine.<eos> Good night!<eos> - Mamma.<eos> - Hey, baby<eos> Hi!<eos> Hey!<eos> Please don't tell me I miss someone's birthday<eos> - No, you didn't
I know you probably believe that.<eos> Goodnight, Katherine.<eos> Good night!<eos> - Mamma.<eos> - Hey, baby<eos> Hi!<eos> Hey!<eos> Please don't tell me I miss someone's birthday<eos> - No, you didn't<eos> - No, you didn't, mamma
Hey, baby.<eos> It's six in the morning.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Couldn't sleep.<eos> Remembered we had some extra paint out back, and... it matches close enough, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up.<eos> This better be good, like I won the lottery good.<eos> You did.
- They took them to the morgue.<eos> Both Phyllis and her husband were shot at close range.<eos> Looks like a single assailant.<eos> Yeah, a good one.<eos> You guys are gonna want to see what's in the living room.<eos> Where does this evidence go?<eos> Jesus.<eos> This is very bad.<eos> You understand that, right?<eos> Yes, of course we do.
Uh, well, I'm sure you know it by now.<eos> We caught Geronimo.<eos> Yes, I briefed the Governor-General and we all heard your radio address.<eos> I wanted the flatlanders to know.<eos> Your bloc, your call.<eos> I'm... I'm curious.<eos> Uh, Geronimo's capture.<eos> Did you let our Hosts know?<eos> Do they know that we have issues with the Resistance?<eos> Of course they do.
! It's over? !<eos> Should we put in the next one?<eos> Of course we should.<eos> We are binge-watching this whole show.<eos> I mean, I haven't been this into something since The Shawshank Redemption.<eos> Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> It does to me.<eos> Did you even like the movie?<eos> I did very much up until that point.
I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> There's a lot we don't understand.<eos> It's a mental and physical break, a disassociation with your bodily functions, something like a coma.<eos> When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.

He's looking at you...<eos> Finely done, cousin, I must say.<eos> Come on. The pitfight.<eos> Nobody thought you had it in you.<eos> Me neither.<eos> You know, uh...<eos> They always told me the world down there was no good.<eos> They'd gone and they'd lost everything that made life worth living.<eos> But me and you, we know that ain't all true.<eos> Oh, we do?
You get scratched?<eos> Hey, you get in a fight?<eos> No.<eos> - You hit him back?<eos> - I didn't get in a fight.<eos> Know something?<eos> I don't know what to say to you.<eos> You already said it without saying it's what I'd say.<eos> I cannot go back down there, G'win, and you know it.<eos> Do I?
Why are you doing this?<eos> To prove a point.<eos> Here's to crime.<eos> You see, I have a reason, a good one.<eos> I have to prove myself...<eos> As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?
Neither backward nor forward.<eos> You once told me that... that love could not be known by reason, that it required only a faith.<eos> Well, I will take that leap, and I will trust you.<eos> And you must try and trust me, too.<eos> Can you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I can try.<eos> I hope this is a new beginning for us.<eos> We deserve it.<eos> Yes, we do.
She watched as Lucifer raked his claws across my body.<eos> You think you know pain?<eos> I was five years old.<eos> It's something, isn't it?<eos> To be betrayed by the person who's supposed to protect you?<eos> My father enlisted me in the army.<eos> Wanted to make a man of me.<eos> But I could've refused.<eos> I could've deserted.<eos> Well, why didn't you?
That's not possible.<eos> I would never.<eos> I...<eos> I love Her Majesty.<eos> And I...<eos> I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.
I would never.<eos> I...<eos> I love Her Majesty.<eos> And I...<eos> I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.
My bad, sorry, go ahead, look pretty.<eos> Once... Oh!<eos> That was a good one.<eos> Stiles!<eos> You're still in the photo.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You ruined it.<eos> Why would I want to ruin your yearbook photo?<eos> Maybe because you haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
Alex is gone, just like his parents, okay?<eos> The Ghost Riders took him, so you guys, you can't be alone.<eos> You got to stick with Scott or with me because I can see them.<eos> Why the hell are you lookin' at me like that?<eos> Do we even know him?<eos> I don't even know if he goes here.<eos> Do you go to this school?<eos> What's your name?<eos> You haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
This is Hydra we're talking about.<eos> You started this, Director.<eos> You need to see it through.<eos> You have all the resources you need.<eos> Update me as you learn more.<eos> Update --<eos> Feel like sharing?<eos> If it becomes a thing, I'll let you know.<eos> You didn't tell him about Daisy.<eos> No, I didn't.
I saw you get shot point-blank.<eos> It's high-density Kevlar, now... who the hell are you?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the Green Arrow.<eos> Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> How did Oliver die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
Let's go.<eos> Adrián?<eos> No, no, no. No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> It wasn't me, I don't know where he is.<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> You suspect that Tomás Garrido was the person in the room?<eos> Don't you?
Now she works near Bierge, in the valley, 20 minutes from home.<eos> Being lured to that hotel so far away is no coincidence.<eos> Tomás Garrido set a trap for you.<eos> He could've sent you that package himself so you'd put the pieces of the puzzle together wrongly and make you doubt what really happened, because it was the only way he'd find the missing piece.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'll wait for you in the Hotel Bellavista.<eos> **He couldn't have known about the swamp.<eos> The area where you buried him is full of swampy lakes and the locals know it.<eos> Tomás Garrido only had to toss a coin in the air and wait for you to bite.<eos> And you did.
That's not true.<eos> - You can't prove it.<eos> - Nor you the opposite.<eos> Let's look at it backwards.<eos> Wouldn't the pieces fit if you'd taken the initiative in all of this?<eos> - What are you doing? - Calling the police.<eos> Listen, it wasn't our fault, it was the damn deer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
What... What does that mean?<eos> If we can't help you, you'll stay and become one of us.<eos> A Skinwalker.<eos> You'll walk with us under the sun through the dust.<eos> Forever.<eos> They're alive.<eos> I mean the Chimeras.<eos> Some of them, not all of them.<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, you do?
We both knew that sooner or later, we're gonna get into another fight.<eos> I can't just say I'm sorry.<eos> I feel like I have to do something.<eos> Like maybe, somehow I have to save your life.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm pretty sure you'll get a chance.<eos> Well, not down here.<eos> We've been walking around for hours and all we've been able to find is some stupid snake sculpture on the wall.<eos> You think it's important?<eos> You didn't.
Okay, admittedly, a lot could go wrong.<eos> Everything could go wrong.<eos> Guys, if we don't do this, we lose Lydia.<eos> She's going to die in there tonight.<eos> And she might take a lot of innocent people with her.<eos> Have you ever actually put that thing on someone?<eos> Not in years.<eos> Close the doors, would you?<eos> How do you know it still works?<eos> I don't.
How'd you learn to fight with a sword?<eos> That just kind of happened too.<eos> So you've never worked for anything and basically you're a cheater?<eos> This wasn't my idea.<eos> How are we even getting past the front gate?<eos> I have a guy on the inside.<eos> And stop changing the subject.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> No, it didn't.
Scott.<eos> That guy's not moving at all.<eos> Look...<eos> Help me.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> Please...<eos> You can't help him.<eos> That's big.<eos> No one said it was that big.<eos> I did.
I have got him.<eos> Come, Marcel. Out to the well.<eos> Do you have any cloth?<eos> Something to wrap your hand?<eos> Yes.<eos> In the cellar.<eos> You'll find what you're looking for in the cellar.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Release the arrow.<eos> Do it, Marie-Jeanne.
Hayden.<eos> Your name is Hayden.<eos> Melissa...<eos> Melissa!<eos> Malia. Come down.<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> I'm not going to stop, Malia.<eos> I'm taking back what you stole from me.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> But you did.
I know I don't owe you a damn thing, - but I need your help.<eos> - I am helping you.<eos> Asa, we both know that you don't have a chance in hell of winning this thing, but losing and getting sent back down there?<eos> That's better than getting your throat cut in your sleep.<eos> Yeah? How the hell do you know?<eos> Thank you so much for joining me.<eos> I know how busy you must be.<eos> But we're gonna be working together on this eviction so I thought, well, let's break some bread.<eos> I've always been friends of y'all, you know that.<eos> Mm, I do.
No, I know it didn't.<eos> You did that to yourself.<eos> Come on, let me see that cut before it gets infected.<eos> That would be funny, though, wouldn't it?<eos> What?<eos> Me getting sick?<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> You dying' after spending half a year in that box.<eos> I don't know, but I find that very funny.<eos> Of course you do.
What painting?<eos> The painting. Yeah.<eos> Me too... yeah.<eos> How about we talk first?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.<eos> That is because I work hard to hide who I really am.<eos> You don't have to hide with me.<eos> I just have to really trust someone if they're gonna know the truth.<eos> Do you?
That's a lie sold to you by the government.<eos> Go find some girls, get into trouble.<eos> Live a little.<eos> Damn.<eos> We're gay.<eos> Even better.<eos> Go gays!<eos> Now get out of my face!<eos> I don't get paid to lock up after you losers.<eos> Yes, you do.
See what I can do.<eos> Drink?<eos> I'm 28 weeks pregnant.<eos> Was that a yes or a no?<eos> What is it like inside your head?<eos> I'm genuinely curious because it must be wonderfully liberating to only see what you want to see.<eos> You know what I'm curious about?<eos> - Hmm. - Why the Phoenix Stone made my mother a character in my hellscape when it had so many other options of torture to choose from.<eos> And this is why I begged Bonnie to get Stefan out first.<eos> Well, why didn't she?
My brother.<eos> That has to be the solution to this hell puzzle, too.<eos> We find a way to get to Stefan.<eos> We stop reliving this day over and over and over again.<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> We are returning to camp.<eos> I insist.<eos> You are not yourself.<eos> Do you want leave to see your peach of a sweetheart?<eos> Do you, Henry?
Pain is real.<eos> Feeling is real.<eos> Unh!<eos> Unh!<eos> Ha ha!<eos> Ha ha ha!<eos> You love this, don't you?<eos> I'm gonna die knowing my own son hates me.<eos> Yes.<eos> He does.
Fine.<eos> I hope it's a long time before I'm proven right.<eos> Klaus.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Aurora.<eos> The moment he looks at you as he looked at me.<eos> The moment you know he is in love with you, you're going to do something for me.<eos> You will drink this blood of mine, and then you will slit your own throat and bleed out silently.<eos> You will want to cry out, but you will not make a sound.<eos> She did this to me.
She was one of the first Strix.<eos> We cared for one another deeply.<eos> Together we created a fellowship unburdened by the limitations of man.<eos> It was the pursuit of a glorious new world.<eos> And then father...<eos> Led by that unquenchable desire to slay his children, Mikael descended, accompanied by a small army.<eos> He laid to waste everything that I built.<eos> So... we had no choice but to run.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Aya did not.
Did Jillian like it?<eos> Was she pleased?<eos> Kinda, yeah.<eos> On a scale of one to ten ten being very pleased, over the moon......<eos> Ezra......<eos> - I need a number.<eos> Nine, eight and a half, I....<eos> Eight and a quarter.<eos> She had notes.<eos> Did she?
Like, made for you.<eos> Not when we have two monsters after us.<eos> Spencer's not answering.<eos> Yeah, well, she's probably still dealing with the fallout from the Yvonne leak.<eos> There's no way Spencer's parents will believe Caleb did that.<eos> Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought that we had a new A, they would march straight down to the police station.<eos> You guys, our stalker already warned us.<eos> Okay?<eos> If we talk to the cops we're gonna have targets on our backs.<eos> We already do!
You saved my life again.<eos> Really, at the expense of your own.<eos> Well, you didn't deserve to die.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> My brother would have liked you.<eos> I already told you everything I know, John.<eos> I'm not here to ask you any questions, Andy.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh...<eos> Glad I did.
Oh, my God.<eos> I told you, John.<eos> The railguns were a distraction.<eos> Argus is the endgame.<eos> If this is retribution for the work Agent Chang and I did crippling Shadowspire, clearly it didn't take.<eos> Vengeance and retribution are useless pursuits.<eos> For one thing, they don't pay.<eos> I'm here for Rubicon, and you--you're gonna give me the codes to access it.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> I do.
It was your idea actually.<eos> You needed proof about the Lotus, I needed proof about my dad.<eos> You set a trap for him as a test.<eos> Unrestricted access to Palmer Technologies' RD lab.<eos> He flunked with flying colors.<eos> I don't even know why I'm surprised.<eos> You're surprised because you're hoping that he's the parent you've always wanted him to be, the parent you deserve.<eos> In an extremely ironic role reversal, my mother was smarter than me.<eos> She said, "People don't change, no matter how much you want them to."<eos> Some people don't.
How long will she be in a coma?<eos> Right now she's barely a 3 on the Glasgow Scale.<eos> Prognosis isn't good.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thea, please don't go.<eos> There's only one way o prevent that.<eos> My father once told me of an elixir known as Lotus, capable of countering he effects of the Lazarus Pit.<eos> A secret weapon developed by the League's enemies.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> I do.
Everything has unfolded according to Providence.<eos> What do you think is under there anyway?<eos> Power, Mr. Queen.<eos> I'm glad you have recuperated.<eos> We have much to accomplish together.<eos> Reiter's pet.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know you killed Vlad.<eos> I watched.<eos> We all did.
Curtis...<eos> In a perfect world, it will work in time for you to walk down the aisle, I mean, but it's pretty cutting edge, so I can't promise anything.<eos> You're telling me that this little piece of technology's gonna help me walk again?<eos> After it's implanted in your spine, yes.<eos> He's been trying to crack it for a while, but he needed a power source, something that would last a lifetime.<eos> Palmer Technologies' power cell.<eos> Exactly. Once I solved that, I knew this might actually work.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
We're gonna hit the streets, see if we can get a line on Cutter.<eos> OK.<eos> You want to talk about the other obvious problem?<eos> Yeah, the, uh, elephant in the room.<eos> Felicity and I are fine.<eos> Yeah, well, if you were listening to her little asides, you would know that was not true.<eos> John--heh heh--you were the one who told me to give her time.<eos> OK.<eos> Do you want to get back together with her?<eos> I do.
Whatever he wants to call himself.<eos> I told him where Chief Reynolds was staying.<eos> The next day, the place blows up.<eos> Objection.<eos> Conjecture.<eos> Something you're free to challenge on cross-examination.<eos> Continue, Ms. Lance.<eos> What else did you do for the defendant?<eos> He wanted me to give him access to the SCPD computer network.<eos> I did it.

[Birds chirping] [Dog barks] [Birds chirping]<eos> Alex?<eos> [Loud clang]<eos> Hello?<eos> Alex?<eos> [Clatter]<eos> Alex?<eos> Hey. Morning.<eos> And here I thought you were gonna sleep past breakfast.<eos> I... I almost did.
Thank you for meeting me.<eos> Of course, my baby girl.<eos> Oh, my God. Ha ha ha!<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I'm always here for you as long as there's no bees around.<eos> No bees.<eos> What--are you ok?<eos> Does the word Ravenspur mean anything to you?<eos> If this is something to do with your father, honey--<eos> So it does.
Every time I knock down a firewall, 5 more pop back up.<eos> It would seem that Mr. Darhk has a counter-hacker in his employ.<eos> And he's good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ok.<eos> I might have something.<eos> Now, until the FBI gets their way, smartphones are protected by encryption.<eos> If you don't enter your passcode after enough times, then the device bricks itself, right?<eos> Curtis, I don't even have the time to tell you that I don't have the time.<eos> You just did.
His death is inevitable.<eos> Why waste his life when it can make me stronger?<eos> What are you doing with my clothes?<eos> When I get stressed, I... I like to fold.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know. When you two were married, it was like living at the gap.<eos> Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.

Peter, we've got great news!<eos> Chris isn't playing!<eos> He's not?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, 'cause we broke his arm like you told us to.<eos> Shattered.<eos> We shattered his arm.<eos> You what?<eos> ! I never told you to do that!<eos> You didn't?
Okay, enough.<eos> How dare any of you criticize Bonnie?<eos> For years, she gave up her own dreams to take care of Joe.<eos> And yeah, maybe she kissed me.<eos> Maybe she needed to because she feels so trapped in her marriage.<eos> It's true.<eos> No one ever takes the time to ask how I feel.<eos> Brian's the only one.<eos> They don't get us, Bonnie, and you deserve better than this.<eos> We both do.
I will now do anything for ten dollars.<eos> Who's got something for me?<eos> I got one.<eos> I'll give you ten bucks if you wear the same pair of underwear for a month.<eos> Pay up.<eos> Uh, actually, you owe me $20.<eos> Ew. Here's $50, go change your underwear.<eos> It won't come off.<eos> Hey, Peter, you want to earn another ten bucks?<eos> Course I do.
Come in, file a report, and I'll get onto it.<eos> Oh, no, we'll handle it.<eos> You have other things to deal with.<eos> I know how overwhelmed you are.<eos> Think you're pretty smart.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're pretty smart.<eos> Went to college, got your education, sitting behind your desk.<eos> You think you know me.<eos> Well, yes, I do.
Nope, not sleepy.<eos> You know, as a former CEO of a major biotech company, I'm used to certain amenities.<eos> This place is old, and it smells.<eos> It smells like old.<eos> Probably haunted.<eos> It's definitely haunted.<eos> You know, some people think that ghosts are just replays. Traumatic events recorded into their surroundings... Into time.<eos> And there are the sedatives.<eos> You don't believe in ghosts, do you?<eos> I don't.
Two years later, Katherine emerged as Batwoman.<eos> She's impressive, but her methods make her a danger to this city.<eos> And to herself.<eos> It's time for me to decide if I'm going to take her under my wing... Or take her down.<eos> Poor Katey.<eos> It always begins with death. Doesn't it, Alfred?<eos> I'm as astonished as you are, Master Dick.<eos> Anyone mind filling me in?<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I just do.
Excuse me!<eos> So, you're a cop?<eos> A detective.<eos> You have a problem with that?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> You just don't look the part.<eos> What's a cop supposed to look like?<eos> Not as hot as you.<eos> Did I just say that out loud?<eos> Uh... yeah, you did.
What?<eos> She calls herself a bitch.<eos> - She did.<eos> - So I can say that.<eos> Whoa, whoa. You hear that?<eos> I think we got another beatboxer in the office.<eos> Ders, go in there and then rap over his flow, and I'll FaceTime Pauly.<eos> - Yeah, I'll do that, yeah.<eos> - You got his number!<eos> Yes, I did.
2016, Central City.<eos> Of all the places in time, you want to go there?<eos> That's right.<eos> To the exact moment Hunter recruited me and my partner on this suicidal mission of his, but, this time, I'm gonna tell him where to shove it.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> I let you go, you'll deliver the Waverider.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do we have an accord?<eos> You think your friends will believe you were able to escape?<eos> Not unless I do this.
How's your oxygen level?<eos> Uh, I think the technical term is "lousy."<eos> Just two more minutes.<eos> You got this.<eos> Nothing quite like dying to make you think about all the mistakes, all the wrong choices.<eos> Is this Leonard Snart coming to God in his final moments?<eos> Hardly.<eos> Just wishing I could take a few things back.<eos> I should've left Mick in future Star City.<eos> Why didn't you?
Welcome to the club.<eos> Gideon, what's happening on the Acheron?<eos> Funny you should ask.<eos> I just received a message from Mr. Rory.<eos> It seems he escaped capture and is now returning to the Waverider.<eos> Told you.<eos> Those pirates picked the wrong guy to mess with.<eos> Since when does Rory even know how to fly the jump ship?<eos> How did he even find us?<eos> Actually, I did the flying.
My powers were given by the Kree... yours by S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> They're the ones who made us.<eos> Why are you worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> Because I'm curious if you can defeat what made you.<eos> The people at S.H.I.E.L.D. are my friends.<eos> Friends who will turn on you, who will try and sabotage the connection we share.<eos> Only because they don't understand, but they will if we can make them share our connection.<eos> You want to put your friends through the Kree experiment.<eos> Once Radcliffe has worked out the kinks, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
An hour ago?<eos> And you just... kept me down here this whole time?<eos> Well, you needed to rest.<eos> I needed to be up there, helping, not locked down here like some prisoner!<eos> Your immune system is completely shut down!<eos> Anyone so much as sneezes, and it might kill you.<eos> So until you've fully recovered, you are a prisoner... you're my prisoner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I just don't know what to do.<eos> None of us do.
You were right to trust me.<eos> I'm finished with S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And actually, I have answers.<eos> The DNA you need... I have it.<eos> Inhuman DNA is not enough.<eos> We needed to drain actual Kree blood.<eos> Which is what I have pumping through my veins.<eos> Coulson used it to bring me back after Quinn shot me.<eos> Ward should remember.<eos> He does.
She died aborting your child!<eos> - She felt the same.<eos> She did.<eos> - Listen to yourself.<eos> Look, if I'd have known what she was going to do, if she'd have told me...<eos> I lost her, Sidney.<eos> I loved her and I lost her.<eos> Some days I can barely go on.<eos> - I didn't think you liked me.<eos> - I didn't.
Sidney!<eos> You wouldn't be up for a pint, would you?<eos> By the look of you, you're about ready for a top-up.<eos> I'm gonna kill him!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Please, Mr Redmond!<eos> Please.<eos> - You knew where he was.<eos> - I didn't.
- She has no alibi either.<eos> You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so,<eos> - Where's your compassion?<eos> - But what you say...<eos> - Have you no heart?<eos> - may be put into writing...<eos> So what does the day hold for you?<eos> Nothing eventful.<eos> - Do you remember when we first met?<eos> - Course I do.
Absolutely not.<eos> I...<eos> You're many things, Archdeacon, but you're not a very good liar.<eos> Are you questioning my judgment?<eos> Sam atoned for his sins!<eos> - The Bishop will have something...<eos> - to say about this.<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew you were going to say that.<eos> He did.
This is for me.<eos> Go!<eos> Pony, no!<eos> - Don't be upset.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You remember that-- you remember that trip to Italy? It was so amazing.<eos> - Amazing times.<eos> - It was so amazing.<eos> Do you remember the thing you kept doing in Naples?<eos> You don't?
- I never killed anybody.<eos> But you ruined that girl's life, the one your son raped.<eos> Kelly.<eos> That's her name, by the way, in case you forgot.<eos> You could have asked so many questions about that night, but you didn't.<eos> Not once.<eos> So, don't take the moral high ground.<eos> You just sound like the hypocrite you are.<eos> I need to know exactly what happened to Robbie Morton and Michael Thompson before I continue to protect you.<eos> No, you don't!
We went down to the car deck to smoke some weed.<eos> And... .. he thought it was a funny idea to get inside it.<eos> That it would be a good place for us to be alone.<eos> He was totally wasted.<eos> And then, he passed out.<eos> You walked away... .. and you closed the door, and then, you just left him there?<eos> And you just pretended to look for him?<eos> I wanted Michael to get the blame when Robbie was reported missing.<eos> I thought you would find him! I did!<eos> I really, really did!
Evelina.<eos> whatever happens you must know everything.<eos> Do you know Sparen?<eos> the one who drowned.<eos> lying by the side of the road.<eos> He would have died if I hadn't helped him.<eos> I took him home and made him coffee.<eos> but I doubt it.<eos> I get up early....<eos> I did something terrible.
- Are you sure?<eos> - I was in my cabin all night.<eos> Can anyone corroborate that?<eos> As I told your boss when he took my statement -- no.<eos> We'd like to take a fingerprint sample from you. Elimination purposes.<eos> Unless you're arresting and charging me, I don't have to give you prints.<eos> And any prints you DO take without my consent are unusable in court.<eos> So, again -- no.<eos> - You know your rights.<eos> - Aye, I do.
- Apart from that... no...<eos> - No. - ..nothing.<eos> Does this mean anything to you?<eos> Is that his family?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I know...<eos> I know you need answers.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> Do you reject sin so as to live in the freedom of God's children?<eos> I do.

I know you need answers.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> Do you reject sin so as to live in the freedom of God's children?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you reject the glamour of evil and refuse to be mastered by sin?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty,<eos> - creator of heaven and Earth?<eos> - I do. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and was buried, rose from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
At home, "Did you take your meds?"<eos> At work, "You're late.<eos> Pick up the pace."<eos> If you don't like it, leave.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Good!<eos> Go!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
Why don't we just go and get a fish supper instead?<eos> I've always found this place slightly up its own arse.<eos> - It's nice to meet you.<eos> - You, too.<eos> Hello?<eos> 'Asha, it's Jimmy Perez.'<eos> Michael Thompson and Robbie Morton - they were father and son.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Well, in my country, women are not encouraged or licensed to drive.<eos> Apparently, it makes us vulnerable to sin.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> Mr. Riley, so sorry to interrupt you.<eos> - I had a...<eos> - Ah, Ms. Winters.<eos> General Halabi, this is Stella Winters, another potential investor from London.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, General.<eos> I think I found Edith's jewels.<eos> You did not.

[Car engine revs] Where is she going?<eos> Danny: Mm, wherever it is, she doesn't plan to stay long.<eos> She has a staff meeting she confirmed via e-mail.<eos> Any other telltale e-mails?<eos> Nothing even remotely adultery-ish.<eos> So... is there any way that you want to talk about what's going on with you and Val?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> I did.
That's Phillip Thompson, the C.E.O. of Olympic Edge.<eos> The tech company?<eos> Not just tech anymore.<eos> Huge military contracts.<eos> Yeah, not just our military.<eos> You two look cozy in here.<eos> Shouldn't you be in the Security wing, Shawn?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Do you not know those people are?<eos> I do.
Your mystery woman...<eos> Give it to her.<eos> Call her.<eos> I can't accept this.<eos> You deserve love.<eos> Zara!<eos> So that's it, then.<eos> They've gone.<eos> I don't suppose she gave you a check.<eos> She did.
You're out of debt.<eos> So what now?<eos> What do we do?<eos> I mean, no offense, but you are a thief.<eos> There is that.<eos> And technically, I can't trust you.<eos> I mean, I shouldn't, right?<eos> So what are we gonna do?<eos> We don't even really know each other.<eos> Yes, we do.
This is my debt!<eos> It's my problem!<eos> It's my fault I stole the bracelet from you.<eos> I am doing this alone.<eos> Let me help.<eos> I want to help.<eos> You want to help me steal a bracelet?<eos> I want to help you not die.<eos> You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.<eos> No, I don't.
She still is.<eos> - But no contact information for Margot?<eos> - No.<eos> And no record of a Margot Bishop entering the country.<eos> And the only alias we have is Jessie Philips.<eos> Even the QR19 software couldn't find a match.<eos> So we don't know anything.<eos> We don't know where she is, what she's doing.<eos> We have no way to find her.<eos> We actually do.
- I know.<eos> No, no.<eos> You can't promise that.<eos> What you can promise is that you will grow tired of each other.<eos> Wow.<eos> Sweetie.<eos> You will have an affair with your personal trainer.<eos> You know, who knows?<eos> We just don't know.<eos> We don't, do we?
Yesterday, just after you left.<eos> We were sitting right here, and he got down on one knee, and he proposed.<eos> It was really lovely, actually.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Well, I said no, of course.<eos> W...<eos> I'm not gonna sit here and say to you and Morgan that marriage is an outdated concept and then turn around and marry him.<eos> Yeah, but you love him, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
Paige Baker, I'd like for you to meet...<eos> Michael Thorne.<eos> I was wearing a wire, hoping to get a confession.<eos> And what did he tell you?<eos> And I love you.<eos> Nothing else matters.<eos> That he loves me.<eos> And then he returned the money he'd stolen from a Kuroqi princess.<eos> I don't suppose she gave you a check.<eos> - She did.
- Uh, it's not working.<eos> Okay. - Here, let me.<eos> No, I got it. I got it.<eos> Just go. Go.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Go.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I think you messed something up.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I didn't.
Do you want me to come back?<eos> I want you to, yes.<eos> Always has been. No, you're not here. You're not here.<eos> It's... it's... it's part of the illness, and... and I have to control it, so I need you to leave.<eos> I need you to leave right now, please.<eos> You know you didn't kill me.<eos> I did.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Mother told me.<eos> You didn't.
Say something, Esther.<eos> I love you.<eos> Say something else.<eos> No.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know if it's a good idea, Sofia.<eos> - I'm afraid it's premature.<eos> - Premature, Your Eminence?<eos> The time it takes to develop and update the merchandise, it means we have to move right away, before the fakes start appearing.<eos> The crooks are always so much faster, who knows how they do it.<eos> Criminal organizations are faster because they don't forgive inefficiency.<eos> At the risk of seeming too materialistic, Your Eminence, do you know how much the Vatican coffers lose for every day that passes without any new papal merchandizing on the market?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> - Now do you understand why I need the Holy Father's immediate approval?<eos> Yes, I do.
What 's your answer?<eos> It requires a great overarching vision, I imagine.<eos> Precisely the opposite.<eos> No vision whatsoever, but by placing importance on the irrelevant things.<eos> And do you know how I manage to learn all the irrelevant things that no one wants to tell me?<eos> No... how?<eos> By learning people's secrets and threatening to reveal those secrets to the Pope.<eos> One bottle of gin doesn't make an alcoholic of me.<eos> Agreed.<eos> One bottle doesn't.
Because of how badly this might disappoint the Pope.<eos> Because of the terrible repercussions that might ensue if news of this matter were to get out.<eos> Shouting, dramatic scenes, transfers, firings.<eos> And of course it's especially embarrassing in moral terms:<eos> Catholics united in holy matrimony swear to be faithful to their spouses.<eos> You have sinned, Esther.<eos> We know and we understand that this was a moment of weakness.<eos> It happens.<eos> As a boy, whenever Napoli, my favourite soccer team, was in serious trouble, don't you think I found myself being a little sympathetic toward Avellino?<eos> Yes, I did.
A dazzling image, so dazzling it blinds people.<eos> In other words, a powerful, an evocative image, not unlike that of Christ.<eos> But Pius XIII doesn't merely dazzle, he offers reassurance as well.<eos> With a magnificent speech, full of quotations in Latin, it tells them that they, the faithful, must not be afraid.<eos> And how could they be afraid, with a Pope as handsome and reassuring as Christ?<eos> Last of all, just a few short weeks before the elections, the Pope says just two words:<eos> "non expedit".<eos> - Do you know what that means?<eos> - No.<eos> No, of course you don't.
Well...<eos> I don't know.<eos> -It wasn't your TV.<eos> - No, but...<eos> - You need to prove that.<eos> - Why didn't you think of that'?<eos> It has to be in writing.<eos> - You need the proof before they arrive.<eos> - Don't you ever think ahead?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I heard you were upset.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't see you earlier.<eos> I was in the middle of a session.<eos> - Oh, no, that's... That's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I do need to tell you something.<eos> - Whatever it is, you can tell me.<eos> - I have reason to believe that my mother is insane and might be killing people.<eos> - You know if you make that accusation, I will have to report this to the authorities.<eos> - I do.
- She's stable for now.<eos> - Have you seen the others?<eos> - I checked the containment room.<eos> By the looks of it, Fitz and May climbed up into the Zephyr.<eos> Then there's hope they'll stop them.<eos> Or be blown to bits.<eos> Did you notice the heat?<eos> - I increased the temperature because ...<eos> - We figured it out, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Us?<eos> I just think... we need to work on ourselves before we can talk about us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The stuff that I did, Lincoln,<eos> - I can't live with it.<eos> - I remember that pain ... sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I ...
I've hit bottom.<eos> I know what it's like to be so addicted to something that you'd do anything to get her back.<eos> Hive and his worker bees will be down here any second.<eos> - And then?<eos> - Even if we could steal the warhead, it's probably on a timer by now, timed with their ascent.<eos> I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one.<eos> Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but ...<eos> - I do.
- I'm glad.<eos> - Really ?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your daughter spews lies.<eos> - You've got nothing to say ?<eos> - Well, she's 17... - It's normal.<eos> - She's going out with Gregorio.<eos> - So ? They're an item.<eos> - I don't like him.<eos> - She does.
Sofia ?<eos> - In her bedroom.<eos> - I'll go and say hello.<eos> - No, leave her be.<eos> - You're at war ?<eos> - Guerrilla warfare.<eos> What happened ?<eos> I found condoms in her bag.<eos> No !<eos> - God, what if Rosa does that ?
Come on, we'll all put our phones on the table.<eos> - Then what ?<eos> - While we're eating, texts, WhatsApp messages, calls, whatever arrives, we share it.<eos> - We don't have any secrets.<eos> - What sort of game is that ?<eos> - It might be fun.<eos> - Think so ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Come on ! Let's do it.<eos> - Do what ?
If I were cheating, I wouldn't have suggested this game.<eos> Or you are and you want to be found out.<eos> There's this psychological mechanism according to which... serial-killers do all they can to get found out.<eos> Let's do.<eos> We can stop ifwe get bored.<eos> Yes, it's like when we played truth or dare as kids.<eos> So what ?<eos> We used to jerk off together as kids too.<eos> - I didn'tjerk offwith you.<eos> - No, you did it alone.
- I haven't been going long.<eos> - How long ?<eos> About six months.<eos> That's long enough.<eos> - Are you angry ?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes...<eos> I don't know, a bit.<eos> - You never wanted to before.<eos> - I do now.
I thought we were in a hurry.<eos> Well, I can't leave without buying anything, it's against my religion.<eos> Of course, if you don't want yours...<eos> Right, I've spoken to the landlord -<eos> Owen hasn't been there since lunchtime.<eos> So you better tell the Inspector.<eos> Tell him what?<eos> That Owen did it!<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Course we do!
We frightened you, we are sorry.<eos> We want to ask you to come to our village.<eos> To Goto.<eos> People miss our faith there.<eos> Our children need you.<eos> We have no mass, no confession.<eos> All we can do is pray.<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did one of the faithful?
I saw him on the website.<eos> - Michael Edgerton?<eos> Yeah, his murder was posted a couple of hours ago.<eos> I watched him bleed to death.<eos> What was the website called?<eos> Taking Out The Trash.<eos> - Charming.<eos> We'll have to ring Special Branch to even use the password.<eos> Some 14-year-old on the other side of the world can access it, but we have to ask if we're allowed.<eos> No, we don't.
Look at him, Katie.<eos> He's growing up alone.<eos> Please don't touch the art.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Charlotte wants you to manage the correspondence today.<eos> What?<eos> You put me back on envelope duty?<eos> Brett will set you up.<eos> Charlotte, I don't understand.<eos> No, apparently you don't.
What?<eos> You put me back on envelope duty?<eos> Brett will set you up.<eos> Charlotte, I don't understand.<eos> No, apparently you don't.<eos> You serve at my pleasure.<eos> Whatever I've been kind enough to give you, I can take back just as quickly.<eos> Like the medical care we're providing for your son.<eos> I would never to anything to jeopardize my position with you.<eos> Well, you did.
- Things are different now, D.<eos> - No.<eos> We've always protected each other.<eos> When you had me shunned, I was furious.<eos> But now...<eos> I get it.<eos> You'll always protect me, no matter what.<eos> Even if I hate you for it.<eos> You deserve to be free of Klaus.<eos> We all do.
That's not your decision to make!<eos> Control yourself.<eos> Unless you can't.<eos> It's worse than I remember.<eos> The rage.<eos> The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.<eos> I never really cared to.<eos> But now you do.
"And a box made so fine.<eos> "Come quickly.<eos> If not, then poor Freya shall rot, buried in dirt for all time."<eos> The woman is insane.<eos> Does she have to punish us with the world's most unfortunate limerick?<eos> Is it not enough that we're forced to play her wretched games?<eos> Freya saw a vision of herself buried alive.<eos> Aurora will do everything in her power to bring about this miserable prophecy.<eos> Let's go stop her, shall we?<eos> What did you do to me?
We need three different cures to three different ailments, each of which could take years to find, and none of us will make it through the day.<eos> Oh, that doesn't bode well.<eos> Let's cut the niceties.<eos> I need you to cure my brothers before something's done that can't be undone.<eos> Oh, there's no going back.<eos> This is a fight to the death, and I won't lose.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You really need to ask that?<eos> Can you honestly defend them?<eos> After what they did to me?
- No... just wondering why you had your friends bring me here if you were just gonna pick out man jewelry.<eos> I requested your company for a progress update, 'cause I am still waiting for you to get me access to the Mikaelson home.<eos> It's not magic keeping you out.<eos> They signed over the deed to the place;<eos> they put it in the sister's name.<eos> You can't get in unless she invites you.<eos> Hmm, perhaps I'll lure him out another way.<eos> If killing his girlfriend didn't get him out of the house,<eos> I don't know what will.<eos> I do.
I did everything you asked.<eos> I joined your stupid cult,<eos> I left my friends in the dust because that's what you needed!<eos> Marcel...<eos> I fought for Hope!<eos> I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.

You wanted me to be the regent of the nine covens.<eos> You believed that I could lead our people.<eos> But how am I supposed to be a leader when you keep jerking me around like I'm a damn puppet or something?<eos> I need you to talk to me.<eos> They won't answer you.<eos> Van Nguyen.<eos> All grown up, I see.<eos> Not that it matters, man.<eos> This ain't got nothing to do with you.<eos> Actually, it does.
Have you come to have a go at me?<eos> Get out of here, Camille!<eos> Shut up, Nik.<eos> This is between us girls.<eos> Though I suppose I will let you listen to her cries as I tear off her limbs like the wings of pretty little butterfly.<eos> I'd like to see you try.<eos> You're brandishing your antiques at me.<eos> I suppose I would be scared if I thought you were quick enough to use them.<eos> You really did not think this through, did you?<eos> Actually, we did.
You must be starving.<eos> Could I just start with coffee, please?<eos> Right there in the pot.<eos> Hey!<eos> What'd I say? !<eos> What the hell did I say if you woke me up again?<eos> !<eos> Huh?<eos> !<eos> - Just do it already, man.

Don't make a big deal out of it.<eos> You know, for a bad influence, you're not really pulling your weight.<eos> I missed you in chem today.<eos> Hepner almost caught me thinking about you with my hand down my panties.<eos> Help me with my homework?<eos> Mole mass and mass mass?<eos> Stoichiometry?<eos> I don't get any of it.<eos> Do you?<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah.<eos> He said get a car.<eos> Come on, hurry up.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey, kid!<eos> Aah!<eos> You don't remember our faces.<eos> Say it.<eos> I don't, I don't.
You know what time it is?<eos> Yeah, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm looking for my dad.<eos> He used to live there.<eos> Yeah, when was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was probably about... about 15 years ago.<eos> You got a last name for your father?<eos> Uh... n-no, I don't.
Um, don't we have to give it to them in person?<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> That half-lostie, the one who come back... he's a bookreader.<eos> Go get him.<eos> Lady Ray wants to see you.<eos> What's she want with him?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Oh, you pay your respect to the Bren'in, for she had a long reign.<eos> And that ends tonight.<eos> Yes, it does.
Honey, I've been a miserable son of a bitch the last two years.<eos> That all stops right now.<eos> Come on. Get in.<eos> Ooh. Heated seats.<eos> Keep your butt warm.<eos> And it turns over when you put the key in.<eos> Thought they weren't hiring yet.<eos> I made a good impression on the right people, I guess.<eos> And they give you a truck?<eos> For managers, they do.
I did what you asked me to do...<eos> Stop 'em.<eos> You should be thankin' me.<eos> Bhradain and Enoch told Shurn they were set up.<eos> I made one call to the gun shop, G'win.<eos> One phone call, that's it.<eos> Did you want people to get hurt?<eos> No, I did what you asked me to do.<eos> Does Foster have guns?<eos> Does he?
You gotta believe me.<eos> You don't get to tell me what I gotta believe, you waste of flesh.<eos> The only thing I'm obliged to do is make sure you do no more harm to this family.<eos> You didn't know I had this, did you?<eos> I had to protect myself against your fa, didn't I?<eos> He died by his fire, and so will you.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> You're right, Ma.<eos> All right, I deserve to perish.<eos> I do.
Well, felt real to me.<eos> It only would've been worse if I didn't.<eos> Worse than this?<eos> I would rather be dead.<eos> Maybe I am dead.<eos> No.<eos> You're all we got, fa.<eos> You're the only one that knows what we should do, knows the price of our living'.<eos> You tell Shurn that I pain for her, and I'm sorry about her Tice.<eos> Did already.
Prophecy talk of one who returns.<eos> I thought all along that he was that one.<eos> But now I'm not sure if it's him should lead us.<eos> Why not?<eos> The strongest should.<eos> And you do agreeth with me on that?<eos> W-well, yes, ma'am, but...<eos> Who is that?<eos> You know who it is...<eos> And so do i.
My name's Haylie Grimes.<eos> How you feelin'?<eos> Fa!<eos> Foster, stop.<eos> - Fa!<eos> - Stay right there!<eos> You heard him, Foster.<eos> - We got orders to shoot.<eos> - Well, go on!<eos> Do it then.
You didn't know about it, did you?<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> I'm glad you're safe.<eos> Is this what you were looking for?<eos> This is witches' glove.<eos> I've never tasted anything like it.<eos> Now don't worry. Just a touch.<eos> You don't know everything that I do.<eos> No, I don't.
See, whatever happens up there, we know about it one way or the other.<eos> The fate of Shay Mountain rests with us, Wade.<eos> You and me.<eos> So before you go and kill our paradise, that mountain wanted you to know what it felt like to die, and now you do.<eos> You think on that.<eos> My guy doesn't know anything.<eos> How 'bout yours?<eos> Well, he didn't kill Breece.<eos> - Well, how do you know?<eos> - 'Cause I do.
- It's a lousy 400 bucks.<eos> Next time you treat the interns, tell them not to talk about it after.<eos> And who eats at a buffet at a strip club?<eos> Men, Kate! Men!<eos> We get hungry.<eos> That's why you're paying for it.<eos> We had a blast.<eos> You should have come.<eos> Wings and ass don't go together, Neil.<eos> Sure, they do.
I'm not sanctimonious.<eos> You're just a hypocritical prick then?<eos> You slept with him.<eos> And?<eos> "And?"<eos> I don't want to fight with you.<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> I just wish that it'd ended up better between you and me, you know?<eos> We would be scratching each other's eyes out by now.<eos> But I do, too.
So we could get him back home.<eos> When are we gonna see him?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> I know I'm making progress.<eos> I'm gonna be out late tonight.<eos> Why?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I miss him.<eos> We all do, Bear.
Mother, I wish you had just told me the plan.<eos> Hey, listen, I just got a customer, so I got to call you back.<eos> Okay, bye-bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Did you fix a furnace for a Norma Bates?<eos> Oh, um, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Did you fix a furnace for a Norma Bates?<eos> Oh, um, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Police came and talked to me yesterday, so I heard.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> She was my wife.<eos> I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you, uh, explain to her that the old furnace was lethal?<eos> Uh, actually, I did, yeah.
We'll check out MacArthur Park Station.<eos> Good job.<eos> Look, I don't want to draw this out, so I'm just gonna say it.<eos> You invited me into your home, and you trusted me.<eos> I obviously violated that trust.<eos> You did.<eos> I'm sure I can contribute more if I was just put in a position to.<eos> Did you know the Mandels?<eos> No.<eos> Not many people in the LA art community did.
No, of course, that would involve actually explaining something to me.<eos> I will tell you everything-- I promise you.<eos> I can't do it now.<eos> I need you to watch Gracie tonight.<eos> - I have plans.<eos> - Break them.<eos> I always have to watch her.<eos> I'm not her parent.<eos> You and Dad are.<eos> - You do it.
Walk with me.<eos> Tell me everything about her.<eos> So, Alec blew right by you and did what he wanted.<eos> I'd be angry, too.<eos> He took the only way I had to see my mother.<eos> Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like.<eos> He was interested in Valentine's style?<eos> Fascinating...<eos> No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him.<eos> And did you?
Alec, wait.<eos> If you hadn't gotten here in time, I...<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm glad you and Jace are okay now.<eos> I didn't do this for Jace.<eos> Then I'm glad you did it for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray.<eos> He helped save Luke's life.<eos> You all did.
It all starts and ends with you. How do you know that?<eos> Because I know Jocelyn.<eos> You're the only other person she would have trusted with the location of the Cup.<eos> If she trusted me so much, why didn't she tell me any of this?<eos> She didn't think this was gonna happen.<eos> She made provisions just in case it did. The potion, Dot...<eos> Jocelyn said that I should tell you everything about our past.<eos> - That it would unlock you. - What does that even mean?<eos> I don't know!<eos> But you do.
You talk about trading hands on a rooftop, Red.<eos> I'm talking about shit, okay?<eos> Shit that you ain't been in.<eos> -I know one thing.<eos> -What's that?<eos> War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
A fucking miracle.<eos> You're okay?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did Hector say?<eos> Oh, he just said I, uh, I made a miracle out of him.<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you everything would work out, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
And then just disappeared.<eos> Have you heard from him?<eos> Or have you seen him?<eos> Should I be calling the police? No.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> If we needed to, I would have called Luke.<eos> I just want to know if he's all right.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You did?
Cut like that and then nailed like that.<eos> Woman: Glad to see that you made it.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Hello, Mom.<eos> Somethin' happened a couple of days ago.<eos> I think, uh... I think I might have helped save a little boy.<eos> Reverend says that I saved you too.<eos> All I know is I put you here.<eos> I made you like this.<eos> After what you did to me...
What if things could be like they were?<eos> Do you know what I mean? I mean, Joshua, he-- he's-- he's whatever you want to call it-- cleansed, free.<eos> The demon left that boy.<eos> You saw it yourself.<eos> Yeah, it wasn't like that with my mother!<eos> If I drove it out of her too, then why is she lying in there like a fucking-- like that?<eos> You know, exorcisms, they're different as the souls they taint.<eos> Now, it's gone.<eos> And when it went away... that thing, it took part of Sarah with it.<eos> Yeah, but what if it didn't?
You don't have to listen to her, you know?<eos> Is this you not talking about it?<eos> No.<eos> This is me ignoring you saying you don't want to talk about it.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Things may have gone very wrong for Old West you and whoever she loved who wasn't Carter.<eos> But?<eos> But Old West you didn't know Ray Palmer.<eos> She didn't love Ray Palmer.<eos> You do.
- I don't really have the...<eos> I've spent years trying to convince myself that things happen for a reason, that you and I were not meant to be.<eos> But I know now.<eos> That wasn't fate.<eos> It was a choice.<eos> My choice.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm alone in the world, Matthew.<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> Of course you do.
You're the only person I can trust.<eos> Well, sweetheart, you don't break into my house and then talk to me about trust.<eos> Don't overthink it.<eos> It's just a bunch of guys in business suits.<eos> They won't know what hit them.<eos> Would be fun, like old times.<eos> Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you...<eos> - No, you don't.

Oh, perfectly.<eos> Good.<eos> I have a rule of my own.<eos> Shoot.<eos> No sex.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have a pair on you. Mmm?<eos> This may come as a surprise to you, but I've actually moved on in the ten years since you left.<eos> I'm seeing someone now, which is only part of the reason why I have zero interest in ever starting anything up with you ever again.<eos> Of course you do.
Castle's awake.<eos> Soon, he'll plead guilty, then it's open and shut.<eos> Open and shut is good.<eos> New York will sleep better knowing Frank Castle's behind bars.<eos> I know I will.<eos> Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.
- Okay.<eos> The fact that it fades...<eos> We took our blanket down to...<eos> our spot.<eos> She was by the carousel on the lawn...<eos> Then I heard her shout.<eos> Scream.<eos> It was a grown man.<eos> Who did you see?<eos> I didn't.
I found something pretty big here.<eos> - Whose house did you break into this time?<eos> - No need. It's just press passes and NYPD files and, um...<eos> So these pictures are all from the day Frank's family was killed.<eos> I've seen enough bloody bodies to last me a lifetime.<eos> - Can we please just--<eos> - Just a sec.<eos> Okay, um... look.<eos> - All right, you see him?<eos> - Sure do.
It's what you do.<eos> The scheming, the machinations.<eos> Frank Castle is a killing machine, and you set him free.<eos> Which means you're aiming a loose cannon at someone, and we both know it.<eos> And you can prove that in a court of law?<eos> Where is Frank Castle?<eos> Not here.<eos> Did you have anything to do with his release?<eos> You don't have to answer that.<eos> No, I didn't.
I understand you're frantic, you're looking for answers.<eos> I have none.<eos> Sometimes I'm glad I'm... in here.<eos> The fate of New York City is out of my hands for once.<eos> That's bullshit!<eos> I don't know what you expect from me... but we're finished here.<eos> Mr. Donovan.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> You asked me if I remember the art gallery.<eos> I do.
Then we change tactics.<eos> I give you one last opportunity to keep this conversation civilized.<eos> Listen very carefully.<eos> You've been tracking their weapons.<eos> So they dropped 'em.<eos> Tracking heartbeats is kids' stuff.<eos> Time to go deeper.<eos> Track their breath.<eos> Sooner or later, they gotta... exhale.<eos> When they do...
You did good.<eos> No, I just...<eos> I just did what you taught me, Stick.<eos> Matty, I'm... proud of you.<eos> Come on, old man.<eos> Let's get you out of here.<eos> Hello, boys.<eos> Do you remember when we met... you told me you'd never abandon me?<eos> It's funny. For the life of me... I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.<eos> But I did.
Then don't let me get in your way.<eos> I am the enemy of the Hand.<eos> So kill me.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Now you could either try and kill us, and prove them right.<eos> Or you could save Stick... and prove them wrong.<eos> You never know when to give up, do you?<eos> No.<eos> And neither does he.
Unprecedented volumes of uncut narcotics into Manhattan.<eos> -How's he doing it?<eos> -Well, that'd be the mystery.<eos> Okay, look, there's, uh... an unfinished highway on Long Island that was illegally used as a landing strip in the '90s.<eos> I mean, it would require payoffs, bribes--<eos> This guy's a ghost.<eos> He works alone or close to it.<eos> I just--<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -I just do.
You're not serious.<eos> I've never been more serious.<eos> This...<eos> Elektra, this is a part of me that I need.<eos> And you're the only one who gets it.<eos> Without this, I'm not alive.<eos> I'm not. Not really.<eos> And I know that now, thanks to you.<eos> I don't know what we are together, and if we have any chance in the future...<eos> I don't...
The enemy had set up an ambush at the only LZ that would accommodate one of our birds.<eos> Sorry, Colonel?<eos> LZ is a landing zone that can accommodate a helicopter.<eos> So the enemy, they block this landing zone, knowing it was the only shot the team had to get out alive.<eos> All they had to do was wait.<eos> They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
Frank...<eos> May I call you Frank?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Frank, we've heard a lot about neuro-chemistry... and psychology, and all things unfolding, scientifically and otherwise, inside your brain.<eos> But I just have one question I want to ask.<eos> What happened that day?<eos> The day your family was so tragically killed.<eos> It's okay, Frank.<eos> - I understand, it's difficult.<eos> - Do you?
Especially if... and by if, I mean when... this thing goes south.<eos> Savage's lady friend just made us.<eos> Have faith, Mr. Snart.<eos> Gideon, push in on the woman.<eos> That bracelet she's wearing... can you get a clearer image?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If we don't move real soon, we could get ourselves killed.<eos> How about we play this like Chicago?<eos> Could work.<eos> What the hell did you do that for?
Just turned 22.<eos> She went missing catering a Players' Club event.<eos> Players' Club?<eos> It's one of those skeezy pickup artist groups.<eos> You know, that teach geeks how to be sex gods.<eos> Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
I need you to leave right now, sir.<eos> Carver!<eos> Carver, can you hear me? !<eos> It's the missing girl's brother.<eos> What'd you do to my sister? !<eos> Get out here, you coward!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got this.<eos> - I know him.<eos> - No, you don't.
He always does.<eos> You want to talk to him, don't you?<eos> Well, go on, then.<eos> What's stopping you?<eos> The rules? Huh?<eos> Detective Douche?<eos> If you desire something, just take it.<eos> Lucifer, what are you doing?<eos> Hello.<eos> You finally did it, Nick.
Well, I was thinking, what if he never left the scene of the crime?<eos> What, and instead blended in with the other paparazzi taking photos?<eos> That's quite clever.<eos> Yeah, so if we recognize anyone from the crash, it could be our guy.<eos> Right.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he?<eos> He did.
Go ahead.<eos> See what happens.<eos> And there's that angelic ego I was talking about.<eos> I'm sorry, uh... You were saying?<eos> Gentlemen, please...<eos> Don't mind my brother.<eos> He's just a bit... simple.<eos> We meant no disrespect, truly.<eos> I thought you told me you wanted your wings back.<eos> I do.
Her name was... Ali, maybe?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I'm having a hard time remembering.<eos> You think she accidentally slipped, fell in the pool and drowned?<eos> No, I think she was murdered.<eos> Oh, my God, that's... that's terrible.<eos> So why didn't you call the police right away?<eos> Well, I told Lucifer.<eos> He said... he said that he would call the police.<eos> And I did.
So do you think she did it?<eos> Sandy claims she was sitting outside Tiffany's house, waiting for Dr. Shaw to show up.<eos> Problem is, no one can corroborate her alibi.<eos> But, no, I don't think it was her.<eos> So there's no one in Dr. Shaw's files that looked like a potential suspect?<eos> Not that I can tell, but maybe I missed something.<eos> What?<eos> The cheater therapist turned out to be terrible at cheating.<eos> Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina he was using him as a cover story?<eos> Maybe he did.
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> I realized a few things.<eos> As I said, we made a breakthrough.<eos> And I think, with that in mind, we should keep our relationship professional from now on.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very well.<eos> If, uh... if you think it's best.<eos> I do.
I saw you talking to Decker.<eos> You want to tell her, don't you?<eos> What, that I'm the one who shot you?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Your conscience.<eos> I know you, Danny Boy.<eos> You forget, this ain't the first time we've been partners.<eos> I looked the other way a few times.<eos> - That didn't make us partners.<eos> - Sure, it did.
Oh, come on.<eos> How gullible do you think we are?<eos> I had troubles with the man, but he didn't deserve to die.<eos> And I certainly didn't kill him.<eos> Can you account for your whereabouts between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning?<eos> Uh, I was here.<eos> Taking confessions.<eos> Mrs. Madison had a lot to say, took up the whole hour.<eos> By chance, does Mrs. Madison have a limo driver?<eos> She does.
! He was down here on his phone.<eos> Heard him talking to someone named Connor.<eos> - He left to go meet him.<eos> - He left?<eos> Where to?<eos> Maybe he's trying to convince Connor to turn himself in.<eos> No. He's probably trying to hide the little miscreant.<eos> Put his faith in God, not the police.<eos> Why do you care about a priest?<eos> I don't.
Follow me.<eos> We heard that you control the docks, and if anything goes down, Los Diablos are in on it.<eos> Really?<eos> We're just a riding club, okay?<eos> Whose members have been arrested for guns, drugs, murder.<eos> A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?<eos> But it does paint you as suspects.<eos> Hey, look, just because we have a reputation as outlaws doesn't mean we had anything to do with a murder.<eos> You like being considered a criminal, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Oh, of course you think she is. Oh...<eos> Do I detect some angst?<eos> She's like a child.<eos> Oh, and I bet it drove you crazy. Yeah.<eos> All she wanted was to doll me up and take me to auditions.<eos> Would make anyone mad with rage.<eos> She made everything about her.<eos> So you could just murder her!<eos> Sure.<eos> But I didn't.
Apparently, I'm not the only one.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> He didn't attack the guy.<eos> He was defending himself.<eos> Still hot.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The preacher.<eos> Preacher's wearing a cuff link.<eos> So what?<eos> A lot of guys do.
And I already dropped some evidence, so it's...<eos> Whoa!<eos> But I did this for you.<eos> Aren't you happy?<eos> Why would I be happy?<eos> I'm not evil.<eos> I punish evil.<eos> - Yeah, but, but you're, you know... - The Devil, yes.<eos> And you think you know who that is, don't you?<eos> The whole world does.
Don't take another step.<eos> You!<eos> Newbie.<eos> Come on.<eos> Riddle me with bullets, so you can go home, drink an ice-cold beer, and feel better about yourselves!<eos> Don't shoot him. He's unarmed.<eos> Oh, you don't know that.<eos> Maybe I have a gun.<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Do it!
Who would want to set him up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Detective, we may have found the murder weapon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Test it for prints and DNA.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
You took that from Lucifer?<eos> I kept it a secret.<eos> I thought I could use it to get us back home.<eos> And you'd give that to me?<eos> Believe me, I don't understand this either.<eos> Why do I feel like I'm walking death row?<eos> Should I order my final meal now to save time?<eos> Dan says he has it handled.<eos> You do, right?<eos> I do.
What do you desire, Malcolm?<eos> Lucifer, what are you doing?<eos> What do you yearn for in that... rotten soul of yours?<eos> I...<eos> You've been given a second chance, Malcolm.<eos> Is killing Detective Decker really what you want to do with it?<eos> I don't.<eos> No, of course you don't.<eos> You want to live, don't you?<eos> I do.
Afraid.<eos> I know.<eos> I once went to sleep for a long time, too.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> But when I woke up, I wasn't alone.<eos> You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Ms. Grant, everything okay?<eos> No, I need you in the office...<eos> Now.<eos> (ALARM BUZZING)<eos> Hank.<eos> J'onn.<eos> I should have known... (SIGHS) This isn't your fault.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.<eos> But it did.
I survived.<eos> To my great shame.<eos> I will hear my family's screams until the day I die.<eos> (INHALES SHARPLY)<eos> Look at me.<eos> (SIGHS HEAVILY)<eos> - J'onn, look at me. - (SHUDDERING)<eos> There's no shame in surviving.<eos> If your family would have lived, you wouldn't want them to be ashamed.<eos> But they didn't.
If I'm all that's left, let it have me.<eos> No, this murderer does not get to win.<eos> And you don't get to give up.<eos> It will save Alex.<eos> We don't choose.<eos> We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
I got a chop shop by Yankee Stadium. Use it to crush stolen cars.<eos> You're lucky you're not in the trunk of one of them.<eos> An entire file drawer of phony registrations, fake plates, VIN numbers... the whole magilla.<eos> Galasso's number two.<eos> Fucking feds are gonna shit.<eos> - Where the hell were you?<eos> - Fuck's it to you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> - We all did.
I was... I was thinking.<eos> And this?<eos> He pissed me off, I punched the wall.<eos> - I do everything by the book.<eos> - I know you do --<eos> Straight down the line, Sidney.<eos> Straight as an arrow.<eos> How does a man die alone in a locked cell?<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
Your boy got shot, innit?<eos> Eddie said the bloke should have finished the job.<eos> You wrestling with it, aren't you?<eos> With what?<eos> No way he died unless your pal did it.<eos> No way on God's green earth.<eos> I will not be in a room with that boy until he apologises properly.<eos> It doesn't seem fair, really.<eos> She's always saying things that upset me.<eos> Of course she does.
BOTH:<eos> Really?<eos> Stay away from the widow, Sidney.<eos> What are we to do with you?<eos> Of all the places, Amanda.<eos> (SIGHS) Why Cambridge?<eos> Does my husband have to know?<eos> As long as we agree it won't become a regular occurrence, not in my city at least,<eos> I think we can draw a line under it.<eos> Does Sidney?
Plus, you did all the work on Emile.<eos> Emile Fisher?<eos> He's in prison.<eos> Not as of two weeks ago.<eos> He just finished doing every single day of his time, so no probation officers to keep tabs on him.<eos> Emile gets out two weeks ago, and the gun comes back.<eos> - Where is he? Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.<eos> Hey. Maybe we drag up all this old crap, and we don't find the shooter.<eos> Or maybe we do.
Overdosed, bullshit. He didn't overdose.<eos> - Dr. Morales said that...<eos> - Reverend Trigger had Emile killed.<eos> - Daniel Price was in the church...<eos> - No. I'm telling you, he ordered it. While Emile was shooting himself up and so was his brother.<eos> And they both have airtight... what more do you need?<eos> Do you think Price is just suddenly gonna break down and name the third man?<eos> You don't even know if there was a third guy in that car.<eos> Yes, I do know.<eos> I do!
And are you aware that at the time of her death,<eos> Rachel and Mark had been having... sleeping together.<eos> I believe that's the, uh, socially accepted euphemism.<eos> Only it was more than that.<eos> She wasn't just some one off in the back of a Crown Vic.<eos> Mark was in love with her.<eos> Thought about Rachel night and day.<eos> Obsessed.<eos> He told you that?<eos> No, she did before the Price trial.
Your patients.<eos> You can't use your thumbs to spin the wheel, dumbasses.<eos> - They always use their thumbs. - Oh.<eos> Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than.<eos> What if they're more than us?<eos> What?<eos> Do you believe them?<eos> Your patients.<eos> Just between you and me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Hmm.
No, it's okay.<eos> I'm just getting ready.<eos> So, you excited?<eos> Ugh. - Oh, come on.<eos> You're gonna do great.<eos> - Hm-mmm.<eos> But I know the feeling.<eos> I hate speaking in public.<eos> Just don't forget to breathe, 'cause I actually... I threw up last night before the concert.<eos> You did?
Wow, you're taking everything, huh?<eos> Well, I'm gonna be back in a month, to see my dad.<eos> And my mom said you can visit whenever you want.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, school's not gonna be the same without you.<eos> Nothing is.<eos> Jude.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Really, I do.
He did?<eos> Why?<eos> It seems that he has been invited for the final callbacks for Juilliard, but he doesn't think he should even try because he doesn't think you could possibly afford it.<eos> Now I just didn't have the heart to tell him that I didn't think even I could turn $7500 into $150,000 in a year.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes, this is she.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. who's office?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I never sent my mammogram over to a Dr. Kopak.<eos> Actually, you did.
Actually, you did.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to call you back, be...<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, thank you very much.<eos> Yes.<eos> You had the radiologist send my film over to another doctor, Mom, for a second second opinion?<eos> Really?<eos> Maybe I did.
Stay down.<eos> Do it again.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!<eos> Listen, son...<eos> If you don't press charges...<eos> I can't stop this from happening.<eos> Understand?<eos> You don't even know.<eos> - Oh I don't? - Nu-uh.
Chiron.<eos> What's up, man.<eos> This... this Kevin.<eos> You there?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Long time, no see, right?<eos> Man, I had to ask Teresa for your number, and...<eos> Hold on, man.<eos> You do-you do remember me, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What did you do to my powers?<eos> I need my powers.<eos> The Beast is here, okay?<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for you.<eos> He is coming to kill us.<eos> You have got to give me back my power!<eos> I've got to save you!<eos> - Do you remember that night?<eos> - Your father does.
So, until then... we were wondering if we could pull the RV into your driveway?<eos> Oh, yeah, we need to borrow some electricity.<eos> Not quite off the grid yet, Will?<eos> - I'm looking into solar panels. - Mmm.<eos> Oh, hey, I got something for you.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Cannabis oil.<eos> High in antioxidants, being used to suppress cancers, among many other things.<eos> I take a drop under my tongue every morning.<eos> - Do you?
Okay?<eos> Okay, sir?<eos> It's vice principal Stricker.<eos> Go, now.<eos> Shon.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you know how to sync this to your phone?<eos> Um... probably not.<eos> Doesn't your dad work at Best Buy?<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.
Go, now.<eos> Shon.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you know how to sync this to your phone?<eos> Um... probably not.<eos> Doesn't your dad work at Best Buy?<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.<eos> Just in marketing.<eos> So you don't get any free stuff?<eos> I do, but mostly office supplies.
Presents.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Oh, it's an apron.<eos> What's this?<eos> "Hello, is it me you're cooking for?"<eos> - Isn't that funny?<eos> - This is so funny.<eos> Where'd you find that?<eos> Well, I had someone make it for you.<eos> You did?
Wow.<eos> So, what do you say, my lady?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You said yes.<eos> I did.
Yes, hello. I was thinking of having a large number one tattooed onto my back.<eos> Is it necessary to make an appointment?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Well, what sorts of openings do you...<eos> Um...<eos> I need to call you back.<eos> Principal Dwight?<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I did it.<eos> You did what?
He's pretty dumb.<eos> I've seen his records from his previous schools.<eos> This kid tests like...<eos> What is this obsession that we have with testing and categorizing our kids?<eos> I literally have no idea what you are talking about.<eos> If we keep cramming standard tests down our kids' throat, we're gonna end up with a bunch of standard children.<eos> I don't know what stinks more, your attitude or my suit.<eos> And that's really saying something, because my suit is covered in poop.<eos> Nobody cares what you think anyway.<eos> I do.

There is a man.<eos> Kenji.<eos> He came in here bragging about the kidnapping, throwing money around.<eos> He says he threw him out of here.<eos> Where is this Kenji?<eos> Luilichang.<eos> Luilichang.<eos> It's a flea market.<eos> - You know where it is?<eos> - I do.
Let's see that.<eos> "France libre?"<eos> I hear these are everywhere now, huh?<eos> Clever.<eos> You can't be arrested for using currency.<eos> Can I keep it?<eos> A souvenir?<eos> Don't worry; I'll buy you a drink.<eos> We don't want a Luftwaffe getting a bad name, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
Now, we know that a consistent physical response in women who have orgasmed is erect nipples.<eos> So, for you men in the audience, the answer is simple.<eos> If your girl's nipples are hard, she came.<eos> If they're not, she's faking.<eos> I'll take questions at the end, miss.<eos> Missus.<eos> And I'd like to clarify this point now, Dr. Fahy, if I may.<eos> You said "physical response," but the correct term is "physiological response," is it not?<eos> Sure, if you want to be technical.<eos> I do.
I am a man of science.<eos> I knew you had to be something.<eos> Listen, let's just say you-- you jump out of a plane.<eos> Parachute is on your back. There's no guarantee that it's going to open.<eos> That right there is faith.<eos> That's not faith.<eos> That's science.<eos> That's what parachutes do.<eos> They open.<eos> Not all the time, they don't.
Because... for 12 years, I've tried every way-- every wrong and misguided way to win your heart only to realize, in these last very dark weeks, you wanted something else.<eos> So you picked someone else.<eos> Which means that part of us together is over... for good.<eos> I'm glad that that is clear between us.<eos> Well, there's not a lot we know about St. Joseph.<eos> He was Jesus' earthly father.<eos> He, uh, dreamed a lot, and, well, in those dreams, he was visited by angels.<eos> And, uh, one day, an angel appeared to him and told him that he must take the Virgin Mary as his wife.<eos> Does everyone understand what--<eos> They do not.
I suppose I should thank you for the tablet, the books.<eos> Right now, it's the only thing keeping me from going crazy in here.<eos> Well, if you're looking for something to occupy your mind...<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a coded file.<eos> I was hoping you'd crack it for me.<eos> You want my help? Seriously?<eos> Look, I know you think I betrayed you...<eos> You did betray us!<eos> Okay, maybe I did.
If anything, it's woken me up.<eos> Made me realize the dangers of being too trusting.<eos> I brought you something.<eos> When you came out of stasis, you had no memory, but you knew the right thing to do because you are who you are.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> Boom!<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> You manage to crack the file?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
We're done.<eos> Deal.<eos> You'll get your men, and then i will get my mountain.<eos> Caleb.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get your bag.<eos> - Could I speak with him, please?<eos> - It's Haylie Grimes calling.<eos> I got an inklin' that you know where them traitors is hiding' at, don't you?<eos> I don't.
Yeah, of course I'm gonna be careful.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> I love you, Ledda.<eos> I love you, too, Wade.<eos> Now you're the one lying to me.<eos> - Well, he's gone now. - That's all that matters, right?<eos> Gone how?<eos> Your fa thinks you've killed him.<eos> So did I.
When we get there, we are gonna find our suspect.<eos> We're gonna apprehend him, we're gonna bring him back down.<eos> Hey, anybody need to say a prayer, take a shit, make a phone call?<eos> Ain't got no service.<eos> - Well, that answers it.<eos> - Let's move out.<eos> Thought I might find you here.<eos> You taught me how to fish in this creek when we were kids.<eos> - You remember that?<eos> - Mm, 'course I do.
I was trying to help you.<eos> No.<eos> You were killin' me.<eos> Killin' me.<eos> And I couldn't see it.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I do.<eos> I love you.<eos> Always did.
The daily grind.<eos> -You don't think I'm in "the grind"?<eos> -No, I do.<eos> It's just that... no.<eos> No, I just want to get out of here for a minute.<eos> Get some sunshine.<eos> -Dude.<eos> -Come on.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay.<eos> -You've got to do it for real.<eos> That was--<eos> -Chip.<eos> Ready?<eos> -No, I don't know any...<eos> -I know this.<eos> -Yes!<eos> Me, too.<eos> -You do?
There will be another opportunity to defeat him.<eos> But not here.<eos> Not now.<eos> You must escape.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> The Master cannot love.<eos> So he takes it from others, feeds upon it, along with their blood.<eos> I don't know if you can feel love, Quintus.<eos> But I can.<eos> And I do.
- I wasn't sure.<eos> You didn't send flowers to the funeral.<eos> I thought about it.<eos> But then I thought, how would that look?<eos> Suddenly, now that the woman's dead, I make some sentimental gesture to show what a great and caring guy I am?<eos> You wouldn't have wanted me to do that.<eos> So what can I do for you?<eos> - I want to come work for you.<eos> - Work for me?<eos> - Doing what?
- rudderless. - Yeah.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You realize the Master saw all this through the eyes of those munchers, right?<eos> He's probably already got a workaround, you know?<eos> No, no, no, he didn't see shit.<eos> The signal paralyzed their communication systems when it paralyzed them.<eos> They just went off his grid.<eos> You want to seal him in this, the device can help you do that.<eos> It worked on strigoi, but do you think it could also incapacitate the Master?<eos> I do.
That's as far as the stinger can reach.<eos> Just remember, if it touches you, you will die.<eos> I know.<eos> Alright, listen up.<eos> We're gonna go in here.<eos> Elizalde, you and the big guy, you go first.<eos> Why don't you go first?<eos> You got the guns.<eos> That's right.<eos> We do.
Just go!<eos> Come on! Come on! Come on!<eos> Don't try me!<eos> Go!<eos> Angel!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> - Let go of her, piece of shit!<eos> - You don't got a clear shot,<eos> - bitch! - I do.
You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Why do we have to meet here?<eos> Well, Angie, I was in the neighborhood, and... you always liked the fries.<eos> What did you do last night, Jamie?<eos> I thought we weren't supposed to ask each other those kind of questions.<eos> What did you do last night?<eos> I went to work-- the club.<eos> Did you have a nice night with Agent Knox?<eos> I didn't see him last night.<eos> Well, I did.
There is no evidence of the killer making their escape, but, then again, they could've left by another route.<eos> Good morning, everybody!<eos> Ah, JP!<eos> - How you doing, Chief?<eos> - Yes, I'm quite well, thank you.<eos> - Good.<eos> OK, so I've been back to the hotel, talking to staff, and a few people who spoke to Mr Green yesterday said that he was a really nice guy, friendly, typical holiday-maker, but I do have one lead.<eos> - You have?<eos> - Yes, I spoke to a receptionist and she says she organised a taxi for Mr Green at about 4pm.<eos> She did?
A bon oeuf, Florence.<eos> So, how come within hours of arriving on holiday, visiting an island he'd never been to before and travelling on his own, no less, someone got into this honest and well-liked man's room and brutally threw him to his death?<eos> Well, we had a lovely day, didn't we, Selwyn?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And it's so nice to hear the old stories about you, Inspector.<eos> What stories would these be?<eos> Well, I had no idea you had a family nickname.<eos> I... I don't.<eos> Oh, come on, Humphrey, you remember.<eos> I don't!
There's a... a chemist, and... and a laundry, I think, and...<eos> And then there's just a...<eos> Good grief!<eos> There's also a bank!<eos> Do you want to ring Florence, or shall I?<eos> I can confirm that a Marcus Knight took out a safety deposit box with us in February of 2010.<eos> Six years ago?<eos> Yes, and three days ago, he presented himself and his key to the branch, emptied his box, closed down the account, and handed back his key.<eos> Do you know what he'd been keeping here in those six years?<eos> I don't.
Don't worry, all will become clear.<eos> Please.<eos> You see, all along, you had to be our killer, Neil.<eos> Only you knew about Marcus's bag of money.<eos> And yet...<eos> Marcus was your one-time company secretary.<eos> looked after the key to his safe deposit box for the last six years.<eos> This is not the behaviour of someone who has hate in his heart.<eos> - You didn't kill him.<eos> - Too damn right I didn't.
Now you see, the victim of the assault pointed the finger at Robert, not Gary.<eos> Robert was charged but then Gary confessed.<eos> And the CPS concluded that because the victim was drunk at the time of the assault they had to go with it and prosecuted Gary.<eos> He was only 20 at the time.<eos> So Gary took a hit for his brother?<eos> Yes, it would certainly look that way...<eos> Whoa!<eos> You did say I don't have to avoid them.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Very well.<eos> Let me talk to his mistress.<eos> For God's sake!<eos> How should I trust the evidence of this woman?<eos> Because this woman is my sister.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> And?<eos> Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?<eos> Yes, he does.
Both he and you, for Christian charity, and for love.<eos> Sweet Judith.<eos> Judith, I need your help.<eos> - I am betrayed.<eos> - Betrayed?<eos> - By whom?<eos> - By the King.<eos> He has made himself King of Mercia, at my expense.<eos> And now I am nothing.<eos> Ecbert did this to you?
It looks like you knowingly led a team of agents in here with a fraudulent warrant.<eos> You need to let me explain.<eos> No, you need to meet me downstairs, both of you.<eos> These agents will make sure you don't get into anymore trouble.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mr. Graff, I want to assure you none of this was approved by the Bureau.<eos> Just talk to my lawyers. Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.

Yes.<eos> You ever think about coaching sports?<eos> That was a humdinger of an underdog speech.<eos> There's only one way back into Duval's life.<eos> He asked me for help once.<eos> Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.<eos> And when he asked for your help, what did you do?<eos> Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here.<eos> Does my dad know you're here?<eos> No, he doesn't.
The name's Kevin Whitfield.<eos> It's a junkie.<eos> Overdose.<eos> Yeah, but this kid has no history of drug use.<eos> He was going to college in the fall.<eos> Dad, just go through it with me.<eos> See if I missed something.<eos> These parents came to me.<eos> They said their son was better than this, and I believed them, Dad.<eos> - I did.
None had a history of street drug use.<eos> This is a homicide investigation now.<eos> US or local PD?<eos> Five victims over three states.<eos> I think we take this one, don't you?<eos> Yes ma'am, I think we do.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's parents came to us.<eos> Said his death wasn't an O.D.<eos> If I'd have stopped it then...<eos> No, the Bureau didn't.
"First you dig deeper, then you get a warrant."<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> The killer's sitting poolside in Acapulco drinking dollar beers and knockoff pain killers.<eos> Liz Kenyon... a piano prodigy from the time she was 6 years old.<eos> What she was 12, this man...<eos> Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does.<eos> He pushed her until she broke.<eos> And you think she's still under his influence?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I do.
I need you to unlock the code so it can be used for someone else.<eos> The tank... what does it do?<eos> It interfaces with the user's genetic structure.<eos> Yeah, but what does it do?<eos> It gives $1 million cash to the first person who opens the code.<eos> I overheard you and Mary back at Peng's.<eos> I know about the tank.<eos> Mary's got a plan to fix it.<eos> Didn't sound like that was gonna happen.<eos> No, it didn't.
- You were there, behind the light.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You were the man behind the light.<eos> My friend Mr. Widowmaker around?<eos> No, not since you beat the crap out of him.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, uh... I'll take a cutter.<eos> Cutter?<eos> Don't know what that is.<eos> Sure you do.
Even had a thing for a while.<eos> You and Mary Goodwin?<eos> Yes, and I don't appreciate your tone.<eos> When I heard about Dad, I didn't believe for a second that he'd killed himself.<eos> And frankly, Duval, I'm disappointed that you did.<eos> Why?<eos> I expected that call every day for 15 years.<eos> Because the Jimmy Pritchard I knew was no quitter.<eos> So I asked Mary if I could use her company to help find out what really happened.<eos> And you did.
So that nothing happens to him, he will be confined to this house until that happens.<eos> In other news, convicted killers<eos> Leo Stax and Edward Hume remain at large after escaping from Pine Creek Prison following a riot that broke out during the city-wide blackout three days ago.<eos> Authorities have now confirmed that the riot began when backup generators failed to activate.<eos> A third prisoner captured in the shootout remains in custody at King Memorial Hospital.<eos> Mr. Pritchard, Mary is waiting for her transfusion on the second floor.<eos> You know, if this works, then we try it on others.<eos> You know how many lives you could possibly save?<eos> Must make my blood pretty valuable.<eos> It does.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Negotiating.<eos> Alfred, show her what I was just watching.<eos> It is Arthur. Showing now.<eos> A few days ago, there was a city-wide power surge that shut down security at that prison.<eos> There was a riot.<eos> Three cons escaped.<eos> Cops caught one, but there are two murderers out there in Seattle.<eos> I did the math, and I know what was happening right before those lights went out.<eos> Well, so do I.
I don't... I don't know who they are.<eos> This place has a soundproofed room downstairs.<eos> Do you want to see it?<eos> O-okay, look.<eos> A few months ago, that parolee Jasper came to his check-in and said that I'm gonna sign his card even when he doesn't show up.<eos> I-I said, "Why would I do that?"<eos> He said 'cause they've already deposited money in my account.<eos> He says it looks like I'm being paid for something, so I might as well go ahead and go along with it.<eos> - And if you said no?<eos> - I did.
I'd like her to sell me the car.<eos> Ms. Solodar doesn't do sales.<eos> She owns the dealership.<eos> Well, no offense, Lenny, but now I've shaken hands with a little girl.<eos> I'd like to make a deal with a real woman.<eos> Alexa, there should be 14 new products at the new production presentation, but I only see 13 new products on this list.<eos> Why was this one removed?<eos> Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.
There's four bodies.<eos> Ripped to shreds.<eos> Neighbors heard what was going on, called 911.<eos> By the time the neighbors got in, whoever did all this... gone.<eos> Out the window.<eos> You were 50 years on the job.<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> You ever see anything like this?<eos> No, Son.<eos> Pretty sure I never did.
The empty lot.<eos> The only thing these places have in common is that Albert Lin called them home.<eos> And this is how you would draw home.<eos> Why'd you cut me out?<eos> Cut you out of what?<eos> You're working this case and you won't ask for help.<eos> It's like you're punishing me for being cured.<eos> I thought we were good out there together, and you did, too.<eos> The two of us.<eos> I did.
In the summer, we went every day when we could scrape enough money together.<eos> We called it our home away from home.<eos> Home away from home.<eos> Not that I don't think you're good at your job, but...<eos> I was hoping they'd send other agents.<eos> They're mounting up.<eos> I knew you wouldn't wait for backup.<eos> You want to wait?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
So he said, "Sabine, fear makes you strong if you face it."<eos> Oh. That's good advice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Such a chatterbox today.<eos> It's just... it's been so long since I had someone to talk to.<eos> Don't you dare be sorry, Sabine.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> You know, the truth is, I work with men all day and right now, I cannot believe how nice it is to be talking to a woman.<eos> - I thought I told you to go away.<eos> - You did.
And I need the DJ booth moved to the center of the dance floor.<eos> The DJ booth is up there to the left.<eos> That's very nice for you, but I need to be at the center of the event so I can control the crowd.<eos> All right, I'll try to get it done.<eos> There's no trying involved, is there?<eos> Get the DJ booth moved to the center of the dance floor or I can't perform here.<eos> The legendary DJ Taj. It's great to meet you, man.<eos> We're so excited for you to join us.<eos> He doesn't shake hands.<eos> - I really don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Bet.<eos> I won't make any moves without talking to you first, but you got to let me help.<eos> If we're gonna be partners, then let's be partners.<eos> What you want to do, partner?<eos> I don't know. I thought maybe you could teach me how to move the money around.<eos> Then I could do it.<eos> How did you set this all up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tasha did all that for me.
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.<eos> I don't feel like myself.<eos> I'm good though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - It's gonna work, Harry. - Yep, yep.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it!
Ms. Burke.<eos> Looks like it's just us now.<eos> I don't even know how to say this.<eos> My husband Randall... he's not my husband anymore.<eos> He's not?<eos> His manners, his speech, his drinking...<eos> - He needs a drug and alcohol program?<eos> - No.<eos> He used to drink a lot.<eos> And now he doesn't.
That was, you know, just to kind of do the wine list.<eos> - I was there to sort that out.<eos> - Sure you were.<eos> She went to a costume party, dressed as Frida Kahlo, and she got her leg, like, caught in the spokes of a bike and she hurt her leg.<eos> "I tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol, but the bastards learned how to swim."<eos> And the weird thing is, what's ironic is the real Frida Kahlo, she hurt her leg and it impacted her entire life.<eos> Huh. That is ironic.<eos> I don't think I knew that.<eos> You know, maybe I did.<eos> Yes, I did.
What we know for sure is that they both were from Boone.<eos> Liam's around the right age.<eos> He could be the son that she gave up for adoption.<eos> Kate let a wolf in the henhouse.<eos> Biology alone does not excuse such an enormous lapse in judgment.<eos> What lengths haven't you gone to for me?<eos> I know you.<eos> I have a basis to make that call.<eos> - Kate was my wife, and I knew her.<eos> - Maybe you didn't.
I'm giving you a freebie.<eos> Take the win.<eos> Never knew you could be so ruthless.<eos> I'm just keeping them honest.<eos> So, what did you need to see me about?<eos> A woman I dated, Tina Sawyer, showed up at my loft last night.<eos> - And I might have seen her at work.<eos> - Is this the woman Cornell interviewed?<eos> - Dad tell you?<eos> - After the cops did.
- Dad tell you?<eos> - After the cops did.<eos> I work with these people, Eric.<eos> They tell me things.<eos> So, who is she?<eos> We saw each other for a couple of months.<eos> Then things got weird.<eos> And you didn't see the red flags?<eos> She always had an explanation.<eos> Yeah, the Cray-crays always do.
Enjoy it.<eos> I'll enjoy it when my speech is over.<eos> - Can I tell you something?<eos> - I know.<eos> I've closed multimillion-dollar deals before.<eos> I shouldn't be nervous about a little speech.<eos> Yes, there is that.<eos> There's also something else.<eos> You love me?<eos> I do.
Open up.<eos> I know you're home.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Sorry. I...<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> Where's Liam?<eos> Who?<eos> Liam Connors... Brown hair, about this tall.<eos> Sorry. I don't know any Liam.<eos> Sure, you do.
Where do you live?<eos> Just south of here.<eos> Gorgeous doorman building, very hip, full of beautiful people.<eos> Hey, you know what might help the vibe in this place?<eos> One of those chairs shaped like a giant hand.<eos> You know?<eos> And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.<eos> Ooh. Do we have a match on your dating app?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
It's important to you, so... it's important to me.<eos> Thank you, Jamie.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to call Tasha.<eos> Set up a meet.<eos> I need her to sign some paperwork.<eos> Hey, how did things go with Tariq the other night?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> Ghost did.
Yeah, I just... I just wish they could be real with me. They're always fake.<eos> Like, Dad, he moved with Angela, and I still don't know what happened to Uncle Shawn.<eos> It's like he could do whatever he wants and get away with it.<eos> Yeah, no doubt.<eos> Listen, you got every right to be upset.<eos> Families are supposed to stay together, not break up.<eos> But if I do know one thing about your old man, Tariq, he loves the crap out of you.<eos> And no matter what happens, your Uncle Tommy always got your back.<eos> Forever.<eos> The fuck you gonna do with a baby?
I see a bad bitch who is about to be balling on her own, and whenever you're ready, any man would be lucky to have you and spoil you rotten.<eos> Some nigga to get you shoes you like. Some nigga to get you bags you like.<eos> All of that stuff.<eos> Yo, what the fuck is this?<eos> You carrying a piece in my shop?<eos> 'Keisha, it's our shop.<eos> And it ain't exactly on the Upper East Side.<eos> I was protecting us.<eos> You know how to use that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Kara.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Still nothing.<eos> Kara, it's coming through here.<eos> - Can you see me?<eos> - Mom, here.<eos> Danny, if you can hear me, I'm here with our son.<eos> Tell him... Tell him Frankie almost rolled over yesterday.<eos> Okay, he didn't almost roll over yesterday.<eos> Yes, he did.
No.<eos> Uh, you know what, Dylan? I'm...<eos> I'm just upset.<eos> I, uh... all is good, actually. Never mind.<eos> Never mind, Dylan.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> You need me to break you out of here?<eos> I can totally do it, I mean, I've studied how to do it.<eos> No, I-I don't.
Oh, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Okay, big shot.<eos> Norma Bates?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton. Um...<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
Do you remember when I first met you on the porch at the motel that night?<eos> Yeah, my heart stopped, mostly because I thought you were gonna arrest me.<eos> No, I missed that opportunity.<eos> Well, I guess...<eos> I guess it all turned out okay in the end, huh?<eos> All things considered?<eos> You think so?<eos> You think it's all gonna be okay?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Do you remember the first time you asked me that?<eos> You were 8.<eos> You told me she was stuck in Cuba.<eos> I said, "She sent me over on a life raft "but got caught before she could climb in behind me."<eos> And as soon as she could escape, she'd be coming for you.<eos> I actually believed it.<eos> Hmm, so did I.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me.<eos> And now someone actually does.
Jay, I can't keep giving this to you if it's hurting you.<eos> If it'll help me defeat Geomancer, you might have to.<eos> Till Barry gets back, I may be the only chance this city has.<eos> I don't know how this is possible, but you somehow made basketball sound more boring than baseball.<eos> Fix this.<eos> Scott Evans, your new editor.<eos> - Oh, Iris...<eos> - West, I know.<eos> You wrote the story about the recent Geomancer attack.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
That's the first honest thing you've said since you came in here.<eos> - At least I'm honest with myself... what I am, what I'm not.<eos> You see what he can do?<eos> Your friend, the outcast?<eos> The power he has?<eos> It is the Lord's power. Oh!<eos> Then why'd the Lord give it to him?<eos> He doesn't even believe!<eos> - It is not my will to question God.<eos> - But you do.
That's really nice of you.<eos> Hey.<eos> You ever seen what a machete can do to the human body?<eos> He's kidding.<eos> Let's get to school, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll drop off Liam.<eos> We'll just go up and look at the bedrooms.<eos> I get the biggest one.<eos> No way, I do!
You accept hundreds?<eos> You don't look like the trust fund kids I normally work with.<eos> Are you a rapper?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> They call me White Chocolate.<eos> Well, you would need a parent to co-sign.<eos> Even then I'm afraid that you would never make board approval.<eos> What, black folk money ain't no good here?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Nah, you don't.
Yes.<eos> As I used to tell you in Little League, Oscar, if you screw up, I'm Jeff Dellinger's father.<eos> Hey, Murph, will you sign my hat?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Felix, will you stop?<eos> Stop what?<eos> Quit trying to create the perfect father-son moment.<eos> He's never gonna change.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
DONKEY-KICK LIKE YOU MEAN IT, JENNIFER.<eos> I'M JUST CURIOUS, BECAUSE THIS TAPE WAS ON ITS WAY TO GOODWILL,<eos> AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU PULLED IT OUT OF YOUR BACK POCKET.<eos> I PUT ON A COUPLE OF EXTRA POUNDS, AND JANE GOT ME OUT OF A SIMILAR SITUATION IN THE '80s.<eos> PLEASE TELL ME YOU WERE WEARING LEG WARMERS.<eos> LEAVE ME ALONE. OH.<eos> WE GOT THIS, GIRLS.<eos> MARCH IT OUT.<eos> WELL, FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, DAD, I DIDN'T NOTICE.<eos> GLORIA DID.
The only one.<eos> We have to shut this down.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> How?<eos> We find Carlos.<eos> Carlos is the one person that knows that you did not do anything wrong.<eos> Where the fuck are we gonna find him?<eos> You said the DEA doesn't know where he is.<eos> The DEA doesn't know where he is.<eos> But I do.
Did he ever tell you about my brother John Rayburn?<eos> - The cop?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Carlos isn't in trouble.<eos> He just needs to talk to my brother.<eos> About what?<eos> You know, my family's helped Carlos a lot, and now we need him to help us, so if you could just tell him to contact my brother.<eos> I don't even know if I'll hear from him again.<eos> - But if you do?
We checked his registration forms.<eos> His address and insurance information are fraudulent, which may mean he's illegal.<eos> We know for a fact that he's contagious.<eos> Chief Besser, we need local police to pick him up.<eos> We're on it.<eos> This is Major Alex Carnahan, Zone 6.<eos> He'll be running point.<eos> Well, then maybe he ought to get on it before some kid from the Middle East gives us all the plague.<eos> Zone 6 will get it done, Billy.<eos> We always do, just like last week's game against you fine fellas from Zone Two.
But now they're not doing theirs.<eos> Sir, I'll find a way to cover.<eos> We'll be lucky if we can cover our own asses now.<eos> Dr. Lommers just called from Washington.<eos> National Guard's on their way.<eos> Food drop failed, so they're bringing in the big guns before they try another one.<eos> But it failed because of her.<eos> I mean, she rushed the timeline.<eos> You really think that matters?<eos> You really do.
Nobody touches those containers until I get there.<eos> Your phone does work.<eos> Leo, I'm on the move, all right?<eos> I will come by your place tomorrow.<eos> I have a gift.<eos> From my hacker friend.<eos> A biohazard package was delivered to Burns from the CDC two days before the outbreak.<eos> - From the CDC?<eos> - Yes. You actually think they sent Burns the virus?<eos> Of course I do.
It would have been fine if things had gone to plan.<eos> Lose your gloves.<eos> You touched him, with your gloves.<eos> Thought this thing was only transmitted through fluids.<eos> You cage us like animals and leave us out here to die!<eos> - Open up!<eos> - Today...<eos> We're getting out!<eos> Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child.<eos> And they didn't!
It was in the chapel.<eos> It was this or the electric organ.<eos> Guitar was lighter.<eos> - Right.<eos> - So that's why I...<eos> Anyway, picnic?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You look nice.<eos> - You like my picnic shoes?<eos> - Oh, wow, I do.
Make sure she stays strong for the baby.<eos> I got kids, too.<eos> Outside.<eos> Come on, let me in!<eos> Come on! Hey!<eos> That one's 65 seconds, which is good.<eos> When contractions are longer than a minute, it means you're getting close.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Uh, I-I don't.
- All right.<eos> - Just go.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> No, not again.<eos> - Hey, is she...?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Just tell me they train cops to...<eos> - Yes, they do.
Her body could reject it.<eos> So?<eos> She's already dying.<eos> This particular Thomas strain of the virus may be deadly, but it's kinder than its predecessor.<eos> Patients remain asymptomatic until past the 40th hour, death is delayed beyond the 48th hour, and the body's ultimate disintegration happens quickly, with precision.<eos> Still a terrible outcome, but a shorter one.<eos> You're saying it could make death worse.<eos> Significantly.<eos> Or it could save her.<eos> Do it.
Thomas.<eos> Hi.<eos> They said you wanted to talk.<eos> Uh, are you mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not mad at you, Thomas.<eos> Not even a little bit.<eos> No one is, not even Quentin.<eos> I didn't mean to make Mary sick.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Kate always gave me a hard time when I thought about giving up.<eos> She always saw me as... more of hero than I saw myself.<eos> She had a way of seeing the good in people.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Another one?<eos> There's no way we're gonna get through here.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Over my dead body.<eos> Look, just 'cause you're stuck in this lab all day doesn't mean I should be too.<eos> Over my rotting corpse.<eos> Look, what happened to trying new things, meeting new people?<eos> You said I should start a life here, right?<eos> And Zoom's over there, and we're over here, so there's nothing to worry about.<eos> There's always something to worry about.<eos> Okay, well, you said Barry and them are good people and I should get to know them.<eos> - I did.
Oh, no.<eos> Not Melissa Etheridge.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Did I do anything else?<eos> Uh, you groped me a little.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No worries.<eos> Um, I'm gonna go make the kids pancakes.<eos> Yesterday we did chocolate chip.
Your tunnel will take months to finish.<eos> You could be relocated before it's ready.<eos> But if it works, we can get everybody out.<eos> Two hundred of you, running around the forest?<eos> No papers, no clothes, no place to hide?<eos> You'll be hunted like dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's risky.<eos> But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left.<eos> Eric didn't know.<eos> None of us do.
Aurora has the keys.<eos> Good.<eos> Gun.<eos> - Why would I give you a gun?<eos> - You need help.<eos> I can help.<eos> What do you know about guns?<eos> You aim and squeeze and your target dies.<eos> How do I know I can I trust you?<eos> You don't yet.
He said he was scared.<eos> Let's just bury our dead.<eos> You must think I'm a monster.<eos> You're not a monster.<eos> Doing that to our own son...<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Sabine, I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.
Sabine, I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.<eos> Because I did the same thing.<eos> I told you about my husband, Max?<eos> He was... he was strong, very strong,<eos> but, um... he got sick.<eos> He got weak.<eos> So weak that there was nothing left of him.<eos> And he begged me... to help him.<eos> And so I did.
I think we can safely say that we have all worn quite well.<eos> The diamonds.<eos> Yes, well, about that.<eos> Look, can I have your word from one gentleman to another?<eos> You, you're not a gentleman.<eos> No.<eos> But I am gentle.<eos> So from this one gentle man to you four gentlemen, can we guarantee that upon receipt of the desired information, you're not going to toss me into the street?<eos> You sold them?<eos> Of course you did.
I know that, and you know that,<eos> but do you really think others will be so liberally minded?<eos> Let me worry about the others.<eos> St Pierre is in love.<eos> You have walked through palaces.<eos> Pauline and St Pierre will be destroyed by it.<eos> I have to protect him.<eos> Pauline means more to me than you could possibly imagine.<eos> I will protect her.<eos> Then do so.
Forgive me, ma'am.<eos> I am a thief, but I am also the principal agent in the jewels' return.<eos> - Hang him!<eos> - I could double your money for you.<eos> - Hang him now!<eos> - Double your money.<eos> Surely if he could accomplish that, ma'am.<eos> Don't trust him, every breath is a lie.<eos> He must have the money he made from the sales.<eos> Yes, yes, I do!
Arrest this lot, will you?<eos> It's okay.<eos> We need to leave.<eos> Oi! Over here!<eos> Arrest these lot.<eos> Just keep moving.<eos> I'll think of something.<eos> Regent Treville.<eos> I knew my brother would finally pardon me.<eos> He didn't.
Your Majesty, I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought you were Gaston.<eos> For the brief time he's here,<eos> I don't want to set eyes on him.<eos> He is in the Dauphin's quarters.<eos> Treville's plan has worked.<eos> Gaston believes your son has been taken out of Paris to safety.<eos> Where is he truly?<eos> Please tell me you know.<eos> I don't...
I, too, am a man of honour.<eos> It is about the imminence of the threat.<eos> If you pull them back just ten leagues to the River Marne, I will draft a treaty.<eos> Why would I do this?<eos> A gesture, an act of conciliation.<eos> Then we could try one more time to reach an agreement.<eos> I should have told you everything from the start.<eos> No.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight, I might've put the boy in danger.<eos> But you didn't.
Well, we know where he is now.<eos> Although, we've all fallen for that trap before.<eos> This time we've got the advantage.<eos> This note's addressed to three of us.<eos> Grimaud thinks D'Artagnan's dead.<eos> The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?
All right, then what am I supposed to do?<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to stop Zoom?<eos> Do you know the answer to this equation?<eos> If Thawne figures out that it's you, the timeline will be altered.<eos> People can die.<eos> Others could live, and no one will know who or what will be affected, but I promise you, when you come back, things will be different.<eos> And only you will know what those differences are.<eos> Well, if that's what I have to do to stop Zoom, then so be it, because if I don't, and Zoom gets my speed before I learn how to stop him, everybody I care about, everybody in this whole city... their world will never be the same anyway.<eos> Um... Do you really think you can do this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't know why.<eos> Well, you must have done something to piss him off.<eos> - Satellite hasn't found anything.<eos> - We need to find a more permanent solution to this problem.<eos> Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.<eos> That's about as good a first step as any.<eos> - I got some parts for it.<eos> - Let's go for it.<eos> You don't know how to stop - a Time Wraith?<eos> - None of us do.
I... Why... why would you want to do something like this?<eos> - That's not like you.<eos> - I know. It's not.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I mean, I've been with Brian for 10 years.<eos> I mean, I don't even know what "like me" means anymore.<eos> Well, having an affair a month before your wedding seems like a really weird way to figure it out.<eos> It's not an affair.<eos> I've been with. - Do you not want to get married?<eos> - Of course I do.
Yeah, Kate thought that I was judging her, and I was just trying to help.<eos> You know? I'm not...<eos> I'm not judgy.<eos> - That's, like, my thing.<eos> - That's true. It is.<eos> And, actually, she was... She was judging me.<eos> She was the judgy one.<eos> Apparently, she's weirded out that I'm marrying Harry because Harry was married to my sister, but you guys don't think it's weird, right?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Do you?
- Get some help!<eos> - You know what?<eos> Screw you.<eos> I mean, it was...<eos> It was like a, um, you know, an out-of-body experience.<eos> I was standing there and I'm watching all my frustrations come flooding out on this poor guy and his bike.<eos> I could have killed him, Karen.<eos> Take a big sip.<eos> - Now.<eos> Do it.
Thank you.<eos> Okay, so, how do we want to do this?<eos> Oh! I-I crashed your date.<eos> I'll pay.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I mean, how do you want to do this?<eos> You girls live together, right?<eos> Would be easier to just go to your place and do it there?<eos> Do what where?
Ann, you will have this orgasm, if it's the last thing I do.<eos> Well, not me personally.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Okay, I think that's all for today.<eos> I think these ideas are exactly what you're looking for, for the dining room... warm, not stuffy... though it matters more what you think, right?<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I love it all.<eos> Oh, I am so glad.<eos> So, why does it look like you actually don't love it?<eos> I really do.
That's harsh.<eos> Yeah, that... that sounds harsh.<eos> Were you the one who leaked them?<eos> That's what you found on his phone?<eos> I thought you were just gonna get his contacts.<eos> Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.
Yeah, that... that sounds harsh.<eos> Were you the one who leaked them?<eos> That's what you found on his phone?<eos> I thought you were just gonna get his contacts.<eos> Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.<eos> So does Troy Baker.
What the hell is this?<eos> You're suing for full custody?<eos> And supervised visitation?<eos> Are you out of your freaking mind? !<eos> I'm not the one who slept with my child's nanny and wrote a book about all the sexual things that I've done<eos> - for all the world to see.<eos> - So this is about my book?<eos> This is about you... living in a morally questionable universe that isn't appropriate to raise a child in.<eos> But yes... I found your book exploitive and disturbing.<eos> Faith and I both did.
Out of necessity, not when there's another set of parents willing and able to care for the child.<eos> You and Faith are both doctors.<eos> You'll be just as busy as I am!<eos> Faith's not going back to work.<eos> She's gonna stay home.<eos> We're gonna have more children.<eos> Faith's not Vivian's mother.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I am Vivian's father, and she is my wife, and she knows the proper way to care for and raise a child.<eos> And I don't?
You did?<eos> Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Well...<eos> Well?<eos> No.<eos> Um... not well.<eos> You know, Harry, I-I tried.<eos> Really, I did.
No. I'm... It's just more Joss stuff.<eos> You mean because she beat a guy up and lied to you about it?<eos> Yeah, that, and now she wants me to cut ties with Jonathan.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He didn't do anything.<eos> Yeah, I know, but it's his nephew.<eos> You know, I really don't want to give up everything I've been working toward and start from scratch, but then I feel like I'm being selfish for even thinking that way.<eos> I like Joss.<eos> I really do.
That's fantastic.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, it will be if you don't do any of that weird stuff you just did.<eos> - Speak intelligently?<eos> - No, you just...<eos> You can't go in there over prepared, especially not with a guy like Jason Hughes.<eos> - He's super off the cuff.<eos> - You know who Jason Hughes is?<eos> Of course I do.
It's fun.<eos> More importantly, how badly did you suck on that podcast?<eos> You're really sticking with this honesty is the best policy thing, huh?<eos> No, I...<eos> Don't feel too bad, honey.<eos> - It wasn't entirely your fault.<eos> - It wasn't my fault at all.<eos> He is a pompous blowhard who didn't let me get a word in edgewise.<eos> And he had the audacity to ask me to come back, if you can believe it.<eos> - He did?
There are a million publicists in this town, so if working with your fiancée is a problem for you, then we don't.<eos> You can blame it on me if you like.<eos> It's your call.<eos> There are lots of other agents out there, Dr. Kim.<eos> Not really.<eos> Not when your first book was only somewhat successful.<eos> I can't afford to take another year off to write something on spec, and I don't know how to get another deal without an agent.<eos> Maybe I should give up.<eos> Maybe I don't have another book in me.<eos> Of course you do.
He's hot. He's cold.<eos> He's... still married to Jen.<eos> He's getting a divorce.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Great.<eos> So what does that make you, then?<eos> The rebound?<eos> You don't know anything about our relationship.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I don't.
I'll think about it.<eos> What?<eos> Do I seem like the kind of girl who wants to spend her vacation on a boat the whole time?<eos> Well, now that you mention it, I am seeing you a little more room service, Four Seasons, right?<eos> Mm! Now you're speaking my language.<eos> So, what else should we talk about?<eos> Stop it.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I know I said I don't want to talk about the book pages, but I lied.<eos> I do.
I do. Do you still have feelings for him?<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> - Because I just get the feeling like there's something else you're not telling me here.<eos> Kate, stop!<eos> I love your brother.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> You remember him?<eos> The guy that you wouldn't tell about the whole secret relationship in the first place?<eos> Lucky for you I didn't.
Oh, yes.<eos> That's an excellent idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You go.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Can I just say I'm glad you called?<eos> I didn't think you were going to.<eos> To be honest, I wasn't sure either.<eos> Why did you?
The woman really did have some great clothes.<eos> Mm, take what you like.<eos> She wouldn't mind.<eos> I feel weird, us scavenging.<eos> Oh, honey, we're not scavenging.<eos> We're organizing.<eos> - I take it you haven't told him yet.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> He was supposed to go on his tour two days ago, but he postponed.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - ‭I'll do it.
Come on.<eos> - I want to see you in a bikini. - Oh!<eos> Hey.<eos> You busy?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Actually I am.<eos> Trying to get ready for the big opening and all that.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Thought I said I'd call you if I...<eos> Yeah, no, you did.
So, what... did you regret it?<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> It was a strange feeling, not knowing what was next.<eos> But I didn't look back.<eos> And the truth is, it was obviously the right thing because now I have a baby, a book, and a new practice.<eos> I don't know how serious you are, but you're never gonna be 100% sure.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Well, sometimes you just have to close your eyes, jump, and trust the net will appear.<eos> Hmm. And if it doesn't?
She came in to see the woman that Scott was still in love with.<eos> And she said that woman was you... specifically?<eos> Well, she said there were still pictures of me on his phone, so it seems pretty obvious.<eos> I don't know how else to say this, so I'm... just gonna say it.<eos> Scott isn't in love with you.<eos> Even if that were true, which it's not, how would you know?<eos> Are you speaking to Scott a lot these days?<eos> Did he tell you himself?<eos> No.<eos> Joss did.
Good.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm just so worried.<eos> Honey, is any part of you worried that Spence might have done this?<eos> Of course not!<eos> You all knew him.<eos> You worked for him.<eos> And when he got drunk, he was a totally different person.<eos> One time, I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> But he didn't.
Like a book club?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You should read this.<eos> It's going to change your life.<eos> "Joynetics:<eos> Completing The Circle".<eos> The Circle?<eos> That's what Shannon and Ben were talking about.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No, I don't.
Text me.<eos> Did that guy sleep over?<eos> Yes.<eos> So?<eos> So...<eos> Good for you.<eos> He's hot, girl.<eos> Give me five.<eos> I met him doing shots at this dive bar and he dared me 20 bucks to go next door and get a tattoo.<eos> But you didn't. Oh, yeah.
I believe I'm going to have the soup tonight.<eos> It reminds me of the soup kitchen where I volunteer when I'm not donating blood or reading to the blind.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Gosh... I mean...<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Evelyn.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I know what "We need to talk" means.<eos> - You do?
You need to find out who really killed Peri.<eos> I killed Peri.<eos> Ben is washing Spence's brain.<eos> That's why he confessed.<eos> She's not asking questions about Spence?<eos> She doesn't have a clue.<eos> And she doesn't know anything about The Circle?<eos> The Circle?<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No, I don't.
You just think that because you're high as a kite right now.<eos> Am I? Mmhmm.<eos> I feel pretty normal.<eos> I don't think there was any drugs in that coffee.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me try something.<eos> Listen to the sound of my voice.<eos> You love prison.<eos> You want to go back to prison.<eos> No, I don't.
I promise not to use tongue.<eos> Let's just go with a hug.<eos> I mean, it took forever to detail the Mercedes, so I was late for yoga.<eos> Do you do yoga, Marisol?<eos> I'm sorry, what...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Forget him.<eos> Once they're talking business, you're on your own.<eos> So, Marisol, you wrote a book?<eos> I did, yeah.
The least you could do is pretend to appreciate it.<eos> A man that I knew a long time ago, he... he died.<eos> Oh. Well...<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> I haven't seen him in 20 years.<eos> But it's the first man I ever loved.<eos> Probably the only man.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> You do?
She snores like an animal, but of course I can't say anything because she's in a wheelchair.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Maybe just scroll forward until she gets emotional?<eos> Wait.<eos> There.<eos> Is she crying?<eos> This could be it.<eos> I was terrified that Spence would find out the baby wasn't his.<eos> I knew I had to come forward about the rape, so I called Hugh and I told him I was turning him in.<eos> But you never did?
Are you working the party?<eos> 'Cause you really shouldn't be in here.<eos> But I need to talk to you... about Peri Westmore.<eos> Never met her.<eos> Such a tragedy.<eos> Oh, I knew her.<eos> And so did my husband... Spence Westmore.<eos> - The man who killed her?<eos> - Oh, he didn't kill her.<eos> You did.
Are you all right?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - He's very lucky.<eos> The bullet didn't hit any vital organs.<eos> Does he have to wear these handcuffs?<eos> Spence is innocent.<eos> He still broke out of prison.<eos> But Kill Face forced you to escape.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Yes, yes, he did.
In the moment, I did, but the second I did it, I knew it was wrong and I came straight to you.<eos> I didn't have to, but... I had to, you know?<eos> I value our friendship.<eos> Yeah, well, friendship's supposed to be 50/50.<eos> Lately, it's more like 90/10.<eos> Would you take 60/40 maybe?<eos> - Not now, Cooler.<eos> - Cooler, shut the fuck up.<eos> I didn't know that you felt that way.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.
Come on, you know that I'd never eat here.<eos> I know, but, um... the watermelon...<eos> Watermelon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That, man.<eos> That cost three bucks, Chip.<eos> Is that the watermelon that was in your fridge?<eos> - Yeah, and it's gone!<eos> - Yeah... because you ate it.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Five hundred bucks?<eos> - Yeah, that guy sucks.<eos> Ew. How long do you think his hand was in that glove?<eos> About a month.<eos> Might have to break into your cellar to get a bottle of that expensive wine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> It could've been worse.<eos> Good thing you remembered who he was.<eos> I didn't.
- Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - Sorry about the other night.<eos> - Hey, babe.<eos> - So, you talk to your guy?<eos> - Uh, which guy?<eos> About the store.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I just did, as a matter of fact.
- Do you know if he's been drinking?<eos> - No. Look, I don't know.<eos> It's more about me cleaning up his messes, and that seems to be all I'm fucking doing lately and I'm fucking sick of it.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Now, I see.<eos> I get it.<eos> No.<eos> I get it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, I do.
So, you tracked me down?<eos> You got a job at my favorite restaurant.<eos> You got close to my best friend, and then you rent my studio?<eos> I didn't know that was your favorite restaurant.<eos> - It's true.<eos> - And then this?<eos> - Was this part of the plan?<eos> - No.<eos> This just happened.<eos> No, it didn't.
No.<eos> - No? - Mm-mm.<eos> Can you rope an ass?<eos> Uh...<eos> No.<eos> I... I've... No, I've never done that.<eos> People love a good roped ass.<eos> - Hmm. - A well-roped ass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My ex-wife sure did. Oh.
For a woman.<eos> What the hell are you?<eos> Um, I guess I never really thought about it.<eos> Um, I guess I'm just normal.<eos> Normal.<eos> Hell, you ain't normal.<eos> If you was normal, you wouldn't be sitting out here in the middle of the dirt.<eos> Thanks, Eddie.<eos> I think he means that as an insult, right?<eos> No, I did not.
- Dale. Stop. It's...<eos> I mean, it's game point, Coach.<eos> It's okay to lose gracefully.<eos> Just calm down.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> No!<eos> You can't hit the ball, man.<eos> - I didn't.
Three, two, one.<eos> Go!<eos> This thing got you cruising.<eos> - How fast does he normally go? - Not this fast.<eos> Not even close.<eos> Are his vitals okay?<eos> Yeah, they're perfect. Cool.<eos> It's like having a pit-stop attached to your chest.<eos> Guys, I can go faster.<eos> Do it.
What if we could stop Zoom through a vibe somehow?<eos> We could weaponize the goggles...<eos> Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.<eos> Okay, what if we modify the pulse rifle to emit a low-level EMF?<eos> We don't have the equipment to modify the pulse rifles now.<eos> Then we do another snatch and grab mission.<eos> By the time we scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...<eos> I need a minute!<eos> Barry, I know you... can't give up your speed to that monster, but... I also know that I want to get my son back, and I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
That was just an excuse.<eos> I missed my breakfast.<eos> And here it is.<eos> Don't burn yourself.<eos> Boys. Mm-mmm!<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Did you call ahead and let 'em know we're coming?<eos> "Hi, this is Reverend Anderson,<eos> I'm just calling to see if you're still 100 percent demon-free."<eos> No, I did not.
What is wrong with you?<eos> Amber?<eos> Amber?<eos> And Lord, we ask and pray, in your infinite wisdom, to bring back... Sherry to us, and more importantly, to her family.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I'll come by tomorrow.<eos> You really think that's gonna make any difference?<eos> Prayer?<eos> Yes, I do.
- No.<eos> No.<eos> - Cover it up. - No!<eos> - Reverend, let them put it back on.<eos> This is what I'm talking about!<eos> This is what I'm talking about!<eos> His sign!<eos> For he walks amongst us.<eos> Right here, right now!<eos> The same way that he did at that mine.
Just like a bad dream.<eos> But until that day comes, I'm gonna protect you.<eos> Better than one of these ever could.<eos> - You gave him everything?<eos> - I didn't give him your badge.<eos> - You lost that on your own.<eos> - Oh, Jesus, come on.<eos> Did it feel good, Mark?<eos> Doing what you did to him?<eos> Yeah, fuck yeah, it did.
They'll be back.<eos> Is he there?<eos> Jesus, come on, Rev.<eos> Didn't you do enough damage the other night?<eos> I want him to see me on my feet.<eos> For him to know that I've beat the count.<eos> Round two.<eos> You really think he's the devil?<eos> You saw what he did to me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Something to help her relax.<eos> Wait right here.<eos> Mr. Barnes.<eos> Mr. Barnes.<eos> You can have a few minutes.<eos> Allison. Hey, baby.<eos> There's so many things I need to tell you.<eos> Things I should have told you a long time ago.<eos> And I wanted to.<eos> The other night on the porch, I did.
Don't know, don't care.<eos> But if he's here, Zoom must need something from him.<eos> So what does Zoom need you for?<eos> That is an excellent question, Caity.<eos> You know, I've been asking myself the same thing.<eos> But doesn't matter now.<eos> I'm not gonna stick around much longer.<eos> Wait, I...<eos> I thought you said your powers don't work inside this cell?<eos> They don't.
I got to get back to the station.<eos> You okay?<eos> No, not really.<eos> You know, you were the first person I saved after I got my powers?<eos> We were out on a walk and we were talking about Eddie and how you were with him, and I was thinking to myself how I missed a lot while I was in that coma.<eos> And then all of a sudden, those cars came at us.<eos> And it was like the world froze.<eos> Like... you and I were the only two people in the world.<eos> I didn't even know what I could do yet, but I knew that I could save you.<eos> And I did.
And I did.<eos> And now, I don't know.<eos> I don't...<eos> I just don't even know who I am anymore or who I'm supposed to be.<eos> Barry, you're supposed to be the same guy that you've always been.<eos> Suit or no suit... that guy is a hero.<eos> That's everything you asked for.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Knowing you've destroyed so many people's lives?<eos> I don't.
Relax, he'll be here.<eos> What should I say?<eos> I don't even know where to start.<eos> Just be honest.<eos> Speak from your heart.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wally West.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> You wanted to see me.<eos> Yes. I did.
- Asher?<eos> - He's fine.<eos> All the kids are.<eos> Wes?<eos> Annalise got out of the hospital this morning.<eos> Wes, this is good.<eos> It means she's gonna be okay.<eos> Wes, it's all working.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Your star witness who is high on pain pills and hallucinating.<eos> You don't have any other choice.<eos> Get the judge to accept it.<eos> Bonnie!<eos> Bonnie!<eos> I can't trust you to do anything.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I don't know what this means.<eos> I'm not your mother.<eos> I don't...
Because it's hard to want to be around someone who does that.<eos> I want to know you, I do, but not this way.<eos> I'm tired, okay?<eos> Please go.<eos> Right.<eos> Nate, I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> You know me.<eos> You do.
I'm not so sure that's true, Mr. Denver.<eos> Objection sustained.<eos> E-excuse me...<eos> If you want Ms. Keating's testimony in this hearing, she will have to testify.<eos> Move on to your next witness, Mr. Denver.<eos> Injuries like Ms. Sinclair's are consistent with a fall, but there are other points of impact in the evidence which lead me to conclude that the body was struck prior to the fall.<eos> Perhaps if the defendant previously attacked her with an object... - Did you call her?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> The judge just threw out your statement.<eos> What do we do?
Argumentative.<eos> - Because I think what you just said, that you didn't see anything that night, is the only honest thing you've said up there today.<eos> Your honor, counsel is badgering the witness.<eos> If she doesn't have a question, we should move on.<eos> Here's a question.<eos> Ms. Keating, aren't you lying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Then how can we trust anything that you think you saw or heard that night, including your claim that Catherine Hapstall shot you?<eos> She didn't.
It was Philip Jessup.<eos> Please strike what my client just said and let the record note that she was not under oath for any of that.<eos> This has been an inadmissible statement.<eos> Your honor, I demand that we recess so that I can properly confer with my client, who is... Clearly she is mentally incompetent right now.<eos> The D.A. is going to offer Catherine a deal.<eos> Five years, minimum security if she testifies against Philip.<eos> Okay. Please, Annalise...<eos> No.<eos> It's not your job to worry about me.<eos> Yeah, I do, though.
I don't care.<eos> Nothing's changed for me.<eos> What I saw in there proves the process works.<eos> Jason's life is worth saving.<eos> You might think you know what you're doing, but you're in denial.<eos> Jason lied to you.<eos> He stood there over your son while he bled out.<eos> Hate won't win.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> Well, it just did.
Just tell me I'm wrong.<eos> That you don't lie to me on a daily basis about all the crap you do for Annalise.<eos> See?<eos> You can't.<eos> I can't do it anymore, either.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Wes shot Annalise, not me.<eos> She told him Rebecca was dead, so he shot her in the stomach because he wanted her dead.<eos> And... I don't blame him.<eos> But somehow she does.
We have time.<eos> Mm. Suit yourself.<eos> So, Gibbins is your dad's last name?<eos> No.<eos> They changed my name when I went into foster care.<eos> - Who did?<eos> - My foster family.<eos> They thought it'd help me acclimate.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> No, of course you did.
She was shot, Catherine.<eos> Like you need to remind me.<eos> She blames Philip for that, not you.<eos> So if there's something else you know...<eos> I won't be mad.<eos> I love you.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Did he do it?<eos> Kill Mom and Dad?<eos> Maybe I did it myself.
- Hey.<eos> Everything that has happened, Sam dying, whatever it is that happened to Rebecca, although something tells me you killed her, too.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Great. There's one thing going for you... if I can even believe that.<eos> Why would I lie about that now?<eos> Because you want me to ignore what you did.<eos> That's not what I'm asking for.<eos> Then why are we down here?<eos> To find out if I told Annalise?<eos> Well, I didn't.
Oh, and a bottle of Riesling.<eos> Your best.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel like the devil.<eos> - Did it work?<eos> - She's thinking about it.<eos> She'll say yes.<eos> My point is I might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins.<eos> Mm. You have to believe in God for that.<eos> Or maybe you do now.
Wait.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> What's better than sex?<eos> You think I'm a gigolo?<eos> I know what you are.<eos> So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay Annalise Keating's bitch?<eos> Frank.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> We found her.<eos> Well, Oliver did.
I would've told you if I were.<eos> Well, since when, then?<eos> Well, we heard that you'd been shot and stopped by to see how you were doing.<eos> So it's all my fault.<eos> I did not say that.<eos> After everything that he's done...<eos> You act like he beat me.<eos> No, the worst thing he did was to move across town.<eos> How do you know he's not gonna leave again?<eos> I don't.
- Exactly.<eos> 'Cause, I mean, if, like, Bonnie found out...<eos> She won't, and neither will Caleb, who hopefully isn't dead right now.<eos> Yeah, I do just...<eos> I want to say this.<eos> Um...<eos> It was bad morally.<eos> I feel that.<eos> I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.<eos> Because I did... uh, thoroughly.
Come on, Annalise, what's up?<eos> You too sedated to pop that thing?<eos> You got to pop it!<eos> Pop, pop!<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo! Y'all better watch out.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Nixon was a far more effective president.<eos> The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot.<eos> Well, you've got that going for you, too, now, don't you?<eos> And you've got your search engine and all your little home videos.<eos> See, if people want a piece of you... you give it to them, right?<eos> Is that what people want?<eos> A piece of you?<eos> Do you play video games?<eos> No.<eos> My kids do.
I'm not a good person.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> I'm not worth it.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm trying to give you the out.<eos> Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.
You're in pain.<eos> I'm not worth it.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm trying to give you the out.<eos> Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
David?<eos> Hey, Claire.<eos> Or is it, uh, "London" now?<eos> I like the new look.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> - Does it...<eos> Does it matter? Just, um... you promised.<eos> Yeah, I know... to give you space and time.<eos> I just didn't expect you to take so much of it, is all.<eos> Yeah, neither did I.
- Take this.<eos> - Whoa. What the fuck?<eos> No, take it, man.<eos> Save us all a lot of time and energy.<eos> - Look, I...<eos> - Shut the fuck up, would you, Chip?<eos> For once.<eos> Take the gun, put it in your mouth or whatever, and just spare us all the extra words.<eos> George, I appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> No, you don't.
That's why they took her.<eos> Where did they take her?<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Let me go!<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior, but nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.
That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior, but nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.<eos> She just took out 20 Wesen who tried to kill me.<eos> - By herself?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
My God, I don't want to deal with this!<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> This guy is obviously contacting you for a reason.<eos> Don't you think we got to figure out why?<eos> I mean, he just said he's thinking of coming to Portland.<eos> What does this guy want from you?<eos> After all this time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He thinks we had a relationship.<eos> We didn't.
Not at first.<eos> I didn't believe in anything.<eos> What about now?<eos> I found a reason to live.<eos> Do you feel remorse for anything you've done?<eos> You mean what she did.<eos> What you did.<eos> You still think you're talking to Juliette.<eos> I don't know who I'm talking to.<eos> Yes, you do.
How are you guys?<eos> I missed you.<eos> We're just glad you're okay.<eos> So you got a motorcycle.<eos> I did.<eos> Look.<eos> I need to talk to you guys about something.<eos> Oh, that kind of talk.<eos> You guys know about Black Claw, right?<eos> We do.
Initiating collision.<eos> Barry!<eos> It worked!<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to my son?<eos> You thought you could give The Flash his speed back?<eos> Well done.
Do what you have to do.<eos> They're gonna arrest you and take you in.<eos> And when they do, you're not gonna say a goddamn word to anyone.<eos> I made things right with Lowry.<eos> I promise you, you did not make things right.<eos> What's this?<eos> Three keys.<eos> Some of what we lost.<eos> We didn't lose it.<eos> You did.
Nothing.<eos> I was just... moving this... chair.<eos> Why?<eos> Just a little late-night cardio.<eos> Okay.<eos> I block the door at night to keep out the murderers.<eos> I know that it's weird, but... it's just one of my things.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> You do?
I'm one of those ancient sheet guys!<eos> Murph!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Yeah, I know, dude... a horse would've been way cooler, but the cop refused to get off of it.<eos> Do you know what would happen to me if the condo board saw this?<eos> You got to get this thing out of here now.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Thought you wanted a wild party.<eos> I do.

I got the perfect bottle of wine.<eos> We're going to watch a beautiful sunset.<eos> She's going to drink this.<eos> And then, I'm going to call an Uber.<eos> For the transition.<eos> Uber guy's going to say, "One stop or two?"<eos> Which is basically like saying, "Your place or mine?"<eos> Except I don't have to say anything.<eos> - Sounds like you got it all figured out.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Installed?<eos> No, I just...<eos> God...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - She needed a place to crash.<eos> - Cool.<eos> That's really nice of you, man.<eos> Do you know how that date went, by any chance?<eos> Like, did...<eos> No, I don't...
- I'm sorry.<eos> Tilly?<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Look... maybe it's time for you to make a fresh start.<eos> Look for a new challenge.<eos> Sometimes it's good to let go of the past.<eos> Yeah, but does this need to be one of those "sometimes"?<eos> Are you ever going to sign our divorce?<eos> I think it might help untangle you, set you free.<eos> - I did.
Okay.<eos> Keep up the good work, guys.<eos> It's an awful world.<eos> Somebody's got to sing about it.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> No, you didn't.
I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, I was looking for a router for the Internet.<eos> - I didn't know if you had Wi-Fi.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't have anything like...<eos> I don't even have a cell phone.<eos> Can I get you a drink or...?<eos> I thought you didn't drink.<eos> - I don't.
As private secretary to the sovereign, he's my senior.<eos> This is where I have to stand aside for the great man.<eos> Martin... so sorry.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> What a nightmare.<eos> Charteris at least had one foot in the real world.<eos> And was your man, our man, on our side.<eos> Whereas Tommy Lascelles... he's stuck in the land that time forgot.<eos> - You asked to see me, sir.<eos> - I did.
- I didn't mean to--<eos> - No, no, it's all right.<eos> I'll get it done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Ask Secretary Durant to meet me in the Oval. Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Coffee table.<eos> The funny thing is I didn't even have to ask him to do it.<eos> He did it on his own.
She was a strong woman... a fierce Texan...<eos> We had... a difficult relationship from childhood onwards.<eos> At times, there were long periods of estrangement.<eos> We hurt each other... often and deeply.<eos> If there was one good thing that came from my mother's illness... it gave us a chance to reconnect, to mend old wounds.<eos> And that's not an opportunity people always get before a parent dies, and I'm grateful to have had that.<eos> And what am I doing here?<eos> I'm here because my mother wanted me to be.<eos> Yesterday, before she passed, she said to me,<eos> "Claire... do this.
I pressure a lot of people, Tom.<eos> That's part of politics.<eos> But never those two.<eos> Danton's parents say LeAnn Harvey came to their house in Miami.<eos> Well, I imagine that's because he wanted LeAnn on the Russian plan.<eos> Then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna get into the weeds on this, but let's just cut to the chase.<eos> The allegations that you're making are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met.<eos> I had nothing concrete then.<eos> This time I do.
For Byamba?<eos> I think you wanted him to react the way he did.<eos> You wanted him gone.<eos> What purpose would that serve?<eos> His support serviced my needs.<eos> Don't remind me!<eos> When I told you to get close to the Khan, you chose the path.<eos> You chose Byamba, not me.<eos> And you used it to your advantage.<eos> Of course I did!
Very wise, Father.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I want to be bitter.<eos> I'm going to go.<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> You're going to make me read it?<eos> It's Byamba's military assignment... as foot soldier.<eos> You removed that from my desk.<eos> -I did.
- Three?<eos> Three times.<eos> Cool.<eos> Well... if you're old enough to have sex, you're old enough to drink.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sit down, would you, please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you think about what I said?<eos> I did.
You ain't black no more.<eos> You blue.<eos> Which is why I can help.<eos> I got access to every fucking thing.<eos> Motherfucker,<eos> I was the call you made when you dropped your first body.<eos> You were the first person to know I fuck with girls.<eos> Now we gonna play each other like this?<eos> Candie didn't know what you meant by "Ghost."<eos> I do.
The OPR was right.<eos> I ran a trainee.<eos> I didn't see what Charlie was doing.<eos> Well, we've both fallen short over the years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We both have blood on our hands.<eos> Hard to get off.<eos> And yet, you're still here.<eos> Only because you saved me.<eos> I did, didn't I?
- That's it?<eos> - Did you?<eos> Got to spring for an Uber for a question you could have asked me anywhere?<eos> I mean, you know, I asked for your resignation a couple weeks ago.<eos> You're the only one - who has grounds to want me gone, and you're next up in line for my job.<eos> I fought for you, Miranda.<eos> You do a lot of things, Liam.<eos> But we both know fighting for me is not one of them.<eos> I messed that up.<eos> Yeah, you did.
As agents, you need to be able to keep your wits about you at all times.<eos> You have to be able to confront the doubts and fears that live within all of us.<eos> Because if you can't, you don't stand a chance against the bad guys.<eos> So gather up your stuff.<eos> We're gonna go on a little trip.<eos> Last time we spoke, I know things got a little heated, but I hope I can count on you.<eos> For what?<eos> Well, in the time of crisis, a group needs a leader, and you're that leader.<eos> I didn't ask for that.<eos> Yeah, well, a leader never does.
Execute.<eos> But this is not about me.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You don't like how I'm acting because I'm not acting like you.<eos> Someone died last week, Drew.<eos> Yeah, a terrorist.<eos> I did what needed to be done.<eos> Whatever you did clearly isn't the same or we wouldn't be having this talk.<eos> You have no idea what I did.<eos> No, I don't.
It's time for my statement.<eos> I'm being benched.<eos> Suspended from active duty till further notice.<eos> Plus mandatory counseling.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I can't let you take the blame for this.<eos> Let... Let me go talk to them.<eos> Maybe I can convince them to go easy on you. I...<eos> They did.
Delivering a package.<eos> Have you heard from Raina?<eos> She's not responding to me.<eos> She's on her way here now with Charlie.<eos> You can wait for her here with me if you'd like.<eos> I'm gonna need you to open up the back, too.<eos> I think we need to talk about Caleb.<eos> Caleb stole your money and met with a woman who gave him this.<eos> I think they're related, but I don't know how.<eos> Maybe you do.
My advisor was a retired federal judge...<eos> Alan Handler.<eos> A real liberal lion.<eos> He and some other fellows had this rotating poker game.<eos> Now, you would think that these brilliant legal minds would know how to bluff.<eos> But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
- Natalie Vasquez?<eos> You know why she would request an emergency leave of absence?<eos> I got an e-mail from her this morning.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Alex, run!<eos> When I was 17, I was part of an organization.<eos> - Like a cult?<eos> - My dad rescued me.<eos> My son's a greater danger to himself than you know.<eos> But I do.
Hurry up!<eos> Those barrels of black powder.<eos> What's their destination?<eos> The capital.<eos> Back to work.<eos> What now?<eos> I saw wagons filled with those barrels on a road that doesn't lead to Cambulac.<eos> And you know every road to Cambulac?<eos> It's my home.<eos> Of course I do.
Orus, you half-wit.<eos> Put down your knife.<eos> -Or what?<eos> -We're going home.<eos> You wanted to be a hunter, you hunted.<eos> You wanted to be a wrestler, you wrestled!<eos> ...You wanted to be a warrior... you fought!<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> - I didn't want to be the Khan.<eos> Well, I did.
Okay.<eos> Really consider this before you react.<eos> We cut off Milo's hands and we leave him on the boat.<eos> Look, Jesús cuts of hands and feet, right?<eos> Milo's already lost his feet so we just leave him on the boat and then it'll look like a drug deal gone bad.<eos> Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time.<eos> That's... actually... a smart idea.<eos> All right.<eos> This is all I could find.<eos> I did the feet.
Fuck off.<eos> Man, give me this.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm giving you three seconds to come out of there or I am going to light this motherfucking closet up, you hear me?<eos> Three, two...<eos> One!<eos> Do it, do it.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you.<eos> - I do!
One of the team left, took off.<eos> It was Joel, right?<eos> Gus. Why did you think it was Joel?<eos> Cobi, I asked you to manage your team.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, I know.<eos> Well, you know, I didn't think he was gonna do it.<eos> But then I was pretty sure that, you know, he was gonna come back.<eos> So I'm-I'm not exactly sure if this, like, affects things m-moving forward. Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
And you know they do, so you use it on them.<eos> I can tell because you give it a little extra.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're aware of it.<eos> If a person were perceptive, they'd be aware that you are aware of it.<eos> Maybe that's all part of it.<eos> A whole other conversation happening with your smile.<eos> Do you want to fuck?<eos> I used to not say what I think.<eos> Now I do.
Don't leave him.<eos> Why?<eos> He... just-just... just give him another chance.<eos> You know?<eos> He loves you.<eos> If you are able to tell us who murdered her and we are able to secure a Case on the strength of your information, then I see no reason why we cannot release you.<eos> Joel Kransey.<eos> You know where he might be?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
♪ And we'll never need their rules ♪<eos> ♪ To guide the way ♪<eos> ♪ Love will light the day ♪<eos> Well, that just made our lives a whole lot easier.<eos> We found our Romeo.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> I'm not an actor.<eos> No, come on.<eos> We're all acting all the time.<eos> - Then you do it.
As difficult as it is to believe, Stefanie, I didn't do anything.<eos> - Do you think I would really do something and keep myself someplace where I'm so unwelcome?<eos> You're always welcome here, Mom, but your opinions, however...<eos> I'll just keep my opinions to myself and we'll... push the old RV out of your driveway and into the streets someplace.<eos> Actually, we're gonna have to borrow their electricity, if you ladies don't mind.<eos> - Oh. - Of course we don't mind.<eos> I'll pay for the utility bill this month.<eos> - Not necessary, Mother.<eos> - Oh, I insist.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm all right.<eos> I...<eos> I just wanted to call and tell you I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.<eos> - You doing okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm just worried about you.<eos> Is... is Mike really pissed at me?<eos> No, he's just sad, I think.<eos> He misses you.<eos> We all do.
"I wouldn't touch that bastard with a barge pole".<eos> But she never thought like that about anyone, ever.<eos> Look, I've got to go.<eos> I've stuff to do.<eos> This is your crowd.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I'll pick you up later.<eos> OK if I take the car?<eos> I don't actually know that many people...<eos> Yes, you do.
!<eos> I could be dead.<eos> So I wish you had killed me.<eos> Look, we can either...<eos> Have you any idea of the misery I've been through in the last ten days?<eos> Look, we can keep going over this, or we can move on.<eos> I might need to destroy your computer.<eos> You're not destroying my computer.<eos> - Did you send them to anyone else? - No.<eos> Did you?
I mean, they are a legitimate business.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What, employing trafficked women?<eos> No, that's...<eos> The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her.<eos> The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.
And I'm prickly.<eos> In fact, you could call it Catherine and then next time you get cross with me, you could...<eos> Throw it at you. Yeah.<eos> Er, yeah, that'd work.<eos> Or I could call it by your nickname.<eos> That might make me happy.<eos> Sure!<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Except I haven't got one.<eos> Oh, you do!
Every day.<eos> Yes.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, but in a bad way.<eos> No!<eos> He talked about bringing you milk.<eos> And how he upset you by bringing his friend and how much he wishes he hadn't done that now because that seemed to spoil everything.<eos> Did he...?<eos> Did he say owt about me chucking petrol all over him?<eos> He did.
And all the other stuff, all the lies I got convicted over.<eos> I did not rape Ann Gallagher.<eos> That were Lewis.<eos> It were me that used to bring her Mars bars and let her use t'bucket.<eos> I did not kill that little police girl up on t'moor either.<eos> That were Lewis.<eos> And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with that knife!<eos> I know.<eos> But nobody believes me.<eos> I do.
You will get caught, you know, Daryl.<eos> And who's going to pay for that getting fixed?<eos> It's reight, it still goes.<eos> It won't pass its MOT, love, not like that.<eos> And what if you'd hit someone?<eos> - What've you got for me?<eos> - I think you'll be pleased.<eos> I didn't, and I told you I wouldn't, do anything illegal.<eos> You're not going to tell me you didn't do owt.<eos> I did do something.
As far as I'm concerned, the best way to achieve that...<eos> - ..he listened, he thought about it, and it sank in... - is to remove her.<eos> From the picture.<eos> Reinforce that.<eos> - But what you're suggesting is illegal... - Fuck illegal!<eos> When has doing anything legally got anybody like me anywhere?<eos> Frances, you're going to have to do what I've asked you to do.<eos> Or what I'm thinking is... ..this... ..you and me... ..it's not going to work, I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you understood me.<eos> I really did. I do!
Hello!<eos> What do you open.<eos> Booyah.<eos> Booyah what?<eos> These are the first few photos clues texted this morning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And we already had those photos.<eos> Can we trace the numbers receiving the texts?<eos> Negative.<eos> Or the number doing the texting?
And now we are having an awkward moment.<eos> And I'm just gonna keep talking because I found an address for Ingrid the assistant. Yippie!<eos> If there's anyone who knows who sabotaged Peter's business...<eos> - It would be her, let's go.<eos> - Okay, bye!<eos> I'm just gonna stay here and wash some mugs.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We are looking for Ingrid Bower.<eos> I am Ingrid, can I help you?<eos> You just did.
I mean, I wasn't, but I would have.<eos> She was trying to kill Nick.<eos> I would expect that from you.<eos> Yeah, I need to know how you feel about Nick and Adalind and their kid.<eos> Juliette is dead.<eos> I know she's dead.<eos> I'm asking you if you'd ever hurt them.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> I don't owe Juliette anything.<eos> But I do.
Why is she here?<eos> She's like me.<eos> Both of you?<eos> Two Grimms!<eos> No, no, stop!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Everybody calm down!<eos> Don't do this!
Did you have better luck?<eos> If anything, I've made it worse.<eos> What did you hope to achieve?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Anything!<eos> Verity, I lost my child.<eos> How could I bear it if I lost Ross too?<eos> Ask me, Enys.<eos> Am I cleaning it to put away or do I intend to use it again?<eos> Do you?
I do.<eos> Do you win?<eos> I always win.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Ok, here's my game.<eos> You have 30 minutes to answer every question I ask.<eos> And if you lie, I'll know.<eos> Because I've spent the past 10 years of my life studying men and their lies before I kill them.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> I do.
Maybe children are the line hitmen won't cross?<eos> The chemist and the sniper both performed jobs that involved families.<eos> Theoretically, if the price is high enough, a hitman shouldn't have morals.<eos> I think these kills are personal to her.<eos> Personal enough to risk double-crossing her contract.<eos> Maybe something similar happened to her.<eos> And that's how we get her to come to the table.<eos> I pretend to be that kind of client.<eos> How do we know that's gonna work?<eos> We don't.
So, I, uh,<eos> I went to see her.<eos> The moment I walked in her room, I saw it.<eos> For 3 seconds...<eos> She didn't know who I was.<eos> I, um, I had her tested that morning, and I found out that night...<eos> That she had early onset of dementia.<eos> Most likely Alzheimer's.<eos> Did you test yourself?<eos> No, you didn't.
Cut to now, Marina gets to demand that I steal shit ten times a week.<eos> Yeah, no big.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Hey, you can't take that.<eos> - Let her have it.<eos> - No, we need it.<eos> - So does she.<eos> If I had more, I'd give you more.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you don't.
Uh, Luke's with her right now, watching over her.<eos> Attention.<eos> The ceremony is about to commence.<eos> Wow.<eos> It is time for Alec Lightwood and Lydia Branwell to mark each other with the Wedded Union rune.<eos> A rune on the hand, a rune on the heart, a union is born.<eos> What's that warlock doing here?<eos> Izzy...<eos> - did Alec invite Magnus?<eos> - I did.
She's a vampire.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before.<eos> We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
Clary, you need to leave!<eos> You said yourself, we have to stay on mission.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> I can't.<eos> Clary.<eos> Clary!<eos> Damn it.<eos> I wish my mom had left us something.<eos> Some sort of clue.<eos> Maybe she did.
- I don't care.<eos> - I do.<eos> You've done enough.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I opened the door.<eos> Agent Mojtabal, stand down. Aram.<eos> Aram, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't blame you for letting me out.<eos> I don't.
'Oh, yeah. Sorry, could you just introduce yourself so people know who you are?<eos> '<eos> 'Oh, yes, I'm Dennis Fulcher, and I was the director of this piece.<eos> 'Now, see, what happened was we started filming when we noticed 'up in the gallery that the painting 'had been set in the wrong place by the bloody art department.<eos> 'Luckily, it was a long scene so I sent a stagehand down to move it.<eos> 'See?<eos> There it is.<eos> 'And, as Celia crosses over, it's gone.<eos> 'Oh, yeah, I never noticed.<eos> - 'No, people don't.
She was... She was hard to miss.<eos> Does she sound familiar?<eos> - I know who she is.<eos> - I get it now.<eos> Why Kate was so insistent about meeting Charlie.<eos> She was pregnant.<eos> She told you?<eos> No.<eos> But when I read about her murder, I-I realized she didn't want to give birth to a new baby till she knew that the one she gave up had everything he needed.<eos> I did.
He's not even mine, but I still felt protective.<eos> He's looking for his biological father.<eos> He's, uh... He's not a good guy?<eos> Would have let him down in the worst way.<eos> And his adoptive parents are stellar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted to adopt, too.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought you didn't want kids.<eos> Of course I do.
In China.<eos> A place I knew his supporters would not travel to.<eos> I took the throne from under him.<eos> They say I cheated.<eos> I don't think it's wholly the election Kaidu's after, but humiliation.<eos> He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
I panicked.<eos> And after Robyn went to jail, I just...<eos> I felt so guilty.<eos> Is that why you started N.B.P.?<eos> I thought maybe I could help Robyn, somehow make a difference.<eos> Except she found out the truth, confronted you, and that's why you killed her.<eos> I didn't kill Robyn.<eos> I-I didn't even know she found out the truth.<eos> Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.<eos> I just did.
99% of these mentors lead to a lifetime of soporific bourgeois magic hell.<eos> Alice.<eos> You're, uh...<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm going to get a drink.<eos> - Is Genji your aunt?<eos> - Oh, hey, Alice.<eos> - Is that Genji?<eos> - Do you guys know her?<eos> Everyone does.
It's brain cancer, but it's the good kind of brain cancer.<eos> Is there anything you can do?<eos> Well, luckily there are some treatment options, some, uh, really interesting new therapies.<eos> Um, do you...<eos> Uh, do you feel sick?<eos> Eh, I feel... decent.<eos> Eh, there was some dizziness, headaches.<eos> That's why I went in.<eos> - Does Mom know?<eos> - No, she does not.
Did she suffer?<eos> She said she loved you.<eos> Yeah, I know she did.<eos> So are we gonna do this, or what?<eos> Whoa. William.<eos> You're late.<eos> I'm what? Who are you?<eos> You always ask the same questions.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You never do.
It seems you have already decided what she is.<eos> It's the money, isn't it?<eos> You thought, "Here's some poor rich woman I can play."<eos> You leap to so many conclusions, it would be dishonourable - for me to contradict you.<eos> - Because you cannot contradict me.<eos> - You are a fraud.<eos> - Meriwether?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> She knows about me.<eos> She does.
Could you turn again, please?<eos> Pardon me, Miss, but do you have a date yet... for the wedding?<eos> No, but my fiance insists that it'll be soon.<eos> He's very impulsive.<eos> Well, if there's time, we should look through all the illustrations.<eos> Isn't that right, Miss?<eos> Miss Honoria?<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh, erm, of course we should.<eos> Yes, please do.
- It's my money!<eos> Yes, when it is due to you, not before.<eos> Your salary will arrive in your bank every month, as usual.<eos> It's two weeks away.<eos> I can speak to your sister if you wish...<eos> Damn my sister!<eos> Must she constantly be an obstacle to me?<eos> I am a Havisham too.<eos> - That must count for something.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Well, I'm very grateful, I feel much better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Healing hands, I got.<eos> I mean, with minor ailments like colds and that, I don't even have to touch you, all I do is look at you, see 'em off.<eos> Yes, thank you, Mrs Gamp.<eos> We'd better get you home.<eos> Can you walk?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's passed, I don't know what happened.<eos> Well, I do.
Oh? Did he share any details with you?<eos> There was one.<eos> Quite recent, I think.<eos> The purchase of a warehouse on the docks, Croucher's I think it was called.<eos> - Croucher's?<eos> - That's all he knows.<eos> He saw some paperwork regarding it, and when he asked Mr Marley about it, he snapped at him.<eos> Bob would not like to know I told you.<eos> In confidence, I have your word?<eos> Yes, you do.
The world needs to be willing to change.<eos> And it takes leaders who are willing to cut through the noise and play the game - and win the game.<eos> - And that's you?<eos> I think so.<eos> You belong to Mr. Morra now, which means you belong to me.<eos> When I'm on NZT, I can think through all the different - angles, every perspective. - Then shouldn't you have known that I was gonna shoot Casey?<eos> You texted me.<eos> Yeah, I... I didn't think you'd shoot.<eos> Lower your weapon.<eos> But I did.
I could jump out of the way.<eos> __<eos> Not bad.<eos> But what if the bullet just grazes me?<eos> __<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'll do.<eos> They need you upstairs right now.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> Of course I did.
I sent Spike shopping while I analyzed TheScrubJay's hawking habits. Bird pun not intended.<eos> And while he does dabble in tech, there is one thing he can't resist...<eos> Rare paintings.<eos> Specifically, rare stolen paintings.<eos> Found myself breaking a lot of laws since working for the FBI, but here's a new one:<eos> art forgery.<eos> You know, Bob Ross always made it look so easy.<eos> Happy trees, happy clouds.<eos> Bob didn't paint psychologically disturbing naked people.<eos> Well, Winton Miller did.
But he's having a benefit to raise money for the Russian Botanical Society in a week.<eos> There's gonna be hundreds of people there, and if we can slip in under cover of the party...<eos> We can steal the seeds.<eos> Look, we could wind up in prison, or worse.<eos> You want to go home, I get it.<eos> Special Agent Harris.<eos> Mrs. Finch. May I come in?<eos> Thank you for having me over.<eos> I assume if you knew anything about Brian's whereabouts, you would tell us, yes?<eos> I don't.
Didn't you already do this?<eos> I don't think I'm quite explaining this properly.<eos> You see, Isabella is actually being held hostage.<eos> We know.<eos> In Valencia.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Again, that's Madalena.<eos> Isabella is in Hortensia.<eos> I don't think he knows what he's talking about.<eos> No, I do.
I will be right back, okay?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Who died?<eos> What?<eos> The tie.<eos> I was filling in for someone.<eos> It's okay, happens to all of us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does.
I didn't want any of you to visit me in there.<eos> House arrest is much more dignified.<eos> I was thinking, I'll come by every couple of days brief you, keep you in the loop.<eos> That way, when you come back to work, you can hit the ground running.<eos> The director paid me a visit yesterday.<eos> Apparently, I'm bad for optics.<eos> He suggests I stop talking about frame jobs and faked deaths and take a plea.<eos> So no one else believes that Sofia's alive?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes. I do.
I want Jane Doe off this team.<eos> She's to surrender her weapon and leave this building until further notice.<eos> That is not necessary.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I just did.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> This little girl was left in a bag, totally helpless.<eos> No one knows where she came from or who left her there.<eos> - Doesn't that remind you of someone?<eos> - Of course it does.
But tell her about the recovery time.<eos> 6 to 8 weeks, barring complications.<eos> See?<eos> There's no way I can be on the shelf that long, right?<eos> Davey.<eos> Honey, this is your health, okay?<eos> I take it he has a pretty full schedule?<eos> Well, our business is day to day so you never know when it's,<eos> - you know, about to get busy.<eos> - I do.
She can't talk to you right now, honey.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, she's talking to someone that might be able to help her out.<eos> You don't think my mom did any of this, d-do you?<eos> The most important thing is for you to get some rest.<eos> No.<eos> My mom didn't do anything.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just... I do.
How?<eos> I'm used to my siblings hating on me lately.<eos> I think I can handle a ten-year-old.<eos> Plus, Frank and Monica were always switching out partners, so I know what he's going through.<eos> I kind of love you right now.<eos> You better.<eos> Your queen doth love what you do with your scepter, King Frank.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Your king... is about to blow his load into your moat, my queen.<eos> One thing before you do, my regal stallion.
Meisner.<eos> He wanted us to be aware of it.<eos> We got a Wesen terrorist, working for Black Claw, loose in Portland.<eos> We don't know where he is, what he wants, or who his contacts are.<eos> I'm assuming Meisner wants us to find him so H.W. can deal with him.<eos> Basically, yeah.<eos> All right, put out an APB but strictly a find and follow.<eos> Do not engage.<eos> Report contact only. You know how to contact Meisner?<eos> - We do.
Too much depends on this now.<eos> This has to be done.<eos> You'll be out of the country before morning.<eos> Once we find whatever it is we're looking for, then what?<eos> Depends on what we find.<eos> What if it's something that used to be important back then, but isn't a very big deal now?<eos> You know? Like eyeglasses.<eos> Eyeglasses?<eos> Did you know the first pair of eyeglasses was invented in the 13th century?<eos> - I did not.
Yes.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Richard: Are you fuckin' k--<eos> Mira, you're not supposed to park here.<eos> That was a little much.<eos> He- he's coming back.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Come here.<eos> Did you touch this?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
The twister?<eos> Yes, the twister.<eos> It was destroyed six moons ago by carlos madrigal.<eos> The skull keeper did not escape from hell, He escaped from our prison.<eos> They all did.<eos> They?<eos> How many more are there?<eos> More than we can survive.<eos> Do you see them, master?<eos> I do.
I have a very good memory.<eos> I guess that makes me a good spy.<eos> If they tell you I committed suicide, it's a lie.<eos> They'll show you proof.<eos> Maybe even a letter written by me.<eos> Don't believe it.<eos> I'll never kill myself.<eos> I think I could die right now.<eos> You don't really know me...<eos> Neither do you.
I'm kidding.<eos> Of course I have.<eos> - Are you a shit?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't know how to lie.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> You're in the land of lies.<eos> You're really good at it.<eos> Do I know how to be a real shit?<eos> I do.
Forget it.<eos> You don't want to help, that's fine.<eos> Some things never change.<eos> Oh, still the victim with you, huh.<eos> Always somebody else's fault.<eos> Somebody else made you go to that cabin.<eos> Somebody else chopped your hand off...<eos> - Ah, no, I did that.<eos> - Somebody else killed your girl.<eos> No, I did that too.
- That's mine. - What is this?<eos> Can I have it, please?<eos> You took notes on my wife?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Look at this shit.<eos> You got all this... Veronica's family tree, likes and dislikes?<eos> Oh, you got that wrong.<eos> - Where?<eos> - "Doesn't like beef-drizzled nachos."<eos> Uh...yes, she does!
Wow, is this mood you're in because of what's going on between you and James?<eos> You always act like this when you two fight.<eos> But Jamie has always shown up for you.<eos> He ever tell you about the time these two boys jumped him?<eos> We lived in a black neighborhood.<eos> Called him all kinds of names for being white.<eos> James found those boys.<eos> Gave them what they had coming to them.<eos> They never bothered Tommy again.<eos> No one did, as a matter of fact.
Don't you see why I did it?<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Why I had to do it.<eos> Holly, get out of here.<eos> Get the fuck out of here right now!<eos> I saved both our lives, and you are gonna kick me out?<eos> After everything he said to you, you still care about him?<eos> He sent you to jail!<eos> He took away your business.<eos> Everything he did to me, to us.
- Now this one.<eos> Take a good, long look.<eos> It takes a moment to see it.<eos> See what?<eos> Superman and Clark Kent are one and the same person.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I drew specs on Superman.<eos> Everyone knows they're the same person.<eos> Well, Lois Lane doesn't.
I get it, there's some stuff you'd like to keep private.<eos> Was it the mask that tipped you off?<eos> How do you cope with your double life?<eos> I'm nothing special... everyone has a day job.<eos> Come on, you spend half your time as a regular person... I spend all my time that way...<eos> And the other half saving the world.<eos> - How do you cope?<eos> - How do you cope with a career and a baby?<eos> How do you know I have a baby?<eos> I did my research.
- How do you cope?<eos> - How do you cope with a career and a baby?<eos> How do you know I have a baby?<eos> I did my research.<eos> I have a nanny, that's basically your answer.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> - He's downstairs right now.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And, yes, I said "he".<eos> - Yes, you did.
Come and say goodbye to your brother!<eos> Freddie... hell is coming.<eos> OK?<eos> But it doesn't have to change who you are.<eos> There's dark and there's light.<eos> And you are light.<eos> Yeah. OK?<eos> That's what I love about you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You did.
With venom from her claws.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> When the poison enters your system... it makes you relive your darkest moments, the worst things you've ever done.<eos> Seizures. Pain.<eos> Until you go mad. Or die.<eos> You know, if La Llorona is here to rescue Amaru, we're in deep shit.<eos> I doubt we'll survive.<eos> You did once. Didn't you?
All right! Enough already!<eos> Maybe I haven't been clear.<eos> There's a gang of demons out there.<eos> They come straight out of hell.<eos> They killed the lords, and now, it is their aim to turn each and every one of us into top-quality shoes, boots, and purses.<eos> Do you wanna die?<eos> Or do you wanna live?<eos> If you prefer the latter, you need to check your shit at the door, and start acting like a real crew.<eos> Now, why in the fuck should we listen to you and your meat-sack brother.<eos> Don't.
Call the medevac.<eos> Oh, I wish I wasn't permanently exhausted.<eos> You've just been through a war, Dana.<eos> It's gonna take some time for things to feel normal again.<eos> Scary thing is, I don't even remember what normal feels like.<eos> We're gonna get you through this, you need to trust me.<eos> Even when you're in the dark.<eos> Even when you're falling.<eos> I trust you, sweetheart.<eos> I do.
You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Dawn.<eos> Don't let me die out here all by myself.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Reba, do you remember in third year when you got that really nasty eye infection and I had to read to you?<eos> You were doing that paper on "pride and prejudice:<eos> Gender and role reversal" "in 19th century literature."<eos> How did I even remember that, right?<eos> I do.
That thing that I think you were suggesting during our impromptu debate club this morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I, uh...<eos> I spent the day without them.<eos> And?<eos> And it didn't go off without its hiccups, but, um... I got it done.<eos> No one died.<eos> So you'll talk to Shahir?<eos> You'll book the surgery.<eos> I already did.
Is there any news?<eos> The fact that they're on the hunt for his sister means he's still alive.<eos> And if he's still alive, there's hope.<eos> One good thing about the Maria Ostrov situation is it throws a lot of cards up in the air.<eos> Dmitri could be one of 'em.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I appreciate your condolences, Madam Secretary.<eos> But they won't bring back President Ostrova, nor will they alter the fact that Ukraine abrogated the ceasefire by assassinating her.<eos> President Ostrova wanted peace.<eos> She didn't.
Well, actually, the secretary did it.<eos> No, they did it.<eos> No, I mean... we all did it.<eos> Russia, China and the U.S.?<eos> I mean, how often does that happen?<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You got to admit, we make a pretty good team.<eos> We do.
I don't have to explain myself to you, first of all.<eos> You finally killed Lobos.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> What language is that?<eos> Wait, how do you know the code?<eos> You have many questions.<eos> And tell me, which is right question to begin with?<eos> Wrong.<eos> Who are you, and do I know?<eos> Yes, I do, Jamie St. Patrick.
- I'm fine, really.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Am I the only one who doesn't know what slacklining is?<eos> It's kind of like tightrope walking, except the line's a lot less rigid and we stay pretty close to the ground.<eos> I need to have a look.<eos> Can you lift up your shirt, please?<eos> Wow.<eos> Must've been quite a fall.<eos> It didn't really hurt, no.<eos> But it does now.
You believe him?<eos> No.<eos> Not for a second.<eos> How long until imaging comes back?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
She's the only one who could see that I was in there.<eos> She... she reached inside, and she-she pulled me out of that hell, and she set me free.<eos> Yeah, I think I understand why you can't let her go.<eos> And those are the years I went completely insane, and she was there.<eos> She was the one who...<eos> She was the one who pulled me back.<eos> I don't think I can go on without her, but...<eos> I mean, the thought of taking away her happiness and holding her back... that's worse than the thought of losing her.<eos> So you don't want me to try and stop her.<eos> I did before.
- Put the gun down.<eos> If I truly have powers like you say I do, I can heal you.<eos> That's not the way to prove it.<eos> Please.<eos> You'll kill me.<eos> - It's all been a lie.<eos> - No. You helped so many people because we made them believe in you.<eos> But this is...<eos> You kept saying I had a gift.<eos> You do.
Speaking of which, the Pretend Pretenders are playing again this weekend.<eos> Uh, much like the real band, we have been described as "meh."<eos> Still, I'm really sorry.<eos> Can you find it in yourself to forgive me, and maybe we can just go back to being friends?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon and I can get my old job back.<eos> Oh, the strike ended a month ago.<eos> What?<eos> ! Why didn't you tell me? !<eos> I did.
I was gonna say less on heroin.<eos> I haven't done smack in 30 years.<eos> I even quit Honey Smacks 'cause I thought it might tempt me.<eos> Ruby, just putting it out there... if you need someone to warm up the crowd, I was in my high school's jazz choir.<eos> I sang "God Bless the Child."<eos> Well, God bless the children that had to listen to that.<eos> Well, it's gonna be very interesting, Earl.<eos> I don't think I ever remember you playing sober.<eos> You always said the junk gave you the funk.<eos> - I did?
- Ah, you made it?<eos> Bravo!<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.<eos> - I was just...<eos> - No, no.<eos> You did well to get here.<eos> I gather half the Downing Street staff didn't?<eos> It wasn't easy.<eos> Just crossing the road you take your life in your hands.<eos> Well, then don't.
Was?<eos> He rammed his car into a tree last Christmas drunk.<eos> Killed himself.<eos> Zach just started managing the team this year.<eos> Can't Coach Basinski help you with this?<eos> We don't know where he is right now.<eos> Why are you looking for him?<eos> I don't understand...<eos> you arrested Ms. Burnap.<eos> We did.
God knows what could have happened.<eos> You drugged him.<eos> I fed him.<eos> Okay, I gave him a beer, too.<eos> I wanted him to feel like a man.<eos> He has no friends, no life.<eos> You know how to pick 'em.<eos> What, the ones who need help?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- What do you mean you think so?<eos> I can't... look, she's all over the place.<eos> I don't even know why she let me back in the house.<eos> We barely talk, which is probably good because it's fewer chances I'll piss her off again.<eos> - That's pathetic.<eos> - What's her problem?<eos> - She's in a mood.<eos> I said to tell her that I needed a minute.<eos> - You didn't tell me that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
This hospital is known for making miracles happen, and I'm looking for an epic-size miracle.<eos> According to my research, it looks like you're the guy who can make it happen.<eos> I am confused about the buttholes.<eos> Strange detour.<eos> So, discuss. Or how about you humor me and let me pretend.<eos> Like I'm in charge for a sec? Now, uh, Ms. Roberts...<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Two years ago, I felt a pain in my right tibia.<eos> She's got a real mind for this stuff.<eos> They did labs, P.E.T. scan, the works.
Oh. Oh, h-honey, I...<eos> We'll need to go in a few times, but I assure you. It's the safest, best option.<eos> I figured out how to do it all on a leg and a half, and now you want to limit everything I do for my entire childhood?<eos> This is how you get. The rest of your childhood.<eos> I'm trying to save your life, Maya.<eos> Sweetheart, we should consider this.<eos> Maybe...<eos> I went to three different hospitals before I came here, and they all said the same thing.<eos> They said, "go to Grey-Sloan.<eos> Do to Dr. Karev."
On site, same as you.<eos> - You're gonna place those 16 inches apart on the ground.<eos> We're gonna build a wall on the ground?<eos> That's easier. You'll see.<eos> Did you... you grow up around here?<eos> Near here.<eos> Where'd you go to high school?<eos> Jefferson for a while.<eos> What year did you graduate?<eos> I didn't.
I mean, I always will.<eos> I...<eos> I'm scared.<eos> It's okay to be scared.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> How can I help?<eos> You can... take me swimming?<eos> - You look like...<eos> - I just walked here.<eos> Yeah, I did.
And then she told me she was gonna work for you, and that changed everything.<eos> A brilliant black woman, mentor for my baby girl, someone who could teach her what the world does to people like us... how to get down in the mud and still manage to keep her dignity.<eos> And look at what you taught her instead.<eos> Is that what you came here to tell me?<eos> I came here to tell you to fire Rachel, because she won't quit.<eos> And when they come at him to turn on you, I don't want her within 1,000 miles of this place.<eos> I'm sorry, Robert.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> And you know why.<eos> I do...
I mean, what makes you think that they're going to come to me?<eos> 'Cause you know how this works.<eos> They're gonna dig into my personal life, and when they do, they're gonna find you.<eos> And how many women like me are you paying a visit to today?<eos> There are no women like you, and you know that.<eos> What I know is, the last time you came to me,<eos> I told you I never wanted to hear Mike Ross's name again, and once again, here you are, asking me to do something for the person that destroyed our relationship.<eos> Scottie, I'm not here to argue with you.<eos> But you still want to know what I'm going to do?<eos> I do.
Okay, Louis... just because we had a fight...<eos> No, this has nothing to do with that.<eos> So you're saying that this has nothing to do with you lashing out at me because of the fight we had before?<eos> No, it doesn't, because among other things, you set your own hours, you can't take dictation, and to top all that, you can't read people for shit!<eos> What's going on?<eos> You almost went to jail for helping them once before, and I couldn't take that.<eos> And the thought of losing you once again...<eos> So you know that they need my help.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
The E.T.U.<eos> We're inside.<eos> They're using you.<eos> Carroll?<eos> Where's Regan?<eos> Where's McCarthy?<eos> What a fine and fearsome creature you are.<eos> Magnificent in every way.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Oh, but I do.
- "It"?<eos> - The poltergeist.<eos> It's in the house.<eos> So you're saying an evil spirit... pinned your husband to the wall with swords?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you didn't hear anything?<eos> I've been... taking a tonic to help me sleep.<eos> Why didn't the poltergeist kill you, too?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> I do.
How did you find me here?<eos> I remember every game you have from our work on your case.<eos> And I knew I had to find you at a place where we couldn't be bothered by anyone from Harvard.<eos> Because everyone from Harvard now knows you didn't go there.<eos> Which is why I need someone from Harvard to tell them that I did.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> No, I'm smart.<eos> All they have is an anonymous tip and no corroborating evidence.<eos> You sign this affidavit saying that I was in your class, their whole case gets dismissed.<eos> And what if it doesn't?
You haven't even looked at it.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> You're family to me, he's family to you, and you don't invest money with family.<eos> That's not what you said when Marcus needed money for his restaurant.<eos> - That's different.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because Marcus actually knew what the hell he was doing.<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> If you don't want to invest, don't invest, but I don't need a lecture from you on what a bad businessman my father is.<eos> Yes, you do.
No, see, I came to see why, when the woman that's been protecting you for so long asks you for a simple gesture of trust, you seem to think that all she's doing is protecting herself.<eos> Because she is protecting herself.<eos> You're goddamn right that's what she's doing, but that's not all she's doing, because from the second that she found out about you, she's had to lie for you, and she still treated you like family, and it cost her everything.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Until now, it didn't cost her anything.<eos> You better watch yourself.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It cost her her relationship with me!<eos> You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> Well, now you do.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> It cost her her relationship with me!<eos> You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> Well, now you do.<eos> So you'll destroy that if I give you mine?<eos> I'm an attorney. I can't destroy evidence.<eos> But you? You can do whatever you want.<eos> You trust me to do that?<eos> No, Mike.<eos> Jessica does.
- She didn't got into my head.<eos> She dangled our dream in front of me, and I know that we can't have that.<eos> It doesn't mean I can't handle this.<eos> It doesn't seem like you're handling it.<eos> - I am. I'm releasing my emotions so that I can persevere instead of denying them and losing my mind.<eos> No.<eos> Which I can't do today, because I have a meeting with the dean.<eos> Now, I came in here to be alone so I can deal with my shit, so if you don't mind, I would like to be alone so I can deal with my shit.<eos> Hey, did you find something in the discovery?<eos> Yeah, sure as hell did.
I came here once before, hoping for a second chance and you wouldn't give it to me.<eos> What does that have to do with this?<eos> Because if we'd gotten back together then,<eos> I wouldn't even be at the firm now, but I am.<eos> And it's all I have.<eos> I understand you not giving me a second chance then.<eos> But I'm begging you... give my firm one now.<eos> Louis, even if I wanted to, it won't work.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I am not going after Anita Gibbs.<eos> Scottie, I would never ask you to do something like that.<eos> That's funny, because you asked me to throw a case to keep Mike from getting caught.<eos> Throwing a case doesn't put a target on your back.<eos> If you really wanted to keep a target off my back, you never would've told me about Mike in the first place.<eos> Scottie, I didn't tell him to do that.<eos> Well, then, I guess you two are having the same problem we did: You don't talk to each other.<eos> Since you chose him over me it's not my problem anymore.<eos> I didn't chose him over you.<eos> Yes, you did.
I have no other choice.<eos> And how do I know I can trust you?<eos> - What's this?<eos> - You know what it is.<eos> It's what Daniel Hardman has on you.<eos> Now you have it too.<eos> David Green.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> So you do remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
I just came by to let you know that Jessica had to go out, so the trial is done for the rest of the day.<eos> And Harvey wasn't gonna tell me because he's playing dirty.<eos> He's not your enemy, Mike.<eos> He's just doing what he thinks is best.<eos> Then I'm gonna do what I think is best.<eos> And what exactly is that?<eos> Donna, he may not be my enemy, and you may not be my enemy, but as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson, I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.
Objection.<eos> We just went over this.<eos> When spousal privilege is invoked in the moment, prosecution has the right to challenge the validity of the marriage.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> - Objection overruled.<eos> Ms. Zane, take the stand.<eos> We can skip swearing her in since she's just gonna lie about it, anyway.<eos> Objection!<eos> Ms. Zane, if you got married six weeks after dating the defendant, why are you engaged to him right now?<eos> Because we did it on a whim.
You think she bought that?<eos> I don't care if she bought it or not.<eos> I wasn't bluffing.<eos> And you and Mike better figure out what the hell you're going to do because the trial starts tomorrow.<eos> What a coincidence running into you here twice in one week.<eos> You can skip trying to cheer me up, because it's not gonna work.<eos> - Rachel...<eos> - I don't want to hear it.<eos> He humiliated me in front of the entire firm.<eos> Yeah, he did.
But you weren't sure if Mike could handle this or not.<eos> And at least now, if he can't, you won't have to be the one to tell him.<eos> That is so easy for you to say, because you have no idea what it felt like to go through that.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I know exactly what it feels like.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Try to imagine how he treated me when I left him for Louis.<eos> Maybe you do know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Your Honor.<eos> Let me rephrase.<eos> Is Ms. Griffith going to be perjuring herself or are you?<eos> Yeah, I was jealous of him.<eos> And if he lied about all of that, what's to make us believe that he wasn't lying about everything else?<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?
Your Honor, prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?<eos> If you lie, they'll never know.<eos> Ms. Paulsen, it's my understanding that you arranged Mr. Specter's interviews for the position currently filled by Michael Ross.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I assisted in the process, yes.<eos> Did you find it suspicious that Mr. Ross wasn't listed on the Harvard class ranking from his first year?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Defense would like to call Jimmy Kirkwood to the stand.<eos> Objection.<eos> His name was not on the witness list.<eos> Rebuttal witness.<eos> She just said we can't produce someone who places Mike at Harvard, and I say we can.<eos> Your Honor...<eos> Mr. Specter is within his rights.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood can take the stand.<eos> How did you know he'd testify?<eos> I didn't until just now.
Mike Ross... Is a fraud.<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike.<eos> She was good, Harvey.<eos> - Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
I don't have to give you anything.<eos> You're not his attorney.<eos> Mr. Diaz, my name is Mike Ross.<eos> Now, do you want me to represent you or do you want to stick with this asshole Perkins who didn't even show up to your hearing?<eos> He's my lawyer.<eos> Donna, I need your help and I need it right now.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is the jury back?<eos> No, I need to know if Stephanie Liston still works<eos> - at the U .S. Attorney's Office. - She does, why?
I'm not having this conversation - behind Harvey's back.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I already had it to his face.<eos> Tried to get him to do the right thing and turn himself in, but he wouldn't.<eos> I'm not going to convince him to do that.<eos> I know, because he'll never be convinced.<eos> Which is why we need to go to Gibbs together...<eos> - Goddamn it, Jessica, we don't have any time!<eos> Did it ever occur to you that if Mike gets found guilty, the first thing Harvey is going to do is walk in there and take the bullet for me and you?<eos> - No, it didn't.
You didn't plead anything.<eos> Harvey, look at me.<eos> It was my crime.<eos> It was my choice to make, and I made it.<eos> It's done.<eos> Well, I'm gonna unmake it, because the judge hasn't ratified it yet, and until she does, nothing is done.<eos> Harvey, stop.<eos> No, you listen to me.<eos> If you think I'm gonna let you do this, you're out of your goddamn mind.<eos> Do what, Mike?
Losing my firm.<eos> Now that Mike pled guilty, every case he ever touched has "lawsuit" written all over it.<eos> So what are we gonna do?<eos> I'll tell you what we're going to do.<eos> We're gonna restructure this firm, and we're gonna do it before the lawsuits even start.<eos> Get me Louis.<eos> Michael.<eos> Gloria, what are you doing here?<eos> I came here to be with you for the verdict, but they told me you made a deal.<eos> I did.
What?<eos> I went to see the foreman.<eos> The verdict was gonna be not guilty.<eos> Then let me see your deal with Gibbs.<eos> I don't have it yet.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You're asking me to decimate my firm for a deal you don't even know she'll take?<eos> - I'll make her take the deal.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.

I don't know who told you that, but, uh, I didn't lobby Cooper to get your job back, because I didn't believe that you should've gotten it back.<eos> I see.<eos> I mean, look, it's nothing personal, but with Reddington being such a wild card, the rest of us need to know where we stand.<eos> I'm not so sure I know with you.<eos> Okay, well, it's nothing personal, but... you sucked in bed.<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> The job fell through.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you already had it.<eos> I did.
What you're proposing requires trust.<eos> We have none.<eos> None of my clients do, which is why you, like all my clients, must swear to uphold and enforce not only this merger, but all mergers brokered with my assistance.<eos> Here is my client list.<eos> They are powerful and well-armed.<eos> Should either of you betray the other, they will destroy your families.<eos> You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.

That's great.<eos> After everything you've been through, I'm happy you found your way back to each other.<eos> I know from my own personal experience... That's not an easy thing to do.<eos> I'm so sorry about what's happening with you and Charlene.<eos> Forget about that.<eos> You're getting married!<eos> It's crazy.<eos> I just wish...<eos> Despite everything she's put me through, I wish my mom could be there.<eos> Of course you do.
Apologize to Agent Navabi.<eos> What?<eos> Aram, we don't have time for this.<eos> We have 30 seconds.<eos> "I'm sorry" takes less than one.<eos> 28 seconds.<eos> Look, I'm not sorry for firing her.<eos> You called her the "B" word.<eos> I didn't call her a bitch.<eos> Actually, you did.
Yes.<eos> Irina Velov?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is for you.<eos> It's from your father.<eos> He told me you're estranged.<eos> And my name is Elizabeth, by the way.<eos> He couldn't find you, so...<eos> Anyway, he says it explains everything.<eos> Yes, it does.
Stalder told Ressler and Navabi he never left his suite.<eos> Was he lying or did he just forget?<eos> Well, that doesn't look like a woman... or a conversation... he'd have forgotten.<eos> Who is she?<eos> I don't know. And we can't ask Stalder.<eos> I checked.<eos> He just cleared U.S. airspace.<eos> They're onto the 11th floor. Go.<eos> 15 seconds and counting.<eos> All right, do a full vertical sweep.
- No. - Did you ever discuss FBI work outside this office with Ms. Knight?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Are you a Russian operative?<eos> No.<eos> Is Ms. Knight a Russian operative?<eos> No.<eos> Are you currently romantically involved with any other co-worker or subordinate, Agent Weller?<eos> No.<eos> So... do you have any theories on who it is?<eos> Do you?
So the Russian diplomats tattooed her, wiped her memory, and dropped her in Times Square to help them smuggle?<eos> She hasn't been with us long enough to be useful to them.<eos> She doesn't have any access to the intel they'd need.<eos> Her tattoos led us to the Russians!<eos> They're solving crimes, not enabling them.<eos> Jane is not the mole.<eos> Then why did Roman ID her?<eos> You're a Russian counterintelligence agent.<eos> You've had years to bust this spy ring.<eos> You didn't, why?
It wasn't your fault.<eos> But I couldn't stop them.<eos> I understand.<eos> My darling... .. the years have been kinder to you than they have been to me.<eos> It's been an eternity.<eos> Just... just to see your face.<eos> You were there with me, the whole time.<eos> In the pouring deluge, in those brooding mountains... .. you were there the whole time.<eos> I, uh... I don't know how to stop this.<eos> Fortunately, I do.
Old man would walk through fire for you.<eos> But, if you're okay, I have a much needed cocktail waiting for me at home.<eos> - What's he doing here?<eos> - You want to keep driving?<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Go home.<eos> You sure?<eos> I can lay on the horn till the neighbors come down.<eos> Is that something you learned in your women's self-defense class?<eos> Yeah, Mel did.
No.<eos> No, I hit traffic on my way up.<eos> By the time I got there, they were closed, and I had to turn around empty-handed.<eos> Thought Ellen would be pissed, but if you're asking me for an alibi, you must really have no idea who did this.<eos> We were wondering how you felt about the pregnancy.<eos> The what?<eos> Your wife was almost two months pregnant, Mr. Jacobs, despite her tubal ligation.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Putting Warren Clift in the center?<eos> He put himself in the center when he didn't use a condom with Ellen Jacobs.<eos> You don't agree?<eos> Well, he seemed genuinely surprised to hear about the pregnancy.<eos> Perhaps he'd begun to worry she would expose their affair.<eos> Perhaps he thought a talking dog was commanding him to offer her spirit to the gods.<eos> He didn't seem crazy to me.<eos> In my experience, a grown man who keeps a photograph of his mother on his desk at work is capable of anything.<eos> Harris Waylon Greer suffocated women with plastic bags.<eos> Someone did the same thing to his daughter.
The pregnancy was equally unplanned.<eos> Perhaps she threatened to tell your wife.<eos> No, she never said a word to me, I swear.<eos> I didn't know she was pregnant until you told me.<eos> Look, what happened to me last night can't be just a coincidence.<eos> Someone killed Ellen three nights ago, and then, last night, they tried to kill me, the guy she was sleeping with?<eos> You think it was her husband Ernie.<eos> He found out about us, he killed her, he almost killed me.<eos> You told the police you didn't see the face of the guy who attacked you.<eos> No, but do the math.
Megan...<eos> Ellen, she had her tubes tied.<eos> Then last month, she told me what had happened.<eos> She was... pregnant.<eos> She was gonna... she was gonna keep it.<eos> So you killed her?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I miss something?<eos> You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.
You work with us, earn your freedom.<eos> Help us bring down the people who put you here.<eos> We've been watching you since you were found in Times Square, but we're missing some pieces.<eos> When did the operative known as Oscar first approach you?<eos> After Tom Carter kidnapped me.<eos> He abducted me and tortured me.<eos> Oscar killed Carter and rescued me.<eos> He showed me a video.<eos> It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.

Yeah.<eos> Tay.<eos> You sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> 2113 Squad... [exhales sharply] Hey.<eos> How's everything going?<eos> Good.<eos> You can talk to me about anything.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I think you're lying to cover your ass.<eos> What?<eos> Huh.<eos> Who the hell are you to talk to me like that?<eos> You let his sister think she was looking at ten years and a felony charge on a dime bag.<eos> And you let Evan step into her shoes.<eos> I'm gonna talk to you however the hell I want to talk to you.<eos> You flip the minnows to get to the sharks.<eos> Do you even know how Narcotics works?<eos> - Actually, I do.
With you?<eos> On the sofa.<eos> I know you have a lot on your plate right now, and you don't need...<eos> - This is John we're talking about.<eos> - My hands are tied.<eos> We're just gonna have to let it play out.<eos> The man takes a spider outside.<eos> How can he be capable...<eos> All due respect I'm not sure you know what he's capable of.<eos> Oh, but you do?
Do you understand what you've done?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How could you possibly think...<eos> I thought I could make it better.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I thought if I could just... if I could just bring him back...<eos> - God...<eos> - And I did.
I don't know.<eos> How could you possibly think...<eos> I thought I could make it better.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I thought if I could just... if I could just bring him back...<eos> - God...<eos> - And I did.<eos> And I did...
I love you, mom.<eos> I don't believe that, either!<eos> Mom...<eos> He was with him!<eos> For 10 years, he was there!<eos> Do you think that matters?<eos> He helped him.<eos> He knew him!<eos> He... he... he...<eos> Everything about him, more than we ever did!
What are you doing?<eos> Calling Social Services.<eos> He was 8 or 9.<eos> He ran off one day and disappeared.<eos> There's no report on him.<eos> I didn't want to lose my license.<eos> Even if I had reported it, it wouldn't have mattered.<eos> There's very little follow-up in the system.<eos> You know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Let's give Adam a chance to answer.<eos> She was there.<eos> I-I remember her.<eos> What about this one?<eos> Do you recognize him?<eos> Adam?<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Let Adam answer the question.<eos> He clearly doesn't know him.<eos> - Do you?
You didn't know, did you?<eos> You had no idea who he was.<eos> You were just trying to protect him.<eos> It's what anybody would do for someone they love.<eos> There was a boy 12 years ago... where we used to live.<eos> He swore he didn't do it, and I believed him.<eos> What was the boy's name?<eos> Eric.<eos> Monsters don't remember names.<eos> Girl Scouts do.
Ravioli, corn, and a few protein shakes.<eos> Um, I'll open it up so you can get to it all real easy.<eos> Where's your monster taking you?<eos> Canada.<eos> Romantic.<eos> Once we're there, I'll call the police.<eos> I will let them know where to find you.<eos> I'll be nice and dead by then.<eos> I don't want to go with him.<eos> Then don't.
No.<eos> That was Adam.<eos> My name is Ben.<eos> We've got a winner.<eos> Mom?<eos> I have to go now.<eos> No.<eos> I have to.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't.
What's the offer, Willa?<eos> Unprecedented access to the Governor's mansion.<eos> First dibs on anything and everything, exclusives.<eos> You will be the boss of us until the end of time.<eos> Why would you ever do that?<eos> What?<eos> Give up control when it's the one thing that makes you happy?<eos> Desperate times.<eos> I'd own you.<eos> You already do.
- Oh.<eos> I never knew how it all worked.<eos> Did he make you wear them a lot?<eos> What?<eos> The bracelets.<eos> Not at first.<eos> When did it start?<eos> When we were older.<eos> When we started fighting back.<eos> And he did that to Adam, too?
When I was 10 years old, I had heart surgery.<eos> Kirsten: My father stitching me into my mother killed her.<eos> Cameron?<eos> I see Barbiero.<eos> He's on a call with a woman.<eos> You're using me to send a message to the girl?<eos> Kirsten: He was told things that I was meant to hear and then he was killed.<eos> Black Sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.
No!<eos> Please!<eos> (sobs) Please!<eos> Cameron!<eos> No.<eos> Cameron? Cameron?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Please... tell me you got the license plate number.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I barely survived having one mother.<eos> I don't need another one.<eos> I think I'm beginning to miss the old Cameron.<eos> What is that?<eos> Something big was bolted down here.<eos> - Do you feel that?<eos> - What?<eos> Come in.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
What the hell is this place?<eos> I was hoping one of you could tell me.<eos> - That's...<eos> - Ed Clark.<eos> Turner's had him here right under our noses since his murder.<eos> Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
I smell incense again.<eos> Done!<eos> I didn't see the killer.<eos> But I did smell incense again just like in Turner's memory.<eos> Whoever killed Ed also killed Turner.<eos> I'm gonna increase security.<eos> You're not going anywhere without an armed detail.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't get to tell me...<eos> Yes, I do.
Noted.<eos> Noted.<eos> Miss Baptiste, you are a legend at the agency.<eos> And you, Mr. Blair, are an unknown.<eos> Your reputation for plain talks is not for nothing.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> For?<eos> Effective immediately, you're promoted to acting director of the Stitchers Program.<eos> Not sure I want the job.<eos> Sure you do.
I don't care for it.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, speak of the devil.<eos> We were just talking about you.<eos> Good things, I hope.<eos> Ah, no.<eos> Not really.<eos> This is like that Star Trek episode where Kirk and the Romulan Commander battle each other but in the end develop a deep, mutual respect.<eos> Ah, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> -I do.
- It was the medicine!<eos> - Which showed you the truth. Which is why you contacted me.<eos> No, no, see, it was the dark...<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Tempting me away. There is no dark!<eos> No dark!<eos> No light! There is only us.<eos> There is no us!<eos> Okay?<eos> Don't... No us!
All we can do is wait.<eos> Boys. What did I tell you about forgetting to close this door?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - We forgot.<eos> Your Xbox come up missing, don't come crying to me.<eos> I'm here!<eos> LAURA: They're fed and ready to go.<eos> Where the hell is the laundry fairy when you need him?<eos> NICHOLAS: Mom. You forgot to sign our permission slip.<eos> Of course I did.
And it all went to hell.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> - Your dad, too?<eos> - He was the smartest, funniest man I knew.<eos> And then I found out he was embezzling from his clients to pay off gambling debts.<eos> I didn't know if I'd ever forgive him.<eos> - But you did.<eos> - It took time.<eos> A lot.<eos> - But I did.
Well, the last time I saw him, he'd started drinking again and he was in a pretty dark place.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You think that Zach shot Walt and kidnapped Dr. Monaghan?<eos> My belt.<eos> What do you think, Walt?<eos> Well... I don't know.<eos> I don't remember the actual...<eos> actual event.<eos> - Well, then you don't know...<eos> - I don't!
I double-crossed Mommy, too.<eos> What?<eos> [groans] 45 minutes in line to ride a plastic pig that smells like pee?<eos> I take it back.<eos> Picking up trash would've been better than this.<eos> No, it's fine, it's fine.<eos> 45 minutes is not that long to wait.<eos> [groaning]<eos> If it's your life story, and... and you looked like a beaver...<eos> I did.
- Mm-hmm. - That is weird.<eos> I mean, they are my illustrations, so, um...<eos> Right.<eos> They are your illustrations, but it's my life story.<eos> I got my adult teeth when I was six years old.<eos> I looked like a beaver.<eos> Everyone made fun of me, but my mom told me to be proud and show everyone what me and my big teeth could do.<eos> If it's your life story, and... and you looked<eos> - like a beaver...<eos> - I did.
It underscores the importance of the president's efforts to destroy this evil before it infects Abuddin...<eos> He's exploiting this.<eos> The sheik's supporters won't listen to Bassam.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Maybe not all of them. And maybe not right now.<eos> But without... without Al-Qadi, it's only a matter of time before our coalition falls apart.<eos> There are only so many blows you can take before you're done.<eos> I think I'm done.<eos> You knew I'd come, didn't you?<eos> Of course I did.
No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> You killed me.<eos> You killed me.<eos> You killed me.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> It's nice out here.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> You know what today is?<eos> Or... would have been?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm not asking you to love me.<eos> I'm asking you to provide me with a child.<eos> It's a physical act, that's all.<eos> There is no way...<eos> You owe me this.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> You could've let me die.<eos> You should've let me die, but you chose me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
How did you know of this place?<eos> Brave FBI man, huh?<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> You don't answer, they pay.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> Is there anyone else with you?<eos> What do you know about our mission, hmm?<eos> Who knows you're here, huh? !<eos> You do.
Already working on it.<eos> We're getting dangerously close to 60,000 feet.<eos> We got to do something.<eos> All right.<eos> One shot in the fuel tank.<eos> That'll cause an explosion big enough to bring this plane down.<eos> Jane... I'm sorry that I brought you here, all right?<eos> I chose this life, you didn't.<eos> You never had a choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm... I'm... you know...<eos> I'm so sorry, Kurt.<eos> I'm so...<eos> Ah, God.<eos> Good work.<eos> How do you know it's hers?<eos> If they were really the same...<eos> I know.<eos> And I know why you gave me this mission.<eos> You do?
- I mean, he...<eos> - No.<eos> - Like, he doesn't...<eos> - It's not about Kurt.<eos> You don't know me, and...<eos> I've got issues.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I know you.<eos> - And I know that you love me, too.<eos> - No, I don't.
Then why did you lie?<eos> About where you were.<eos> Why did you...<eos> Because I was trying to kill myself!<eos> Stop looking into Tom Carter's disappearance, or people you love will start to die.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't feel the same way.<eos> - I know that you love me.<eos> - No... I don't.
Trying to stop him from killing anyone else.<eos> We're on our way to Owen's apartment.<eos> It looks like the Lyman brothers have three other properties.<eos> Got locations?<eos> Patrick owns places in Boston and Providence, and they own 30 acres on Long Island.<eos> They share a cabin out there.<eos> Owen's student was found outside in a field.<eos> These guys never change their M.O.'s.<eos> Send us the cabin address.<eos> Just did.
Now let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - Let's get a little music going.<eos> - Ah, I'm the DJ.<eos> A parachute?<eos> We think it was built into his tux.<eos> We searched his belongings for... explosives and computer equipment.<eos> We weren't looking for hidden parachutes.<eos> Rich was the one decoding Ahktar's Squancher messages, so he lied about the Gatsby party so he could wear it.<eos> Yeah, but how'd he know we'd bring his entire storage locker to him?<eos> He didn't.
Hey.<eos> Dad.<eos> What are you doing here so late?<eos> Someone wanted to come in and say hello to you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Taylor?<eos> It's you, isn't it?<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Don't you remember me?<eos> Of course I do.
- In a bit of pain?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just rest.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just rest.<eos> Did you remember him?<eos> Were you just saying that?<eos> Did we, uh...<eos> Did we used to go fishing... on a bridge over a stream?<eos> Yeah... we did.
Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Yeah, I'm fresh out.<eos> God, I must have something in here.<eos> Come on, Kristin, pull yourself together, pull yourself together... - Kristin, I think I just heard you say? - Yeah.<eos> - It's just a drill.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know what else started as just a drill?<eos> No.<eos> Well, neither do I.
I guess, uh...<eos> I'd like to run a division one day, like you.<eos> Be careful what you wish for.<eos> Early on in my career, someone powerful approached me, asking for help.<eos> It was a big career opportunity.<eos> What he was asking me to do was... morally ambiguous at best.<eos> I went along.<eos> Told myself that it was for the greater good, but in my gut, I knew that was a lie.<eos> Didn't sleep well back then.<eos> Still don't.
What have I done?<eos> Well, we're gonna need to rain-check our feelings, 'cause we got to get out of here.<eos> That's a trip wire.<eos> If that door opens, everything blows.<eos> We're not supposed to be seen... In public together?<eos> What does it matter if you're walking away?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I asked Coombs to show me how to use the Cellphone Trace Protocol program in case you were ever late for a swap.<eos> You didn't tell her where I am, did you?<eos> I didn't.
I'm forgetting you ever existed, which is convenient, since that's what the FBI will be doing, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey. You good?<eos> Yeah, I just can't believe all this is over.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I start at the D.C. field office tomorrow.<eos> Oh, so it's like your graduation, too.<eos> Well, I better get up there, or nobody's going anywhere.<eos> And here I thought you didn't want me to make it to this day.<eos> I didn't.
They kept calling and asking me to do more... gather information on train routes to Penn Station and Grand Central, scout CCTVs around the city.<eos> I had no idea what they were up to.<eos> And then, the first attack happened, and I saw you on the news.<eos> I felt horrible, Alex.<eos> Why didn't you turn yourself in?<eos> To who?<eos> The FBI?<eos> I knew whoever was doing this was inside the Bureau.<eos> That doesn't mean it was Ryan.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I never told anybody that until now.<eos> You just took the blame, huh?<eos> Liam's career was already hanging by a thread.<eos> If they had pinned that on him, it would have been over.<eos> He'd been good to me.<eos> Do you regret it...<eos> Sacrificing your career for his?<eos> I mean, you're stuck here at Quantico while Kent is on track to becoming Assistant Director.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did for a while.
I met you.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's the end of the day.<eos> I'm ready for dinner.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Uh, let me just close down shop.<eos> Ah, you must be...<eos> Raina.<eos> When you introduced yourself earlier, I... I knew you had figured out it was me.<eos> Yes, I did.
If I move to Europe,<eos> - I can live in the same city as...<eos> - You can't quit.<eos> I knew you were gonna say that.<eos> They lied to you.<eos> Yeah, they did, but they're not anymore.<eos> They only met up with you for one final cash infusion before disappearing for good.<eos> Caleb was too afraid to tell you.<eos> Caleb said that?<eos> Yeah, of course he did.
Wait, the guy with the gun is a cop?<eos> I'm not going to jail for Melanie!<eos> This is not her fault, man.<eos> Well, good luck telling that Danny guy when he shows up at your door.<eos> Not to mention whatever Eric's gonna say when he...<eos> Hey, no. We cannot tell Eric.<eos> There is no "we".<eos> You have to tell him.<eos> My best friend thinks I killed his wife.<eos> No, no, no, he doesn't.
_<eos> _<eos> Give us a moment?<eos> Did you get in contact with the courier?<eos> We have a date.<eos> And that will tell you what, exactly?<eos> I'll find out tonight.<eos> Time isn't on our side.<eos> You find Shaw, you come home in garlands.<eos> And if I don't?
Nothing like a grilled cheese nap.<eos> I don't want you flying around in a little plane, either.<eos> Well, it's kind of my life's dream, but if you want me to stop, I'll do it for you.<eos> I had a bad dream last night.<eos> I think that this retirement thing - is making me very scared. ‭<eos> Join the club.<eos> Just not my country club.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> Killian, we're here to help you. We just can't find you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> In an underground prison.<eos> - The Underworld.<eos> - I'll only be gone for a day.<eos> - Come back to me.<eos> - I always do.
Can you see anything?<eos> Yes, wonderful things.<eos> Where's the coffin?<eos> My God!<eos> There's more.<eos> This is just the antechamber.<eos> This is the burial chamber.<eos> The seals are still in tact.<eos> You found something wonderful.<eos> Yes, we did.
Good day, sir.<eos> Carter.<eos> Mace says that moisture may be damaging items in the burial chamber.<eos> Well, I haven't been back to the tomb, but yes, I should think.<eos> What can be done about it?<eos> Well, the first thing would be to get them clear of the confined space. Out into the dry air.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
If I'm hearing you right, there's going to be another Power Rangers movie?<eos> The real headline is that I still don't believe Wyatt's guilty.<eos> I mean, he comes across as so genuinely innocent.<eos> If he were guilty, it would be the performance of a life time.<eos> Wait till you see what the computer lab boys found on Jordan's hard drive.<eos> Oh, when's your call time?<eos> 6:00.<eos> I'm first up with Kell.<eos> Aw, we missed the good stuff.<eos> No, you didn't.
Yeah, I... glanced at it.<eos> Her and Cosima are obsessed with this Brightborn IVF/Neolution connection.<eos> Yeah, but that Evie Cho, she was on the board of Dyad.<eos> Oi. "GeneConnexion."<eos> That's the company Felix used to find his bio sister.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it?<eos> They're owned by Brightborn?<eos> I knew there was something about Adele.<eos> No, no, you don't.
Oh, lord and butter, Donnie.<eos> Stop chewing the scenery.<eos> What the bloody hell are you doing?<eos> - I'm playing the part, darling.<eos> - No, darling,<eos> - you're mincing.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> Donnie, do you have any gay friends?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Holy shit.<eos> Sarah, talk some sense into her, please.<eos> What are you doing, Mika?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> - There's a bomb under my chair.<eos> You can't do this. I need him.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to Niki.<eos> I know, alright?<eos> I know about Helsinki.<eos> Did Beth?
You raised a CASTOR clone instead.<eos> Please be kind to Ira.<eos> CASTOR was never completely under my control, to be raised homogeneously like that.<eos> I wanted him to be different.<eos> And me?<eos> Raised by Aldous Leekie. Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside...<eos> Helsinki?<eos> You weren't supposed to know about Helsinki.<eos> Well, I do.
Then we can't just accept this.<eos> We may have been raised without familial bonds, but you, Ira, are my brother. And I'm beginning to believe that means something.<eos> You just stood without your crutches, and your aphasia completely cleared.<eos> Apparently passion helps.<eos> No coffee, but I made chai.<eos> You still feeling it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't had a two-day hangover in a long time.<eos> How are you?<eos> I almost did something desperate.
And the people I work for would be more than happy to let you and your family live your lives.<eos> But what do they want?<eos> I think you know.<eos> We all know who the real fly in the ointment here is.<eos> I don't know why they don't just leave Sarah alone.<eos> She's not a threat to Neolution.<eos> Not my call.<eos> I just need to find her.<eos> Well, I don't know where she is.<eos> I don't.
Where would you find Sarah?<eos> The location.<eos> And I'm gonna get back in touch with you real soon.<eos> Son of a biscuit!<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Alison?<eos> Are you, uh... You all right?<eos> - Let me... Let me help you with this.<eos> - I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.<eos> Oh, well, I do.
We're back on top, Susan.<eos> We hope.<eos> The board will make its recommendations.<eos> Recommendations to whom?<eos> I will see you in the morning.<eos> Took me a while to realize what the cell regeneration rates mean to you.<eos> You knew this was on the table, Cosima.<eos> It was there when you gave us Kendall's cancer cells.<eos> You don't even care about a cure, do you?<eos> Of course I do!
I-I can do that.<eos> That's it.<eos> You want some of this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you can't have it! (whoops)<eos> And we all looked at each other, and we just smiled.<eos> Wow!<eos> Was that too loud?<eos> I do not usually drink.<eos> (singsongy): But I do now!
Gus and I got married after a crazy, intense sex bender.<eos> Pretty sure I didn't need to know that part.<eos> This time's gonna be different.<eos> But, look, if you want all the wedding hoopla, you got it.<eos> But... our marriage is gonna be different than the other one.<eos> Because it's us.<eos> Did you say all that just 'cause you want to get laid?<eos> No.<eos> No, but, uh... did it improve my chances?<eos> - Yes, it did. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm!
Zoe's murder presented us with a bit of a puzzle.<eos> How did one of you manage to kill her when you each had an alibi?<eos> Nelson helping Sadie, Eloise on the phone to her agent,<eos> Rosey on the catwalk, Jay taking photographs.<eos> At one point, we thought it could've been Zoe's stalker, but something about that didn't quite ring true.<eos> - So, who did it?<eos> - Well, it could have been you.<eos> A charge for assault on file, anger issues, Zoe had a bad attitude and didn't show you the respect you think you deserved.<eos> - But that doesn't make me a murderer.<eos> - No. No, it doesn't.
Someone who loved her.<eos> Over 500 photographs, one of them conveniently catching the killer in action, giving you the perfect alibi.<eos> I assume that was planned, Jay.<eos> That you wanted us to find it.<eos> It's rather audacious, really.<eos> This... .. is the photograph we enlarged, only to discover that within it was the image of Zoe's actual murder taking place.<eos> The other ten or so images are the ones that were taken around it, and there was something about them that bothered me, something that I couldn't quite get my head round, and then it hit me -- they were all framed identically.<eos> The angle didn't change once.<eos> And you presumed we'd never notice.<eos> But unfortunately for you, we did.
My father was one of 'em.<eos> But E-Ezekiel... he's a lot more careful now.<eos> He told me that it, uh, well...<eos> He, uh, told me he was keeping his deal with that group quiet 'cause he thinks the people would want to fight.<eos> He says that even if we did, we wouldn't win... at least, not without losing people... maybe a lot of 'em.<eos> And you think he's right... that we shouldn't fight?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean... I don't know if I know enough to know.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Maybe you do.
It was handwritten... about not killing.<eos> - Is it yours?<eos> - It's not, no.<eos> 'Cause I also noticed you only put vegetables on your plate during dinner.<eos> And, I mean, you're teaching me aikido, and if aikido means not to kill, then that means that you're...<eos> It's not about what I think.<eos> People can... They can try and set you in the right direction, but they can't show you the way.<eos> You know, you got to find that for yourself, and...<eos> I thought I had it.<eos> I did.
[Snorts] How's that?<eos> 10 more minutes, and I might start to regret all the times I tried to shoot and stab you.<eos> I think you're my favorite person I ever knocked out.<eos> Definitely top two or three.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Do you promise?<eos> Always watching, always ready, remember?<eos> I do.
His name was Shane.<eos> Well, him and Lori... they were together.<eos> They thought I was dead.<eos> I know Judith isn't mine.<eos> I know it.<eos> I love her.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> But she isn't mine.<eos> I had to accept that.<eos> I did.
Why you acting like you don't know that?<eos> I'm not sure that means much to me anymore.<eos> What we did at the satellite station... all of those people that we killed...<eos> You didn't see it, okay?<eos> You just saw what was left.<eos> No.<eos> I had to do it, too.<eos> Yeah, we all had to... for some milk and some corn.<eos> That wasn't the only reason.<eos> And yeah, we did.
We were trying to get away from them, and I got knocked off a bridge.<eos> I fought the current, wound up in the inlet.<eos> The estuary?<eos> The bay?<eos> Look, I'm not good with geography.<eos> I just thought I was dead out there.<eos> And I got to the shore, and I just passed out.<eos> It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.
Yeah, a lot.<eos> I'll use the cars as cover until I can't anymore.<eos> Then what?<eos> I'll run.<eos> I love to run.<eos> It's my favorite thing.<eos> You'll never make it.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You already did.
Hell, I'll put you all on the same job.<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> I'll stay.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> You know what that means, right?<eos> You know what that means, right?<eos> Ye... Yes.<eos> I love you, Negan.<eos> Oh, of course you do, darlin'.
But it's settled... we're square.<eos> Everything is cool.<eos> Let Mark's face be a daily reminder to him and to everyone else that the rules matter.<eos> I hope that we all learned something today, because I don't ever... want to have to do that again.<eos> Some crazy shit, huh?<eos> You probably think I'm a lunatic.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go figure out what to do with you.<eos> I didn't want to come back here.<eos> I don't...
That's good to know, baby.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Mm. Wow, you smell fantastic.<eos> I'm in a situation.<eos> Svetlana.<eos> We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
Thank you, Frank.<eos> What'd you name your sports bar in Florida?<eos> Well, I-I decided to keep it humble.<eos> I called it The Hero's Den.<eos> And what did you use as the logo?<eos> Well, the picture of me and the baby.<eos> Iconic. You know, somebody really should write all this down.<eos> Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.

Nah, he wasn't much of a drinker.<eos> Could have been working a case, then?<eos> The other Vic was a young woman, Jenny Egan.<eos> She was with McQueen at the bar.<eos> You think he was having an affair?<eos> I guess anything's possible, but... he's in Park Slope with his wife and kids.<eos> Seems pretty happy to me.<eos> Yeah, I was out at the house last week.<eos> He worships the ground his wife walks on.<eos> At least he did.
You have rights, Frank.<eos> You never gave consent, you never sat down for an on-the-record interview.<eos> They're portraying you as the lead actor in stories that are all but impossible to fact-check.<eos> He's my friend.<eos> He was my partner.<eos> I do not want to go all legal on him.<eos> And I hope you don't have to.<eos> Hopefully, he'll listen to reason.<eos> You don't know Lenny.<eos> No. I don't.
Waiter.<eos> I need a refill on my marg.<eos> I am not the waiter. I'm a manager.<eos> And you know my name is Jake.<eos> I'd be happy to send a waiter over for you, though.<eos> I want it from you. No one else makes them right.<eos> I'm sorry, Ally.<eos> I mean, Miss...<eos> You know my husband's on the board of this club.<eos> - Of course I do.
- You're out here.<eos> - Yeah, I'm going.<eos> My champers!<eos> Sully!<eos> Good night, Roundelay! Whoo!<eos> Do you want to go after Matty?<eos> See if he's okay?<eos> There was no part of me that wanted to follow Matty McKibben.<eos> For the first time, I didn't feel anything for him... not love, not hate, just indifference.<eos> No, I don't.
Would you please just read the whole thing?<eos> I'm done talking about this and I'm done with you.<eos> He's never gonna forgive me.<eos> Then he's an idiot.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Maybe I'm the idiot.<eos> Luke, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just... it's something I have to do.<eos> If you don't want to wait...<eos> I don't.
Hey.<eos> You made a deal?<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> It's a year's license suspension...<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Five years probation,<eos> - $14 million in resti... - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
It was two doctors striking up a conversation.<eos> Where did this conversation take place?<eos> - In a coffee shop.<eos> - Near your house? - No.<eos> - Your office?<eos> - No.<eos> - In fact, it was 8 miles from either of those places.<eos> Didn't measure.<eos> Do you know how many coffee shops are between your house or office and there?<eos> I don't.
Improper opinion.<eos> Sustained.<eos> What about any other witnesses who...<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Yes, Ms. Shelby, move on.<eos> Your Honor, someone has to speak for these victims.<eos> You don't speak.<eos> You ask questions.<eos> And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.
We got a mission.<eos> I don't care how long it takes, I'm not abandoning my post until the CO tells me to.<eos> What mission?<eos> What mission?<eos> Sleeping Beauty!<eos> Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing.<eos> How are we gonna protect her if we're dead?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Well, it sounds like you already got one.<eos> I do.
Previously on "Van Helsing..."<eos> It was murder.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Can I help you?<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> That's none of your business, Pal.<eos> Ok.<eos> How's Roger doing?<eos> I put him under to ease the pain,<eos> But when he wakes up he's on his own.<eos> It's gonna hurt like hell, But we can't spare any more analgesic.<eos> I understand.<eos> Really, do you?
The blood bank or whatever it is.<eos> Well you ought to teach her to read because I put a sign on the door that clearly says "keep out".<eos> You asshole!<eos> I got this.<eos> I'm gonna need a list of every gadget you've stashed around this place.<eos> Why would I do something stupid like that?<eos> Because that's the only way a group of people trying to live here can safely go about their daily lives.<eos> That is why.<eos> You got a pencil?<eos> I do.
Hey!<eos> Do you like how it feels?<eos> Do you like it? !<eos> Brendan!<eos> Do you like that?<eos> Do you want some?<eos> ! Somebody help us!<eos> Do you like how that feels?<eos> !<eos> Do you?
Nicole!<eos> Let her go, let her go!<eos> Anybody that wants to live, follow me.<eos> You think you got a better idea?<eos> You do whatever you want.<eos> What, are we just gonna leave her here?<eos> Keep advancing.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Well they still have to make it through the UV lights and there's no way that's gonna happen.<eos> And if they do, then what?
Look, it's pretty simple, ok?<eos> If we make it to the base and it's still up and running I might not make it out alive.<eos> Who knows what they wanted me for before you got stuck with me?<eos> Hell if I know.<eos> It's gotta be a cure though, right?<eos> I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive.<eos> And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth.<eos> Axel.<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh... it's nothing.<eos> Dead body run.<eos> Don't worry about it. I got it.<eos> So Susan, huh?<eos> We're friends.<eos> Special friends, it looks like.<eos> You wish.<eos> Yeah, kinda do.
They took me.<eos> They tortured me.<eos> So why didn't they hurt her?<eos> I would never tell them anything.<eos> No matter what they did to me.<eos> It's her...<eos> Sheema!<eos> She's the one...!<eos> I would do anything for the cause. You know that.<eos> I do now.
I'll be up in the morning back assuming I don't blow my brains out tonight.<eos> I have an empty bottle of JD and there's clip left in my 45.<eos> I hope the night's better to you.<eos> Pray for sun.<eos> Gordo out.<eos> Look at you, man!<eos> Lookin' good.<eos> You got change?<eos> Feels good.<eos> It does.
His disappearing place?<eos> He'd always leave.<eos> I liked it when he was gone, even though he never left much food.<eos> Do you know where the disappearing place is?<eos> I didn't get to go. He only took Violet and Sheila once.<eos> They were more special.<eos> Why were they more special?<eos> Because they were good.<eos> They never fought.<eos> But you did.
Oh, you know I'm good.<eos> Eating clean, getting lean.<eos> Jimmy loves me.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah, so I'm calling about Dani Duncan's contract.<eos> You need to come up on those numbers.<eos> Because we both know Dani is on fire right now.<eos> Everybody wants her.<eos> They do?

Jake has come home.<eos> So should you.<eos> Then again, perhaps it is better to fight for the pleasure of ripping the beating heart of power from America's chest, to hold it in your bloody hands, than it is to never have entered the battle at all.<eos> After all, to be empty-handed is to be powerless.<eos> And in this town, powerless means impotent.<eos> And who wants to be impotent?<eos> You're late.<eos> You knew I was at dinner with my father.<eos> I don't like waiting.<eos> Then don't.
Track him down.<eos> Retrace his steps.<eos> Do whatever you need to do to find Billy and stop him before he's able to hand over what he has.<eos> I have got to get me one of these.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> You're working.<eos> You seem good.<eos> What?<eos> You thought you'd find me drunk, playing Russian roulette with the nuclear codes?<eos> You did.
You have a whistle-blower at the NSA.<eos> Which is why I need you to handle this.<eos> Keep it off the agency's radar.<eos> Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.

And affects some of our carbon-reduction initiatives.<eos> I don't know if you've had a chance to read it.<eos> Also, the g8 summit in London, which I want you to attend.<eos> We're still on for the Gridiron Dinner tomorrow night, right?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Hold on.<eos> You hung up on me.<eos> No.<eos> No, you really did.
Thank you all for joining me.<eos> I'm a busy man, so if you could be as brief as possible...<eos> Not really my long suit, being brief but seeing as I'm about to tell you who killed Caroline Bamber...<eos> You see, one of the things that puzzled me most about this case is just how was Caroline murdered?<eos> We know that she died after drinking a glass of champagne laced with a fatal dose of cyanide, but we also know that the bottle that was used to pour out her glass contained no poison.<eos> In other words, the cyanide must have been added directly to her glass.<eos> But how?<eos> Well, thanks to the Commissioner here, we were able to identify three people who might have been able to slip cyanide into the glass.<eos> That is assuming we discount the Commissioner himself here.<eos> - Which we do.
All of it.<eos> You wanna know power?<eos> Suck.<eos> It. Up.<eos> OK, boy.<eos> You look good.<eos> What happened?<eos> Yatt were thick as thieves.<eos> - How come he turned you revenant?<eos> - He didn't.
How do you propose we do that?<eos> We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.<eos> You have all the time in the universe... - literally.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> And how can you stand there in judgment and accuse me of rejecting my gift?<eos> Do you have any idea how much I've done since I was first struck by lightning, how many people I've helped with the power that you gave me... what I've sacrificed?<eos> Of course we do.
That's not true for any of us.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Look, I know that you had an experience in the Speed Force.<eos> And I'm happy that you think we're gonna win the day.<eos> But I think a little fear can be a healthy thing.<eos> It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.<eos> I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.<eos> I met your little red friend tonight.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?<eos> You didn't.
Amplifying it to an erratic frequency on the Earth-2...<eos> - Higher. Higher frequency. - Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.<eos> And when that pulse hits anyone from Earth-2... It'll disrupt their nervous system.<eos> Earth-2 metas go night-night.<eos> - Even Zoom?<eos> - Even Zoom.<eos> Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.<eos> How do we keep the pulse from hurting them?<eos> Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.<eos> Yes you did.
It's the first time I felt normal in a long time.<eos> Come here.<eos> - This is a group hug moment.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> So all of Zoom's meta-humans are locked up in Iron Heights?<eos> Most of them.<eos> Some are somewhere else.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> No you don't.
Not men.<eos> ISIL brides.<eos> You're different than I was expecting.<eos> What were you expecting?<eos> Your mother was sleeping with a Stasi spy.<eos> He was developing her.<eos> You think you're clever?<eos> You're working me?<eos> - You still don't trust me.<eos> - No. I don't.
You will what?<eos> Your support would be a huge gain for Tel Aviv.<eos> Name your price.<eos> Money's no object.<eos> - You're an asshole.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Hector loves me.<eos> You love him?<eos> Of course I do.
N-No, not exactly. No, you haven't.<eos> Exclusivity was never our thing.<eos> Will I see you later?<eos> _<eos> You've never moved this fast before, Steven.<eos> Why the rush?<eos> Opportunity was on the table.<eos> You always have opportunities.<eos> Do you know what headquarters thinks of us?<eos> They don't.
Oh, look at this.<eos> I guess they like us, huh?<eos> Hi. Wonderful.<eos> What were you saying?<eos> How really sorry I am.<eos> And I'm not someone who loves to apologize.<eos> Uh-huh, right, but you're loving it now, aren't you?<eos> Oh, loving it.<eos> Want another one?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You brought them back.<eos> - No.<eos> - They're dehydrated.<eos> I don't care.<eos> There's no room.<eos> Not here.<eos> Not where we're going.<eos> We don't know where we're going.<eos> Mom?<eos> Yes, we do.
- Dr. Mir...<eos> - Mirpuri.<eos> "Mir-piri." Okay.<eos> How is she doing?<eos> I'm afraid it's quite dire.<eos> All brain function has ceased.<eos> So she's not gonna bounce back?<eos> I'm afraid she'll need to stay on life support until she expires.<eos> Did you still want to do her nails?<eos> - Oh, yes, I do.
My leverage equity is on Saint Claude Avenue.<eos> What remains.<eos> I went by the building yesterday.<eos> Everything I own is submerged and beyond salvage.<eos> Lucky man.<eos> I'm bankrupt.<eos> I have to begin again.<eos> I have to close half the Ninth Ward tomorrow.<eos> I got to look those people in the eye.<eos> So don't.
Oh, yes.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> - I know it's politically risky...<eos> - Come this way.<eos> ...but, you know, a carbon tax is the only way to go.<eos> - Yeah, you've met my daughter Catherine? - No.<eos> And this is her special friend Marjorie.<eos> I want to get a picture of all of us.<eos> No, Mom, we don't want to take any photos.<eos> Sure, we do.
- Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - Right, we're gonna do it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How stupid are you, you motherfucking snake?<eos> I know all about your meeting with Marwood and Purcell.<eos> I know all about how you're trying to fuck me with that abstinence program of yours.<eos> Underneath this whole honorable, decent, wholesome Boy Scout crap of yours, I know exactly who you are.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- based off something you think you saw.<eos> - Let me by, Chris.<eos> Whatever you think you saw, it's wrong, Alicia.<eos> I froze.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's all that happened, okay?<eos> - Chris, let me go.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> You can't say anything.<eos> What if I do?
You've got a son.<eos> I'm sure you've done it before.<eos> - You've been in this position.<eos> - No, I have not.<eos> This happens occasionally in Iceland, but there it's just an accident.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> God, this was their real demand from the beginning.<eos> I mean, those islands didn't come out of nowhere.<eos> Actually, they did.
- I can elect a Muslim AIDS virus.<eos> - Okay, Jeff.<eos> A terrorist fucking AIDS virus in the tiniest suicide vest ever made,<eos> I could make it governor of New Hampshire.<eos> Okay, Jeff, you're drunk.<eos> New Hampshire, wow.<eos> Wow, New Hampshire.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I did this.
To get a troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was thinking again... about how women are just as funny as men. And then i realized that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because black laughs matter.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Yes, you do.
Let me tell you a story.<eos> In 1999,<eos> Google was a little startup, just like we are.<eos> And when they started bringing in chefs and masseuses, we thought, "They're nuts!"<eos> But they were attracting the best possible people, and they were able to create the best product, and now they're worth over $400 billion.<eos> And do you know the name of that company?<eos> Google, right?<eos> You said it at the beginning of the story.<eos> You're right.<eos> I did that wrong.
And so, Gavin doesn't want to see any more negative mentions of Nucleus on Hooli-Search.<eos> So... we're gonna alter the search algorithm?<eos> Of course not.<eos> That would be unethical.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Promote other websites to outrank the bad Nucleus news?<eos> Do you have any idea how big a fucking job that is?<eos> Don't you swear at me.<eos> We don't work here anymore.<eos> For 10 more days you do!
Not anymore.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, the occupant of a residence in California has almost unlimited rights.<eos> I have to get his permission to enter my property.<eos> I can't turn off the power or the gas, and I have to hire a lawyer to start a legal eviction.<eos> That won't be cheap.<eos> Jeez, man. I'm sorry.<eos> That sucks.<eos> So, where did you sleep last night?<eos> I did not.
You said that when we got back from Maleant - we would discuss this.<eos> - Okay, let's discuss it.<eos> Take a look at the Conjoined Triangles of Success.<eos> Now, what do those two triangles make together?<eos> - A square?<eos> - A box.<eos> They make a box.<eos> - You can't make that shit up.<eos> - But you literally did make it up.<eos> Yes, I did.
Both of you.<eos> This place is dangerous.<eos> That woman is dangerous.<eos> She's just upset.<eos> I can talk to her.<eos> You stay away from Celia.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Travis is coming over that hill.<eos> When he does, that's when we move.<eos> What if he doesn't?
So that's what I did, Mom.<eos> I just brought him back.<eos> And now we get to stay.<eos> You know, I'd do the same for you.<eos> What?<eos> I can bring Travis back.<eos> - No.<eos> - Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Papa!<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I know what he meant to you.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Nick.<eos> - He's just--<eos> - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that-<eos> - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
I have nothing to tell you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> I don't want you to worry, Daniel.<eos> I will take care of you.<eos> There is a place for you here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came to bring you back. She really needs you.<eos> She's hurting.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - So does he.
I don't want you to worry, Daniel.<eos> I will take care of you.<eos> There is a place for you here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came to bring you back. She really needs you.<eos> She's hurting.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - So does he.<eos> You found him.<eos> No, I didn't.
Fred's great, man.<eos> He's got this really cool, um, malware cataloguing thing-- Cut the shit, Big Head.<eos> I see exactly what you're doing.<eos> Poaching my tenants?<eos> You stole my business model. What? No.<eos> Dude, it's not like that at all.<eos> It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.<eos> You have any idea how scary that gets at night?<eos> So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
What'd you do?<eos> I did it all.<eos> I murdered my friends at that cabin.<eos> I murdered my sister, Cheryl... the patient, the orderly.<eos> I did it all.<eos> That's good, Ash.<eos> Very good.<eos> You know what you have to do now though, don't you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
This morning, you saw me inject that man.<eos> Saline solution.<eos> It will do nothing to protect him from the infection.<eos> - He will soon die.<eos> - So why inject him?<eos> Like you, I would prefer that he not fear.<eos> And yet we are running out of medicine.<eos> Nicholas, when we run out of cake and drugs, where will we turn?<eos> Comfort is no supplement for faith.<eos> You do that girl no favors.
Yes, Pablo was always there for me.<eos> When we moved from Redondo to work in the maquiladora.<eos> Then when everything changed.<eos> Your parents outside of the city?<eos> My father, no.<eos> He was gone before it began.<eos> When everyone began to die, we sent for our mother, but we lost contact with Mama when she was south of the city.<eos> - We should look for her.<eos> - We have.<eos> Pablo did.
Hey, I'll be back for the toast.<eos> She in there?<eos> We met at UCSD.<eos> Took me a year to work up the courage to talk to her.<eos> Just to speak.<eos> I couldn't breathe.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I never thought in a million years I'd put a ring on her finger.<eos> But you did.
I volunteered at county usc through high school.<eos> The nurses taught us that what you don't say to patients is as important as what you do say.<eos> For instance?<eos> I'm not gonna tell you it's gonna be all right.<eos> Why on earth not?<eos> Might not be.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> Your bedside manner is abysmal.<eos> You didn't seem like someone who liked sugar coating.<eos> I don't.
It was the only way.<eos> Everybody dies.<eos> Yeah, easy for you to say.<eos> Pablo's entire lifespan measured about a second, compared to yours.<eos> Didn't he make that second count?<eos> In defeating Baal, he achieved more than I did in thousands of years.<eos> Man, you can really taste the angel dust.<eos> But no matter how baked I get, you're still gone, buddy.<eos> Man, I wish I could just go back in time, and undo all this.<eos> So just do it.

Do what?
I don't understand, why kill you?<eos> Why not just leave you here?<eos> Back down in the Sea or Cortez we had a friend with us.<eos> Yeah, your friend who got bitten, right?<eos> Yeah, Troy.<eos> You know, he was... he was sick and we were still figuring shit out. We didn't know how it worked.<eos> We didn't know what was gonna end up happening to him.<eos> We knew there was no way he was not gonna turn.<eos> Troy knew that, so he made us promise not to let that happen to him.<eos> And we didn't.
No. Maybe.<eos> I don't know, Dad.<eos> They were bored.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I just want to say, Dad, that I get it.<eos> Oh, you get it?<eos> What is it that you get?<eos> What you're trying to teach me.<eos> I mean, you don't even like James.<eos> No, I don't, son.
- Oh, no, no.<eos> Full steam ahead.<eos> Mainland.<eos> That's the theme.<eos> Hawaiian.<eos> We'll have a luau.<eos> Yeah, somebody called me that in high school, and the nickname just stuck.<eos> - Pakistani Denzel.<eos> - I mean, I don't see it.<eos> But everybody else does.
I've done things my whole life that gradually broke her spirit. And now that she's lost everything, let me assure you, she is piiiiiiissed.<eos> Now our only chance is to keep our heads low and act like we're changed men. Because we're very close to the end.<eos> The end? Of what?<eos> Women are sick of our shit, son. And soon, they're gonna know everything we've said and done online.<eos> And unless we start kissing their asses, we're all gonna be put in a big chamber underground and milked for our semen.<eos> Eric, we're so far from home.<eos> We aren't gonna see home again, babe.<eos> We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.<eos> Do you really think there's hope?<eos> Yes. I do.
Get off of that computer right now!<eos> Uh, everyone, please, listen.<eos> We don't have any rockets going to Mars.<eos> Now, you're not listening.<eos> We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet.<eos> We're working as hard as we can.<eos> There's a little girl working on the problem right now, and apparently, she's incredibly smart and funny.<eos> You got it figured out, babe?<eos> Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.<eos> Heidi, yes, you do.
Then beyond you and Mateo, anyone else have access to the van?<eos> Not Victor?<eos> He doesn't have a key.<eos> Listen, your brother... I know you love him, but much as you care about him he wasn't perfect.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> I've had it myself.<eos> Whatever he did... he had a good reason.<eos> But you don't know what that reason is?<eos> 'Cause if you do, you know I can help.<eos> Of course I don't.
That's code for...<eos> We started fooling around.<eos> "Fooling around"?<eos> That's it? Yeah, just messing around.<eos> Is this girl making a rape allegation?<eos> She's saying something happened that she didn't want to happen.<eos> That is so not true. We didn't even have sex.<eos> Okay, if that's the case, just give us a DNA sample, and this whole thing goes away.<eos> - Whoa, I don't... - Do you have a warrant?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> I got to go study, so...<eos> Look, I don't want to bad-mouth her, but Abby's just trying to get attention.<eos> Trying to avoid us, Jack?<eos> No, I just don't know anything.<eos> What's the matter, were you down in that darkroom with her too?<eos> You know, she's only 15.<eos> You're 18. Know what that means?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, I did not touch her.<eos> Yeah, but Chris did though, didn't he?
Objection.<eos> Speculation.<eos> More like common sense, Your Honor.<eos> But I'll withdraw.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> During the course of our investigation, we became aware that Chris Roberts was a member of the school's unofficial secret society, the Cherry Pickers Club.<eos> What did your investigation find out about this club?<eos> Club's one purpose, to deflower female students, and then to record the names of those conquests on a wall in the library behind a portrait of the school's founder.<eos> The defendant recorded Abby's name on that wall?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Abby, the worst is over.<eos> No, it's not. Chris is going to testify and tell everyone lies about me.<eos> Mr. Barba won't let him get away with that.<eos> We were in the darkroom kissing.<eos> I kept asking if everything I was doing was okay, and she didn't say no, so I kept going.<eos> How far did you go?<eos> I put my fingers inside her.<eos> I couldn't have done anything else even if we both wanted to, because I finished early.<eos> Did you have sex with Abby Stewart?<eos> No, I did not.
She's almost at her 30-hour max.<eos> We need to get her into the O.R. while she's still fresh.<eos> What about me?<eos> You're always fresh.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> Shahir, look, my brain can wait.<eos> It's her first lead surgery.<eos> Come on.<eos> You remember your first time.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Dr. Carter, please report to obstetrics.<eos> Hey. I tried to call you.<eos> Why did you bump your surgery?<eos> Asha's been on for 24 hours.<eos> The truth.<eos> Kristine needs my help to cross over.<eos> Charlie, come on.<eos> Alex, the last time she asked for my help, I turned her away, and then she wrapped her car around a tree.<eos> Well, you can't blame yourself for that.<eos> I kind of do.
Let's hope you feel that way after these three days.<eos> Sir, we were just going over some ground rules for Lillian's article, should we decide it's a go.<eos> Cy, she spent a week with Putin.<eos> I think Lillian knows the drill.<eos> Mr. President, did you just compare yourself to Putin?<eos> No.<eos> Mr. President did not.<eos> I should write that down.<eos> Do you know the meaning of "off the record"?<eos> Of course I do.
You set the rules, I follow them.<eos> But, frankly, I'm not interested in a heavily regulated, closely guarded interview with the leader of the free world.<eos> Nor is that what we want to give you.<eos> I want a conversation with the man.<eos> A meaningful one.<eos> I want to know, is Fitzgerald Grant hell-bent on making a difference in the final days of his presidency, or is he happy just tending the store?<eos> I want to know if the man I voted for thinks he succeeded or failed.<eos> I have no ulterior motive here, aside from wanting to write a damn good article.<eos> Do you want me to write a damn good article?<eos> Of course we do.
I was your husband's mistress.<eos> I was in the wrong.<eos> Truth is, I was glad you were there.<eos> You were a good mistress.<eos> Probably a great one.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Well, I am an overachiever.<eos> Once I put my mind to something, I commit.<eos> Tell me you brought more.<eos> Oh, damn straight I did.
Wild Carding is my business.<eos> Look, no judgments.<eos> If you want to spend the night at her home, there are protocols...<eos> Plans that have to be made.<eos> Secret Service schedules that need to be adjusted.<eos> Extra drivers booked.<eos> The ambulance has to be restocked and crewed.<eos> Routes to major trauma centers have to be plotted as well as the distances to Marine One and Air Force One.<eos> The football has to be in attendance, as does the mobile command center.<eos> - We never did any of this with Olivia.
Yep, that's the one.<eos> Oh, my gosh, I...<eos> Oh, I have, like, a million questions for you.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> - What-what you got?<eos> Hit me. Okay, first of all, how many pull-ups can you actually do?<eos> Because I saw you do 24 once.<eos> I don't want to overestimate, but...<eos> Uh, maybe I do.
Seeing as you're eating for three and Jell-O won't cut it.<eos> Uh, where's Stefan?<eos> He had to step out for a bit.<eos> Step out where?<eos> Step out where, Valerie?<eos> He went to Mystic Falls.<eos> Damon's gotten himself into some trouble with Julian.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, I-I told him he didn't have to worry, that I would stay here and look after you.<eos> Yeah, of course you did.
- No, I said it was up to her.<eos> Okay, just... God.<eos> Run!<eos> Cops are gonna come.<eos> How's that gonna work out for you?<eos> - Move.<eos> - No.<eos> Move.<eos> You know what? You got no idea what you just did.<eos> Actually, I do. I do.
- Done.<eos> - You're gonna have to prove yourself 'cause I don't trust you yet, so it's gonna be crap work for months.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Second chance she'd stolen in Boone?<eos> What was she talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She tried to help you, and you lied to her!<eos> No, I didn't.
I guess.<eos> They're so annoying.<eos> What?<eos> It's funny to hear you sound like a normal teenager.<eos> Shut up.<eos> How's that for a normal teenager?<eos> - Sure, that's good too. - Mmm.<eos> - So, have you read it, the bill? - No.<eos> No, she hasn't sent it over yet.<eos> - I did.
_<eos> I'm sorry, I'm too exhausted to keep secrets.<eos> - She won't say anything.<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> Ay... _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Trust me, I know how difficult this is.<eos> You don't.
This looks like the place.<eos> You never really gave a shit about the girl, did you?<eos> She was just an excuse.<eos> This?<eos> This is the story you wanted.<eos> Logan was wrong, of course.<eos> Good ol' William... couldn't get you out of his head.<eos> He kept looking. Worried you were out there alone, afraid.<eos> He knew he'd find you.<eos> And eventually, he did.
Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> He tried, but I stopped him.<eos> Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?<eos> It was Arnold's key insight, the thing that led the hosts to their awakening... suffering.<eos> The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.<eos> It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
He's eight, so it's late-onset.<eos> Gives him five to seven years before he becomes confined to a bed and completely vegetative.<eos> Poor kid.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Well, I've got to go talk to the par...<eos> Dr. Manning?<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> I think my water just broke.<eos> Oh, my God. It did.
Hey, by the way, there's a guy in here, I swe... dead ringer for your brother.<eos> That's 'cause he is my brother.<eos> They're really gonna let Noah become a doctor?<eos> Does he know an ass from an elbow yet?<eos> 'Cause I swear I saw him flailing around back there.<eos> All right, it's his first day.<eos> - He'll be fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, at least he's got a big sister to turn to when he needs someone to show him how it's done.<eos> Yeah, he does.
I love those kids.<eos> Maybe because you're like a big kid yourself.<eos> That's why you're so good at talking to them.<eos> And one day, when we have kids and they say, "why don't we have shoes?"<eos> You can say, "so that other kids can have candy."<eos> Um, V, sometimes it's like... Like you don't understand me or...<eos> Even believe in me.<eos> It sucks.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I do.
Sorry, I'm just gonna be confident like her.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just gonna be confident like her and I'm just gonna get in.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, is anyone else getting bitten up by mosquitoes around here?<eos> Maybe it's just me with my sweet, sweet skin.<eos> So I called him, then I texted him, then I Snapchatted him;<eos> Never heard back from him.<eos> Next thing I know, he's on a waterslide with some skank.<eos> And he tagged me in the picture.<eos> - No, he didn't!
Oh, hey.<eos> Just one second.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um, do you want to go get a sandwich?<eos> The tornado warning's been lifted, and Jimmy's making meatloaf.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Chili, I'm trying to talk to you.<eos> About what?<eos> That woman almost died today.<eos> Yeah, but she didn't.
Like h-he sent her to the hospital.<eos> After that, they were done.<eos> You ever meet this guy?<eos> You think Dylan could have killed Janet?<eos> Honestly, I don't know who else it could have been.<eos> You said you had something for me?<eos> What is this really about?<eos> What's what really about?<eos> You said you wanted my help finding Hector Mendoza.<eos> I do.
Well, I-I spoke with an aide from President Shwe's office and there has been no change in schedule.<eos> As soon as the agreement is signed, I'll call.<eos> Sir, it is a good deal.<eos> In all fairness, sir, I-I don't think anyone could have anticipated a U.S. ambassador leading a demonstration against his own country.<eos> With that said, I'm gonna do everything I can to...<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.<eos> No, no, he does.
- It was just a temporary fix.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> Trying to one up all of us like usual.<eos> You know what we call her.<eos> Queen Elizabeth.<eos> Queen Elizabeth... like it's a big secret!<eos> We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> - We're not deaf!<eos> - I never called her that.<eos> - I didn't!

No towels, sí.<eos> Good night.<eos> Ready?<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> On to Plan B.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get away from him now, you filthy, little gobshites.<eos> It's me you're lookin' for, right?<eos> And honestly, boys, I don't know how you keep finding me.<eos> Truly, I don't.
And God asked unto him, he said,<eos> "Noah, now, why is it you release all the other animals, but yet you refuse to release that rooster from your grasp?"<eos> And Noah said unto God,<eos> "After 40 long nights on that ark, forgive me, O Lord, but I cannot stop stroking my cock."<eos> Amen?<eos> Can I get an "amen," boys?<eos> Mom, no.<eos> Make the kid watch.<eos> I know you.<eos> I do.
You two talk a lot, huh?<eos> All the time.<eos> You tell him everything.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> You tell him what you are?<eos> Absolu...<eos> Yes, absolutely.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I did.
Everything all right?<eos> Where'd Cassidy go?<eos> Jesse?<eos> Where's Cassidy?<eos> Jesse?<eos> You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You did.
No, Sheriff.<eos> That church is nothing more than wood and paint and bits of colored glass.<eos> It's a lie, Sheriff, and I'm gonna tear it down peg by peg.<eos> Grind it into dust.<eos> "Holy ground," my ass.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Yes.<eos> I should've listened.<eos> That's right.<eos> But I didn't.
Tonight.<eos> Morning first thing.<eos> It's the best I can do.<eos> And Noah said unto God, after 40 long nights on that Ark,<eos> "Forgive me, oh, Lord, but I cannot stop stroking my cock."<eos> Can I get an amen, boys?<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Make him watch.<eos> I know you.<eos> I do.
Jesus.<eos> Where is God?<eos> I am the Resurrection!<eos> I am the way and the truth!<eos> Where is God?<eos> ! I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> None of us do.
It's a solid lead.<eos> If you followed up, you'd probably find out where Max Lord went.<eos> Uh, I just...<eos> I just think it's best if we don't pursue that any further.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would...<eos> We should not be messing with the DEO.<eos> You know about the DEO?<eos> No. You just told me about them.<eos> - No, I didn't.

Professor!<eos> Sentence to be carried out.<eos> Professor, move!<eos> - Kara!<eos> - Alex, look out!<eos> Red sunlight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No!<eos> You wasted your ammo.<eos> No, I didn't.
Ker-rah!<eos> If I have to say your name a third time, you will have to find another job.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> You...<eos> You missed a button.<eos> Um, Ms. Grant just told me...<eos> Lucy quit.<eos> You told her I was Supergirl and she left the city?<eos> No, I didn't tell her.<eos> - You didn't?
What happens on a retreat is private.<eos> It's between the Ascender and The Light.<eos> Why are Bill and Felicia here?<eos> Why do you think Bill and Felicia are there?<eos> Because they think I'm fucking up with running things, this whole... this whole thing with Miranda Frank.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Everything you need to know, you know.<eos> You're 10R, after all.<eos> Well, I don't know what Eddie's hiding.<eos> Huh. Don't you?
Yeah, I'm coming straight for you, actually.<eos> - Oh, well then.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come and get me.<eos> So, are we... are we good?<eos> You know what might make us good is you jumping in this lake.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want me to jump in the lake?<eos> - Yeah, I kind of do.
Amputated.<eos> Skinned.<eos> Drained.<eos> Injected with experimental drugs.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No.<eos> No one does.
Well, aside from my eardrums ringing like church bells, I'm okay.<eos> You sure?<eos> You don't seem okay.<eos> I'm sorry I made you rush in on Livewire without a plan.<eos> I didn't know she was gonna have a cohort.<eos> That's the thing about being a superhero.<eos> You have to somehow be prepared for the unexpected.<eos> Something happened to me a few weeks ago.<eos> I was exposed to this substance that made me crazy.<eos> I did a lot of horrible things.
Afraid I'll win?<eos> You've already lost.<eos> Accept it and the glorious fulfillment of Astra's vision.<eos> In the end, she defeated you.<eos> This doesn't look like victory to me.<eos> And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
- Where are you now?<eos> - At Mom's.<eos> Stay there.<eos> If you come to National City, Myriad will take over you too.<eos> There's no way I'm leaving you there by yourself.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> I'm, uh... I'm with Ms. Grant.<eos> Why wasn't Cat affected?<eos> Maxwell Lord protected her and himself.<eos> Of course he did.
Not that old.<eos> Not old-old.<eos> But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.<eos> We can transmit a signal by calibrating it to Myriad's frequency, without leaving any online fingerprints.<eos> Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> -CAT: I have one question for you, Max.<eos> -MAX: Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
Want to come on in?<eos> Hi.<eos> Mike was just telling us about your warehouse.<eos> That's awful.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.<eos> Uh, why... why would you sue us?<eos> I never gave permission for the school to use it to put on that play.<eos> So you're liable.<eos> Yes, you did.
Except the sound of Arthur bashing his head through that window.<eos> He just wanted that noise to stop.<eos> He said, "Get it out of my head."<eos> Hmm. Did you notice anything else, a drop in temperature?<eos> No.<eos> But the power went out.<eos> And when I looked through the broken window, I saw something.<eos> What did you see, exactly?<eos> You're not gonna believe me.<eos> They certainly didn't.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> Tell me something.<eos> What did you do before you retired?<eos> I was in a Patsy Cline tribute band. No.<eos> I'm deadly serious.<eos> You ever miss life on the road? Nah.<eos> Nah, I had my fun.<eos> You want to know the secret to living a long and happy life?<eos> Actually, yes, I do.

So he was tanked.<eos> But he died from asphyxiation.<eos> They found neurotoxic venom in his system, which caused paralysis, inhibiting his diaphragm from contracting.<eos> - How did that happen?<eos> - M.E. has no clue.<eos> But the report suggests the skin of the victim's face was removed while he was still alive.<eos> You remember the case we handled with the alien sightings?<eos> Yeah, the missing cow ovary mystery.<eos> Never figured that one out.<eos> Well, actually, we did.
And let's leave the foot chase to Fisher this time.<eos> What?<eos> Foot chase?<eos> I just helped apprehend a witness.<eos> Yeah, your daredevil days are over.<eos> - Maggie, I was just...<eos> - I'm already in the hot seat with Blair.<eos> I don't need you taking any risks with this case.<eos> - You can't bench me now.<eos> - I just did.
- Yeah, 'kay, bye.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cameron, the way you've been acting, like charging right into things and you're so impulsive,<eos> I don't know if you're overcompensating, or trying to impress me...<eos> No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.

I...
That was confusing.<eos> That was my bad.<eos> Hmm, that's weird.<eos> I'm not expecting anybody.<eos> Oh, it's probably the cops.<eos> Cops...<eos> Sorry, hmm?<eos> Josh?<eos> You called the cops?<eos> Of course I did.
God. we really have!<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I don't want another man.<eos> I mean, the only thing I've been cheating on you with is... Rebecca's love life.<eos> She's so in love, and it-it's just been so intoxicating to witness it in its purest form.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm addicted.<eos> Who's she in love with?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> Yes, I do.
Queso.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> I'm sorry the rocket exploded on re-entry.<eos> Yeah, so, I think we're done with the Apollo 13 references.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just want to spend time with him.<eos> I want so badly to go back to the way things were.<eos> ♪ Romantic moments you had ♪<eos> ♪ That he didn't know were romantic ♪<eos> ♪ Or maybe he did a little ♪
- A hundred percent.<eos> - So you got to go.<eos> Yeah. Oh.<eos> I don't want to have to go back to your friends and tell them I don't know you.<eos> I would much rather stay here and make you dinner.<eos> How about that?<eos> Are you blackmailing me?<eos> Oh, you know what they say, one person's blackmailing is another person's love story.<eos> Who says that?<eos> Me. I do.
She's one of our regulars.<eos> The one that orders those custom cheeseburger pizzas.<eos> Look, everyone, look!<eos> It is classic case of the common man being exploited by corporate interests.<eos> And I will prove today...<eos> Man, she looks hot in her little legal outfit, right?<eos> I'd pound that gavel.<eos> Guys, nobody wants to watch this silly trial.<eos> Hey!<eos> Yes, they do.
But, but which I loved.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> You're not... perfect.<eos> No one is.<eos> You tried really hard today.<eos> I just wanted to make everyone happy.<eos> And, I don't know, I wanted you to be proud of me.<eos> You wanted me to be... proud of you?<eos> I didn't know you thought about me that much.<eos> Of course I do.
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...<eos> Let's delve into your childhood.<eos> Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.<eos> - I used to like her.<eos> - You still do.
I don't know how things work.<eos> She's looking sharp in that suit.<eos> It really highlights her brains and tactical thinking skills.<eos> Is she still single?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Who knows?<eos> I don't even think about that anymore.<eos> Why not?<eos> Didn't you go all the way to LA just to tell her you dig her?<eos> Yes, I did, Chris.
Certain issues have arisen which will lead to a delay in wages being paid.<eos> Just for today, that's all.<eos> Just a day... or so.<eos> But I can assure you that it is temporary and will be rectified as soon as possible.<eos> It's no use looking to me.<eos> - I know as much as all you do.<eos> - So you'd say?<eos> - If you knew something?<eos> - Aye.<eos> But I don't.
We didn't have a body back then and with the blanket there's a direct link to someone in your house.<eos> Anybody could've taken it, including you.<eos> Happy to let yourself into my home without permission.<eos> How do I know you've not done it before?<eos> You're not the only one who lives under this roof.<eos> Who else was here at the time?<eos> Skinny, paying bed and board.<eos> And Johnny Blackwood.<eos> He and Red never saw eye to eye.<eos> A lot of folk didn't.
Coates is stirring up trouble about Red's death.<eos> He even believes I've something to do with it.<eos> - You're capable of handling Coates.<eos> - He's doing this to divide us, even if it means tying me to a murder.<eos> We shouldn't stand for it.<eos> Is it always somebody else's fault, the chaos that surrounds you?<eos> It's always you, John, at the centre of the heartache, the turmoil.<eos> You left here, destroyed our father's life, returned years later and lied your way into the town I built.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - You never do.
My brother will need to be found.<eos> Are you really sure, sir?<eos> If it was any other man, I'd be expected to send a search party.<eos> It'll be no different for him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You're not the first and you won't be the last, love.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> The world is full of men like Rory.<eos> Promise the earth to get what they want.<eos> Well, he did.
Please!<eos> Tell me the truth!<eos> There's no way of knowing, Mrs Blackwood.<eos> Somebody has to do something.<eos> Seems like you folks have a whole lot of trouble on your hands.<eos> There's a great wall of boulders blocking the tunnel.<eos> Mr Blackwood and his brother are trapped down inside.<eos> Want my advice?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, we do.
- They're awfully gassy.<eos> Yes.<eos> I suppose one can always open the windows.<eos> - Don't you miss it?<eos> - What?<eos> The country of your birth.<eos> The people here.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.<eos> But they didn't, so I don't.
- You flatterer.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Generally, we're better at queens than kings.<eos> In this country I have a feeling you'll be no exception.<eos> - I certainly intend to do it well.<eos> - I did, too.<eos> Obviously, not hard enough.<eos> No.<eos> You never apologized.<eos> To your papa, I most certainly did.
- Clarence House...<eos> - Our home.<eos> What about it?<eos> We have to give it up.<eos> The home of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom is Buckingham Palace.<eos> Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
I want to make a public declaration of my trust in you.<eos> - There's no need to matronize me.<eos> - I'm not matronizing you.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You're taking pity on me and giving me a job, for appearance's sake.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I was just thinking how I'd like us to spend more time together.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We spend all our time together.<eos> No, we don't.
Fussing about curtain fabrics and paint charts.<eos> Honestly, it's just queening of another sort.<eos> What would it entail?<eos> Well, the Duke of Norfolk will run the show from an organizational perspective, look after the seating, the root of the procession, but as Chairman of the Committee, you would have an input on ideas, inspire everyone, lead them.<eos> They won't listen to me.<eos> The grey, old men?<eos> The men with moustaches?<eos> They hate me.<eos> - They do not hate you.<eos> - They do.
Goodness.<eos> Well, of course, we're aware of the complications and issues at stake.<eos> Oh, Lilibet, you've known for a while about Peter and I.<eos> This can't really be a terrible shock to you.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> - Is there anything you'd like to ask us?<eos> - Does your wife know?<eos> - No, ex-wife.<eos> - She does.
Aren't we going to the airlock?<eos> Already sealed.<eos> You ok?<eos> I'm fine. Yeah.<eos> I-I...<eos> I was just thinking it's been two days with no one trying to kill us.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I know. But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
I've never even been off this rig.<eos> Trust me, that's a good thing. Heh.<eos> I'm Jasper.<eos> - Shay.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Jasper's actually smiling.<eos> Clarke. Let it go.<eos> We can't just leave.<eos> It's not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
The one black kid had a blade, the other was backing him up.<eos> I shot in self-defense.<eos> That's for a grand jury to decide.<eos> You would have done the same thing-- any cop would have.<eos> You will have your day in court, you have my word.<eos> Your word?<eos> I served your father with distinction for 20 years.<eos> You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.<eos> This has got nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course it does.
♪ Travel to the car ♪<eos> ♪ And find a juror ♪<eos> ♪ Your heart is true, but you're not walking fast enough. ♪<eos> You and Nick, tell me everything.<eos> The power went out.<eos> We went into the basement.<eos> There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And you like him.<eos> No. No, I don't.
Its own bedroom?<eos> So the baby that you're not even pregnant with yet is doing better than old Caroline?<eos> No, Ming Wa wants me to give up my walk-in closet.<eos> I mean, that's where my purses and half my hair live.<eos> So purses and hair are doing better than old Caroline too?<eos> Uh, earwax is doing better than old Caroline.<eos> Come on, Caroline.<eos> Let's shake these asses and get them passes.<eos> Do you think I should shave my back for tomorrow for Game Con?<eos> My mom does.
Our construction.<eos> Yeah, we had to fire Oleg's cousin.<eos> Turns out the sexual tension was still there.<eos> Hey body... not so much.<eos> Yeah, so it's gonna take at least another week.<eos> A week?<eos> There goes the "no sex while Max and Caroline are awake" rule.<eos> That wasn't sex you were having in front of us?<eos> Max, Caroline, I don't know how I'll ever repay you for getting Eunice off my back.<eos> I do.
What's the emergency?<eos> Veronica Mars here wants to stitch into Sandy.<eos> Maggie gave the go-ahead?<eos> Okay, then we're going behind Maggie's back.<eos> Intriguing, tell me more.<eos> I can't stop thinking about that note.<eos> What if it was meant for me?<eos> Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.<eos> Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does?
Get up.<eos> Nice.<eos> Well, I played hockey in high school.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Tell us about Sandy.<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> All right? We went out once and she blew me off.<eos> I just wanted a second chance.<eos> She didn't have to call the cops.<eos> She didn't.
Okay.<eos> This one's apparently good for immunity, alkalization, and opening your third eye chakra.<eos> A third eye-opener.<eos> That might be the most LA thing I've ever heard.<eos> Hey, man, you're the one who chose to stay in traffic jam paradise.<eos> Why did you stay?<eos> And don't even tell me it was "for the rewards of teaching."<eos> Really?<eos> You want to hear about this?<eos> Of course I do.
- Bah! Hobbit feet?<eos> - It was nothing.<eos> I went outside to check on a noise and I forgot to wipe the dirt off my feet.<eos> Oh, thank God. I thought you meant hobbit feet as in hairy.<eos> Yeah, you've seen my feet.<eos> - Did they suddenly sprout?<eos> Mm. Oh. Time it goes to work, my precious.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why'd you tell him?<eos> Why didn't you?
Trust me, it helps.<eos> That's not just tea.<eos> No. Some situations require more than just tea.<eos> Like when you shoot your first person?<eos> You didn't have a choice.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
It would help you get closer to finding your father.<eos> Hey. How you feeling?<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> Well, your brain scan came back clean.<eos> There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.
Look at us.<eos> Sneakin' stuff across the border, just like the old days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We are a couple of bad-asses.<eos> Ooh!<eos> I forgot my mittens.<eos> I have to pee.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> I asked you if you needed to pee before you got in the car.<eos> Yeah, well, at the time, I didn't.
In and out... in and out.<eos> And now push!<eos> It doesn't feel right.<eos> - Push.<eos> - Now, push!<eos> You're very close.<eos> Something feels wrong.<eos> I know.<eos> I remember this.<eos> - You do?
She listened to her, and she let Carla decide how she wanted to fight.<eos> Where were you Friday night?<eos> One of my kids was sick.<eos> I spent the night in the emergency room.<eos> And I got no idea how I'm gonna pay for it.<eos> Guess what I've got.<eos> Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.

Oh!<eos> Back from the honeymoon already.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Alan saw you naked?<eos> - On the plane. - (Giggles)<eos> We had one glorious night in Puerto Vallarta, but there was a 30% chance of a hurricane, which is 100% too much for a Jew.<eos> But... we did manage to bring a little Puerto Vallarta back with us.<eos> Oh, my damn.<eos> Alan loves it.<eos> - You do?

Say no more.<eos> I'm gonna grab the sleeping bag.<eos> Bag-a? Or bag-zzza?<eos> Thought we could share.<eos> That's cool.<eos> And it should be cool.<eos> And I want it to be cool.<eos> But it's not cool yet.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, I don't.
Anything.<eos> What?<eos> - All done!<eos> - That.<eos> Bye!<eos> Well, at least we got our first awkward bondage experience out of the way.<eos> Hey, I said "first," and then I said "said."<eos> Hey, high five for getting our feeling back to all of our proper places.<eos> You know, I actually do have a fantasy.<eos> - You do?
We're gonna have a great time.<eos> Come on, let's, uh, let's get you settled.<eos> All right.<eos> So, West Covina wasn't the first time you made a rash decision to try to win back the man you love.<eos> That's not...<eos> The two aren't...<eos> No, that's...<eos> They're two different situations.<eos> I mean, clearly, my mother had been keeping us apart and we were meant to be together.<eos> Mm, I did some research.
Love comes in many forms.<eos> But the kind of love a child needs is the kind they can count on.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Wake up, sleepyhead!<eos> I made pancakes.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You know, I really do love you, Becca.<eos> Of course you do.
What is she doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> No one asked you to come.<eos> God, I hate this part. I hate this part.<eos> This is when she ripped me away from him.<eos> You know, he loved me.<eos> He did.<eos> But of course I couldn't have that.<eos> Did you snoop around my room?<eos> Oh, you did, didn't you? !
So she'll never know what you're capable of.<eos> Or not capable of.<eos> And I didn't see him for two more years.<eos> And I always blamed her.<eos> I always thought she was the one keeping us apart.<eos> She never told me any of this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she didn't want to hurt you.<eos> Because someone did love you.<eos> Someone still does.
That's what you take away from that story?<eos> That my mother loved me?<eos> Okay, with all due respect, a mother's love... That's the bare minimum.<eos> I mean, geez, serial killers have mothers that love them.<eos> What I take away from that story is, my father's even worse than I thought.<eos> I always knew he was an abandoning piece garbage, but, geez, I thought at least I could blame my mother for it.<eos> Can't believe she never told me that story.<eos> She never misses an opportunity to rub things in.<eos> Maybe you misjudged her in some way.<eos> Maybe I did.
What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Has she been catfished by a drug smuggler?<eos> - What?<eos> - I watched this TV show called "Catfished by a Drug Smuggler".<eos> It's on the new Catfishing Channel.<eos> Oh, my god, it is so good.<eos> I-I binged the entire thing.<eos> Okay, I know what's happening.<eos> - You do?
Quick!<eos> Hurry!<eos> - There he is!<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - On a ride.<eos> - Do you know what time it is?<eos> !<eos> - I'm half an hour late.<eos> - I told you to stay here!<eos> - No, you didn't!

Hi.<eos> It's the shifter.<eos> It will break sooner or later.<eos> There's a problem with the chain.<eos> Bring it here. We'll try to fix it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're good with bikes.<eos> I won the Tour de France ten times.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - You do?
You know all about me, then.<eos> May I ask you a question?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Is it true, what they say, that you killed a kid in an accident?<eos> He came out of nowhere.<eos> It was dark...<eos> I couldn't avoid him.<eos> Did you go to jail?<eos> No...<eos> I didn't, unfortunately.
I have to leave!<eos> We're not too late.<eos> He hasn't woged yet.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Take him down.<eos> Take him down now!<eos> He's not a Lycanthrope.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Previously on "12 Monkeys"... - Dad!<eos> - Sam!<eos> What happened to me?<eos> The Witness took control of you.<eos> I don't love you!<eos> You did once.
I didn't have to go to that hotel and wait for you, but I did.<eos> So, please, stop blaming yourself for me.<eos> Worry about your own purpose.<eos> Go... save the world, Cole.<eos> Ah, to hell with the world.<eos> Then what are we still doing here?<eos> For what?<eos> Why continue this?<eos> You know why.<eos> No. I don't.
Hmm.<eos> - You knew this was gonna happen?<eos> - Ticky-tock, those eyes.<eos> Left, right, swaying like a granddaddy clock.<eos> Can't take 'em off me.<eos> God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
It's just, I'm supposed to be meeting my husband in New York.<eos> - Oof.<eos> - Is-is that a good oof - or a bad oof?<eos> - There is no good oof.<eos> I have one seat on Flight 47 that's leaving right now.<eos> - If you hurry, I can...<eos> - Oh, no, I can't do that flight.<eos> I strongly encourage you to get on the earlier flight unless you want to spend the night next to that guy.<eos> Why did he fall asleep on that wet spot?<eos> He didn't.
Look, I just want to meet someone who I can talk to, someone who understands me.<eos> You know, someone like you.<eos> A good listener.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You.<eos> - You.<eos> I want to kiss you. - Someone like me.<eos> - I do want to kiss you.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Yes, I do. - No.
- I do want to kiss you.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Yes, I do. - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> You...<eos> Please sit down.<eos> - You want to, too.<eos> - You must...<eos> - Oh. - I can tell.<eos> - I don't!
Everything okay?<eos> You can go in.<eos> Donald. You asked to see me?<eos> Do you remember Leonard Letts, general counsel in Borns Tech?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Your ex-husband went to see Gina Larson yesterday.<eos> Okay. I give up.<eos> Who's Gina Larson?<eos> Like you don't know.<eos> I don't.
The only man.<eos> They're better equipped to deal with gall bladder problems in America.<eos> Due to the high fat diets they have here.<eos> Leaving me without you for the summit with Ike.<eos> - Can't you delay it?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
The military industrial complex, Ma'am.<eos> What?<eos> And its threat to democratic government.<eos> It's what most concerns him.<eos> - Something lighter, perhaps?<eos> - Golf?<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - Oil painting.<eos> - I'm told he paints landscapes.<eos> - Oh, don't they all?
Goodness.<eos> That's the second consecutive private audience that he's missed.<eos> - It's most unlike him.<eos> - Yes, isn't it?<eos> Are you all right, Martin?<eos> Your Majesty, I've had the opportunity to think about your very kind offer to become your Private Secretary.<eos> And I'm afraid I must decline.<eos> Why?<eos> In this instance, I really do believe you'll be better served by Michael.<eos> No, you don't.
Lord Porchester? This way, madam.<eos> At the end of the bar.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello, Porchey!<eos> - You found the place all right?<eos> - The taxi driver did, yes.
The trickery.<eos> The fish, down below.<eos> I think all our work is unintentionally revealing and I find it especially so with your pond.<eos> Beneath the tranquility and the elegance and the light playing on the surface, I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.<eos> The framing itself, indicated to me that you wanted us to see something beneath all the muted colors, deep down in the water.<eos> Terrible despair.<eos> Hiding like a Leviathan.<eos> Like a sea monster.<eos> - You saw all that?<eos> - Yes, I did.
I'm not gonna leave her.<eos> I'll stay and help Valerie.<eos> Damon needs you.<eos> I don't care what Damon needs.<eos> I don't know what he did to make you hate him, but he is so determined to make things right, he's gonna get himself killed.<eos> Do you honestly think i would do anything to put Caroline at risk?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Stefan, go.<eos> We can take it from here.<eos> How we doing?
Things are hard right now.<eos> You're still lucky.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know what it's like to do this job and not have anybody to talk to about it, except a series of handlers who don't give a shit.<eos> My daughter is in a very bad place because of us... because of this job.<eos> She could sense that something was off.<eos> You know, the late hours, no family ever around.<eos> Elizabeth wanted to tell her who we were, and I didn't.<eos> We fought about it for months.<eos> And then we did.
No, but she's still on the island.<eos> Kirk's preparing her exit plan.<eos> I don't know what the preparations are, but I know who can find out-- Manuel Esteban.<eos> The Chilean Spymaster?<eos> - Who's Esteban?<eos> - Our next Blacklister.<eos> Manuel Orentez Esteban.<eos> Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.
The man who took Agnes-- he's driving a blue Dodge sedan, late '50s,<eos> He's taking her straight to Liz.<eos> If we can follow the car--<eos> We can find them.<eos> Okay, let me think.<eos> Let me think.<eos> Okay, what I'm thinking is, um, did you help Agent Keen fake her death?<eos> Aram!<eos> Not helpful, I know.<eos> Okay. But did you?
Aram!<eos> Not helpful, I know.<eos> Okay. But did you?<eos> At the funeral, when you put a flower on her casket--<eos> The car-- it has an old tube radio.<eos> - Local oscillator.<eos> - The oscillator.<eos> Right. Of course.<eos> Okay, if you could rewire it, you might be able to turn the PLL receiver into this-- ...into a low power mono FM transmitter that produces a signal that you can trace.<eos> You do?
Please stop talking.<eos> Okay.<eos> Of course you're insecure about your body.<eos> You're a teenager.<eos> It's part of the job description.<eos> But if this whole skinny-dipping thing ever even happens, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> - Easy for you to...<eos> - You're still talking.<eos> You have nothing to worry about because nobody's going to be looking at you, because all those other kids are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities.<eos> But I-if they do?
Well, like I said in the interview, no one's against free college.<eos> - The problem is...<eos> - Susan.<eos> Do you see any TV cameras in here?<eos> No, sir.<eos> So be honest with me.<eos> You like Governor Vargas' free-education plan, don't you?<eos> That's correct.<eos> And you want to see it implemented around the country?<eos> I really do.
My brother.<eos> I thought you were an only child.<eos> I am.<eos> Oh.<eos> "Oh"?<eos> It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
[glass cracking] [laughs] You stepped in ship.<eos> [Joy coughing] Oh, put it down, put it down, Joy.<eos> Go away, take the rest of the weekend off, 'cause my boy here has got to be ship-shape for his big press conference tomorrow.<eos> - Trick Malloy.<eos> - Kent Russell.<eos> I know you're thinking of doing something else with your life.<eos> I get it, I do.<eos> You're not a one-trick pony, and it's a trick... y decision.<eos> You see what I'm doing here?<eos> I do, I do.
Why don't you come up to my office, and I will show you my bronzed cast of Apolo Ohno's hands?<eos> Oh, yes, to Ohno, you know?<eos> [all laughing] Attaboy.<eos> Oh, my gosh, do you hear that?<eos> - What? - The train that's coming?<eos> That sex train.<eos> Do you hear it?<eos> Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, his dick!<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
No, it's not about money.<eos> It's like I have a calling, and I'm tired of letting it just go straight to voice-mail.<eos> Ring, ring.<eos> Ring, ring.<eos> Sorry, I just overheard your metaphor.<eos> I was tending to the garden.<eos> Nice toss, by the way.<eos> That's the exact kind of throw that would beat a soft nickel, assuming that the safety bites it on a fake pump, of course.<eos> Didn't know you knew so much about football, Billie.<eos> She doesn't.
Where is Gene?<eos> ♪ Gene, you're not in slo-mo.<eos> Stop it.<eos> There's no fan blowing your hair.<eos> [slowly] A breeze.<eos> Don't talk like-- You're not in slo-mo.<eos> - Maybe I was.<eos> - You're not.<eos> Did you ever think I was for a second?<eos> No, I didn't.
I hate to interrupt your moment of Zen, but it's time you fill me in on the details of the buy.<eos> Keehi Small Boat Harbor, tomorrow morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I know the where and when.<eos> Who's the buyer?<eos> Guy I hooked up with while I was on the inside.<eos> Nobody you would know.<eos> That's reassuring.<eos> Look, I would tell you that you can trust the dude, but really, I shouldn't have to, because you should trust me.<eos> I do, Levi.
I just want to feel like I'm a priority to him.<eos> Even when we're making love, I feel like he's not really present.<eos> Maybe that's because I have to schedule an appointment with you to be there.<eos> I'm sorry I'm so busy juggling a job and raising your two children.<eos> Maybe if you valued that, I'd give it up more often.<eos> Danny, you haven't exactly been participating.<eos> What's your take on all this?<eos> Uh, my take on, uh, this is, um-- sorry-- it's stupid, and I'd like to just go take a nap if that's okay.<eos> So you don't see the value in anything we do here?<eos> I-I don't.
That's what Pilcher says, right?<eos> Dr. Yedlin.<eos> That was, uh, very impressive, what you did in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, segmental recession of saphenous vein interposition graft?<eos> That's right.<eos> I was, uh, just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You... You don't?
- Well, do what you have to.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Don't tell my wife about this.<eos> - [whispers] Jess.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - I wanted to see how you were.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> - Oh, he smells like heaven.<eos> Think he knows me?<eos> - Of course he does.
- You know, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> - The wrong impression?<eos> - Natalie just had a baby.<eos> - Oh. Uh-huh. I know that.<eos> - Her husband died only six months ago.<eos> - I know that too.<eos> - So, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> - It amazes me how dumb a doctor can be.<eos> Everybody knows you like Natalie.<eos> - They do?
Professor le gall is my adviser.<eos> Is she?<eos> Oui.<eos> For god's sakes, audrey, Nobody is condoning rape.<eos> We're just saying that the term "sexual assault". Is so expansively used now. That it dilutes public outrage.<eos> Really, mike?<eos> Because a woman who cries sexual assault. Might just be looking for attention?<eos> Or... or maybe she was confused.<eos> Maybe she really did want it. Maybe she did.<eos> Maybe she did,
Lucky for you. You have a paper record. Of the man you used to be.<eos> Whereas for most of us that younger person only exists. In our memory.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> I was beginning to think. There wasn't anyone interesting to talk to in all of new jersey.<eos> But...<eos> You're a famous author.<eos> And you've been to prison.<eos> Sir thomas malory wrote le morte d'arthur. When he was prison.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
It's gonna be long and hard.<eos> But it will end, and you will come back.<eos> Take comfort in knowing that.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Honey, what's wrong?<eos> I want to come with you.<eos> What?<eos> I want to Walk.<eos> I want to Walk with you.<eos> Son, you, uh... you do this alone.
He acts like it's the other way around.<eos> Maybe it is.<eos> Look, do you know what that guy Larson did here?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He worked on the Falcon class line of fuel systems for the Navy.<eos> That's not what he did, Leonard.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Do you actually want to know what he worked on?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Hi, I'm Patty Solis-Papagian for the plaintiff.<eos> We're awaiting the arrival of lead counsel William McBride.<eos> Judge: And where is Mr. McBride?<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> The traffic was a mess.<eos> I think the President's in town or something.<eos> Miss Senate, Miss Kittridge, and Mr. Letts were all here on time.<eos> The litigant bringing the case can't be bothered.<eos> Well, if protocol seems to count--<eos> - Judge: It does!
You can't do this.<eos> What?<eos> Things are different now, I mean...<eos> You have the chance to bring up your baby and you didn't have that chance before.<eos> Mol, what are you doing?<eos> No, because it's hard enough.<eos> But I promised you.<eos> If you want this baby, half as much as I do, you are never gonna forgive yourself if you keep this promise.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> We'll camp here tonight.<eos> You happy?<eos> But tomorrow, we're gonna fix your boot,<eos> I'm gonna get you to your kingdom, drop you off, and then I can go and rescue Isabella.<eos> All you care about is saving your precious Isabella.<eos> You don't care about me.<eos> Nobody does.
Do you only care for men who save your life?<eos> On the cliff. Do you know that you... risked your life to save mine?<eos> You told me to save you.<eos> you said... you ran through a shower of bullets... to save a comrade.<eos> About you... going to save Private Ryan.<eos> was it? did you... save him?<eos> Everyone's on board.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Sir. Sir. Stay with me.<eos> I did.
I will definitely date her for sure.<eos> We've been together for a year now.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I envy you.<eos> Don't you think I would also find someone to date for a year that I have only known for a month?<eos> I don't think we will be fighting over Myung Ju.<eos> Let's be on the same side when we do fight.<eos> It feels good to drink during the day.<eos> Do you know that we have never said "I love you" to each other?<eos> We did it with our actions instead of with words.
"Rache." What is that, short for Rachel?<eos> That's possible.<eos> But Charlotte's native language is German.<eos> And in German, that word is "rache," which means "revenge."<eos> Maybe it's the name of a band or sulein Konig craved revenge.<eos> If she did, you got to wonder who killed her to keep her from getting it.<eos> Actually, we may already have a pretty good idea.<eos> Charlotte Konig was suing your company for $100 million, correct?<eos> She claimed we stole her process for turning algae into biofuel.<eos> Did you?
Because there'll never be $1.3 million.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're back.<eos> I thought you were gone for another few months.<eos> Yeah, I didn't like it.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> See my hat? "Take a byte out of Silicon Valley."<eos> I do.
You want to get out of here?<eos> ♪ Don't remember ♪ no.<eos> We finally have the place to ourselves.<eos> You mean you don't like it when the, uh, car next to you's bumping up and down and you hear groaning?<eos> Nobody can hear us, can they?<eos> ♪ Don't remember ♪ not tonight.<eos> Doug!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> He knows.<eos> Don't you?
You need to appreciate what that woman's do...<eos> They canceled school.<eos> So we're gonna... Hang out, I guess.<eos> Hang out, huh?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He got the message.<eos> Damn right he did.
I wasn't always this girl.<eos> Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror, and I'm like, "that's me?"<eos> Yeah, you said you had to run away from home?<eos> Jody took you in?<eos> You should know...<eos> I've done some really bad things.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Hurt people.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
The case files of the late Bob Underhill.<eos> You got my texts?<eos> Murdered FBI agent fed through a wood chipper.<eos> His wife thought it was over one of his unsolved cases.<eos> Marcus and I went to his apartment and discovered he had been revisiting three of them.<eos> I made copies of his files and assigned each case its own room.<eos> As you can see, the library tells the tale of a hate crime, a church burnt to the ground in 1981.<eos> The arsonist, never identified.<eos> You think that's who killed Underhill?<eos> I do not.
No, but once the secret's out, what would I have?<eos> We need to take this to the next level.<eos> No, we need to take it slow.<eos> This can get out of control real easy.<eos> You're using it, aren't you?<eos> I had to make sure you weren't trying to cheat me.<eos> I told you not to use it.<eos> This could ruin everything.<eos> - I think I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't.
"Pierced a woman's face as she lay limp in it's arms.<eos> "It appeared to suck something from its victim "as the cheeks grew ever larger.<eos> "When it finished with the young woman, it disgorged the Yanbue."<eos> So we don't know what the Musasat Alsh-Shabab does with the... - Yanbue.<eos> - Right.<eos> That it sucks out of people.<eos> Right. Here's more.<eos> "And when it melts into the skin, "age disappears, but it becomes highly addictive, "shattering lives, and making monsters of those who use it." Oh.<eos> Well, there's a happy ending.<eos> Not done.
- She seems to be managing quite well.<eos> I have been looking for you everywhere.<eos> You are needed in the retiring room right away.<eos> All the chamber pots need emptying.<eos> But that's a chambermaid's job.<eos> I think you can probably manage, don't you?<eos> I've been observing all the ladies, but none of them dance as well as you.<eos> Please, will you do me the honour?<eos> - If you insist.<eos> - I do.
You know how grumpy former employees tend to be Chatty Cathys.<eos> - And you came up with this.<eos> - I did.<eos> That's pretty impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Brittany, get an IT guy to blow these images up, and then all three of you go through this list, and find somebody that knows what this shit is.<eos> You don't think the video would be enough?<eos> With this judge?<eos> No, I don't.
It's all right.<eos> There's nothing nefarious in feeding.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> As soon as she's done... you're handing her back.<eos> There, there, my little sweet pea.<eos> There, there.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
That explains why Salib tried to kill him.<eos> Riggs had Jack's sat phone number.<eos> Jack got a call at the apartment.<eos> Yeah, but that was his wife.<eos> Come on.<eos> No. No, no.<eos> There's no way that Jack would give Salib his location.<eos> Not even to save his family in Afghanistan?<eos> Remember those dirt bikes we rode in Joshua Tree?<eos> Oh, yeah, of course I do.
Let me speak to Donald.<eos> He's not in.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> He's always in.<eos> Put him on, Nicole.<eos> He's not in.<eos> Therefore, I must by law allow this lawsuit to proceed.<eos> Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule.<eos> Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests.<eos> No, you don't.
You back-doored me to Cooperman.<eos> N-No.<eos> Not... It's...<eos> Spit it out.<eos> He emailed me last night, and he told me...<eos> That if Mr. McBride brought up Rachel Kennedy, I should hit back with...<eos> He told you to speak?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
Well, in any case, we're going to have to prove that this isn't a suicide letter.<eos> Oh, I got some leads on that.<eos> You did well at the hearing.<eos> I'm glad to hear you say that.<eos> I was starting to think you'd lost faith in me for some reason.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Free-floating anxiety.<eos> It wasn't because I reached out to Lucy Kittridge, was it?<eos> Why did you?
Run, Mikey, run!<eos> Molly!<eos> Molly!<eos> Molly!<eos> Molly!<eos> Molly!<eos> Mol!<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Hey, Harry. Have you seen Molly?<eos> Sure did.
Heather, you got any change?<eos> We're, uh...<eos> Oh, what are you doing?<eos> I'm selling all the stuff that Mom gave me that I don't like.<eos> - Please don't tell her.<eos> - Tell her?<eos> I'm gonna go grab a box of crap that she gave me.<eos> Honey, Jen just took someone from the yard sale over to Heather's house.<eos> I was wondering if you knew what was going on.<eos> I do not.
I can tell by the look on your face this is not a social call, Francis.<eos> Good news.<eos> We found out who stole the money.<eos> A Mason Reyes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I believe you know him.<eos> And his family.<eos> Well, he's 20, so we can charge him as an adult.<eos> The question is, how do you know him?<eos> I don't, personally.
In the Bronx, we decide indictments based on the merits of the case, not the last name of the defendants.<eos> Then let's let the merits of the case decide the outcome.<eos> Let's go, Nicky, we're done here.<eos> Wait, Mom...<eos> No.<eos> I'll make a statement.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I'm not allowing a statement.<eos> That's fine because Ms.Reagan-Boyle already got Kyle Miller to make a statement, vindicating her.<eos> He did?
But sir, there was one interesting thing.<eos> Apparently among the congregation there was a woman wearing a veil that completely obscured her face.<eos> A widow?<eos> Except that nobody could attest to her identity, sir.<eos> Apparently she slipped in late, spoke to nobody, and afterwards just vanished, as if into thin air.<eos> I can guarantee you she went out the door, George.<eos> Sir, either way, I suggest we keep an eye out for a mysterious veiled lady.<eos> - What do you make of that?<eos> - Looks like ivory.<eos> It certainly does.
But it was what my mother wanted.<eos> She always thought I would have a better life this way.<eos> - Does your husband know?<eos> - No.<eos> I was living as white when we met.<eos> So you thought your secret was safe, until your father came to town.<eos> All he really cared about was finding Gloria.<eos> - He had heard rumours she married rich.<eos> - He wanted money?<eos> Of course he did.
There's a note.<eos> "Off to invade Hortensia.<eos> Back in a jiffy."<eos> Looks like we definitely have the place to ourselves, huh, guys?<eos> - What's going on with them?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> What's that?<eos> You want to hear how we spent our evening?<eos> - No, he really doesn't.<eos> - No, I don't.
Galavant, the undead army is turning on us!<eos> I know.<eos> They're doing it here, too!<eos> - You can control the dead?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Not only control, but make them stronger.<eos> Ha! Seems Galavant has brought the wrong covered dish to the potluck dinner.<eos> Ha! They're kind of attacking everyone, our men included.<eos> Well, you make a cake, you break a few eggs.<eos> So, how do we do this?
A little privacy?<eos> You!<eos> You know this woman?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We spent a weekend together.<eos> In jail.<eos> The Regina Sumner case?<eos> Hi, Pam.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do!
Yeah, sure.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> If it isn't the soon-to-be-dead Mr. Wormwood.<eos> Oh, much better.<eos> Are you done?<eos> I just had these done.<eos> You know, you have no idea what that sword makes you do.<eos> Of course I do...<eos> Not.<eos> No, I don't.
Thank you.<eos> You can't park here.<eos> It's a red zone.<eos> Keep it!<eos> Roberta, wait!<eos> Put down that cat.<eos> Wha...<eos> Richard, you're... You're alive?<eos> You didn't go to war?<eos> No, I did.
You should ask Destiny.<eos> She's always sniffing around Mr. Boss' guys.<eos> You'd wrap your legs around anything with money, Sapphire.<eos> I saw you trying to get with a parking meter.<eos> DESTINY: Trinity.<eos> You hooked up with "The Stick" back in the day.<eos> A one-timer. I date CEOs, not gangsters.<eos> The night Cassidy bit it, she came back from her break screaming about how she just caught Nick banging some other chick, and that she was gonna send his ass to jail.<eos> Did anyone else see Nick here that night?<eos> We all did.
The night Cassidy bit it, she came back from her break screaming about how she just caught Nick banging some other chick, and that she was gonna send his ass to jail.<eos> Did anyone else see Nick here that night?<eos> We all did.<eos> He was completely wasted.<eos> He was practically passed out on the rails when I was on stage.<eos> Look, we know where Nick is.<eos> We've got squad cars heading over to pick him up as we speak.<eos> But if anyone knows who the other woman is...<eos> I saw Helvetica grinding him in the storage room once.<eos> You did not.
I'm looking to confirm that Brody Johnson is a leading suspect in the murder of Bailey Barker.<eos> Detective Babineaux?<eos> - Liv...<eos> - Okay, I get it.<eos> I won't quote you, but I just need official confirmation.<eos> Tell you what, I'll count down from five. If you hang up before I get to zero, I'll assume it's true.<eos> Five...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You asked me to go through Bailey's records.<eos> No, I didn't.
So during finals, I said, "I need to cram."<eos> I offer her a couple of twenties for a couple pills.<eos> She says, "Sure."<eos> And that's how Bailey got arrested.<eos> I'm sure Benedetto gave her the same deal.<eos> When I heard she was dead, I told him I wanted out, or I'd go above his head.<eos> He told me, I'd better not talk to anyone, unless I wanted to end up like Bailey.<eos> Thank you, buddy.<eos> Now, um, what informant did you say this was?<eos> - We didn't.
- Granted.<eos> None for me.<eos> I need to stay sharp.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I made a map and an inventory sheet.<eos> I'll laminate the map, but not the inventory.<eos> We'll need to update that as it changes.<eos> Ah, old Liv.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you the girl doesn't know how to party.<eos> Because you do.
I was like a praise-oholic.<eos> I thought I was past that, but apparently not.<eos> He made it sound like by not telling you about Drake I was somehow protecting him.<eos> But I don't think that that's really the case.<eos> Do I not praise you enough?<eos> Temporary insanity, that's all it was.<eos> I'm done with old me.<eos> You can trust me with almost anything.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I do.
Last thing I need's a lawsuit, am I right?<eos> (CHUCKLES) You mean Major didn't get the bar I made?<eos> (SIGHS) No, you did all you can. Thanks, Peyton.<eos> No. There's no more time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> Liv. I wasn't really expecting company.<eos> You said I should think things over.<eos> I did.
- I'm going to, I am.<eos> I'm dogged in my pursuit of this.<eos> I know you are, honey.<eos> You want this open or closed?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> I want it open. Leave it open.<eos> All right.<eos> It's a stupid chart.<eos> I never said you were stupid.<eos> Oh, yes, you did, and you don't do it again, and you definitely don't do it during the deposition.
We could leave.<eos> We just stay here and put up with this shit<eos> - for the money. - Right.<eos> Just like Leonard Letts stays at Borns Tech.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> No one ever died because Donald fucked them.<eos> And don't kid yourself.<eos> Lucy knows exactly what she's doing.<eos> You know who I really hate, though, right?<eos> - You do.
You know anything about that, Jason?<eos> Uh, when I was in sixth grade, uh, back when I was a kid,<eos> I, uh, had to do a school project, and, uh, I had to bury a family time capsule.<eos> But I'm not supposed to dig it up till I'm 21.<eos> There's a beer in it.<eos> We had a lot of stuff in there...<eos> Um, newspapers... pictures of the family, coins, stamps, some predictions.<eos> Father Anan came over last night.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
So if you happen to find yourself on the phone - with the commissioner...<eos> - Of course.<eos> We have an opportunity.<eos> Stunning break tonight in the case of the elusive serial killer known as Silver Bells.<eos> Rubble from the recent tunnel collapse revealed evidence connected to a victim killed back in 2002.<eos> ...a killer known for strangling his victims and leaving no trace at the scene except for his eerie calling card:<eos> a small silver handbell.<eos> ...six victims from 1999 to 2002, before the murders abruptly stopped and the case went cold.<eos> Many of you remember the terror that gripped our city during that time.<eos> I certainly do.
All right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm weird, too.<eos> Did you know cicadas spend 17 years underground, and then emerge and immediately shed their shell?<eos> They spend all that time building it, and then just leave it behind.<eos> Do you know... that if you cut a worm in half, both sides stay alive?<eos> Jack.<eos> Let me talk to your Uncle Garrett for a minute, okay?<eos> You said you'd never come back.<eos> I did.
You think that should be enough, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that should be enough.<eos> See, the tricky part was making Callen and Sam impressive, but not so impressive that Flibbit goes,<eos> "Hey, why have we never heard of these guys?"<eos> So I tapped into an oversaturated yet popular market with the coders.<eos> Check it out.<eos> You invented an energy drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> Callen and Sam did.
- Good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I gotta get to work here.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - So...<eos> Listen.<eos> I know you only go to the meetings because you got a nudge from the judge.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> - But if you ever need someone to talk to...<eos> - I don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where else to go.<eos> Her name is Pamela Aguirre if you could just look into it.<eos> Bye, Meg.<eos> Janey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'll see you guys later.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I just thought maybe we could get a coffee or something.<eos> I don't...
- No?<eos> You never know what else is out there.<eos> People start digging in, you'd be surprised the dirt they find.<eos> How's the tire coming?<eos> Almost there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> My parents don't usually like me drinking coffee.<eos> That should be the least of their worries.<eos> Do you smoke weed?<eos> I do.
- So, you did force them to stay away?<eos> You know what, you're young, there is no way you can possibly understand this, honey.<eos> I can't believe how much bullshit you fed us.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Everything you told us about family<eos> - is a lie. - No, it's not.<eos> Yeah, this family treated Danny like shit for years.<eos> Is that a lie?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> - Oh, yes, I do.
It's clear to me you're in no financial shape to join our group.<eos> He's got till the end of the day, Dad.<eos> I know this means a lot to you, James.<eos> Get the money.<eos> What is this for?<eos> It's for, um... I'll tell you later.<eos> Thank you, T.<eos> Tommy, why'd you do that to Holly?<eos> Ghost told me what happened.<eos> He did?
Keep trying.<eos> My eyes in the sky.<eos> Two Hornets on the horizon.<eos> Should have visual in less than five.<eos> Private jet is outside restricted airspace, but not for long.<eos> Over metro D.C. in less than 30.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hell of a day to quit smoking.<eos> Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.<eos> I don't.
I know you prefer to wait until the autopsy to actually talk about the bodies, Doctor, but can we talk about the bodies, Doctor?<eos> No.<eos> I just couldn't help but notice the absence of any cyanosis on any of the fingers or any of the toes of any of the bodies. Mr. Palmer.<eos> At least some sign of hypoxia.<eos> I mean, it's weird.<eos> We won't know what it is until... Until we do the autopsy.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Yes.<eos> But if I didn't know any better...<eos> Well, clearly you don't.
NCIS Agents Pride and Lasalle.<eos> You alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of people lookin' for you.<eos> We gotta get you to safety.<eos> Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
Sure, but it makes shitty coffee.<eos> How would you explain one phone not appearing anywhere for several days?<eos> The battery and sim card were removed.<eos> No. The phone was used to make calls.<eos> You can make a phone disappear.<eos> But you need special technology that erases the location data in real time.<eos> It fits in a briefcase.<eos> - Do we know how to do that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Who else does?
I care more about your need to tell me.<eos> But truthfully, I'm not curious.<eos> Isn't that part of your job?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> Those who see blue rats are always right.<eos> I've given 30 years to the company.<eos> And I've been unfailingly loyal.<eos> I really believed in it.<eos> And I still do.
Let's just concentrate on the matter at hand.<eos> Now we know the clipping book shows us events that have happened or are about to happen, so obviously there are so many events on the horizon, that it overloaded.<eos> You know, we could do this a lot more quickly if we could just use a reconstituting spell.<eos> We don't use magic, Cass.<eos> We're Librarians.<eos> - We use our brains.<eos> - Yes, but my brain is telling me we should use magic.<eos> I mean, we have the greatest collection of magic in the whole world, right here in this building.<eos> And we never put it work for us.<eos> - I do.

I mean, them running around, gathering up artifacts they don't understand.<eos> The consequences could be catastrophic.<eos> Well, we'll have to keep our eye on them.<eos> What about Apep?<eos> He's still out there.<eos> I think that without the Ankh, and without a host body to inhabit, we don't have much to worry about there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> All right, let's get this over with.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, yes you do.
Yes.<eos> Can it... be nice?<eos> Well, that's on you.<eos> Let me know by 9:00.<eos> - What if we die before then?<eos> - There's not much I can do about that.<eos> Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made,<eos> - am I right?<eos> - No, they don't.
- Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.<eos> - What-what are you doing?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Are you breaking up with me?<eos> Why you hate me?<eos> Why you hate me so much?<eos> - I don't...<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> - Oh, my God, you don't?
You said you're roommates.<eos> Damn.<eos> Bitten by my own snake.<eos> So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - Yes. - Chicago.<eos> So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.<eos> I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.<eos> I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.<eos> Who does?
Can you back that up, please?<eos> Ok.<eos> Right there, he reaches in his jacket.<eos> Can you blow that up?<eos> Sure.<eos> He's showing her credentials.<eos> The LAPD detectives are incredibly proud of their badges.<eos> They wear them clipped to their belt or jacket or on a chain.<eos> They don't carry creds.<eos> No. But we do.
Wait.<eos> Come on.<eos> What else is there?<eos> How did you get here, Derek?<eos> They kidnapped me, from the grocery store. Uhh!<eos> I was buying food for dinner.<eos> For who?<eos> Savannah.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes, I--I do.
What part of my contract?<eos> It's their costs.<eos> Costs?<eos> Oh, oh, it's $3.1 million in costs?<eos> Promotional, touring...<eos> They didn't promote my album.<eos> ...CD packaging and breakage.<eos> Almost everything was online.<eos> I mean, I don't... I don't... I don't remember negotiating any of this stuff.<eos> You probably didn't.
- They said it.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> Come back to Lockhart/Agos.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You fired me.<eos> And I've never worked there.<eos> We want you back.<eos> And we want you to come with her.<eos> Diane does?
NCIS Agents Pride and Lasalle.<eos> You alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of people lookin' for you.<eos> We gotta get you to safety.<eos> Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
And he mocked you.<eos> He still mocks you.<eos> More.<eos> You can sense it, even as he threatens people's livelihood with this case, that they're rooting for him.<eos> Imagine everything... everything that they have you gave them.<eos> And it is so, so wrong.<eos> God, it feels so good.<eos> You didn't have to go that far.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
I'm gonna have to get that out of my head.<eos> Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> Thank you, sisters.<eos> Do you feel the love? all:<eos> Yes.<eos> You feel it in your hearts? all:<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you feel it in your souls?<eos> All: Yes.<eos> Well, I don't.
Satan follows.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he is here with us right now.<eos> - All: No!<eos> - Yep.<eos> He's here right now. all:<eos> No! And make no mistake about it.<eos> What he wants is your immortal soul.<eos> - All:<eos> No! - He does.
Yes, okay.<eos> And we can try again.<eos> Like we did last time.<eos> What's happening?<eos> It divides the spectrum into bands.<eos> If there's anything there, we should get an image.<eos> Got some Aramaic here.<eos> And some form of Latin.<eos> I think what you got here is very, very old.<eos> We do too.
Of course!<eos> I'd like to eat this fish but I don't think it would be safe.<eos> I know you killed Vera Blanchett... ..and let an innocent boy swing for it.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Father.<eos> Your work took you to the Crown Court regularly.<eos> That's where you met Vera.<eos> She was young, impressionable.<eos> You were a Detective Sergeant.<eos> How could she refuse you?<eos> But she did.
Not every man who invites you out to lunch will turn out to be a murderer.<eos> And I didn't even get to taste the Dover sole.<eos> It is the merest of consolation, but I do believe that George is repentant about what he did to Vera and Thomas.<eos> And I suppose that's why he poisoned Henry as well.<eos> I'm not convinced it was him, actually.<eos> How can you even question it?<eos> His denial seemed sincere.<eos> And I don't believe he would have chosen hemlock.<eos> Nobody in their right mind would choose hemlock.<eos> Plato did.
You are a genius, Mrs McCarthy.<eos> Socrates chose hemlock for his own execution, and so did you.<eos> What?<eos> Thomas Lightman showed you that the justice system you had given your life to was corrupt.<eos> Made you wonder how many other innocent people you had hanged.<eos> The shock made you give up your job, the Church and embrace the bottle.<eos> I suspect you were looking for life's exit door before you left your own party.<eos> But when Iris Lightman told you the name of the monster who had caused you all this grief, it was the final straw.<eos> And you had to know George very well to know that he was Max.<eos> And you did, didn't you, Henry?
To a select group of highly vetted guests.<eos> Where it will be surrounded by my men.<eos> If Frenchie's moronic enough to turn up, we'll nab him.<eos> He's a master of disguise.<eos> I assume there's a point to all this.<eos> I'm one of the few people that can identify him.<eos> Let me be your eyes and ears, my Lord.<eos> You can see yourself out.<eos> I answer to a higher authority than you, Inspector.<eos> Indeed he does.
Prior to marriage, she signed a prenuptial agreement.<eos> My father was guaranteed full custody.<eos> She was guaranteed visitation, a small amount for living expenses.<eos> She lived her last few months in a modest flat in the East End.<eos> So modest in fact that it went up like a tinder box when the neighbor's water heater caught fire.<eos> Yeah, pretty sure the smoke would've got her before the, uh...<eos> So I didn't speak to my father for two years after that.<eos> You held him responsible.<eos> I did.<eos> You still do.
We don't want to be late.<eos> The risk you are putting us through is enormous.<eos> I need to get to court.<eos> What a sight you all are for me.<eos> You may find my appearance odd.<eos> Remember, I am in no pain.<eos> You are my people.<eos> I'm your people.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, so help you God?<eos> Yes, I do.
No.<eos> And what can be more evil than that?<eos> Not evil.<eos> Not entire-- tirely.<eos> I know.<eos> It's what makes this so sad.<eos> How could they have deliberated for one day?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Oh, did you call Gina?<eos> - No, Marva did.
I'd like to talk to my old friend.<eos> Just a few minutes.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hate to see this happen to you.<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> You know me, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know you.<eos> I sure do.
I hate to see this happen to you.<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> You know me, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know you.<eos> I sure do.<eos> And that feels good.<eos> To be known.<eos> But...you think you're the good guy, don't you?<eos> No, Donnie, I don't.
The rest-- you know, love, relationships, family-- these are things I know nothing about.<eos> This is what the Armory can provide me.<eos> So will I do whatever it takes for answers?<eos> In a heartbeat.<eos> Flag on the play.<eos> Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone.<eos> We'll call you when we connect.<eos> Come on, Bon. I want to beat traffic.<eos> You know where he is.<eos> Yeah, I do, Enzo.
I don't believe he'd hurt you, any of you.<eos> We needed that film.<eos> She knew it.<eos> None of you watched that film.<eos> I did.<eos> You take me to the Man in the High Castle.<eos> Take me and I can describe it to him frame by frame.<eos> You've got a lot of goddamn nerve. Ask him.<eos> Ask him if he wants to see me.<eos> Already did.
You know I did.<eos> The general has arrived.<eos> Aren't you going to arrest me?<eos> You did not shoot the Crown Prince.<eos> As a Jew, you know I need no charges to order your death.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Then you will accept your friend's confession.<eos> Confession?<eos> He confessed?<eos> I did it, okay?
Okay.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> So much for surprising him.<eos> Oh, we'll think of something else.<eos> We always do.<eos> What if...?<eos> What if I could burn our names off the gravestones that Hades made for us, the ones holding us here?<eos> I looked for a spell like that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Actually, it does.
Being a hero is not about compassion and having forgiveness.<eos> It's about strength!<eos> Doing whatever it takes to defeat your enemies.<eos> But Rumple isn't even your real enemy.<eos> Hades is.<eos> Why do you defend Rumplestiltskin?<eos> He kidnapped you.<eos> He made you a servant.<eos> You should want him dead, too.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't.
Take it from a man who trades in deals.<eos> It matters very much.<eos> What was the deal, Belle?<eos> Look, I tell you, you got to promise me something.<eos> You have to promise me you won't hurt Gaston no matter what you learn.<eos> Belle, you can trust me.<eos> All right.<eos> He said that if I let you and Gaston face each other and one of you ends up in the River of Souls, he'll then tear up the contract on our baby.<eos> And you turned him down.<eos> Of course I did.
Yeah.<eos> We all could.<eos> This round's on me.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Oh, no. I've got it.<eos> A.L.I.E.'s gone.<eos> Yeah. I figured.<eos> Clarke, you're not acting like someone who just saved the world.<eos> Because we didn't...
I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.<eos> I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What?<eos> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.

I should go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's true what I said.<eos> Um, it's a really bad neighborhood.<eos> I could walk you to your car at least.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm just so cold.<eos> I still love her, you know? I mean, I really love her.<eos> Yo, man, I hate to tell you this, but I got to close up shop.<eos> Sure, of course you do.
This time, motherfucker, you need to choose me.<eos> I do.<eos> I choose you, all right? I'll leave it alone.<eos> I hope so.<eos> - Tommy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Ruiz hit me up... about that payment.<eos> He ain't never gonna reach his full potential unless we set up a meet, you know, between he and Milan.<eos> You know how that motherfucker is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I said I'd give you a ride home... - Oh...<eos> - but we got to break now.<eos> Well, guess that's good night for me too, then.<eos> Gentlemen, a pleasure.<eos> It's a beautiful car.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My father used to own one just like it... well, for a little while.<eos> Hey, Ruiz...<eos> You know what it's like to be betrayed.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Ghost...<eos> If we're gonna do this... kill Milan...<eos> I call the shots.<eos> I'll come up with a plan.<eos> Call you in the morning.<eos> Tommy, I didn't expect to see you back tonight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A few days ago, you asked me if I was one of you.<eos> I did.<eos> Yeah, you did.
What do you mean she's not in school?<eos> You got one of those?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Right above my tramp stamp.<eos> Is it a tumor?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Regan!<eos> ETU's suddenly a breeding facility.<eos> I didn't see that one coming.<eos> No one did.
And whatever they look like on the surface... they're monsters underneath.<eos> CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 2012<eos> You're ruthless.<eos> World domination cometh.<eos> You get the killer instinct from your parents?<eos> My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit.<eos> Not about me.<eos> No one does.
You've killed for the ETU.<eos> Jackson told me we had to, to save people.<eos> - That we needed to stop you.<eos> - What did your parents tell you?<eos> Not much.<eos> Are they still alive?<eos> The humans know more than I do.<eos> The ETU has more intel on us than they've shared with you.<eos> They know exactly where your parents are, I don't.<eos> Well, who does, Jackson?
I have your gun.<eos> And this.<eos> Who knows you're here?<eos> You killed her.<eos> And then made yourself look like her.<eos> - Flynn...<eos> - I know what you are.<eos> I've seen one.<eos> I know what's inside you.<eos> No, you don't.
It doesn't make any fu... sense.<eos> You're a survivor, Flynn.<eos> I only keep on going because of you.<eos> Me too.<eos> You're all I've got.<eos> I love you.<eos> You shouldn't have come looking for me.<eos> Why didn't you tell me the truth?<eos> Think how you would've reacted.<eos> Other Hunters did.
That's why I had to see her yesterday.<eos> If you loved her so much... then why did you leave?<eos> They wanted me out, said I'd "gone native."<eos> - McCarthy?<eos> - Everyone.<eos> But I refused to come in.<eos> I had a family, you and Emme.<eos> I couldn't imagine living without you even if it meant being someone I never really was.<eos> I wanted you more.<eos> I still do.
You okay?<eos> I can't talk about this on the phone.<eos> Can you please get down here?<eos> It's important I see you now.<eos> Emme, I'm really sorry.<eos> I gotta take care of something.<eos> Just a quick work trip.<eos> I'll see you as soon as I get back.<eos> - Flynn, you don't understand.<eos> - I do.
Hunters molt.<eos> They click.<eos> They have shells.<eos> And they have nuclear weapons.<eos> I think that you,<eos> Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?<eos> By turning her against her own kind?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
You know how you came to look like you do?<eos> I chose this body for you, a vehicle to keep you safe and strong.<eos> You killed someone for their body?<eos> For you!<eos> I chose well.<eos> - I was a child.<eos> A baby!<eos> - That baby would have died anyway.<eos> Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum.<eos> I did it a favor and I did it for you!
He should be healing, I don't understand.<eos> The wound is too deep.<eos> His human body needs human medicine.<eos> Hold him down.<eos> Is he going to be okay?<eos> Shh.<eos> He saved us at the hotel.<eos> - What were you doing there?<eos> - Trying to help.<eos> And I did.
It's now or never.<eos> Then why bother?<eos> I did Musa's dirty work, you know?<eos> Killed and terrorized while he Elon Musk'd it and played philosopher king.<eos> Revenge.<eos> How primitive.<eos> Yes.<eos> We understand each other.<eos> Not even close.<eos> Oh, but we do.
His overpaid investigators were making zero progress with them, after all.<eos> And you have?<eos> They're of little use in tracking his shooters.<eos> Nine-millimeter, hollow point, American-made.<eos> Obtainable almost anywhere in the world.<eos> They do however, help me enter the mind of whoever might have wanted to murder my father.<eos> Not a long walk, I confess.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, do you remember Fiona Helbron?<eos> I do.
I can't tell if you're, if you're happy to see me, or...<eos> I'm very happy to see you.<eos> Would you like to kiss me?<eos> Asking 'cause I'd like you to.<eos> Um, Fiona...<eos> I've been, uh, thinking about you.<eos> Spending time with you that day, I enjoyed it.<eos> That doesn't happen very often.<eos> Also, you're very handsome, and you smell nice.<eos> A lot of people don't.
Oh.<eos> Called ourselves The Mul-TAP-Liers.<eos> Multipliers, get it?<eos> (chuckling):<eos> Oh. We were good, too.<eos> I mean, you're not a little mortified, showing this photo?<eos> Why would I be?<eos> DORFMAN:<eos> As a matter of fact, we, uh, tapped our way into quite a few theater girl" hearts, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.
Me, too, Gibbs?<eos> (phone rings) No.<eos> Keep digging on our gangbanger.<eos> Yeah, Duck.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm on my way down.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> It was nothing, Doctor.<eos> You would have found it eventually.<eos> But I didn't, Mr. Palmer.
My night crew won't be in for a few hours, but you guys are welcome to stick around.<eos> Actually, it's '90s Night, in case you guys want to relive some of your glory days later.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Glory days?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Show off some of those old dance moves?<eos> A little "Can't Touch This."<eos> What's your surveillance situation?<eos> Do you have security cameras?<eos> Of course I do.
Me.<eos> Right behind you.<eos> Tiffany.<eos> I run Daly Tech's Pet GPS division.<eos> And pretty much everything else.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't here to meet you.<eos> I was on a call with a potential investor.<eos> Kickstarter can only take you so far these days.<eos> Did you bring the fragment with the serial and batch numbers?<eos> Uh, yes, I did.
I know the legal system thinks of animals as property, but I don't.<eos> Whatever dog this came out of has the same rights as you and me.<eos> It didn't come out of a dog.<eos> It came out of a person.<eos> Your product is being used in human trafficking.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> This piece came from a bulk shipment to a company called Vanderhusen Industries.<eos> All I have listed for them is a P.O. box number.<eos> Do you still think this is connected to your old case?<eos> I do.
Minus the bitter.<eos> The bitter makes you you.<eos> I delight in your bitter.<eos> I delight in you.<eos> Diamond.<eos> Saddle up.<eos> Your partner's gonna meet you at the Cuban Chancellery.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, today is the last day to sign the boys up for the read-a-thon.<eos> Done.
If I die, I will die doing what's right for Cuba.<eos> That's it.<eos> You're putting your life in your own hands.<eos> No. I'm putting it in yours.<eos> We have to assume Sergei Mishnev has heard everything we've said, on the phone and at the chancellery.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, then, all of our old plans are scrapped.<eos> We are gonna have to make calls on the fly.<eos> But we have ADA Lambert standing by in case we run into any legal red tape.<eos> Of course we do.
Yes, he will.<eos> Please, Milly, you have to stop this.<eos> It isn't safe.<eos> We can talk about this, sort it out on the ground.<eos> Please!<eos> Milly, this is a really bad idea.<eos> How can you prove that this woman even existed?<eos> Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.<eos> Well, what if they don't?
What were you and Alexander going to do after the funeral?<eos> I'm moving to London in a month to train as a nurse.<eos> Alexander was going to meet me there.<eos> You know, leave this stupid feud behind us.<eos> Alexander felt guilty, especially about leaving Ian.<eos> But he loved you more.<eos> At least this way, with the insurance, he could make sure they were properly looked after.<eos> How did you persuade Dr Harris and the undertakers to help you?<eos> Oh, I know all about Dr Harris and his wandering hands.<eos> But his wife doesn't.
I'll fetch you a nice cup of tea and there'll be no need for any more wandering around.<eos> Gaga!<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> But it was the best I could think of on the spot.<eos> That was the best you could think of?<eos> Well, it got you out of a sticky situation.<eos> A situation I would not be in were it not for you!<eos> So... did you find out what was in that file?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Oh, hello, Doctor!<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> Goodfellow, how about you do another sweep of the house?<eos> CAMERA BULB PLINKS And was it just you and Calvin in the house, last night?<eos> And Wallace here, my butler.<eos> Any sign of a break-in?<eos> I've got this, Padre.<eos> The house was securely locked from the inside, I made sure of it.<eos> Mr Twyman, do you know of anyone who would want to hurt your son?<eos> Well, do you?
I came as quickly as I could.<eos> We've caught our killer.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Robert Twyman.<eos> Robert Twyman killed his own son?<eos> And he's just killed someone else.<eos> Rosie Everton, a local journalist - killed at her piano.<eos> Oh, my dear Lord!<eos> Did you know Rosie?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
Brilliant journalists don't need to break the Official Secrets Act to get their stories.<eos> That's hardly a crime, compared with what you and Robert did.<eos> We were found innocent.<eos> No, you weren't convicted.<eos> You knew you were fitting faulty parts.<eos> But you put profit over safety.<eos> When did Calvin find out?<eos> I... I don't think he did.<eos> Then, why kill him?<eos> I didn't!
To feel the pain of what it's like to lose your own son.<eos> And how do you feel about Rosie's death?<eos> She did her best to get justice for your son.<eos> She lost her job, then she lost her life.<eos> I... I'm sorry about that.<eos> Then, confess.<eos> He's the one that has to confess.<eos> That's between him and God.<eos> Vengeance doesn't bring peace.<eos> Then...what does?
I think that was a squirrel.<eos> And in any case, you stand a better chance of reaching a peaceful resolution if you just calm down.<eos> I'm not going to calm down while some maniac's stalking my fiance.<eos> He's not a maniac.<eos> He's a man with a broken heart, and he deserves some understanding.<eos> Just wait till tomorrow.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'll drive you back after the gig at the hotel.<eos> Should you really be letting her do that in here?<eos> Do what?
SHE GASPS Tommy... No.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you're still looking for clues...<eos> That means you think the voodoo priest was innocent?<eos> - His name was Emmanuel. - Oh...<eos> If he broke in last night, then why did he pick the lock today?<eos> Why not come in the same way?<eos> I can't believe I didn't see it before.<eos> - Didn't see what exactly?<eos> - None of us did.
I went outside in the daytime.<eos> Nina's on her way in.<eos> You know, she's the executive who discovered me at that storytelling show.<eos> I'm running behind, so you need to order me lunch.<eos> I want a kale salad with a side of kale and a kale shake, and tomorrow better book me a kale-onic.<eos> Caroline, what are you doing?<eos> You're dressed all wrong.<eos> Yours is a "riches to rags" story, a story we'll never sell if you go in there wearing that.<eos> I have a huge hole near the crotch in my panty hose, if that helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Let me just grab something to wear.<eos> I hope that isn't Lawrence saying that he needs the place for an hour because Ben Affleck is here with a nanny...<eos> Jude Law is here with a nanny...<eos> Gavin Rossdale is here with a nanny.<eos> Hi, girls.<eos> Hey, we've got a lady that looks like you at home.<eos> Wow, nice room.<eos> Sophie, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, after Max talked me into not adopting...<eos> - I did?
Everybody get down!<eos> Get back!<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on. Get out of the way!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> Drop it!<eos> I got a vest on.<eos> Do you? They'll be cleaning you off the walls for a week.<eos> Do it!
Get back!<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on. Get out of the way!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> Drop it!<eos> I got a vest on.<eos> Do you? They'll be cleaning you off the walls for a week.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
She's got a mole that doesn't look right.<eos> Steve, are you still here?<eos> Got to go.<eos> Right cheek.<eos> Of course I was a stripper.<eos> Seeing a lot of Steve these days, huh?<eos> Well, I can't afford a gym membership.<eos> I got to get my cardio in somehow.<eos> - Come on, you like him.<eos> - I do.
Oh, and, Roy...<eos> 'I love you.'<eos> And I hate me, Aggie, and I really have to go now.<eos> Bye.<eos> What did I say about the hair?<eos> You think it's me.<eos> What?<eos> You all think it's me who killed her.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, I don't.
Why?<eos> Because she was a thwarted singer?<eos> She was bitter and twisted that she never made it.<eos> As soon as she discovered I was a music teacher, she never stopped talking about her singing!<eos> How she'd given it up to get married, like she was the only one who ever had a dream.<eos> She'd have done anything she could to crush Berenice's hopes.<eos> And you couldn't have that.<eos> Berenice's confidence would never have recovered.<eos> And she deserves the chance to feel good about herself.<eos> We all do.

So, tell me, what are you doing this side of London?<eos> You'll come out in a rash soon.<eos> Oh, you know, bit of this, bit of that.<eos> I'll explain why, but what can I get you?<eos> The usual - double macchiato with a twist, yeah?<eos> Oh! Sorry.<eos> Bill!<eos> Paul Bladen.<eos> You went out with him last night.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Okay.<eos> So, Kelly, uh, we wanted to clear the air about something.<eos> JOSH: Yeah.<eos> We think you probably know what it's about.<eos> There's something between us, and I know you're feeling it, too.<eos> And we really like you.<eos> And we were wondering if...<eos> I don't want to have sex with you!<eos> - What? - What?<eos> I do!
But now, you're gonna forgive me and tell me that you still love me.<eos> Am I?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Because you have to let all of this fairytale stuff go, Gabi.<eos> Life isn't a fairytale.<eos> Nothing's perfect. Nobody's perfect.<eos> First dates aren't perfect, life is just messy<eos> - and complicated, and...<eos> - Okay, I forgive you.<eos> - You do?
I need Calloway here right away.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You ain't believing this crap, are you, King?<eos> Don't know what to believe.<eos> He's just stalling us until the attack.<eos> NCIS.<eos> Maybe so, but he's our only link.<eos> That's why I need to talk to Calloway direct.<eos> Find him?<eos> No, but NOPD did.
Thanks. Careful.<eos> I made it a little strong this morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, that will wake the dead.<eos> Certainly make your job a lot easier.<eos> One interview,<eos> "He's the guy who killed me," case closed.<eos> Castle, I'm guessing that you found out something about your missing time, and that's what you want to catch up with me on. Uh...<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Actually, yeah, I did. Um...
So then tell me, what was he struggling with?<eos> What did he need to set right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Way to face-plant in front of a superior, Decker.<eos> This is Captain Beckett.<eos> Captain, I...<eos> You're dismissed, recruit.<eos> That was a little harsh, don't you think?<eos> I do not.
Say the word.<eos> I'm not making any more decisions concerning LokSat without Beckett.<eos> Now that is the smartest thing I've heard all day!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Okay, I'll get you more aspirin.<eos> You are not quitting.<eos> I'm unfit to be a cop, Captain.<eos> If you hadn't talked me down back there...<eos> I had every intention of pulling that trigger.<eos> But you didn't.
- Cock?<eos> Sam. How about... penguins?<eos> - Lovely!<eos> Excellent choice, Fred.<eos> ♪ I'll sing you a song about penguins and... ♪<eos> Oh, oh, my God.<eos> Oh, no, no!<eos> It's good.<eos> One more go, one more go.<eos> - Just do it again.
TABLE SHAKES Oh!<eos> Why am I the only ones drunk?<eos> Cos you drank everyone's wine.<eos> Sam, help me, would you?<eos> - Sam?<eos> - Yeah. So, Lulu...<eos> - Pretty full-on, yeah.<eos> - She's trying to piss me off.<eos> She doesn't actually want to have sex with you.<eos> - She does. - She doesn't.

I'm not comfortable taking my...<eos> being naked.<eos> I understand the whole desexualised art thing, yes, but I'm just... No.<eos> OK...<eos> No.<eos> - D'accord.<eos> - I mean, I know I shouldn't care, not in this situation, but, I hate my body and I wish I had the sort of body confidence to just drape myself all over everything, but it's just, well,<eos> it's not like I don't think I'm... No.<eos> - You hate your body?<eos> Of course I do.

No.<eos> - You hate your body?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Everybody does.
Up my arse, yeah?<eos> Do you want me to shit on your face?<eos> - You want that too?<eos> - I'm up for anything.<eos> - What else do you want?<eos> - Get your dick out.<eos> - This isn't quite how...<eos> - Come on, Sam.<eos> - Punch me in the face, fuck me up the arse.<eos> Do it!
I will go shower.<eos> Since our imprint curates exclusive content for millennial readers, we're excited to launch our first title:<eos> "The Deciding Decade:<eos> Making Your Twenties Matter."<eos> The eBook will hyperlink to the author's genre-leading podcast and all social platforms.<eos> And for print, we're using biodegradable ink on 100% recycled, fair-trade paper.<eos> Yes. I like all that.<eos> Tap that.<eos> Uh, don't your people use Tap That?<eos> Of course we do.
Want a hit?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> There you are.<eos> I was scared you were hiding from me.<eos> Were you hiding from me?<eos> What is it?<eos> If it's something I did or said...<eos> No, oh... oh, my God, you...<eos> you didn't do anything.
May I ask who's calling?<eos> Mmm-hmm. It's your father.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Hal has asked to see the police.<eos> Fortunately, the attending physician is an old family friend.<eos> Knew to call me first.<eos> Is there anything we should know about what happened to Hal?<eos> Look, Grace, maybe your father and I should...<eos> If this is about Hal and other women, I know.<eos> So does Betty.
(CHUCKLING) All right, man.<eos> All right.<eos> You should get a job making people nervous.<eos> (STAMMERING) No, I will.<eos> I just got some stuff.<eos> You know?<eos> Some lyrics and whatnot.<eos> You understand.<eos> No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do. I do, for sure.
-Damn.<eos> And, I mean, he got proof?<eos> I mean, were you even there?<eos> I don't live there anymore.<eos> You know, he kicked me out.<eos> He didn't care.<eos> I didn't have nothing.<eos> Hey, man, I had to enlist when my dad kicked me out.<eos> That's how bad off I was.<eos> I almost did that.
I think you should call Kot, just in case he's trying to intimidate you for testifying against Freddie.<eos> Lucas?<eos> I'm Lieutenant Casey.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You pulled my dad out, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... a lot of people are looking for you.<eos> I don't want to see them.<eos> [somber music] I didn't, either.
Yeah, and I bet you were the one that blabbed about Jelly Bean too.<eos> We're just worried about you, that's all.<eos> Yeah, you got a hell of a way of showing it.<eos> Hey. Knock it off.<eos> Look, it sucks to lose somebody, okay?<eos> Believe me, I've been there.<eos> [stirring music] I'm not trying to tell you how to grieve, okay, but you are gonna lose your job, and if that's what you want, fine.<eos> You can keep pushing everybody away.<eos> But I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> None of us do.
So do infectious diseases.<eos> Right, uh, so I guess Men Now really is taking off.<eos> I guess you'll just have to keep all those profits to yourself. Please.<eos> Money means nothing to me.<eos> Right, which is probably why you're driving around in those junky cars.<eos> No, we bought those junk boxes because driving around in nice cars got too expensive.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times some feminazi shattered their windshields or keyed their cars.<eos> Forensic evidence shows that Emil was struck multiple times in the head.<eos> Do you know of anyone who threatened him?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
I-I found found multiple postmortem blunt force trauma injuries to the skull.<eos> It's almost like he broke up the skull to conceal the victim's identity.<eos> But the teeth are still intact.<eos> Which means he wasn't trying to obfuscate identity.<eos> Wow, it's crazy.<eos> It's almost as if he saw the victim as still alive, and... and he became angry, and he had to kill her all over again.<eos> As I said, the evidence thus far is anything but normal.<eos> ♪ Bones 11x13 ♪ The Monster in the Closet Original Air Date on April 28, 2016<eos> You know, Angela can make a digital copy of that if you want to step out of the Stone Age.<eos> No, she already did.
We won't know whether the gunshot wound was fatal.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Wow. Oh, my God.<eos> These are incredible.<eos> Each is a piece of my soul.<eos> That's what photography is, Angela.<eos> It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.<eos> Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?<eos> You don't.
I don't care about any of the stuff in this folder.<eos> I need you.<eos> See you at home.<eos> It's a beautiful thing you've done for them, Booth.<eos> Kenny's done bad things.<eos> He's paid the price, but you know, he's taking responsibility.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> He deserves a second chance.<eos> And a family.<eos> They both do.
No!<eos> Mike look out!<eos> I made it.<eos> I'm finally free.<eos> Miiiiiike!<eos> I sees it.<eos> Vermont.<eos> Better than I ever dreamt.<eos> I made it, Philly.<eos> I did it.
I have someone very special in mind.<eos> Group Captain Townsend?<eos> - Are you missing him?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Very much.<eos> And are you missing your sister, Her Majesty, the Queen?<eos> Not quite as much, no.<eos> Why on earth did you say that?<eos> - What?<eos> I did! And I do.
You may tell your employer that I donna have time to see him today.<eos> Actually, I believe you have time right now.<eos> Langmead and Langmead, Lemont Furs,<eos> Levesque and Sons.<eos> You are familiar with these companies?<eos> Aye, so?<eos> So each of them are illegally conducting trade in the north in territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company, just as you are.<eos> The most successful is a man named Peter Carruthers,<eos> Carruthers and Co. You know him?<eos> What if I do?
Again, it's complicated.<eos> Because you're helping his brother... Who's a good vampire.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So this good vampire... Does he feed on people, too?<eos> Does he kill them?<eos> Stefan...<eos> I mean, not right now, but...<eos> It's complicated?<eos> The thing is, I've just spent the past few days with you learning about how much you hate vampires and what they did to your town.<eos> I do.
Bonnie Bennett is a close second.<eos> Looking for a bottle to celebrate?<eos> I gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Got your text.<eos> I didn't think you'd be able to kill her.<eos> Actually, my exact message read:<eos> "She's taken care of."<eos> Yeah, she's taken care of.<eos> What, so you didn't kill her?<eos> I did.
- Um, if I win...<eos> - When you win.<eos> I want to know who's behind all this.<eos> This has never happened to me before.<eos> __<eos> We're not gonna kill anyone, are we?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to know that up front.<eos> Renard is cooperating with Black Claw.<eos> Did he know that Dixon was gonna be assassinated?<eos> Not at the time, but he does now.
I swear to God, I will kill that guy.<eos> Because of that.<eos> He asked me for money and when I said no, he got angry.<eos> He was gonna hurt me and then Adalind came in.<eos> She told him she was gonna call the cops, and then he went after her and it just... it just happened.<eos> She broke every finger on his hand without even touching him, and then he ran away.<eos> She didn't want it to happen, but it did.<eos> She was scared of what you'd do to her.<eos> I told her she had to tell you, Nick.<eos> Well, she didn't.
- I came as fast as I could.<eos> I hear you contacted Shapur Zamani.<eos> I got them to come to Paris.<eos> I had forbid you to contact him.<eos> But then you...<eos> What?<eos> Changed your mind.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Guillaume Debailly persuaded you.<eos> He did?
He says they're stupid.<eos> Does he play?<eos> Why you think he's called "Toufik Al-wyraq Dakin"?<eos> It's his favorite color?<eos> No. "wyraq Dakin".<eos> Deep Blue.<eos> The computer that beat Kasparov.<eos> What's this?<eos> You didn't turn them off?<eos> Of course I did.
There's something I never told you.<eos> That I've never told anyone.<eos> It's weighing on me.<eos> I've been back for almost a year.<eos> I've been in Paris for a year.<eos> I still haven't told my father.<eos> He thinks I'm still on a mission.<eos> I've been back for a year and my father doesn't know.<eos> - Your daughter doesn't see him?<eos> - She does.
"In light of the seriousness of the charges<eos> "and the need to swiftly repair the affront brought against the Iranian people,<eos> "the defendant has been sentenced by presidential order,<eos> "without further ado."<eos> 100 years' imprisonment<eos> Guillaume Debailly.<eos> Isn't he here?<eos> "You know your father a little better now.<eos> "I don't know what good that does you.<eos> "Whether it does good or bad.
That's why your mother and I do what we do... to keep things like that from happening.<eos> Do you really think it makes a difference?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just hope we're all together when it happens.<eos> - Paige.<eos> - And quick.<eos> It's better if we just... get wiped out straightaway than get sick or anything.<eos> You shouldn't have to think like that.<eos> Don't you think about it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, we don't.<eos> Don't be scared, sweetheart.<eos> No!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Paige, now!<eos> Oh, he's gonna get you.<eos> He's gonna get you!<eos> Oh, ho!<eos> Let me show you how it's done.<eos> Yeah, do.
- (Ding) - And chef right now.<eos> Sticky buns!<eos> - Isn't Gabi great?<eos> - She's adorable.<eos> Dump her.<eos> I made you your favorite: turkey club and curly fries.<eos> And speaking of favorites, I think I'm your mom's new one.<eos> (Giggles) Quick, quick, while she's upstairs, tell me everything.<eos> Does she wanna put me in an ice cream cone and just eat me up?<eos> (Chuckles) She does!
Yeah, and a bit of a problem... with you.<eos> - What?<eos> - She thinks you're a gold digger.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> What would make her think that?<eos> I'm rich, you're poor.<eos> Her words, not mine.<eos> Then... you told her I'm not after your money, right?<eos> Of course I did.
I mean, Josh, some of that stuff you were saying to my dad, the forever stuff, I had no idea that you felt like that.<eos> Yeah. Neither did I.<eos> Well, I thought that it was very sweet,<eos> What was that?<eos> What?<eos> You just took a step back.<eos> (Scoffs) No, I didn't.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You just did it again but just with your head this time.
We appreciate that you're living your truth, but we have to live ours as well.<eos> But we don't ask her to move in just yet.<eos> And we'll make sure to do any sleepovers at her place.<eos> Lauren, I'm sorry.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Okay, but I still think...<eos> You can just stop.<eos> Of course you dumped our plan to help Karma.<eos> I'm an idiot for even being a little surprised.<eos> I did all that for you.
Previously on Faking It...<eos> Let me be the messenger.<eos> But... won't that ruin - your chances with Amy?<eos> - I think I'll be okay.<eos> If you don't see me as fully male, then maybe we shouldn't date.<eos> - Let's talk.<eos> - We just did.
- Karma...<eos> I-I wanted to make things right with Amy, but I never, ever wanted you to get hurt.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not hurt.<eos> - You're not?<eos> - No, I mean... I like Amy.<eos> We have a lot in common.<eos> But she wanted to kiss someone else at midnight, and that's okay.<eos> Because, uh...<eos> I did too.
- I don't care.<eos> - You will.<eos> Get away from my daughter.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> You okay?<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Not for Jack.<eos> Not in time.<eos> Sorry I ruined your birthday.<eos> You didn't.
Callie, do you have any proof Justina Marks is employed by Arbiter?<eos> No comment.<eos> Is it true you made these false allegations because she found out you were having sex with your foster brother, Brandon Foster?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> Yours.<eos> Or it will be after you sign the lease.<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> I do.
We're gonna go to St. Anne's in Virginia.<eos> Negative, ma'am.<eos> We're under strict protocol to get you to the White House bunker.<eos> No, no, I don't care.<eos> Just turn around, now.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> Not your call.<eos> There could be a secondary attack.<eos> - Do you really think that might happen?<eos> - It did on 9/11.
- You, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye, Dad.<eos> Are you going?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did you call Jane Fellows?<eos> I did.
- Bye, Dad.<eos> Are you going?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did you call Jane Fellows?<eos> I did.<eos> I support your decision.<eos> No, you don't.
It's not about getting up.<eos> It's about stumbling, stumbling in the right direction.<eos> It's the only true way to move forward.<eos> Whoever it is you wrote about in your journal, do you still see him?<eos> I can tell the person you're writing about meant something to you.<eos> Sometimes he takes over?<eos> That's why you don't remember things?<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Yes, you do.
I mean, who are we protecting?<eos> Some scrawny kid in a hoodie?<eos> Part of our agreement was that you would not ask any questions.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> I just...<eos> I know someone is watching me.<eos> I can tell.<eos> On the train, at work, in my apartment.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
Gus mentioned you were the one who found his body.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Speaking of bodies. -Hmm?<eos> Mad hot. [Wynonna chuckling]<eos> Alright, Champ.<eos> Yeah. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.<eos> -Do you know what time it is?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Time for you to tell me how Curtis died.<eos> -He-he just did!
The biggest dogs with the sharpest teeth own the room.<eos> So, how long should I wait?<eos> How long do you think it'll be before a big dog will rip my throat out and take my spot in line?<eos> But how do the big dogs sleep at night?<eos> I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?<eos> Abby...<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You're just standing too close to the Oval.<eos> You can feel the power, and you want it.<eos> Everyone does.
Yeah, we're just a regular Brady Bunch.<eos> You know, we used to be a family, crazy, dysfunctional, worked 23-hour days...<eos> Me, you, Harrison, Abby, Huck.<eos> We had that.<eos> But you can't stand here in this moment, look me in the eye, and say that's what you see.<eos> When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?<eos> Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,<eos> Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?<eos> I think you know the answer to that.<eos> I really don't.
She was a grown-ass woman.<eos> Twenty-five.<eos> She started with me right after my priest got sent away.<eos> She did the same shit to me that he did.<eos> I'd only known a man.<eos> You know what that is.<eos> I thought I was all fucked up in the head.<eos> I did not want to be gay.<eos> Do you get that, Ray?<eos> Do you?
His office.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> - Hey, Abs.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Remember when we went out to the hot springs in Indio?<eos> Out in the desert?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> We got caught fucking in the hot tub, and that guy got really mad.<eos> I do.
I just haven't...<eos> Theresa... she's acting crazy lately.<eos> You know?<eos> Always trying to...<eos> I mean, when you were pregnant, did you always want...<eos> Want what?<eos> Sex.<eos> All the time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> After the first few months, yeah, I did.
I could use a partner.<eos> You never fucking learn, do you, Mick?<eos> This is real.<eos> Back in Primm, inside a casino, there's a gorgeous green horseshoe filled with four million in cash.<eos> No one's even watching it.<eos> Your bus is leaving.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation. You ever think about your sister?<eos> Ever see her face?<eos> Like in a dream?<eos> No. I don't.
True Grit?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, Terry, can I ask you something?<eos> What?<eos> Do you look at me like a brother?<eos> What?<eos> Like an actual brother?<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> - Sure I do.
Belikov runs your whole operation.<eos> Look, I didn't even know.<eos> Cops don't know anything either.<eos> Muncie's gone.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Just keep my family out of it.<eos> Do your kids play soccer?<eos> - Can we cut the bullshit?<eos> - Do they?
Look, I didn't even know.<eos> Cops don't know anything either.<eos> Muncie's gone.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Just keep my family out of it.<eos> Do your kids play soccer?<eos> - Can we cut the bullshit?<eos> - Do they?<eos> - My son did.
I'm sorry, Abs.<eos> I'm so fucking sorry.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't care about any of it... not the house or the money.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Always have.<eos> And still do.
No, don't look away.<eos> Am I ugly?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me I'm beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was born of the virgin Mary, suffered death and was buried, rose again from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
What about Fiona Miller?<eos> Well, she disappeared about...<eos> God, it was ten years ago already.<eos> The papers said it was drug-related.<eos> And?<eos> It wasn't.<eos> Radley tried to force himself on her one night at his mansion after a taping.<eos> And she wasn't having any of it, so he lost his shit, and he fucking stabbed her to death.<eos> You got proof?<eos> I do, actually.
- You?<eos> - Very good, Ray.<eos> One murder weapon, complete with Sherman's DNA and his fingerprints.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Very handsy, Ray.<eos> You got a body?<eos> Nick Lowell, the agent.<eos> You know him?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
Sure.<eos> They're grown now, you know.<eos> Do you know what a size queen is?<eos> Guy who's into big dicks.<eos> Do you know what a bear is?<eos> Big fat guy, lot of body hair, like a bear.<eos> Do you know what a wolf is?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That one, I don't.
What's going on, Bunch?<eos> It's Teresa.<eos> Her brother Marco just put her into a mental hospital.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> She left me, Pop.<eos> She left me.<eos> She left baby Maria.<eos> And now she's in a fuckin' nuthouse.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Of course you do, son.

You know what that means?<eos> It's jail... A record.<eos> Dad went to juvie.<eos> Didn't hurt him.<eos> Don't be a smartass.<eos> He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do.

Russian.<eos> Loves your movies.<eos> He just wants to meet you.<eos> I do that, this guy won't post the video?<eos> Here's the address.<eos> Eight o'clock.<eos> You gonna stay for the rest of the interview?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna cry.<eos> I always do with her.
Shaved roast beef on a hoagie, Mmm. Fuji apples... sliced and skinned... ooh.<eos> Plus, Rice Krispie Treat.<eos> Did she use Fruity Pebbles?<eos> She yabb-dabba-did.<eos> And this somehow is supposed to make you miserable?<eos> Uh, this is a mind game she's playing.<eos> Unfortunately for her, this mind don't play it.<eos> So you're gonna outsmart her by undersmarting her.<eos> Pretty smart, huh?<eos> You-you did it.
Nice to see you again.<eos> It's very nice to see you, as always... good to see you.<eos> How'd that purchase work out?<eos> Yeah, how did it work out?<eos> He won't, um, tell me.<eos> No, uh, I-I don't think that you want to hear about my terrible Valentine's Day experience.<eos> Oh, she didn't like the perfume?<eos> Perfume?<eos> You bought perfume from here.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Come to my place tonight.<eos> Come on, let's get some sleep.<eos> You shouldn't be alone right now.<eos> I didn't know I could do that.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> No, that's the thing.<eos> I don't feel bad.<eos> I always knew there was a part of me that wanted to do this to her for what she did, but...<eos> I figured when the time came, something would stop me...<eos> But it didn't.
What's that for?<eos> For impersonating an NYPD officer.<eos> All cell carriers have a law enforcement hotline.<eos> Instead of hacking the carrier, if the situation's urgent enough, you can just ask them to track a blocked call for you.<eos> Is it done?<eos> Not yet... need a few minutes for the spoof fax to go through.<eos> It needs to propagate through their system.<eos> No one in the world uses fax anymore except cops.<eos> Half of me wants it to be him.<eos> Half of me doesn't.
And here was me thinking nothing bloomed in the Underworld.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Came to see a woman about a curse... a pesky sleeping curse, which you gave to my wife.<eos> If Belle preferred eternal slumber to one more moment with you, that's hardly my fault.<eos> I'd say her judgment's improving.<eos> See, the thing is I don't think would've come to that decision on her own.<eos> I think you saw an opportunity, and you took advantage, much like I'm doing now.<eos> You can't hurt me.<eos> We made a deal, remember?<eos> Oh, I do.
- Was there something that's changed?<eos> No, nothing's changed.<eos> It's Aguirre fucking with me, that's what it is.<eos> Does the story stay the same?<eos> The story stays the same.<eos> The story stays exactly the same.<eos> Nothing changes.<eos> Nothing changes in the story.<eos> You both realize how fucking important that is, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
I wanted to mend fences.<eos> She is so influential.<eos> Exactly, and my art was not ready for her.<eos> The review is terrible.<eos> Which I'm sure is what you wanted.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, I was trying to help.<eos> I-I just wished you would've consulted with me first.<eos> - Well, I didn't.
Okay, let's not get sentimental, all right?<eos> You stole me away from your business rival.<eos> Sure sounds like a trophy to me.<eos> Yeah, that might have been why I was interested in you, but that's not what I loved about you.<eos> I loved that you were the kind of person that saved $743 on fish filets.<eos> And I just, I couldn't shake the feeling that the caterer was gouging us,<eos> - so I went to the fish market<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - And I priced it myself.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- What?<eos> Brandon, come on.<eos> - Brandon, stop.<eos> - What?<eos> - We... we can't.<eos> - We can't what?<eos> Tell Moms.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you know why.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm with Five-O.<eos> Got a badge to back that up?<eos> No, I-I don't. Not on me.<eos> Do you have, do you have a cell phone that gets service here?<eos> People today are too obsessed with their phones.<eos> I don't like it-<eos> - I come out here to connect with nature.<eos> Unplug.<eos> You feel me?<eos> Yeah, I do, uh...
She asked me to tell you how grateful she is.<eos> How's the baby?<eos> Still has a cough but Mrs Ashdown thinks now they are out of the city, it will get better.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I used to fancy myself a good judge of men, but I can't think of many people who would do what you did for a stranger.<eos> So...<eos> I didn't do it for her.<eos> I suppose you want something in return.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Miss Skerrett, I do.
So, yesterday I had the whole day to think about my commitment issues, and how I could fix said commitment issues.<eos> So, I did a search for commitment issues.<eos> Here's what I got.<eos> Wow. Impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much for that.<eos> That was chapter three: Acknowledgment.<eos> Wow, uh, you know what this shows me?<eos> That you really want to help yourself.<eos> - I do.
I know that's me, but I swear it wasn't me.<eos> I would never hurt Staci.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I was at a dinner the entire time.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.<eos> You do?
Uh... She's -- she's with my mom.<eos> I hate to have to ask this, but I-I need to ask you a difficult question.<eos> Okay.<eos> Were you aware that your husband was having an affair with your babysitter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> I know what you're thinking -- jealous wife kills her cheating husband.<eos> But that couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> I loved Dan.<eos> I still do.
As far as I can tell, there is no lore.<eos> My best guess is this was the White witch's home cooking.<eos> Terrific.<eos> All right, so what do we know?<eos> Um, if you kiss someone, then they die.<eos> I guess.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You didn't kiss Staci.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, but Dan did.
You're a mystery.<eos> I can see inside your heart.<eos> Feel the love you feel, except... It's cloaked in shame.<eos> When it comes to this...<eos> You can't help yourself.<eos> So why fight it?<eos> Just give in.<eos> Why hurt Melissa?<eos> She only wanted to save her marriage.<eos> They all do.
- All of the faces<eos> Sin Rostro changed.<eos> But I gave that to Nadine to give to Rose.<eos> My mother says Rose doesn't have it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Nadine must not have given it to her.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you, away from your partner.<eos> 'Cause we probably broke some laws trying to get Mateo back.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I did.
I'm fine.<eos> I mean, it's gonna be a process.<eos> Right?<eos> I've got to learn how to be honest about my feelings instead of pushing everybody away like I have been.<eos> But I'm up for that.<eos> I'm very glad to see that you are well and confident.<eos> Good, thanks.<eos> But promises... are just words, Chili.<eos> I'd like to see you succeed here.<eos> I really do.
But he wanted me to.<eos> And how exactly did you divine that?<eos> I couldn't just let her die for no reason.<eos> Well, there is a reason.<eos> She has a legally binding document ordering you not to do so.<eos> And don't I, as her doctor, have a moral responsibility that supersedes that document?<eos> No, you do not, and you know that.<eos> Ms. Goodwin, she was out of her mind from the pain and the illness.<eos> She did not understand what this drug could do for her.<eos> - I did.
We're on top of each other -- and not in a good way.<eos> Oh, fun.<eos> I was hoping your sex life would come up.<eos> Look, Dad, remodels are tense.<eos> Half the divorces I do start with a remodel.<eos> Or an underwear model.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> - You know what a Reuben is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh. What's that for?<eos> For whatever's crawling all over me!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> They're on me, too!<eos> $40 for the hour.<eos> Songs are in the book.<eos> Anyone want a cocktail?<eos> - You know how to make a Manhattan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Now, let's go.<eos> Somebody named Olga should be salting me like a pretzel!<eos> Mm.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It was just a false alarm.<eos> Well, then we should probably get back to the theater.<eos> Those pre-movie trivia questions aren't gonna answer themselves, are they? [ Chuckles ]<eos> - Actually, they do.
- I need to see him.<eos> - I can't help you.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> He's being hunted by the NSA.<eos> Because he's brilliant.<eos> And they want to exploit his work.<eos> No, because he's a killer.<eos> He killed three people.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Actually, I do.
- Uh, it looks like Nick cut some kind of deal with Josh to be a VIP host.<eos> No, no, no, not that.<eos> The anomaly.<eos> We're seeing it on our end.<eos> Erecting a firewall to isolate it.<eos> I never thanked you for helping me out of the void.<eos> Helping you is why I'm here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I want to tell you.<eos> I really do.
Let me see the picture.<eos> Fourth guy from the left.<eos> - Tate?<eos> - In position.<eos> All she wanted.<eos> Needed, really.<eos> You think she knows we got him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe she does.<eos> They both do.
- than it is.<eos> - I'd feel more comfortable with a greenlight<eos> - from her doctor.<eos> - Sheriff.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - OK?<eos> I want to help.<eos> - Well, I'll swing by and make sure that cat of yours is fed.<eos> She doesn't really like men.<eos> Well, who does?
Top notch.<eos> I'll answer whatever, OK?<eos> Just put my necklace back on me, please.<eos> On second thought, you're not really in a position to do any bargaining, are you?<eos> OK, look, we just need the entrance to your old bootlegging tunnels, that's it.<eos> Let's say I was willing to help you.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
- Yet holding me hostage can be interpreted as an act of terrorism!<eos> (coughing)<eos> Take this upstairs.<eos> Who knew we would be blessed with so many visitors today.<eos> (Wynonna):<eos> Is Yiska his real name?<eos> Course not.<eos> He says there are outsiders who don't understand our commune, even fear us.<eos> Fear him.<eos> Do you?
Suppose some find that something to be proud of.<eos> My experience says drifting is just another word for running.<eos> Running ain't in my nature.<eos> Well, maybe it didn't use to be, but enough time in the dark...<eos> - ...a man can change.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - Or maybe it's a woman.<eos> - Well, it ain't.<eos> You ever spend any time at war, son?<eos> My father did a long time ago.
At least you didn't have a meltdown in front of your boss.<eos> Gummy bears.<eos> Fuzzy Peaches.<eos> I remember we used to play in here with gummy bears.<eos> We would dance them across the beams and into our mouths.<eos> [Wynonna] Then you turned 11 and you wanted to practice making out with the gummy bears.<eos> Oh...<eos> And you promised<eos> - to never tell anyone that.<eos> - I never did.
Black Badge isn't just a...<eos> - ...a job for me.<eos> - Yeah, no kidding.<eos> I get it.<eos> Feeling like you're about to lose something.<eos> It's OK if you don't like her, you know.<eos> I'm happy she's back, I really am.<eos> It's...<eos> I never really knew her, you know.<eos> Still don't.
- That was $2,500? !<eos> - You told me to stand my ground!<eos> Wasn't there some $100 ground you could've stood?<eos> Hendrix played this.<eos> I mean, I could be just like him now.<eos> Dead and in estate battles over who owns his rights?<eos> Okay, that is going back today.<eos> We are driving you.<eos> (no accent): I swear to God I was not the last person to use the bathroom.<eos> I don't even do that at work, okay?
Yes, there'll be a sign.<eos> Just like there was when we got pregnant with Greg.<eos> There was a sign?<eos> We were all around the table, and somehow a chair from the dining room had made its way into the kitchen.<eos> I looked at that empty chair, and I knew something was missing.<eos> And that something was another baby.<eos> What about me, Mom?<eos> What was the sign you should have me?<eos> Oh. Remember what that sign was?<eos> I do.
- Good morning, Josh.<eos> - Hey! Hi!<eos> You're here.<eos> So, uh, you know, after we broke up in therapy,<eos> I wasn't quite sure how things were gonna be between us.<eos> Was it gonna be awkward?<eos> Were you gonna poison my... breakfast?<eos> You didn't, did you?
We can hear everything from the bathroom.<eos> So, anyway, Ella, I just want to say that I'm really sorry for what happened.<eos> It had absolutely nothing to do with you.<eos> I was young and an idiot.<eos> Okay, well... apology accepted.<eos> Wh... uh...<eos> Wait, I mean, let's, uh, let's at least have a drink.<eos> You know, I really wanna make this up to you.<eos> Sure, if that makes you feel better.<eos> It does.

I didn't until we spent the whole night looking at our old yearbooks and started reminiscing.<eos> All the feelings came flooding back.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How about the bad feelings from when you hated me for what I did to you?<eos> Did those come back?<eos> Where are the bad feelings?<eos> Where are the bad feelings?<eos> They're gone because you made the greatest amends of all.<eos> You vowed to never hurt me again.<eos> I did?
What are you talking about, Rachael Ray?<eos> What do you mean, what am I talking about?<eos> I mean, it's literally all over social media, all over the Internet.<eos> No. (Chuckles) No.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, you... you seriously did... did not know this?<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> She did not.
Well, hello there.<eos> Show yourself.<eos> Glad to see you followed instructions and came alone.<eos> Zelena.<eos> I tried to stop them, but...<eos> It's not your fault, it's theirs.<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Because we wouldn't be here if you'd ripped up that contract when I asked you to.<eos> You didn't have leverage.<eos> And now I do.
Look. I just want to say my goodbyes down here without everyone watching.<eos> No.<eos> We've already had more time than we were ever meant to.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - We both know it is.<eos> You should have let me go in Camelot.<eos> Don't make that mistake again.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know how to say goodbye.<eos> Well, then don't.
Juices are the new vanity plates.<eos> Well, what do you recommend?<eos> The juice bar down the street.<eos> - It's half the price. - Mmm.<eos> Or a NutMegan.<eos> I'll take the "Arlene-ergy."<eos> 'Cause I'm a sucker for advertising.<eos> Is that why you bought that shirt, advertising?<eos> - You don't like my shirt?<eos> - Actually, I do.
- Um, Agent Dunst, you're technically with the FBI but also serve on TAPS... the Technology Allied Protection Service task force,<eos> - It is, although I would not call myself technically with the FBI.<eos> Does the FBI have a steering committee, sir?<eos> - A... - Steering committee.<eos> - No.<eos> - Does the Secret Service or the Chicago PD?<eos> - Not that I know of.<eos> - How about TAPS?<eos> Does they have a steering committee?<eos> Yes, they do.
Your partner's got a drug problem and you're gonna color in the details for us right now.<eos> Should I have my PBA rep in here with me?<eos> You know what, that's a brilliant idea.<eos> Why don't you call your PBA rep and I'll call the chief of department and we can order in pizza and make a day of it, how's that sound?<eos> No.<eos> Then cut the crap.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Forget I mentioned it.<eos> You know where your partner is, don't you, Officer Abrams?<eos> I do not.
They recovered a nine beneath his mattress.<eos> Prints and everything.<eos> Dummy.<eos> He ain't no genius, that's for sure.<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna have to work on your double negatives, Anthony.<eos> The what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> You did good.
Prints and everything.<eos> Dummy.<eos> He ain't no genius, that's for sure.<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna have to work on your double negatives, Anthony.<eos> The what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> You did good.<eos> I did well.
Stan, what are you doing here?<eos> We told you not to worry.<eos> The thing is, I'm a worrier.<eos> I was worrying about my family, and that stressed me out, so I tried to get away from them.<eos> But I just started worrying about you guys.<eos> Turns out if I love someone, I worry about them.<eos> And if someone's gonna stress me out, I'd rather it be my family than you guys.<eos> Did Stan just say he loves us?<eos> He did, Gorney.<eos> He did.
And then you just ran off?<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Well, if by "bad" you mean "not good," then yes.<eos> (SIGHS) I was caught off guard.<eos> Honey, listen.<eos> Relax.<eos> Okay?<eos> Karma would not have said that if she didn't want to get back together with you.<eos> The question is, do you want to?<eos> Yeah, part of me does.
Oh, yes.<eos> Why don't you turn around and unhook that thing?<eos> My goodness.<eos> Now I'm starting to get other ideas.<eos> Why don't you get on your knees, little girl?<eos> NYPD.<eos> Why don't you put your hands up in the air?<eos> Hey, now, what is this?<eos> Nothing happened!<eos> Oh, yeah it did, champ.
Thanks.<eos> They're still in the apartment.<eos> - Computer crimes here yet?<eos> - Almost.<eos> Gives me time to get Pippa and the kids out.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> I know you live to make my life miserable, but J.C., Mary, and Joseph... this?<eos> Look, you didn't have to wake the commissioner up in the middle of the night to tell him that his trusted PR chief is busted for child porn.<eos> Between you and me, I never liked the guy anyway.<eos> No one does.
- Thank you.<eos> - What?<eos> Hank Abraham just slashed his wrists.<eos> Pippa.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Uh, he lost blood, but he'll make it.<eos> I found him on the floor of the bathroom.<eos> I... only stopped by the apartment to pick up some things for the kids.<eos> If I hadn't...<eos> But you did.
I'll be home in a few hours.<eos> You need to stay.<eos> You should stay.<eos> Who's that?<eos> That's Martha.<eos> Martha?<eos> Mm-hmm. Why'd they draw her?<eos> Misunderstanding.<eos> Didn't know we knew her.<eos> Carlotti did this?
E-plus.<eos> E-plus!<eos> Actually, she got perfect grades across the board.<eos> This calls for a celebration.<eos> Taking her out for ice cream after dinner.<eos> What is it?<eos> A body was found in the Potomac.<eos> It's being brought to the lab.<eos> Well, that's not good, because that means the local PD moved the victim from the crime scene, and I know how much you hate that.<eos> I do.
Well, there's Buckley.<eos> Yeah, but everybody in the newsroom has problems with Buckley.<eos> Who's Buckley?<eos> Another producer at the station...<eos> He had seniority over Emma, but she beat him out for that promotion.<eos> And Buckley was pissed.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he even claimed that she'd made up lies about him just to get the job.<eos> But I can't imagine he would kill her for that.<eos> By any chance, does Buckley drive a white van?<eos> Yeah, he does.
You did it at our place?<eos> Kind of on Sheldon's bed.<eos> What?<eos> ! No!<eos> I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.<eos> Usually he says, "Do not go in there," but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."<eos> How could you do that?<eos> I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.<eos> I do know what that's like.<eos> I really do.
Did he spend a lot of his time with The Whippersnaps?<eos> People would do anything to be part of that group.<eos> It was his whole life.<eos> Hi.<eos> Parker, is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about this summer.<eos> Your camping trip with your father?<eos> Yeah, see there's this creative writing summer session thing at Oxford<eos> I didn't think I'd get into.<eos> But you did?
Oh, give it to me.<eos> Just tell me where I need to poke.<eos> Go down.<eos> The femoral artery runs down the inside of his leg, from the kneecap to the groin.<eos> Time out.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> You most certainly can.<eos> We're divers, not doctors.<eos> We don't even know what we're doing.<eos> But I do.
No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But Jalen-- he can be strong.<eos> He was dangerous.<eos> Do you think he could do something like this?<eos> Love can make people do crazy things.<eos> Aw...<eos> Gibbs.<eos> You got me a card.<eos> Yes, I did.
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
This wasn't a hit, it was a robbery.<eos> The question is: what was this guy carrying inside of his body... that was worth taking out a whole room full of people?<eos> We weren't supposed to meet for another 72 hours.<eos> Yeah, well, couldn't wait.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
How long has she had them back?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Maybe three or four weeks.<eos> Does she know you know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does Nick know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did Adalind tell him?<eos> No.<eos> You did.
All right, your eyes are starting to do that little thing that they do.<eos> Let's have it.<eos> Have what?<eos> It's not my birthday.<eos> And I said to you, please, no welcome back party.<eos> All right, look, I'm not saying, but I was supposed to distract you, so do me a favor and act surprised when you go in there, all right?<eos> All right, I got you covered.<eos> And let's just keep it an extra 30 seconds, just to be sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> So my eyes do this thing, huh?
How is she?<eos> Still touch and go. I...<eos> I'm waiting to see her.<eos> The note. "seeing red." what does it mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're looking for microexpressions.<eos> You divided this team when we need to work together.<eos> JJ disobeyed orders by going to you, and now you're withholding.<eos> I didn't divide this team.<eos> You did.
Nick, come on.<eos> You want to go there?<eos> I want to go where?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You wanted to impress me because you have a crush on me.<eos> It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.<eos> I need a laugh.<eos> It's too hot not to laugh.<eos> Lord knows it!<eos> You do.
All right, get 'em out of here.<eos> We'll secure the area.<eos> Uh, you sure you two can handle an empty apartment?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You heard him, Ramirez.<eos> Housekeeping will take it from here.<eos> Hey, hey! Put some mints on the pillow.<eos> You know, I am getting a little sick of Seely always acting like he's better than us. Yeah.<eos> I mean, just 'cause you get a commendation from the mayor and back-to-back marksmanship awards doesn't mean you're a better cop.<eos> It kind of does.
Mom.<eos> They debone the birds and then layer them smallest to largest.<eos> Well, however they make it, boy, it's good.<eos> So, Francis, did the Brits actually listen to what you have to say, or were they just being British?<eos> One of them sure did-- kept pushing for more.<eos> More what?<eos> More of the secret sauce, as the kids say.<eos> Kids don't say that, Grandpa.<eos> Oh, I thought they did.<eos> Some do.
I don't know.<eos> Sure, okay.<eos> That'll be all, Baker.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm just saying, that's sort of what you signed up for.<eos> Babysitting punks like Marcus?<eos> Mentoring rookies, like me, and yeah, some like Marcus.<eos> Most rookies have a sense of respect for the job.<eos> You did.<eos> Well... maybe Marcus does, too, in his own way.
They even let us do a full sweep of their bedrooms.<eos> You find anything?<eos> We found everything.<eos> Pot, illegal prescription pills, fireworks.<eos> It's like searching a car coming back from Tijuana.<eos> Hey, uh, by the way, it'd be great if you could come by the house on Saturday, too.<eos> Might help the adoption lady to see how diverse my friends are.<eos> Diverse?<eos> Come on, you know what I mean?<eos> I certainly do.
Look, quit trashing the Challenger.<eos> It's a Hemi V-8 with a Scat Pack.<eos> 470 horses under the hood.<eos> Might not be a practical family car, but it's my baby and I love it.<eos> Knows all. Sees all.<eos> Okay, we need to go at least two feet deep.<eos> Then we bury St. William and we don't dig him up until he gives us a child.<eos> Are you sure this is sanctioned by the Church?<eos> Well, anything goes with that new Pope, but, you know, they bury St. Joseph when they want to sell their house, so this just makes sense.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it kind of does.
And then I like to do push-ups.<eos> I like to do...<eos> I could keep doing push-ups all day.<eos> I'm going to do ten more push-ups.<eos> Yeah, that's basically how it went.<eos> I mean I think I paraphrased a little bit but you guys get the gist.<eos> Why is Danny being so mean?<eos> How do you not get this?<eos> Don't you remember when you first met?<eos> Of course I do.
And what did you do?<eos> Erm, just watched the TV and then fell asleep.<eos> And you didn't speak to him again?<eos> We're gonna need to take some things away.<eos> Paperwork, bank statements, his computer.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> He didn't have a computer, though.<eos> He just used his phone for everything.<eos> - Where did he work?<eos> - He didn't.
Oh, slightly domineering.<eos> Also Stefan's type.<eos> Wow.<eos> Much better.<eos> I had to get you healthy so we can do the transfer spell.<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
Who else was in here?<eos> Um...<eos> Cameron...<eos> Nina...<eos> Ivy.<eos> She could have done it.<eos> That's...<eos> That's the equation for power lost during the transmission of electricity.<eos> I wanted to see how far a power surge could travel.<eos> - Of course, you did.
- Clear!<eos> Clear!<eos> Kirsten, where is he?<eos> Not here.<eos> Someone tipped him off.<eos> - Her?<eos> - No.<eos> He must be connected to someone inside the NSA.<eos> How were you able to lie to me so completely?<eos> I didn't!
- Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, boy, is she the absolute best.<eos> - [inhales deeply] Why did you use the word "typical"<eos> To describe your relationship?<eos> - Oh, well, I think I just meant normal.<eos> - Is that important to you, Having your relationship described as normal?<eos> - No, no, I just don't think that we are abnormal.<eos> Yes, we're close, but we had to be.<eos> You know my father died, right?<eos> - I do.
Let's go change you.<eos> Let me.<eos> I want to.<eos> Okay...<eos> All done.<eos> Nice and clean.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who's my perfect boy?<eos> I love you.<eos> Yes, I do,
Yeah.<eos> I mean, Bobby's catnip to the ladies.<eos> They come in here hoping for a moment.<eos> Right, right, but we're talking about you, Mr. Panko.<eos> So how much will they do for you?<eos> Well, I get my share of the runoff.<eos> Why, what is she saying?<eos> Bobby told us you walked in on 'em.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I went looking for him, and I saw that he was busy, and she invited me to stay.<eos> She did?
I mean, you do know that she's unstable, right?<eos> Yeah, okay, right.<eos> I get that.<eos> You probably think I have a blind spot because of my sister.<eos> - Right?<eos> - What?<eos> No. No, not at all.<eos> 'Cause you do know that these two guys are guilty, including your dad's friend Bobby.<eos> You think I'm a daddy's boy.<eos> No, I don't.
Is my son all right?<eos> Which one?<eos> R.B. is in custody, and Eric... I'd imagine... is in shock.<eos> Decades of deceit by their father builds up a lot of anger.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt anyone.<eos> Yet you hurt everyone.<eos> You... you may not understand, and you may not believe me, detective, but I love both my families very much.<eos> Must have been difficult living two lives.<eos> The fact that you got away with it for so long makes me wonder what you would have done if Kate found out.<eos> - But she didn't.
All four of his kids are criminals.<eos> What the hell was he thinking, man?<eos> It's all right. It's all right.<eos> He doesn't have us anymore, and he definitely doesn't have SEG.<eos> How did you manage that?<eos> Our father used our mother's trust to build the firm, so since he married Corinne first...<eos> Which makes us bastards, by the way.<eos> He wasn't legally married to Mom, so he wasn't entitled to her money.<eos> The thing is, he doesn't matter anymore.<eos> You do.
You'll never guess who kissed my hand tonight.<eos> Mr. Show Business himself, Sammy Davis Jr.<eos> It was really quite something, although that's not the reason why I'm calling, obviously.<eos> Uh, I'm calling because...<eos> I had a thought which is that it's an early start tomorrow.<eos> First thing up is our intake with the new couple. The, uh, the Buckseys, but even before that we have a meeting with our attorney um, in the... well, in our pandering case.<eos> I say we meaning Mrs. Johnson and myself, but, well, I'd like you to be there as well.<eos> Of course, Dr. Masters.<eos> If you want me there, I'm there.<eos> I do.
We predicted it and we were right.<eos> We know our people.<eos> Oh, Virginia is, uh...<eos> Not my people.<eos> Jesus, I've been...<eos> So you come all this way to St. Louis to clean up after him, to tell his lover to back off?<eos> Someone had to.<eos> All for someone who lies to you, who, uh... disregards you? Who ultimately cannot love you.<eos> Can you possibly hate yourself that much?<eos> Sometimes I do.
I was created in the form of someone your subconscious trusts.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Kirsten.<eos> I'm Cameron.<eos> You can't be real.<eos> There's something waiting for you at your doorstep.<eos> When you go home and see what it is, you'll know I am.<eos> More midnight graffiti?<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.<eos> Oh, you didn't.
Everyone here is subject to confidentiality rules, and the captain is currently being questioned about certain... leaks.<eos> You're saying he leaked?<eos> No, it's not my position to say he leaked.<eos> I'm merely saying he's being questioned about certain leaks.<eos> Now we need to vote.<eos> In 12 hours,<eos> Hopper is going to be moved.<eos> Does he pose an imminent threat of violence against the United States?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - He does.
Hey.<eos> You're back.<eos> Yup.<eos> They didn't need me anymore.<eos> And she can't tell us who "they" are.<eos> Mm-hmm. It's top secret.<eos> So, it's been fun here, huh?<eos> Yeah, a gender war.<eos> Jason, do you have a minute?<eos> I do.
I don't like not knowing what the situation is.<eos> What situation?<eos> Look, it's not like you're married to the corner grocer.<eos> All right?<eos> It's the governor.<eos> And that's my problem.<eos> No.<eos> My problem too.<eos> - He accepts it.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Don't tell me to relax, Steven.<eos> Christ Almighty, relax?<eos> Look at you.<eos> I said I took care of it.<eos> But how? What does that even mean?<eos> Where there's a paper trail, there's Thomas Shaw to light it on fire and burn us alive.<eos> That's a little melodramatic, Robert. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You think?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
Somebody like Steven Frost.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I'm afraid that's a bit above my pay grade, Robert.<eos> No, he fits the profile, you know?<eos> - Long career. - Uh-huh.<eos> Brought us out of the Cold War, strong ties to the China, managed to stay friends with Germany even after the NSA shit.<eos> Now the Shaw leaks.<eos> Well, sounds to me like someone sees an opening.<eos> Yeah, Chris.<eos> I do.
Sure can turn on the charm, can't he?<eos> _<eos> German as they come.<eos> Wunderbar.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I noticed you served in the same capacity under Steven Frost in his last posting... COS Vienna.<eos> Yes, I did.
Today I do.<eos> I'm not eating my lunch in that dump.<eos> What if I said I had intel on the truth-teller Shaw?<eos> Truth-teller?<eos> You buy that shit?<eos> Well, my company has just been hired to safeguard the servers for the newspaper that publishes that shit.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - No hacker or government will be able to spy on the Berliner Zeitung.<eos> Does the Zeitung think they're being watched?<eos> Of course they do.
If you want my allegiance because my last name is Kirsch... I recommend you look elsewhere.<eos> We want your allegiance because you are one of the most valuable American intelligence officers in Europe, positioned for upwards mobility.<eos> Your support would be a huge gain for Tel Aviv.<eos> A huge gain?<eos> No.<eos> My loyalties are not for sale.<eos> Should be.<eos> Neither Steven Frost nor the Agency grant you the respect you deserve.<eos> They don't see your full potential.<eos> We do.
They might be smart enough to pull this off.<eos> Hector loves me.<eos> He said that?<eos> What can I say?<eos> I'm irresistible.<eos> I'll assume you said something snarky in return.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Hey.<eos> You love him?<eos> Of course I do.
Okay.<eos> They've whored themselves out to Western culture.<eos> They shove McDonald's hamburgers down their throats, walk through Christmas markets, and still they try to call themselves devout Muslims.<eos> If anyone should be ashamed of their family, it's me.<eos> Do you feel responsible for Lin?<eos> Why should I?<eos> Because we knew from the beginning we were sending him back.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Doesn't relieve you of the guilt.<eos> It does for me.
Your mother was sleeping with a Stasi spy.<eos> He was developing her.<eos> You think you're clever?<eos> You're not.<eos> You're transparent.<eos> Feeding me childhood secrets in the hopes of what?<eos> Working me?<eos> You still don't trust me.<eos> No.<eos> I-I don't.
It's why he fell.<eos> Wow.<eos> But they did an angioplasty, and it sounds like it went well.<eos> He got out about an hour ago.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,<eos> Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
Drop it.<eos> Isn't this a fun surprise?<eos> You really thought you could double-cross me?<eos> Me?<eos> You know I invented the double-cross?<eos> Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.
Isn't this a fun surprise?<eos> You really thought you could double-cross me?<eos> Me?<eos> You know I invented the double-cross?<eos> Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.<eos> Yeah, they all do.
Then tell me.<eos> It will be okay. I promise.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> When I met Johnny, I thought he was the most charming man I'd ever met.<eos> We'd never done much... physically.<eos> I just thought he was old-fashioned.<eos> On our wedding night, he, uh... he got real tense.<eos> Didn't wanna kiss me.<eos> He just asked me to close my eyes.<eos> So I did.
Mr. Amberson, Jack Kennedy here.<eos> The Secret Service tells me that, uh, my wife and I, uh, owe you our lives.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome, sir.<eos> The First Lady would like to speak with you.<eos> All right.<eos> - Mr. Amberson?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I don't know how to say this, but I had a feeling that something terrible could've happened today.<eos> Thanks to you, it didn't.
Studios starting at one million dollars.<eos> For a studio?<eos> - That's insane... if buyers aren't lining up.<eos> That is why I have you.<eos> All those contacts and famous names you mentioned during your interview? You should have no problem.<eos> So many accomplishments, and still just 32 years old.<eos> Fantastico!<eos> Wow. Ay, caramba!<eos> You don't have any contacts, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
Oh, here we are.<eos> See you later, Riles.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm pretty committed to this rela...<eos> Oh, god!<eos> And now for my second trick, I'll be making Danny disappear.<eos> Hey, bro, so I've been thinking about our conversation, and you gotta stop worrying about it.<eos> I'm sure Riley's not having any second thoughts.<eos> Second thoughts.<eos> Who said anything about second thoughts?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
Great idea.<eos> Perfect way to relieve some of that stress.<eos> What stress?<eos> There's no stress.<eos> Whoa, calm down, man!<eos> It's okay, I'm your brother.<eos> So what if this move is too much, too soon.<eos> Too much, too soon?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
- Rachel.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> No, uh-uh, not now.<eos> - Well, I-<eos> - Bad job, buddy, real bad.<eos> Yeah, real bad.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, no, you don't know.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't.
Liam.<eos> That Liam?<eos> Is he the reason you weren't at the library?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because he's connected to Daniel Stinger.<eos> And Maggie wanted me to find out what information I could get on him.<eos> I suppose she didn't want you telling me.<eos> No, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.<eos> So, I didn't.
José Díaz-Balart?<eos> Fine, you pried it out of me.<eos> Yes, I will be sharing the harrowing tale of my kidnapping with him exclusively.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> It means that I'll be late to your engagement party, though.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Don't even think about it. But, Dad,<eos> I haven't even heard what happened.<eos> D-Do you want to tell me, maybe?<eos> I do.
Oh, be right back.<eos> It's Rafael.<eos> He was meeting his brother.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Look, I think Derek's telling the truth.<eos> I don't think he knew.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You can't know that already.<eos> Well, I do.
!<eos> They sent cute texts to each other.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> They caught up on Scandal.<eos> Honestly, I'm glad Olivia's done with Fitz.<eos> Oh, my God, I knew it.<eos> - You kept watching without me.<eos> You did! - No, I, no, I didn't...
And a hardcover, how decadent!<eos> Υou know me...<eos> Living large.<eos> And this is good.<eos> I can look at her without cringing.<eos> Ah, yes, you'll recall this happened last year.<eos> Even my masseuse has a manuscript.<eos> - Oh, no, no, I'm not...<eos> - You don't want me to read that?<eos> Well, I-I do...
That's one way to put it.<eos> And now we must return to reality, as the couple we are.<eos> - If you return. - Hmm?<eos> We're at the part of the story that I love so much.<eos> And that's how I feel.<eos> I love you.<eos> - But, see, I don't believe you.<eos> - What?<eos> It doesn't feel the same, like you love me like that.<eos> - But I do.
Rafael realized it wasn't in fact all out of his control.<eos> There was one thing he could do.<eos> I want to help you find my mother.<eos> - You guys are working together.<eos> - Yes, but... look, that's obviously privileged.<eos> I didn't want you to go chasing after him.<eos> I wasn't gonna go chasing after him.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> I know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
Ready to go again.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Is it over?<eos> - It's over.<eos> You did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I'm sorry I called you all those horrible names.<eos> - You didn't.
I'd get the hell out of the car and run.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'd go this way.<eos> That's where the closest busy street is.<eos> So if I'm hurt, maybe I stumble.<eos> Hello.<eos> I've got something here.<eos> Do you have an evidence collection kit in your car?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
The whole operation, it was my idea.<eos> You never told us that.<eos> Well, I'm telling you now.<eos> She's dead because of me.<eos> Emily, she volunteered.<eos> The Chief Inspector hated the idea.<eos> He thought it was too risky.<eos> And I went above his head to push it through.<eos> I just... I thought we'd catch him.<eos> You almost did.
Won't it be weird if we run into Han?<eos> And not with a car?<eos> Okay. This is it.<eos> Hello!<eos> Oh, no, I hate puppet shows.<eos> Evie, this isn't available, it's a cupcake shop.<eos> Unless those two girls finally gave up.<eos> I've decided to let you expand.<eos> Evie convinced me to do things outside my comfort zone.<eos> - Yes, I did.
So, giving your childhood BFF the grand tour?<eos> Well, I've been here before.<eos> Are these walls more orange than I remember?<eos> So, what was it like being military kids, moving to a new base every few years?<eos> It had its ups and downs.<eos> Got to meet a few nice people along the way. Yeah.<eos> Plus, we got to travel the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you remember our train ride to Austria?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
You're just... giving up now?<eos> You told me it was gonna be different this time.<eos> You said that we were gonna do it together and you were gonna teach me.<eos> - All that shit about being your sous chef.<eos> - Yeah, well...<eos> I lied.<eos> Why don't you just ask your parents for the money?<eos> - You want me to ask them?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I don't.
You told me it was gonna be different this time.<eos> You said that we were gonna do it together and you were gonna teach me.<eos> - All that shit about being your sous chef.<eos> - Yeah, well...<eos> I lied.<eos> Why don't you just ask your parents for the money?<eos> - You want me to ask them?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I absolutely do not.
No, he was not.<eos> This is getting interesting.<eos> Any idea why she'd lie about that?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Think she was helping Danny?<eos> Could be.<eos> Something was going on that night.<eos> When this first started, Marco...<eos> I know you think that I was playing politics.<eos> I did, not anymore.
There's something else.<eos> What?<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> To me?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> She wants us to come over there.<eos> Well, that's interesting.<eos> Why didn't my dad ask them for help?<eos> He did, a bunch of times.
- It's like the fricking Navy here.<eos> Wow!<eos> - Hinckley T55.<eos> - Queen of the Fleet.<eos> She is a beauty.<eos> My nephew in Long Point is getting married.<eos> Kid's not much into boats, so I figured this would jump-start his interest.<eos> You think?<eos> I guess you vetted me pretty good before I came out here, huh?<eos> Yes, I did.
There was a while back I was doing pretty good.<eos> We all go through rough patches.<eos> When you, uh... first came to see me, I was...<eos> I was a little cold to you.<eos> - Yeah, you were.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Look, if this is some sort of apology... it's just a little late.<eos> Just let her talk.<eos> I wish I could go back and change our history, but life doesn't work like that.<eos> Nope, it doesn't.
The Times wants an interview regarding the new Critical Response Command.<eos> Refer them to the Chief of Counterterrorism.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They want you.<eos> They're lucky if anyone in this department talks to 'em after that hack job they did on excessive force in the NYPD.<eos> That was a different reporter.<eos> And I wasn't aware that you read The Times.<eos> I do.
She's been a broken record about that for years.<eos> As a councilwoman.<eos> Now she's the Speaker.<eos> Now she has muscle.<eos> We base our decisions on the Broken Windows paradigm.<eos> The moment someone tells me I can't is the moment I'm out of here.<eos> There's no doubt that poor and minority neighborhoods are being singled out in the enforcement of minor offenses.<eos> Only because that's where most of the offenses occur.<eos> But you can't say that.<eos> I just did.
I'm happy to stay.<eos> Well, here's to... a constructive dialogue.<eos> I think he thinks we need a chaperone.<eos> Or a referee.<eos> You know, I got to tell you, I like this couch.<eos> I bet you get a lot of great power naps on this bad boy.<eos> Look, Regina, I know that we haven't always agreed in the past...<eos> We have never agreed about anything in the past.<eos> The point is I've always respected your opinion, and I hope you can respect mine.<eos> Oh, I do.
It's okay, it's okay.<eos> No! Hey. Hey!<eos> No!<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> What should we do with him, Detective?<eos> Lock him up for harassment.<eos> Maybe this'll teach him a lesson.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Would it kill you to hold back a little just once?<eos> I did!
Collecting Amy's journal pages to spare her further humiliation.<eos> Isn't that what you're doing?<eos> Totally, and while we're both helping her, why don't you give me a peek at the pages about me, and I'll give you a peek at the pages about you?<eos> [gasps] What?<eos> I'm not reading them.<eos> That's a total violation of her privacy.<eos> Hmm, well, then I guess you aren't interested in Amy's analysis of your daddy issues.<eos> Please.<eos> Amy didn't write about that.<eos> Or did she, Show Pony?
Ew, a rat. [shrieking]<eos> - Okay! - Trap it!<eos> Trap it! Trap it!<eos> I'm trying. You have to get off my back.<eos> Oh, sweet Bloody Mary.<eos> You saved me from the rat.<eos> I saved myself.<eos> I don't exactly love them.<eos> Liam told me that you didn't kiss Zita.<eos> I really didn't.
I'm not a good dad, see?<eos> - Well, I had a good time there, so...<eos> - Good.<eos> Hey, uh, if I tell you something, can you keep it to yourself?<eos> - Yeah, from who?<eos> - Particularly your cousin Brenda, who I know you're close to.<eos> - Okay, sure.<eos> - So your Aunt Sylvia, um... - she has breast cancer.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> - You do?
You listen to me.<eos> Tijuana is a low-down dirty place where anything goes, which is why I love it.<eos> But you cannot go because you are still a child.<eos> So are you. I think we can agree my childhood ended with that text.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Listen. I love your dad very deeply and I work hard to make sure that our marriage is strong and our love life is spicy.<eos> And I don't feel like I should have to apologize for that.<eos> I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy.<eos> Heather!<eos> Daddy does those things to Mommy.
You guys haven't talked to Matt, have you?<eos> - No way.<eos> - Hell no.<eos> - Team Colleen.<eos> - Hos before bros.<eos> I broke up with him.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Shut the front door.<eos> You just said you missed him.<eos> I do.
We both know it.<eos> - But Mom...<eos> - No, no.<eos> No.<eos> No lectures.<eos> This is not a lecture.<eos> Dad is holding out hope.<eos> He thinks you might change your mind.<eos> About kids.<eos> He does?
No.<eos> Oh...<eos> But look, I'll take care of her.<eos> When she wakes up, she should probably talk to her brother.<eos> And speaking of big scary talks...<eos> We can't do this anymore...<eos> Act like we didn't break up, because... we're really just putting off the inevitable.<eos> I'm not gonna change my mind about having kids.<eos> Jane told you?<eos> Yeah, she did.
That might be true, but these photos are mug shots taken of Sang Min for crimes committed during his illustrious career as a criminal.<eos> Looks like an evolutional chart.<eos> Only, it's going the other way.<eos> Do you recall what offense you committed when this mug shot was taken?<eos> Why don't you tell me, Paco?<eos> I'd be happy to.<eos> It's from... your early years as a criminal mastermind.<eos> When you and James Lam were arrested for extortion.<eos> Only, Lam never went to prison.<eos> And you did.
She's pretty amazing.<eos> Look, Norman, there's something that I need to tell you.<eos> You and Emma.<eos> Something happened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dylan, I'm... I'm glad.<eos> You are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I get it, the... the two of you.<eos> I-I really do.
I walk very quietly down the hall, afraid to go to the kitchen to get a glass of water because I know my dad might still be awake.<eos> I'm sorry, Norman.<eos> You know I love you, don't you?<eos> I know, Daddy.<eos> It's okay, Norman.<eos> Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.
All right, that's it.<eos> Lower him in.<eos> - Wait!<eos> We can't do this.<eos> - Sure we can.<eos> We drop him in, and then, boom, we seal it closed.<eos> What I mean is, we shouldn't do this.<eos> Hiccup, the Skrill hunted you and Toothless.<eos> - It wanted to kill you.<eos> - But it didn't.
I'd be in the kitchen watching Glen make something he likes to cook, and I just kept staring out the window at the chaise.<eos> So then, I think two days after that, Roger calls the house,<eos> I pick up the phone, he says, "Hi, Sarah,"<eos> I say, hey, and my heart's pounding.<eos> It's pounding, and he says, um,<eos> "So I'm thinking about coming over to paint the wainscoting "in the dining room tomorrow, it's peeling.<eos> So is around 11:00 in the morning okay for you?"<eos> And see, here's the- The thing is, he never did that.<eos> He never called before, he just comes over.<eos> He never did that.
- Do you want to hear this?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Okay, so that's when I first met her, was at that dinner, and I<eos> - I forgot - I don't know why, but I asked her why she- when she graduated high school, and you made that joke, you said, "She's your age, Horace. "<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I remember that.<eos> - This doesn't bother you to hear about this?<eos> - No, it's helping me.<eos> I think it's- - Did you forgive me or- - No.<eos> No, I never did.
Those are Glen's kids, not yours, and they lost their mom.<eos> That's what happened to them.<eos> Bu anything you give them is plus.<eos> They got to be with you, okay?<eos> If you leave, it doesn't mean that they give that back.<eos> Just because you pull out doesn't mean that you weren't- that you were never there.<eos> - Boy, you really have a skill at justifying horrible things.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> - No, you don't.
Of course I am.<eos> Then I'm going, too.<eos> No offense, Emma, but you're too emotional.<eos> I-I understand.<eos> You had a loss.<eos> But you're not thinking straight.<eos> Is that you th... is that what you all think?<eos> Emma.<eos> We still don't know how to stop Hades.<eos> Until we do...
It's sacrifice.<eos> It's giving up everything for the person you love.<eos> But Hades won't give up a single thing for you.<eos> Like he said, he wants it all.<eos> Listen to her.<eos> She doesn't think you deserve to be happy.<eos> Look at this office.<eos> Look at this town.<eos> This all belonged to her when you had nothing, remember?<eos> Of course I do!
Zelena!<eos> I owe you thanks for your help.<eos> I have embarked on many a wrongheaded quest in my time.<eos> I'm just glad to finish one that was righteous.<eos> I only wish I knew what happened to Emma.<eos> Emma did exactly what she needed to.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> I do.
- Jesse Kemp just had his lawyer visit him at Chicago Med.<eos> That was Vikan from the gang unit.<eos> He said Brian is affiliated with the gang, but he's not a trigger man.<eos> He does just enough to not have fellow gang members<eos> He can't imagine any scenario in which the G Park Lords would put a hit on Brian, let alone on his 6-year-old son.<eos> - Good news.<eos> - We could use some.<eos> - I was able to contact Maurice Owens.<eos> Know of him?<eos> - I do.
- Lydia Bernstein's been in Cancun for the past ten days.<eos> Her car was parked at the long-term lot at Midway.<eos> She didn't even know it was even missing. - Ruzek, you on parking lot surveillance?<eos> If that's what you want to call it, Boss.<eos> - You can't get a cleaner picture?<eos> - No, this is the best I got. So, based on this video, we're either looking for a human being or a yeti.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Run it through face recognition.<eos> Maybe something will pop. - Where are we at with this new Bryan Johnson?<eos> - Beat cops did a sneak-a-peek at his residence.
I just can't believe it.<eos> Me and Finny were just goofing around, like always, and the last thing I said to him... that no one had a gun to his head... it's one of those things you sort of say without thinking and... the next thing I knew, he...<eos> It's okay, Janet.<eos> "Finn's gone."<eos> (wry laugh)<eos> That's what he said to me.<eos> With a smile on his face.<eos> Was it this man who said it?<eos> No.<eos> The one doing all the talking.
It was just the case, and McGee said...<eos> Whatever.<eos> It can't happen again.<eos> I know.<eos> Trust me.<eos> What you said yesterday, about me dropping in just when you... start feeling whole again.<eos> And what about it?<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> The not feeling whole part.<eos> Do you?
Look, when I read about it,<eos> I read it, I go, "whoa, this is a big deal."<eos> Yeah.<eos> The people who were running this program, including Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA at the time, had to go down into the situation room and face President Obama,<eos> Vice President Biden, at one point during this discussion, sort of exploded in Biden-esque fashion and blamed the Israelis.<eos> He said, "It must have been the Israelis who made a change in the code that enabled it to get out."<eos> Richard Clarke:<eos> President Obama said to the senior leadership,<eos> "You told me it wouldn't get out of the network.<eos> It did.

So help us understand a little more what this thing is whose origin and destination we don't understand.<eos> Gibney:<eos> No, at no time did I get the impression from someone that that's okay, you know, get the little pat on the head, and... and scooted out the door.<eos> I never received a stand-down order.<eos> I never... no one ever asked, "Stop looking at this."<eos> Do we think that this was a nation-state actor and that there are a limited number of nation-states that have such advanced capacity?<eos> Gibney:<eos> Sean McGurk, the director of cyber for the Department of Homeland Security, testified before the senate about how he thought Stuxnet was a terrifying threat to the United States.<eos> Is that not a problem?<eos> I don't... and... and how...
There are companies that run electric power generation or electric power distribution that we know have been hacked by foreign entities that have the ability to shut down the power grid.<eos> Sanger:<eos> Imagine for a moment that not only all the power went off on the east coast, but the entire Internet came down.<eos> Imagine what the economic impact of that is even if it only lasted for 24 hours.<eos> Newsreader:<eos> According to the officials,<eos> Iran is the first country ever in the Middle East to actually be engaged in a cyber war with the United States and Israel.<eos> If anything they said the recent cyber attacks were what encouraged them to plan to set up the cyber army, which will gather computer scientists, programmers, software engineers...<eos> If you are a youth and you see assassination of a nuclear scientist, your nuclear facilities are getting attacked, wouldn't you join your national cyber army?<eos> Well, many did.
Put 'em down right now.<eos> I cannot believe the conversations I have in this room.<eos> I thought cooking was supposed to be relaxing.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Don't put that song on and disappear into Rory's room. Hey!<eos> At least turn it down!<eos> - Did my boxes get here?<eos> - Behind the rack.<eos> Great!<eos> So, you finally did it, huh?
I don't know exactly how many nights, okay?<eos> It was not a lot.<eos> Now the building's going condo.<eos> I'm not ready to buy a condo, so it seemed like the time to say...<eos> - Bye-bye, Brooklyn.<eos> - Bye-bye, Brooklyn.<eos> This box is open.<eos> - Damn that TSA! - Really?<eos> You went through my stuff?<eos> I did.
That was the call that I got.<eos> - Why?<eos> They just bumped it for other stuff.<eos> It happens.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I have a lot of irons in the fire.<eos> I'm still getting a lot of good responses from the New Yorker piece so...<eos> Did I tell you that I attacked Gail Collins?<eos> - You did not.
No. Yes.<eos> All good.<eos> You're right.<eos> Let's go sit and have martinis.<eos> You can tell me all about this new boy.<eos> Well, he's not new.<eos> We've been going out about two years.<eos> - Really?<eos> I must meet him.<eos> - Oh, you did.
- And... you wanted it that big, right?<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> 'Cause it's a... a real presence.<eos> As was your father.<eos> Olive?<eos> And he came and measured the space?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Mario Andretti?<eos> Marco Toretti.<eos> Yes, he did.
I made a mistake!<eos> Are you happy?<eos> I gave them the wrong dimensions, and they screwed it up.<eos> I'm a screw-up!<eos> I admit it!<eos> Just please, don't let this be the only thing you remember to say at my funeral!<eos> So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.

- Lorelai, why are we here?<eos> I tried to broach the subject of adoption.<eos> I don't want to go to Bangladesh to get a baby.<eos> I don't want to go to Woodbury to get a light bulb.<eos> If you won't adopt, this may be our only option,<eos> - and I don't want another picture window. - What?<eos> When we remodeled the house, you wanted a picture window, but it looked weird with the other windows and so you gave it up.<eos> You settled.<eos> I do not remember wanting a picture window.<eos> Well, you did.
Money is nice.<eos> Now I have to hang out with her more to get a handle on the first few chapters so we can bid it out and see who wants it.<eos> That starts in a month, when she gets back from India.<eos> Basically, I had a good day. How was your day?<eos> Well, I had my dry cleaning delivered.<eos> - Oh, I think I win.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really like these pants, so...<eos> - I'm glad it went well.<eos> - It did.
Tomorrow, I'll tell you all I've heard about Naomi Shropshire.<eos> I don't care if she's difficult.<eos> Oh, she's difficult and a little weird.<eos> Well, I like weird.<eos> I was formed by weird.<eos> It could be great, and you deserve that.<eos> I do.<eos> I do deserve that.<eos> Did I tell you she lost her shoes at the club?<eos> - You did not.
Capital "B" on "butter." Yeah, I'm still here, Michel.<eos> - Luke!<eos> - Not now, Taylor.<eos> Well, then when?<eos> I have called, I've left messages,<eos> I even slipped notes under your door at night.<eos> Which I turned over to the FBI.<eos> I know for a fact that you have had septic tank issues.<eos> Taylor, do you see people in here trying to eat?<eos> I do.
Leonard Marlin's daughter works at the UN.<eos> I had her come over.<eos> She doesn't know what language they speak, either.<eos> Mom, what is going on here?<eos> - You mean with the house?<eos> - Start with the house.<eos> I'm decluttering my life.<eos> - You know Marie Kondo?<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't?
- Sounds great, Mom.<eos> She told me to get rid of the Marie Kondo book.<eos> I like her already.<eos> Hey, I did something right.<eos> Law of averages.<eos> I bought a notebook so I can write down things I want to discuss with her.<eos> - That way I won't forget.<eos> - Very sensible.<eos> I told her it was your idea that I come see her.<eos> You did?

You've been spitting nails all week.<eos> Are you aware that the A-listers in this movie are all staying in Woodbury?<eos> - Painfully.<eos> - At the Cheshire Cat. The Cheshire Cat.<eos> With their watery orange juice, scratchy towels and really stinky croissants.<eos> - Yes, we're better than the Cheshire Cat.<eos> - We are better, but they have suites.<eos> Big, comfy suites with soaking tubs and mini-fridges.<eos> - We hate mini-fridges.<eos> - Of course we do.
You Americans really don't listen.<eos> - No, I listen...<eos> - I am on a ledge here.<eos> - Uh, wait, are you literally on a ledge?<eos> - What?<eos> You see, I don't think you have the humor to do this book.<eos> You don't get nuance.<eos> No, I get nuance.<eos> And you flat out dismissed my whale and mouse story.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Oh, please don't.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> So, when was the last time someone audited your books?<eos> - Hey, you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I had a moment. I thought I'd check in. How's my little alumnus doing?<eos> Great.<eos> It's fun being back here, and weird.<eos> - The headmaster says hi.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
- You're catching us at a bad time.<eos> - Are you stalking me?<eos> - Sorry, did I accidentally step into 2003?<eos> What do you need?<eos> Expanded lunch hours?<eos> Hemlines shortened to just below the hoo-ha?<eos> Should I get the nurse?<eos> Or are you and Rory in cahoots again, planning a get-together behind my back?<eos> Is that why you didn't want to get lunch?<eos> I did.
Pretty generic.<eos> You got anything specific?<eos> - You want specifics.<eos> - I'd love some.<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> There could be something in, um, girls who go to Comic-Con type things and sleep with characters.<eos> Character-loving girls.<eos> That sounds obscure.<eos> Very made-up.<eos> Yes, it does.
- Didn't work though, did it?<eos> - Every ride has to end.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... let's do this.<eos> If you change your mind about the house, it's yours.<eos> No strings attached.<eos> I think your days of rescuing me are over.<eos> You never needed rescuing, Ace.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do now.
I should've known it would have something to do with coffee.<eos> Everything in my life has something to do with coffee.<eos> I believe, in a former life, I was coffee.<eos> But the place was closed.<eos> And I had to wait, and I walked around the back and there was this hill.<eos> And... I don't know why, but I walked up the hill and there was this vista, and suddenly something became completely clear to me.<eos> - Luke...<eos> - Stop!<eos> - I know what you're doing.<eos> - You do?
That's that tennis player's name?<eos> Serena?<eos> Actually, my momma named me after Bewitched.<eos> Well, that's a fun story.<eos> So, Serena, first off, congratulations are in order on your brand new marriage.<eos> Renford seems like a new man since you two tied the knot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think it's the juicing.<eos> And now you want to become a member of the DAR.<eos> I do.
It's a group of kids, all about your age.<eos> They've been to college, then out in the real world, and it spit 'em out like a piece of gum.<eos> Now they're all back in their old rooms, like you.<eos> - I'm not back.<eos> - They all hang out together.<eos> That's them there.<eos> So dig out your shoes and ball, 'cause tomorrow you're all goin' bowlin'.<eos> I don't have a ball or shoes.<eos> Did you know about the Thirtysomething Gang?<eos> Yeah, everyone does.
Enjoy your stay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> On a scale of one to ten, how much did I sound like a child molester?<eos> - Six.<eos> - Oh, getting better. Hmm.<eos> - Lorelai.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Did you know I just celebrated a birthday?<eos> - Of course I did.
We are merely trying to satisfy the jury's questions.<eos> No, you're not, Diane.<eos> Don't play innocent.<eos> You're trying to shout down the other evidence - with this melodrama.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> We're not the ones asking the question, Your Honor.<eos> The jury is.<eos> They obviously have some probative value.<eos> Well, first of all, do we even know what this "inaudible noise" was?<eos> We do. Okay.
- Yes.<eos> - Addison, did you stab Tosh Walker?<eos> No!<eos> I didn't.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> So, tell us, what did happen?<eos> At first, I was only meant to take one coin as a souvenir for the first dive.<eos> Right, let's count this lot.<eos> 'I didn't think anyone would notice.'<eos> And when they didn't...
So, thank you.<eos> I'm extremely grateful.<eos> Any time, sir.<eos> Right, jolly good, here we go.<eos> There are bin bags.<eos> We have Marigolds.<eos> And there are additional cleaning accoutrements in the kitchen, should you require them.<eos> But, Chief, do you not think that as I organised the stag party, I should maybe be exempt from cleaning it up?<eos> With respect, Dwayne...<eos> I do not.
And all of sudden, I realize,<eos> "If I jump on them, I will kill them."<eos> So, what did you do?<eos> So, I jump out of the way.<eos> And lucky there was no cars coming.<eos> But Don, oh!<eos> He said a funny, funny thing.<eos> You remember it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
I got it!<eos> Do they know where their son is?<eos> No idea.<eos> Jake's cell phone's off.<eos> They gave me the number of some of his friends.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
Ready?<eos> - Your team searched his nightclub and his condo and you failed to uncover anything linking Martin Ainge to these murders, am I right?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - You found the killer.<eos> His weapon matched the shootings at the shelter<eos> - We know that Ainge is behind the whole thing.<eos> - Well, that's a very compelling allegation, but I'm sorry, I'm not prosecuting based on this.<eos> Ainge gets to go back to club life like nothing ever happened?<eos> - No.<eos> He doesn't.
Maestro, my hero.<eos> She's here.<eos> She appears to be happy. She's ready to rehearse.<eos> We will have a great concert, an historic event.<eos> Yes, Beppi, we will, we will.<eos> But there's a lot of work to do.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A lot.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A lot of work to do.
He's just doing Sibelius the same as he's doing Mozart, the same as he's doing the Ravel, and I resent him for that.<eos> And do you notice that every time you have sex with him, it's exactly the same?<eos> I only had sex with him once.<eos> You've only had sex with him once?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> Well, I can tell you from experience, it is always exactly the same.<eos> - Well-- - Every single stage.<eos> Did he paint f-holes on your back?<eos> - Yes, he did.
That's a good look for you.<eos> Abby...<eos> I told you to go home.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> And miss an all-nighter?<eos> I feel like I'm 13 years old at Missy Trayman's house when her dad passed out drunk and we got to stay up till dawn.<eos> Now that I think about it, Missy had a pretty sad childhood.<eos> Okay.<eos> You said you had something.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> We talked a lot.<eos> But just as friends.<eos> She finally told me about being raped.<eos> She said I was the first guy she felt safe with since it happened.<eos> So... how do you jump from that to "Want to grab a drink sometime?"<eos> I'm the last guy you want to take advice on women from.<eos> So what now?<eos> She had a case for self-defense.<eos> She still does.
Please.<eos> Kayla, you're not safe.<eos> Her life is in danger.<eos> You have to listen to me right now.<eos> Kayla!<eos> You're in danger!<eos> Ma'am, I need to talk to Kayla.<eos> You need to talk to me, Brandon.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
But she would never steal money from her own charity.<eos> And she damn sure wasn't involved in trying to kill anyone.<eos> Patton, you're too close.<eos> Come on!<eos> You got to admit there are a lot of unanswered questions.<eos> We need to check Kayla out.<eos> That's just what we do.<eos> We need to look into her personal computer.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> 'Cause I already did.
That's a sign of growth, right? - Or something.<eos> - Scar tissue.<eos> Maturity.<eos> Cynicism.<eos> You expect the worst in people, - you'll never be disappointed.<eos> - Right.<eos> You think this is the worst of Jason? No.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> He didn't promise you anything, right?<eos> He didn't, did he?
So, please, just have a seat right here.<eos> I have several questions I think the grand jury would like to hear the answers to, um, but I understand that you have a right to invoke spousal privilege. - I do.<eos> - Good.<eos> I just don't want the jury to judge you every time you say "I invoke spousal privilege and elect not to answer the question."<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, members of the grand jury, please refrain from any such judgment.<eos> Now I'd like to turn to our first question.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, did your husband ever make a deal with Lloyd Garber to have his son released in trade for political contributions? No.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, just to be clear, you answered that question.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Everything all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Pretty fast for an associate to get an office, isn't it?<eos> Lucca's good.<eos> Seems like yesterday when we were.<eos> So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?<eos> - Did Diane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, she didn't.
Has that tiny meat suit corrupted you?<eos> This human body is a pitiful sac of blood, piss, and water.<eos> I fear in your case, mostly piss.<eos> She is my mother... a love you know nothing of.<eos> Do not be blinded by mother love.<eos> Or mother lust.<eos> You cannot let this go unpunished.<eos> There are punishments far worse than death.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I did.
Come on, man.<eos> What do you got, an extra eight-by-ten for my moms?<eos> Turn it over.<eos> What's "15" mean?<eos> if you commit another crime with a gun.<eos> And that's a hard number; there won't be any pleading it down.<eos> It's up to you, Tyrell.<eos> None of y'all know me.<eos> None of y'al know where I've been or where I'm going.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Use the basement.<eos> Thank you, Bob, you're the best.<eos> There's something on the board.<eos> There's something on the board!<eos> Bobby, make me one of those!<eos> But hold the egg.<eos> That sounds gross.<eos> And the thyme.<eos> Do you know what?<eos> Just do the tomato one!
Born and raised in L.A.<eos> Former Army Special Forces.<eos> Says here he's working overseas.<eos> He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.<eos> We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything.<eos> Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
No, don't worry about it.<eos> You know what, I got to tell David Lee, so I'll talk to her.<eos> - How are you doing, by the way?<eos> - Good.<eos> Wait, which subject?<eos> Our lost weekend.<eos> Good.<eos> I needed to clear my head.<eos> And we didn't even drink.<eos> We didn't.
Look, he appointed you, but he can't fire you.<eos> You need to hold your ground.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Go to war with the President of the United States?<eos> The White House never respected you.<eos> That's the real problem.<eos> No, Alex. The real problem is I didn't play Richmond's game all the time.<eos> Oh, Tom, come on!<eos> It's called politics.<eos> - And maybe if you did...
Do you want me to admit I'm scared?<eos> Yes, I'm scared.<eos> I don't like that I can't remember.<eos> I don't like that I go away.<eos> But I am also glad... Glad that I'm taking the medication... I hope it helps... and mostly, above everything else,<eos> I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better. I...<eos> I really, really do.
How do you feel?<eos> It was hard.<eos> Why do you have this magical ability to make me feel calm? There's something I got to tell you.<eos> I'm, uh,<eos> I'm actually magical. I'm a unicorn.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you...<eos> Did you say you were a unicorn? I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
Did you say you were a unicorn? I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!<eos> Thank you for... for being whatever it is that you said.<eos> That you say that you are. Okay.<eos> Yeah, you're very welcome.<eos> Warm air.<eos> I can feel warm air in the house.<eos> You got it working.<eos> Yes.<eos> - I did.
You always loved new beginnings, Mother.<eos> Fresh starts.<eos> I don't think I can start over, Norman.<eos> I think you can, Mother. You will.<eos> We'll just do it together.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You really want to do it? - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Give me one sec.<eos> Ginger ale does not get out stains.<eos> I know that.<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to say it?<eos> What are you gonna do when this Mike guy gets back from New York and says to these two, "Hey, guess who isn't married to Dan Logan."<eos> She thinks I don't know where they're coming from. Oh.<eos> Like a person could actually just, in the course of their normal life, bump into that many people who make balloon animals.<eos> Do you?

Well, you didn't seem to want to try things.<eos> I was a virgin when we married, Bill.<eos> I only knew what you showed me, and it was so... polite.<eos> We had the most polite sex in the world.<eos> All that was missing afterwards was a handshake and a thank-you card.<eos> I'm sorry you were disappointed.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> That's my point.<eos> I didn't know enough to be disappointed.<eos> But you did.
So, I'm guessing you had nothing to do with bringing it on yourself.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Can we not?<eos> I need to win this court case so I can clear away the mess of my life and start fresh.<eos> Well, my cab is waiting, so if you wouldn't mind signing my form.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> - I was married for 26 years.<eos> Now I'm divorced.<eos> Potential Juror number 11, before your divorce, did you and your husband ever seek any kind of counseling or therapy?<eos> Yes, we did.
I believe there's even a number for it.<eos> I cannot apologize enough for what happened in St. Louis. The way Bill and I left you hanging with all those reporters.<eos> It was just, well...<eos> Don't make me relive it.<eos> Well, the good news is we're back on our feet, and we're days away from having this whole trial business behind us.<eos> A white wine, please, and for the lady...<eos> A white wine as well.<eos> Our lawyer, Bram Keller... He thinks that this trial could be as important as Scopes.<eos> Didn't Scopes lose?<eos> He did. Yes.
You tell me.<eos> - Here.<eos> - No. I'm fine.<eos> Oh, come on, Bill.<eos> You're a research scientist.<eos> Aren't you a little bit curious?<eos> All right.<eos> One puff.<eos> I believe they call it a hit.<eos> Do they?
Now is your chance to do your speech.<eos> - Bill...<eos> - Please, don't.<eos> No. I have to.<eos> I have to say thank you for what you did for me, for the sacrifice that you made.<eos> - It wasn't a sacrifice.<eos> - Bill...<eos> It wasn't.<eos> I did not do this for you or Libby or anyone else.<eos> I did it for myself.
Park Chancery?<eos> Yeah, they're going to call him to testify Virginia Johnson and I have been meeting at the Park Chancery.<eos> I would be willing to discuss a plea.<eos> I know what you did, Bill, and I know why you did it.<eos> Finally we are back where we belong, together.<eos> Virginia...<eos> I should have called first.<eos> I know.<eos> Did I leave something at the office?<eos> Did you...?
- This is one of those moments.<eos> Could you close the door, please?<eos> What happened between the two of us the night of your party, Art?<eos> This sounds like Perry Mason.<eos> I'm asking you to describe what happened.<eos> We went to bed together.<eos> And by "went to bed together," do you mean that we had sex?<eos> Did we have sex, Art?<eos> Any sort of physical contact at all?<eos> We did not.
So now you're angry with me?<eos> Because Art lied?<eos> I'm... I'm not angry with you, Virginia.<eos> Look, I'm sure you feel guilty enough without my piling on.<eos> Why would I feel guilty?<eos> You should have left that party as soon as you knew what it was.<eos> Instead, you spend the night with an employee, in his bed.<eos> Regardless of what actually happened in that room, you put your reputation and the reputation of the clinic at risk.<eos> But I suspect you already know that.<eos> I do, yes.
Okay then, I take it back.<eos> If you want to have sex tonight...<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Good night, Bram.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Strolling.<eos> Like that?<eos> Does it make you uncomfortable?<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Caught a one-way ticket down south, right?<eos> Let me see if I got this straight.<eos> Malcolm kills her uncle, lures the heir back home, and now this?<eos> How many times do I got to tell you idiots?<eos> Peacemaker can't be touched by revenant hand.<eos> - But-but we-we just thought...<eos> - Don't!<eos> Ever!<eos> Think!<eos> I do the thinking... for all of us.
What the hell?<eos> Easy, Marty.<eos> The witch chose us three for a reason.<eos> Each of us guarding a different piece of the puzzle!<eos> I knew about the hand, Gary hid the stupid book; now I need you to get your piece!<eos> We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
Previously on Masters of Sex...<eos> I've seen the photographs.<eos> Water-skiing with Dody on your shoulders, and then at the end of the summer, she broke your heart, and you came back to me.<eos> Ever since you two had sex, Virginia, you have completely and irrevocably turned on me.<eos> Could you ask Art to come in here, please?<eos> Did we have sex, Art?<eos> Any sort of physical contact at all?<eos> We did not.
You sound exactly the same.<eos> Do I?<eos> What about me?<eos> If-if I had just called you and, uh, tried to- - I don't know-- sell you a magazine subscription, would you have known it was me?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Say "apple pie al a mod-y."<eos> Oh, my God, you're--you are still holding on to that.<eos> I--what can I say?<eos> I didn't speak French. I was trying to impress you.<eos> Oh, you did.
If I know Virginia, she'll take full advantage of this trip.<eos> They're posing as a couple, after all.<eos> They're going through treatment.<eos> I think she's hoping the Masters and Johnson method will work on Masters and Johnson.<eos> It's unbelievable the contortions some women will go through to bend a man to their will.<eos> She's a world-class gymnast.<eos> I could get used to this.<eos> Mrs. Lavery just sat there as he took the Irish Setter, both cars, the house on Long Island... everything.<eos> I was itching to just dramatically bang on the table or something.<eos> Why didn't you?
I sent you at the hospital with the roses... the two dozen long-stemmed roses.<eos> There was no note, no roses.<eos> No, the-the roses I left at the hospital.<eos> It was after visiting hours, so I gave them to the nurse, and told her to prop the note up where you'd be sure to see it.<eos> Well, she didn't.<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> And I didn't understand what I had done.<eos> Why you pulled away.<eos> Well, I-I was waiting for you to say... uh, something.<eos> And when you... when you didn't...
And I'm not ready to leave the clinic when we've barely begun our tenure.<eos> And I'm not willing to put up with as much as you are.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> How I must look.<eos> Raccoon eyes, huh?<eos> And here I... I wanted to take your breath away.<eos> As if I still could.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you take your husband's breath away.<eos> Oh, he-he doesn't look at me.<eos> Or he does.
What you and James have now, it doesn't seem like love.<eos> It seems like punishment. If you stay in this marriage, Louise, this will... this will just keep happening.<eos> Eventually, you will be right back here again.<eos> Don't you think I know that?<eos> Well, then you have to leave, don't you?<eos> How do I do that?<eos> I put this man in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and then I just walk out the door?<eos> You're asking me to trade one form of punishment for another.<eos> How do you know it would be any worse than what you have now?<eos> I don't.

What do you mean?<eos> I mean we're-we're together.<eos> In love.<eos> We're, uh... we're gonna get married.<eos> Look, I know that must seem strange to you, given all the years that Aunt Virginia has been a part of our family and how close you've been to Tessa.<eos> This whole time, you've-you've loved her?<eos> I did.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Look, what you have to understand is that the last thing I wanted was to hurt your mother.<eos> But you did.
Because grown-up lives are just impossibly complicated.<eos> Because I loved Virginia, and as much as I tried, I just couldn't change that feeling.<eos> Well, then you-you weren't trying hard enough.<eos> I was, John.<eos> Look, I'm... look, I'm not saying I'm blameless.<eos> It's far from it.<eos> I have made many mistakes, but that doesn't mean there isn't love in it.<eos> I love you... and Jenny and Howie.<eos> And I did love your mother.<eos> I still do.
Right.<eos> We are gathered here in the sight of God and in the presence of this witness to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate and not to be entered into lightly or unadvisedly but reverently and discreetly.<eos> William Masters, will you have this woman, Virginia Johnson, to be thy wedded wife?<eos> Will you love her, honor her, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> Virginia Johnson, will you have this man, William Masters, to be thy wedded husband?<eos> Will you love him, honor him, keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> Do you pledge to remember that love, trust, and loyalty alone will prevail as the foundation for a happy and enduring home, which will be full of joy and will abide in peace?<eos> We do.

"will never beat faulty logic, I bleed twice."<eos> now, if you count the letters in each word, you get a hexadecimal code which can then be translated into characters.<eos> Kid, just tell us what it says.<eos> "Atone full moon."<eos> Atone on the full moon?<eos> The full moon is tonight.<eos> At exactly 10:36 pm, which means we have less than 5 hours.<eos> The unsub's gonna kill those kids.<eos> We have no idea where he is.<eos> Antonia does.
We said - no trash talk in the bedroom.<eos> We said no work talk in the bedroom.<eos> Just for the record, I am right.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> Meddler.<eos> I still think - I should wait until next year to apply for the grant.<eos> Why?<eos> You're eligible now.<eos> Technically, but they always give the grant to a senior resident anyway.<eos> Except for when they don't.
Welcome back, Kyle.<eos> I showed you my moves.<eos> Time to show us yours.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Your turn to free-style.<eos> This wasn't my fault.<eos> Telling the mother.<eos> Stress doesn't just cause arteries to rupture.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
God bless your heart.<eos> I'm glad you told me... about Jackson's father.<eos> Now you understand why I'm doing this.<eos> Not a bit.<eos> It was an awfully sad story.<eos> But it was your story, not theirs, and stop trying to make it theirs.<eos> I don't have a choice, Richard.<eos> The woman I married... believed in second chances... that anything was possible... and that the glass doesn't always have to be half empty.<eos> And you said your ex-husband didn't know the woman he married.<eos> Well, I do.
- Do you hear me?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Not when you're having my grandbaby.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Listen, what I said before, that was just me being...<eos> Insecure.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> You could have said a lot worse.<eos> I did... earlier.
All right, she told me... everything.<eos> So, yeah, you should just stop... 'cause I see you.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You can't just come in here and pretend to be some nice guy, pretend to be this hero and lie and fool everyone, like Grey and Bailey and Pierce and Amelia.<eos> You can't just take more people away from me.<eos> You can't do it, and I won't let you.<eos> Benjamin Warren!<eos> Miranda Bailey.<eos> You didn't submit your application for the Preminger Grant!<eos> No. Of course I didn't.
Slow down, let me handle this.<eos> I have experience with hardened criminals.<eos> First off, killer Carly Rae Jeps.<eos> Um, do you mind if a sister does, like, five shots?<eos> Look, Mr. Hwang.<eos> Call me by my first name:<eos> Hwang.<eos> Your names is Hwang Hwang?<eos> Oh, you think that's funny?<eos> So did Kim.
Just like that?<eos> Do you have any idea what a slap in the face this is?<eos> How long?<eos> !<eos> How long have I been sitting on a couch discussing my marriage with someone who has already checked out?<eos> - That's not what I was doing.<eos> - I just want to know when it happened.<eos> When did you decide that you were done?<eos> - She didn't say that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Too bad you won't be getting any sleep.<eos> I don't want to talk, because you know what?<eos> I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say "You love me, but"!<eos> You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
And it's not clear for me anymore.<eos> This...<eos> When I look at you and I stop thinking...<eos> When I let myself just be with you...<eos> All I'm saying is, I don't think that I want what I wanted anymore.<eos> And what I want...<eos> What?<eos> I want you.<eos> You guys had sex.<eos> Yeah, we did, too.
You... you okay? Hey.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're... we're here.<eos> We're okay.<eos> I had a gun pointed at me.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> My life flashed before my eyes.<eos> - It... it... it really did.
- Oh, h-h-hold on.<eos> - What?<eos> Like "Harper Avery" Avery?<eos> Uh, yeah, actually.<eos> - Anyway...<eos> - So you're, like, born to the throne.<eos> You know what?<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> Do you know a Catherine Avery, the urologist?<eos> I do, actually.
Come on.<eos> I'm not gonna do it here, I promise.<eos> First, I'd swing by Home Depot.<eos> Pick up a nice, polyethylene plastic sheet, lay it out nice and neat so as not to make a mess.<eos> Then I'd take my final, last shot of Jonathan Daniel's, leave the instructions for my internment and a nice $6,500 check for burial costs.<eos> Actually, things are more expensive out here.<eos> I might need to look into that.<eos> My point was, you'd use your dominant hand.<eos> So why would Alvarez shoot himself with his right hand if he was lefty?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
I didn't kill him.<eos> The Grand Prix is a disaster zone.<eos> Thousands of dollars worth of damages.<eos> Not to mention a bus driver I may have to charge with manslaughter.<eos> What the hell did this guy do?<eos> - He had a tattoo. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Tell him, tell him what the ta...<eos> Uh, he had a... a skull tattoo on the side of his neck, which I associated with a cartel in Juarez.<eos> Right, so he questioned him.<eos> - I did.
All right.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I will see you tomorrow, right?<eos> You're not gonna go home and, like...<eos> No. Not tonight.<eos> But you want to.<eos> For real.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
And why is that?<eos> 'Cause she'd be ashamed of me.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> That's probably the least crazy thing about you.<eos> Martin!<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> Oh, he just dropped this off and then he was leaving.<eos> Well, did you invite him in?<eos> - No, 'cause he's...<eos> - No, he did not.
No, honey, we did it.<eos> Like, you know, "it."<eos> Oh... okay.<eos> Well... good job, Greg.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> All right, hey, listen, is anyone gonna eat this last Eggo?<eos> Oh, I was actually eyeing it. Wait a minute.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> What... no... sure, no, sure I do.
You don't like me.<eos> But I need a favor, and there's no one else I can ask.<eos> I have to access some records, and I can't use my code to log in.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because no one can know I looked at them.<eos> - You caught me on the right day.<eos> - Don't tell me;<eos> I don't want to know anything about it.<eos> - I realize this is a very uncomfortable situation, really.<eos> - Do you?
- But I need your help to do that.<eos> - Look.<eos> We already know that most of those girls were students at St. Fabiola's.<eos> Is there someone at the school we should be looking at?<eos> - I don't work there.<eos> - Please. Please.<eos> Okay, you know, sometimes the guidance counselors at these schools have their fingers on the pulse of what's going on.<eos> Are you saying we should be talking to Father Eugene?<eos> What, you know him?<eos> Yes, we do.
- But you don't have to.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about your trafficking ring.<eos> And I'm not talking to anyone about it ever again.<eos> Stop, listen...<eos> Thank you, Monsignor.<eos> I know I've put a heavy burden on you, but I have faith that the D.A.'s office will do the right thing.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Please, this has to end.<eos> I want to spare these girls any more exploitation.<eos> We all do.
I think you have more anger than you know what to do with.<eos> Hey, you didn't answer my question.<eos> I think there is a choice even when there appears to be none, but it's the reaction that determines whether the choice is good or bad, not the person who makes it.<eos> And what would Juliette think?<eos> I don't go there.<eos> Too dangerous.<eos> - You're here early.<eos> - Been here all night.<eos> - I thought you had a date.<eos> - I did.
Pilcher would be proud.<eos> I'm not so sure about clearance procedures, given your situation.<eos> You heard Jason.<eos> He wants me to be welcomed back.<eos> You wouldn't want to disobey orders, would you?<eos> - No. - It'll be all right.<eos> Pam?<eos> Oh. [chuckles] Here you are.<eos> I wasn't aware that we had an appointment.<eos> We don't.
You take care, Megan.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Let me clean you up a little, Theo.<eos> Pam Pilcher.<eos> What about her?<eos> She said she was in Hawaii, when they took us.<eos> Some of them came here on their own, you know.<eos> People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?
Stop!<eos> If they can learn? Let's teach them some consequences.<eos> [gunshot]<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop! Hey! Think about it.<eos> Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you wanna take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it, is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you any more?<eos> Of course, they do.
When you go to sleep, I promise you, I will be there.<eos> And when you wake up, I will be there, too.<eos> Wherever I am. And whenever you are. Both of you.<eos> [sobbing] [engine revving]<eos> The last group is moving towards the pods.<eos> Which we hope will work.<eos> There are no guarantees in this life.<eos> You're a surgeon, you know this.<eos> L've had lives in my hands, held a human heart beating.<eos> Did one earlier today, as a matter of fact.
I know.<eos> I thought I did a pretty good job for you. But I guess I was wrong.<eos> So you say hello to the future for me, okay?<eos> Arlene.<eos> You're taking his pod.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Yedlin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still don't know why you did that.<eos> I don't either.
But you must wonder.<eos> All the differences.<eos> Y'know - the way she was when she came back.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What happened to us, Sam?<eos> We managed - we struggled on for 11 years after she was taken.<eos> What were we doing, just fooling ourselves that it could all just go back to how it was before she went?<eos> We got through it then because I loved you.<eos> You and Matthew and Alice...<eos> and I still do.
It was a tragedy what happened to her mother.<eos> You must realise, Alice, you are the only one who can help us find your friend.<eos> I studied Sophie Giroux for years and years.<eos> There is a gesture she makes, a nervous habit.<eos> This girl, Alice, made the same gesture. And what?<eos> Alice's parents - they just accept it? Does she seem... different to you?<eos> Was there a yellow van mentioned in Alice's abduction?<eos> That was the only clue we had in Sophie's case.<eos> I can't keep coming round.<eos> Then don't.
They found him guilty.<eos> It was...<eos> There were pictures on the camera.<eos> It was my husband.<eos> Your husband was a prominent figure in the community, yes?<eos> Did Adam Gettrick ever come to the shop?<eos> Er, yes.<eos> Sometimes, I suppose.<eos> He would have known your husband's hobby. Bird-watching.<eos> Most people did.
I'll say it was me.<eos> Give us the pass.<eos> What are they going to do to you?<eos> Dad, you can't... Give me the pass.<eos> And just keep your mum out of this cos she doesn't need this worry right now, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> - OK, I won't tell her.<eos> How many times I have to tell you I don't blame you for what happened to Alice.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - But I do.
I can't help you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But maybe Eve can help you, if they find something to do with this picture.<eos> Eve...<eos> So we sit and we wait and, er... we hope.<eos> What's wrong, Matty?<eos> That French detective came to my house.<eos> He reckons the guy that used to run the Army garrison has something to do with my sister's disappearance.<eos> - You believe this? - I don't know.<eos> But my mum does.

- You gave me your word he wouldn't.<eos> If you kill her, you kill yourself.<eos> Then you'll be the last person I disappoint.<eos> But this inhuman creature must be made to pay.<eos> Hey, take revenge now, and it's over.<eos> But that coil inside stays just as tight, Doc.<eos> What if her suffering wasn't just a gunshot away?<eos> What if you could make it last?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
To swim far, far out into the ocean so that I can't see the bottom anymore.<eos> To eat geoduck.<eos> Isn't it the one that kinda looks like a p...<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Point is, I've always wanted to do things that scared me.<eos> But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Because I don't wanna be friends.<eos> When I think about what I wanna do most in this world... it's you.<eos> Oh God, that sounded so much more romantic in my head.<eos> Just jump in any time, Nicole, because I really, really don't know how to do this.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
Uh, so I will clip it, right?<eos> Hush.<eos> Crap.<eos> It's a tumor.<eos> No.<eos> It's an aneurysm.<eos> That's... that's an aneurysm?<eos> I've never seen one that big.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to clip that.<eos> Neither do I.
And if she didn't say yes or no...<eos> I mean, April... I mean, she's, like, fine.<eos> It's like she's better than fine.<eos> You'd think that she was the one that was pushing for the damn divorce.<eos> Sloan always wanted me to try golf.<eos> I never liked golf.<eos> Love golf.<eos> Just don't try hockey.<eos> Ow! Jo doesn't know what she wants.<eos> Neither does Amelia.
And every time we have sex or a fight, he could just pull it out and point it at me.<eos> Do you even want the ring?<eos> I don't want it... right now.<eos> Grey and Shepherd are gonna kill each other, and I'm going to die in the crossfire.<eos> Grey needs to chill 'cause it's not even her case.<eos> Shepherd could cut her some slack.<eos> It was her case.<eos> It was supposed to be my case.<eos> Do you think I should tell him to take it back?<eos> Jo, you already did.
I have not.<eos> No, no card for me, though I own the walls that support them and the floor they dance on.<eos> Yeah, Louis hasn't been asked either, though young Master Frank will dance soon enough to Louis's tune.<eos> He'll certainly have a great responsibility to discharge.<eos> Don't worry about Louis.<eos> And there are no other major bequests I shall have to deal with?<eos> Not unless Louis dies before he's 30, in which case, it all goes to my sister's eldest child.<eos> - What?<eos> - My sister Anna. You remember.<eos> Of course you do.
Just finishing up.<eos> Okay.<eos> See?<eos> We were just finishing up, sweetheart.<eos> - We're done.<eos> - Ozzy.<eos> Ozzy.<eos> I fucking told you everything, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure you did.
Tomorrow I'm gonna cash in my nest egg for a big ol' pirate ship to sail away in!<eos> First pranking is a rite of passage for every possum.<eos> Peaches gets to be the first April fool in history.<eos> She's gonna be so happy.<eos> Shh! Here she comes!<eos> We're the best uncles ever! Shh!<eos> But I...<eos> I don't get it!<eos> We set a vicious booby trap for our niece.<eos> We did everything right here!
Okay, give me something concrete, please.<eos> Murder weapon was a .308 caliber sniper rifle.<eos> CSU found a spent shell casing on a rooftop 70 yards from the podium.<eos> Ballistics thinks there could have been major drag resistance on a shot that long.<eos> In which case, the shot would have fallen mid-air.<eos> Fallen or shifted laterally.<eos> Up to six inches per the estimate.<eos> Okay, so what?<eos> Shooter didn't miss.<eos> What if he did?
Two days out, she cancels.<eos> Why?<eos> Justin's bio final was pushed up.<eos> She said the trip could wait.<eos> They'd get down there soon enough.<eos> [SNIFFLES]<eos> I found these in Justin's drawer.<eos> Two tickets to Florida for next month.<eos> She thought she had time.<eos> We all do.
It's okay.<eos> [VOICE BREAKING] No, it's not.<eos> [SOBBING]<eos> It's gonna be.<eos> Jake is proposing to Jen tonight.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Didn't he just start dating that chick like a month ago?<eos> So where does he get off proposing?<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - I do.
- All the time.<eos> At the time of the operation, as you know, structural alterations were discovered.<eos> Of course.<eos> The blockage in the lung.<eos> It's time we gave that blockage a name, sir.<eos> It was a tumor.<eos> A malignant tumor.<eos> I see.<eos> - But... we removed it?<eos> - We did.
Well, what's inside?<eos> Everything they want me to know, they stick on top.<eos> Everything they'd rather I didn't know,<eos> Cabinet meetings, Foreign Office briefings, they tuck away at the bottom.<eos> Which is why... the first thing I do when no one is looking, is this.<eos> Will you take that?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you get sick of it all?<eos> I do.
- Sir?<eos> She is the job.<eos> She is the essence of your duty.<eos> Loving her.<eos> Protecting her.<eos> Of course, you'll miss your career.<eos> But doing this for her, doing this for me... there may be no greater act of patriotism.<eos> Or love.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Do you, boy?
So we got two vics.<eos> Okay, church lady says the van is usually driven by their reverend, a Father Joseph Leahy.<eos> Another priest?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> _ Yes, that's our minivan.<eos> I loaned it to Nina this morning.<eos> She said she was in trouble. Is she okay?<eos> Do you have any idea where she was headed?<eos> I gave her the keys to my family's lake house in Vermont.<eos> You did?
Of course.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> - SHE SCREAMS - What do 'ee do to 'er?<eos> Rosina, can you stand?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I'll be here to catch you.<eos> Nay, surgeon, if anyone shall, 'tis I.<eos> I think...<eos> I believe.<eos> What did 'ee do?
Elizabeth will accept, and the money can be transferred to her.<eos> So, do I understand you aright?<eos> You are offering ã600 for a half share in a mine which is about to close, when you owe George Warleggan, the man who will happily see you in debtors' prison... ã1,400!<eos> Correct.<eos> As your banker and friend, I must advise against.<eos> You cannot afford it.<eos> And you have your own wife and child to care for.<eos> Would it not seem as if you value your cousin-in-law's comfort ahead of hers?<eos> It might, if I chose to tell her.<eos> Which I do not.
Me too.<eos> I was sort of spinning out about what sex with you means.<eos> It's embarrassing, but I had this dumb idea that someone was gonna take away my gay card.<eos> I'm a gay man, Shane.<eos> If you don't see me as fully male, then maybe we shouldn't date.<eos> No, no, no. W-we should.<eos> I just... The words came out wrong.<eos> I thought I was ready for this. I'm not.<eos> - Hey, but let's talk.<eos> - We just did.
18 years old.<eos> My goodness, she's lovely.<eos> Fauzi.<eos> What?<eos> A daughter's a blessing.<eos> And look at you.<eos> In the palace.<eos> I always said this is where you were meant to be.<eos> Well, it's only temporary.<eos> But, uh... yes, you did.
They're not gonna leave us alone, are they, the Caliphate?<eos> There's no living side by side.<eos> They're gonna push us and push us until it's like,<eos> "Either you kill us or we kill you."<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hope not.<eos> It's not enough to hope though, is it?<eos> You have to do something.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
You cannot seriously be thinking of offering - that man one of the few - We've got to contain this outbreak.<eos> - existing doses of the cure<eos> - We have got to have a cease-fire<eos> - you've got.<eos> - in place with Boko Haram.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Jay, this drug could be our only leverage.<eos> So you'd rather give it to a mass murderer than to any one of the decent people who've been infected?<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Mary Thorne?<eos> - She'd come in from Boxall Hill.<eos> We hadn't seen each other since my engagement, so Patience invited her.<eos> Patience Oriel may ask whom she pleases to the Rectory. But you must support your brother.<eos> - Surely, when I'm Mrs Oriel.<eos> - When you're married you may do as you wish, but you are not married yet.<eos> - Did she talk of Frank?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Does he write to her?<eos> No, he does not, nor she to him.
Are you engaged elsewhere?<eos> - No.<eos> But I'm not free.<eos> You have led me on, Miss Thorne.<eos> You have led me on most wickedly!<eos> He has fallen victim to her wiles.<eos> What is the point of talking like that, Mama?<eos> You think everything is lost, then?<eos> Do I think Frank will be true to Mary Thorne?<eos> Yes, I do.
I feel so high up, here.<eos> Will you help me down?<eos> Ahem. Yes.<eos> Mary... .. do you remember when we were last together?<eos> I remember you were very foolish.<eos> Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do.
The Countess de Courcy and the Lady Arabella Gresham.<eos> Is your uncle not at home, child?<eos> He sent a message.<eos> He has gone to Boxall Hill.<eos> It is just as well, since it is to you we wish to speak.<eos> You know how fond we are of you.<eos> Mary, can we not put an end to this ill-feeling?<eos> It all depends on one thing, you know, and one thing only.<eos> Miss Thorne, do you consider yourself engaged to my nephew?<eos> Yes. I do.
And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.<eos> Sheldon.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Right, Murdoch, I think it's time we did a complete inventory - of Mr. Crawford's pawnshop.<eos> - Right.<eos> O... OK, look...<eos> I shouldn't be telling you this.<eos> I mean, it could get me into a lot of trouble.<eos> You were making payments to Station House Number Five.<eos> - To whom?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Don't play silly buggers, Eddie.<eos> - I don't.
Can you supply corroborating evidence of anyone else other than your colleague?<eos> - Eddie Crawford.<eos> - The pawnbroker?<eos> Crawford's payments were marked with an ink that's visible only under ultra-violet light.<eos> Why would we do that unless it was our intention to prove where that money came from?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> If the money is marked, I'll accept your story.<eos> What am I supposed to be seeing?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
- Good evening, Doctor.<eos> - Inspector.<eos> I'm sorry for dragging you to such a place at this time of night.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I've always wondered what it looked like inside.<eos> Not an entirely unlikely venue in which to find a murder.<eos> More unexpected that anyone bothered to tell us about it.<eos> Henry.<eos> Who telephoned the police?<eos> Well, sir... - I did. - George?
Look, Crabtree, I'm glad you're having yourself a bit of fun with that dancer.<eos> She is a looker.<eos> But be careful.<eos> Careful, sir?<eos> Women like that are only after one thing.<eos> Look at yourself: nice lad, good prospects.<eos> Not the sort that she usually crosses paths with.<eos> She may be trying to entrap you, George, into marriage.<eos> Sirs, she's not interested in that, she's told me as much.<eos> Of course she did.
Oh! We know how much George loves pens!<eos> Right!<eos> William, I can't see how this is a good idea from any perspective.<eos> Let's make our guests feel welcome, shall we?<eos> We'll head down to the dining room when George appears.<eos> - Oh! - Cheese?<eos> Must be nice to have someone do all the cooking for you.<eos> You should have tasted the abomination - Thomas made for me last night.<eos> - Sir, you didn't.<eos> I did indeed.
So, Danny boy... ..be careful.<eos> Hanging around people like that - you don't want that shit to stick.<eos> You don't like them 'cause they're better than you.<eos> At least they've done something with their life.<eos> Danny! All you do is drive from Melbourne to bloody Perth and back again.<eos> One day they'll train monkeys to do your job.<eos> Danny!<eos> You're getting fat.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Yes, I did.
I quit school.<eos> I started working.<eos> But I'd learned how to drink, so I just kept doing that.<eos> And, uh...<eos> I don't know, then I started drinking here.<eos> And your father liked me, so I moved in with him...<eos> - And then he died.<eos> And since then, Pete has been supporting you out of the cash register, and you drank here free.<eos> - Yeah, that's right. - And- and then Pete died.<eos> - Mm-hmm, yes, he did.
They knew this was coming, and they got out so they could all have it on record that they were gone before the suit came down.<eos> Then we need to know who the hell tipped them off.<eos> It doesn't matter who tipped them off.<eos> What matters is, if we lose this suit, we can't handle the money.<eos> How much are they suing us for?<eos> - $100 million. - God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.<eos> And right now we don't even know where they went.<eos> I do.
Yeah, that much I already know.<eos> What I don't know is why we should trust you.<eos> Whether you believe it or not, I still care about you guys.<eos> Besides, you've got no choice.<eos> It's been arranged.<eos> The Ishida cruiser is sending a shuttle to pick me up.<eos> When it gets here, we make our move.<eos> - Where's Two?<eos> - In solitary.<eos> - What did she do?
Just let 'em go, Anders.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Help me.<eos> Warden, a shuttle just launched.<eos> This way.<eos> Android, get us out of here.<eos> I am unable to establish a neural link.<eos> Go to the bridge.<eos> Do it manually.
I'd like to stay a while.<eos> Explore the station.<eos> Rejoin you later if that's all right.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> You can stay too, if you want.<eos> No, I'll come back with you.<eos> Have fun.<eos> You gotta understand, Titch, if we'd known, we never would've left you there.<eos> We thought you died on that godforsaken planet.<eos> Almost did.
He has sex with girls the minute they turn 18, and he films it.<eos> Uh, here he is.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Auditions girls from all over the country.<eos> Detective, I take it that you are checking to see if any of those young women are underage.<eos> Or if Bo was maybe "rehearsing" with them before their birthdays, but couldn't prove it.<eos> Any chance this Bo guy resented your investigation and took it out on Hudson?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> When we had no luck on the underage-sex front, we passed the case on to Narco, thought they might have a better chance getting Bo on a drug charge, and we moved on.<eos> Well, Hudson didn't.
Okay. Fine. The bitch paid me to kill her husband,<eos> What was her motive?<eos> Claire did everything for robert when he was sick -- Nursed him, kept his business together. Even changed his bedding, if you know what i mean.<eos> And then when he gets well, he dumps her.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know, really. I guess he was dying for so long That he wanted to live it up a little,<eos> that was claire giving the bastard One last chance to do the right thing.<eos> She told robert that he owed it to her To, uh, rekindle the flames or whatever.<eos> And if he still felt the same After they relived their honeymoon Along the california coast,<eos> And she did.
We've been married now for three years and I've seen you, maybe, 98 days over that time.<eos> Well, you're at trials.<eos> I mean, I'm... I run a law firm.<eos> That's just who we are.<eos> Diane, I'm selling my business.<eos> I want to move in together... full-time.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You had me so worried.<eos> I thought you wanted a divorce!<eos> I don't.
No, sir.<eos> One day we'll be remembered as heroes. Yeah.<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> Dad!<eos> Come out with your hands up!<eos> Mr. Colson, come out with your hands up. I repeat... come out slowly with your hands up!<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> This is a much bigger operation than I imagined.<eos> Good thing you stopped them.<eos> We didn't.
Dwight said the zyklon brotherhood had changed leaders?<eos> He never admitted to being part of zyklon.<eos> He kept it generic Aryan, but yes, there was a name of a guy.<eos> Huh.<eos> Would it be in your notes?<eos> You know, that's a great idea. Yes, I recorded all our sessions.<eos> And do you remember where those recordings are?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, do you want me to tell you where to find them?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I killed a man.<eos> To save the lives of others.<eos> The Bible says, "thou shalt not kill."<eos> God forgives these sins when they're made in the pursuit of justice and saving the lives of others.<eos> Except that I am not sorry.<eos> What? There is no guilt.<eos> There is no remorse.<eos> There is no compassion for his soul.<eos> In fact, the more I investigated Dwight, the less human he seems.<eos> Because of what he did in the courtroom?
It's under the couch.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We handled it.<eos> It's our perp.<eos> Aly, I want you back. I...<eos> - I-I want you back.<eos> - Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?<eos> I miss having you as my partner.<eos> Do you want to tell me why you left?<eos> 'Cause you never did.
Sorry, Blake.<eos> No special treatment.<eos> Same thing I tell my husband.<eos> Hunt!<eos> We got incoming.<eos> - Be right there.<eos> - Good luck!<eos> Um, you know Curt Morgan?<eos> The neuro-ophthalmologist?<eos> I do, yeah.
It's on me.<eos> And I am trying.<eos> I just, I don't know how to make...<eos> So if we had another practice run and we were in the cadaver lab and you had all the time in the world, where would you start?<eos> We don't have time!<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what's the first thing you would do?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Yes, you do.
We've been seeing each other... as a couple, romantically... in romance.<eos> So you want to keep the surgery this morning, then?<eos> Yes, that would be fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. I'll see you in there.<eos> That was hard to watch.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It was hard to do.<eos> It was really hard to watch, though.<eos> So, I... I did it.
So, did you find something new or...<eos> Warren, we need you to tell us why.<eos> Why what?<eos> Why, when the elevator doors opened, you chose to ignore it...<eos> I have told you and told you and cut open Gretchen McKay anyway.<eos> ...that I did not make a choice.<eos> I wasn't given one.<eos> I-I was forced to use the knowledge and resources I had to fulfill the oath I took to save her life...<eos> Because the door didn't open.<eos> No, it did.

I just don't understand how you didn't see it happen.<eos> You do.<eos> You know.<eos> Y-You should know.<eos> Y-You're surgeons.<eos> You know what it's like.<eos> You... When you operate, when you control if a person breathes another breath, when... when you hold their beating heart in your hand, when you are responsible for that life, you don't see or hear or feel anything else.<eos> The rest of the world just disappears.<eos> You know that.<eos> You all do.
And we'll figure it out, right?<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Um, so, we will talk about it, okay?<eos> But just thank you.<eos> Every surgeon who worked on Mrs. McKay and the baby said the same thing, including Dr. Warren.<eos> That they were backed into a corner and they didn't have a choice.<eos> The only difference with Warren is whether or not you think he's lying, whether you believe he didn't see that door open.<eos> And do you think he was lying?<eos> - No.<eos> - We don't.
Hi! Hi, baby.<eos> Hi! Hi!<eos> Hi!<eos> - ♪ rest your head ♪ - You paged?<eos> Um, Robbins has requested you for her service for the foreseeable future.<eos> Apparently, you're really good with the moms.<eos> Yeah, I'm not.<eos> I just did what Robbins...<eos> No, you helped that woman through the scariest hours of her life.<eos> I did, didn't I?
He's right.<eos> Let's go get that crystal.<eos> Let's.<eos> - Where should we start?<eos> - Actually, um...<eos> I was thinking maybe you should sit this one out.<eos> Oh, that's why you were trying to be delicate with me.<eos> You're worried the Evil Queen is about to come out to play.<eos> No, I just want what's best for you.<eos> No, you don't.
I was so wrapped up worrying about how you'd react to Hook,<eos> I...<eos> I wasn't there for you about Robin.<eos> You want to know why I got so angry?<eos> Because you're right.<eos> The Evil Queen... is inside me... always trying to get out.<eos> I can't expect you to get it.<eos> Well, I fought the darkness.<eos> You know I do understand.<eos> All due respect, but you don't.
Why would you try to destroy magic?<eos> Do you really have to ask me that?<eos> You finally had a chance to be happy, and then magic took it away from you, just like with Daniel.<eos> Henry, the Evil Queen is never coming back.<eos> You don't have to worry about me.<eos> I don't, because my other mom is doing that for me.<eos> You thought she was gonna go all Evil Queen again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have trusted Regina.<eos> But you didn't!
Those exact words.<eos> They're playing on a loop in my head.<eos> Put a pin in Minister Avdonin and find me Dean Ward.<eos> Get her on the phone?<eos> No, find out where she is.<eos> Right now?<eos> Dean Ward, what a coincidence.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> I didn't know you went here.<eos> I don't.
All we need is a hair, a cell, a drop of blood.<eos> We'll find something.<eos> I like your optimism.<eos> Joe Harris had financial problems.<eos> He was a month or two from filing for bankruptcy when Alice arrived at the prison.<eos> - She saved his ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did he know the contract and the money came from Alice?<eos> - Unclear.<eos> - He did.
- It is.<eos> No further cognitive loss.<eos> I'm experiencing a little dizziness, but, um...<eos> - Whose house is this?<eos> - R-Really?<eos> I pranked you.<eos> You believed me.<eos> I pranked you and you believed me!<eos> I did.<eos> I really did.
- Uh, if he doesn't know that we're on to him.<eos> Mm-hmm. He might try and use 'em.<eos> Can you flag all the missing credit cards for me?<eos> Anybody so much as buys as tank of gas, I wanna know about it.<eos> - This is my mug.<eos> - What?<eos> This is my mug!<eos> I left it at your house.<eos> It is.<eos> You did.
Well, we needed the volunteers, and I've got a really good stagger.<eos> Even if Jared ID's Christine, this is not gonna hold up... in court.<eos> Probably not, but it'll justify holding her.<eos> And looks like we have our zombie lineup.<eos> - Take your time. - Hmm.<eos> Can you make them groan?<eos> Can I get a groan from each of the zombies, left to right, please?<eos> Can you make them say, "Brains..."?<eos> You didn't tell us the suspect said, "Brains."<eos> They didn't.
Oh! I may be getting old.<eos> Right now retirement sounds sweet.<eos> When you leave, CJ may snatch you up.<eos> Yes, sir, meet at the airport.<eos> My boss found an oxy smuggling ring in New York, and he wants me on a plane to help consult.<eos> - You got reinstated.<eos> That's great!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just don't know how I get over two men dying on my watch.<eos> Mm, you don't.
- Okay. Um... we don't do interviews.<eos> So I'll, uh, get an officer and he'll escort you...<eos> - But I can help you...<eos> - ...to the front.<eos> ...if you just tell me about the case.<eos> Uh, I think you're a little bit confused.<eos> We ask the questions.<eos> How is it exactly you think you can help us?<eos> - I know who did it.<eos> - You do.
- Well, he's a hard guy to avoid.<eos> Then maybe you shouldn't avoid him.<eos> - I'll call him.<eos> I promise. - I bet you'll have a good time.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - And maybe after the concert, you guys could sign up for Cub Scouts.<eos> I'm gonna disown my mother.<eos> [Laughs] That won't stop her from telling me all the cute Frankie Junior stories.<eos> Did you find anything in the historical document room at the library, Scout?<eos> - Actually, I did.
Bye.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've had the same bra for 10 years.<eos> - I always wear clean underwear.<eos> - I believe you. [Laughs]<eos> Hey, thanks for letting me put you on the spot.<eos> It's no problem, Detective.<eos> - I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> - You didn't.
Frankie, what's going on with the prison logs?<eos> And the ball magically melds with the cup.<eos> - Frankie!<eos> - What?<eos> I'm on hold.<eos> They're taking forever to pull the logs.<eos> Moving at a snail's pace.<eos> No.<eos> I saw the second ball hit the table before the cup dropped.<eos> You did not.
Hi.<eos> Jane and Frankie are out on a case.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> I was just bringing in - some reinforcements for everybody.<eos> - Ah, thank you.<eos> We ran right through the last batch.<eos> - Italian is my favorite.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Frankie's been teaching me to cook.<eos> - We did chicken parm last week.
I'm too tired to be insulted.<eos> And tonight... I sleep for a week.<eos> I think the record for sleep deprivation is about 19 days.<eos> Hold up. This is something that you don't know the exact factoid on?<eos> Wow, maybe the both of you are sleep deprived.<eos> Well, the "Guinness Book of World Records"<eos> no longer keeps statistics on this subject for fear that those competing for the title would suffer ill effects.<eos> Sometimes I think you're actually a robot.<eos> I do know how to do the robot.<eos> - No, you don't.

It doesn't look like he has any clothes.<eos> - Really?<eos> - No.<eos> So, whatever happened to Johnny?<eos> - He pulled a real disappearing act.<eos> - Did you say...<eos> - disappearing act? - No, I did not.<eos> Oh, I think I know that trick.<eos> - No.<eos> You really don't.
I'll make myself scarce.<eos> And a nosh.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I made you your favorite breakfast,<eos> French toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese.<eos> - You wanna know why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I made a really big decision about us.<eos> - You did?
But I did discover trace amounts of rust on many of the pellets.<eos> - Lead doesn't rust.<eos> - No.<eos> I believe the pellets picked up the particles from a rusty shotgun barrel.<eos> So this got me thinking, "In turn, what could the pellets have picked up from said barrel?"<eos> A curious mind is a wondrous thing.<eos> Well, I decided to indulge my curiosity with further metallurgy tests.<eos> I discovered that the pellets picked up trace particles of a hardened steel laminate with a carbon point of .06.<eos> - We need to check with the FBI firearms database.<eos> - I did.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> So you broke up with me under false pretenses.<eos> So I reject your breakup.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unless you can stand there and honestly tell me that you don't love me the way I love you.<eos> You love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm a broker. He hired me to sell his business.<eos> - The funeral home?<eos> - Yes. He said he wanted to sell as quickly as possible.<eos> I had an offer from a big chain mortuary, and I was bringing him the papers to sign.<eos> Did he say why he was selling?<eos> He said he was fed up with the business.<eos> I figured they had money problems.<eos> A lot of these places do.
Yeah, but maybe the truth is that I'm not particularly good at it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you didn't hit it out of the park on your first try?<eos> I'm wrong until I'm right on every murder we've got.<eos> Okay, they're bringing in my suspect.<eos> Jane.<eos> Did you really like the chapters that you read?<eos> - Honestly.<eos> No sugarcoating.<eos> - Yes. I did.
It's actually not up to us.<eos> Some sex offender parolees have to live 1,000 feet from a school or a playgr...<eos> Oh, they should be 1,000 feet from Earth.<eos> Mr. Nomaks, I can only imagine how upset you are...<eos> I should have never let you move into that neighborhood.<eos> Dad.<eos> I really need to speak with your daughter.<eos> You're moving back home, now.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Free.<eos> Now let's make sure no one can ever steal this again.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> I'd hate to be trapped in this town without magic.<eos> That would be truly barbaric.<eos> Mr. Hyde.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Gold.<eos> He made a deal with you, didn't he?<eos> Yes, that he did.
I don't care what it says.<eos> You don't let me in there and something's wrong with him, I will make it my life's purpose to make your life a living hell.<eos> Ma'am, I worked maximum security for ten years, so if you think I'm gonna be intimidated by the likes of you, you've got another thing coming.<eos> You know, usually it takes prisoners a couple of weeks to get their first violation.<eos> You've been here less than 24 hours.<eos> That might just be a record.<eos> Yeah, I don't care.<eos> I need to make a phone call.<eos> You're not making anything after what you just did.<eos> I didn't do anything.
And if I am?<eos> Then I get you a job.<eos> And if I'm not?<eos> Then you never see me again.<eos> And the next time you have an incident, you will go to solitary confinement for a month.<eos> So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
Right between the eyes.<eos> Wynonna...<eos> Trust me.<eos> dear robert"... holy...<eos> Holy shit. Wow.<eos> Yep.<eos> So whose stick i gotta yank to get a hanger<eos> Can i just say...<eos> Damn.<eos> you sure did.
Let's get you out of here.<eos> No! my god!<eos> are you on something other than bubbly?<eos> ho!<eos> Sip.<eos> Be cool.<eos> Says the guy who eats salad for breakfast.<eos> we know bobo's plan.<eos> If he's got it right.<eos> He does.
Your partner killed two of our people.<eos> You don't think there's consequences for something like that?<eos> I believe in consequences... for everybody.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're gonna be first.<eos> - Something doesn't feel right.<eos> - Then call him.<eos> I'm telling you, something's not right here.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.
Damn!<eos> I mean, it's all good. I can pick it up in the morning.<eos> Oh, no, no, no. It's not you.<eos> I'm trying to play with the right tackle and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this.<eos> I mean, I guess if this is what the Dolphins want, I got no choice.<eos> It's not like teams are lining up for a 35-year-old tackle.<eos> Hey, you're not just any tackle, baby.<eos> - You the Black Swan.<eos> Okay, baby, I just... I got to make me one block.<eos> You just did.
Do you know how deep in debt we are?<eos> Residential real estate by definition is when opportunity meets risk meets ebb meets flow.<eos> No, that's not the definition.<eos> That's barely a sentence.<eos> You bought two houses... two houses... that abut a working landfill, yes or no?<eos> Yes, because I paid practically nothing for them.<eos> Because they're worth nothing, so you overpaid.<eos> Aha! Those two houses happen to be sitting next to the future home of an 18-hole golf course, which they're gonna move forward with as soon as they do their methane off-gassing system.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> Of course you do not.
Buttercup has a clock in his head.<eos> He can do the course in perfect time.<eos> Don't forget how he runs across the pasture whenever he sees me.<eos> He's an angel on this earth.<eos> And he moves like a cat.<eos> The way he transitions into a canter, it's like... like...<eos> Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What if she's not working with us because she's with them?<eos> Politically and emotionally.<eos> I doubt she has the sophistication - to run a game that deep.<eos> - All the same, maybe it's time to start treating her like an enemy combatant, and less like our nation's favorite houseguest.<eos> You want to take a terrified young woman to a black site for enhanced interrogation.<eos> - Yeah, hello.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - 'Cause this approach does not.
Wants to experience it like a local.<eos> And he thinks you're just gonna let him take off like that?<eos> He wants me to retire with him.<eos> What?<eos> Ms. Goodwin?<eos> Yes.<eos> We lost a patient this morning, Lisa Patrick.<eos> Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.<eos> Do we have a protocol for that?<eos> We do.
Give my best to Maximo.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll take her number. I'm not taking his number, though. I got him already.<eos> You gonna share?<eos> You gonna share that fruity ass drink?<eos> Oh, come on, Chuck, man. I brought you here to break your funk, not to see you sink deeper into it.<eos> Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.
Oh, come on, Chuck, man. I brought you here to break your funk, not to see you sink deeper into it.<eos> Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.<eos> Option number one is going over there and telling Siefert he's a piece of shit for cutting you like he did.<eos> That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
- Good to see you.<eos> Wait, I'm...<eos> Can I get you a drink?<eos> I'm a fuckup, man.<eos> Oh, come on. Don't say that.<eos> No, man, like, everything I do turns to shit.<eos> Shakedowns, injuries, demonic, overgrown fucking poodle on the loose and shit.<eos> I can't do shit right.<eos> Well, you got Vern out of Crenshaw, right?<eos> Man, his talent did that.
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before? !<eos> Next pairing, on the mat!<eos> - How long has it been?<eos> - Six weeks in the air.<eos> Only the Quinjet touched down.<eos> - Is that a record for Zephyr One?<eos> - It is.<eos> It was supposed to be even longer.<eos> - You know who called us in?<eos> - I do.
Why don't you ask the Director?<eos> Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Didn't hear?<eos> Word is, he hit again last night.<eos> - Two dead in the street.<eos> - Who?<eos> Ghost Rider. You must not be from around here.<eos> Do you know where I can find him?<eos> Nobody does.
- Jonathan, stop burping!<eos> - I can't!<eos> (burps) Uh...<eos> - Seriously, that's so gross!<eos> - I'm all gassed up!<eos> It's not<eos> - gross.<eos> You burp all the time.<eos> - I have to leap onto you.<eos> I don't do it outwardly.
- I can't!<eos> (burps) Uh...<eos> - Seriously, that's so gross!<eos> - I'm all gassed up!<eos> It's not<eos> - gross.<eos> You burp all the time.<eos> - I have to leap onto you.<eos> I don't do it outwardly.<eos> - What do you... what do you do then?
So, how did Grant's band break up?<eos> Okay, so Grant's drummer got caught sleeping with the bass player's fiancé.<eos> And...<eos> I sound just like Grant.<eos> Wow. They didn't make it.<eos> Like 99% of all the other bands.<eos> You think he'll ever change?<eos> He doesn't have to change.<eos> He just has to grow up.<eos> I did.
You think he'll ever change?<eos> He doesn't have to change.<eos> He just has to grow up.<eos> I did.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> He's got to show me something first.<eos> If he does, who knows?<eos> Emma Harris?<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Lieutenant Severide, of course I do.
Must have been Amy.<eos> At least she got my good side.<eos> There are no bad sides.<eos> Can you find your way to Chief Boden's office, Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah, I can, thank you, Connie.<eos> So... you were right.<eos> Body belongs to Courtney Harris.<eos> Have you spoken to Courtney's mother recently?<eos> You told me to back off.<eos> I did.
You're being ridiculous.<eos> The whole conspiracy with this is absurd.<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> You're being paranoid.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, I just stopped by to see how you are doing.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Can you talk some sense into my brother?<eos> I don't know if you remember my brother, David.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I just asked him to keep it to himself.<eos> What, keep it to himself?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That I'm seeing people. That I'm dating.<eos> That I went on a date.<eos> So, April knows, huh?<eos> Uh, that you're seeing other people.<eos> - Does April know?<eos> - No!<eos> N... She doesn't.
How far along are you, April?<eos> I'm 12 weeks.<eos> 12 weeks.<eos> I was coming to tell you...<eos> When did you know?<eos> Did you know before the divorce?<eos> Did you know before we signed those papers?<eos> - Uh... - April?<eos> I... yes. I...<eos> Yes, I did.
Look in a mirror.<eos> You had a tough day.<eos> You heard, too?<eos> I think everybody's heard by now.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I want to make it right.<eos> I mean, I have to make it right somehow, but I don't know what to do.<eos> I don't... I don't know how to fix it.<eos> You did something indefensible.
Have you ever, you know, seen one of these personally?<eos> Hmm? John, get a banana.<eos> Tyler doesn't know how to use a rubber.<eos> Oh, you guys are weirding the kid out.<eos> He's got a prom to go to.<eos> Thanks, Pop-Pop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your mother and grandmother have a problem with boundaries.<eos> They don't know how to talk to you like you're an adult.<eos> But I do.
I thought you said I just couldn't go near you?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We have class.<eos> Doctor, clinic, now.<eos> That's a burger well-done, with crispy fries, and a Denver omelet, extra ham.<eos> And let me get you a refill on these sodas.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll get that cleared up for you in just a sec.<eos> - You get my order on 14?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.
- Mer just said...<eos> -I don't care what Mer said.<eos> You can't crash here. Go home.<eos> It was my room before it was yours.<eos> Go home and fix your crap. - I can't.<eos> - You're freaking out because you got some sword hanging over your head?<eos> Me, too, and I can't do a damn thing about it except wait.<eos> You can fix your stupid sword.<eos> Go home and get the freaking execution over with.<eos> I did.
She wants to spend our money on a new kitchen.<eos> When we all know the moment you make that first sandwich that room loses half its value.<eos> Isn't Diane coming here for dinner tonight?<eos> Ooh, good point.<eos> Oscar, maybe it's best that we put those someplace else.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'll move 'em.<eos> Unless I forget.<eos> Just kidding, I won't.<eos> Unless I do.
Those are your shoes.<eos> No. No, no. No drama.<eos> Tonight is-is a night of joy, so let's just, uh, skip ahead to Emily's big surprise.<eos> Um... Emily.<eos> - From the first moment I saw you...<eos> - Please don't do this.<eos> I knew that you were someone special...<eos> It's not the time.<eos> and that you deserved the very best of everything.<eos> I really don't.
Give me a minute.<eos> I've got all night.<eos> How do you feel about whipped cream?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> I hope you're not disappointed.<eos> They got a little saggy.<eos> Well, let me be the judge of...<eos> You actually made dessert.<eos> Well, you said you like chocolate.<eos> I do.
And that's why she wants to take it slow.<eos> And you should want that, too.<eos> Why?<eos> In the past, you've always jumped into bed with women that you barely knew.<eos> And what did it get you?<eos> Several thank yous.<eos> Countless high-fives.<eos> That's right, loneliness and regret.<eos> But now you have a chance to build something real with a woman you seem to genuinely care about.<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Oscar, what's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why?<eos> Just tell me... is there something wrong with me?<eos> No.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> Everything's right with you.<eos> Supple and good-smelling and right.<eos> I just think maybe we should wait.<eos> You do?
Nothing.<eos> Why?<eos> Just tell me... is there something wrong with me?<eos> No.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> Everything's right with you.<eos> Supple and good-smelling and right.<eos> I just think maybe we should wait.<eos> You do?<eos> Because I don't.
Why?<eos> Just tell me... is there something wrong with me?<eos> No.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> Everything's right with you.<eos> Supple and good-smelling and right.<eos> I just think maybe we should wait.<eos> You do?<eos> Because I don't.<eos> Well, I did.
Just like I imagine riding a bike would be.<eos> But it would help if somebody here could give me a challenge.<eos> Check!<eos> Czechoslovakia!<eos> Anton Chekov.<eos> Check's in the mail.<eos> I got more puns than players!<eos> Felix... stop.<eos> We saw the video of your... meltdown at the chess tournament.<eos> You did?
But n-n-no, no, despite our differences,<eos> Oscar is my best friend.<eos> I want to win, but not that way.<eos> You are a good man, Felix Unger.<eos> And you're gonna make an amazing president.<eos> And you are going to make a great First Lady.<eos> Once we lock down a more appropriate campaign hairstyle.<eos> You don't like my hair?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do not.
I would just like to say that... you all made a horrible mistake electing me.<eos> I didn't do any of the stuff you're thanking me for.<eos> Felix did.<eos> Oscar, you don't have to do this.<eos> No, I want to.<eos> I don't deserve this hammer.<eos> I may or may not have started the garbage chute fire.<eos> And I may or may not have tried to put it out with vodka.<eos> I don't deserve to be president.<eos> Felix does.
I guess I was just hoping to relax tonight.<eos> But what the heck?<eos> I'm in!<eos> You don't have to... string me along!<eos> Marionette humor!<eos> It's contagious, isn't it?<eos> Marionette show?<eos> Look, you know I am a ray of sunshine, but I'm gonna rain on this parade.<eos> I think it'll be fun.<eos> I do.
Oh, it's just he gets so excited about the things that he likes.<eos> I have a hard time saying no.<eos> You see, body language is part of your problem.<eos> I'm going to teach you "the Power of Posture."<eos> I watched a TED Talk on it.<eos> "The Power of Posture"?<eos> Yes, you need to get big.<eos> If you stand confident, you will be confident.<eos> - That stuff doesn't work.<eos> Maybe it does.
Hey.<eos> How'd it go with Charlotte?<eos> Great.<eos> I asked her out. She said yes.<eos> And right now, we're on a romantic carriage ride in the park.<eos> I don't understand...<eos> She said no!<eos> You got in my head about needing a substantial woman, and now I don't have Charlotte or Allyson!<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I had a bad night, too.<eos> It kind of does.
Mm, sorry. You're already taken.<eos> I'd like you to leave right now.<eos> And I'd like you to give me your pants, because we're so obviously the same size.<eos> Why are you acting like this?<eos> Gee, I don't know, Meredith two.<eos> Maybe it's because I'm standing here in my delicates like a crazy person!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> She's out cold!<eos> What have I done?<eos> What do I do?
Everyone wins.<eos> What about the daughter?<eos> I can make her cry on the stand.<eos> Or she'll end up telling the truth.<eos> Ms. Winterbottom, either call your next witness or I'm making my decision.<eos> We'd like to call Faiza Assaf, Your Honor.<eos> I told Annalise she can't testify.<eos> It'll buy us time.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
I mean, I had nothing.<eos> And then I realized, while y... well, the Evil Queen was trying to kill me... that the only way I could stay alive was to never give up.<eos> You taught me how to have faith.<eos> You were the one who taught me that hope is a choice.<eos> I think Hades was wrong.<eos> Robin is at peace.<eos> You know, I've been sitting here thinking about these new people and how pathetic they were for hiding in some horrible land so their stories didn't have to play out.<eos> And then I realized... that's exactly what I used to do.<eos> I don't remember you hiding from anything.<eos> Oh, I did.
Seriously, though.<eos> I think it's time we shake things up.<eos> Move to Paris, you know, search for buried treasure in Nepal.<eos> We could fly a hot air balloon across the Sahara.<eos> You know what?<eos> I love all of those ideas, but I just became captain, and you have your P.I. business.<eos> And then there's LokSat.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We have responsibilities, right?<eos> But what if we didn't?
No, no, no.<eos> It's not all good.<eos> I almost stuck a thermometer in his liver.<eos> Uh, so is he stable?<eos> Well, I'm still running tests, but he seems completely healthy despite having ingested a deadly dose of tetrodotoxin.<eos> Hm? TTX.<eos> It's a neurotoxin found in several species of fish.<eos> It's extremely potent.<eos> And yet he survived, so do you have an explanation.<eos> No, but your husband sure does.
Something powerful.<eos> An unnatural presence in the order of things.<eos> What kind of presence?<eos> What kind, indeed?<eos> When is a man not a man?<eos> When his life-force cannot be extinguished, when he cannot die.<eos> Then he is a god.<eos> I think he senses your powers.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You do?
Someone at Zantium Labs is trying to kill me!<eos> Someone at Zantium Labs is trying to kill you!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that what we sound like?<eos> Certainly hope not.<eos> I mean, it was cute but just overly cute.<eos> Alan.<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you know who ordered the L.A.H. for Zantium?<eos> I do.
- Your Honor, this is a clear case of intrusion upon seclusion.<eos> It is well-established that a person has a reasonable expectation to privacy in his own home.<eos> No, it is a clear case of Reese Dipple trying - to create law.<eos> Look!<eos> - Your Honor!<eos> The expectation of privacy is in relation to government surveillance.<eos> If Dr. Nachmann simply uses some discretion - by pulling his blinds...<eos> - He shouldn't have to.<eos> Your Honor, we have to weigh the minor inconvenience to Dr. Nachmann against the significant public interest in preventing crime.<eos> - So we do.
- Something like that.<eos> Life's a bitch, kid.<eos> Assistant U.S. Attorney Fox.<eos> Diane Lockhart.<eos> I'm representing<eos> Eli Gold.<eos> - What can I do for you?<eos> - My client is here to confess to obstruction of justice in the Don Schakowsky bribery case.<eos> You realize that potentially comes with it a... lengthy prison term.<eos> - I do.
Women should do what they want, even if what they want is to stand by their man.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hannah's a proctor in my dorm.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I know I'm older, but Zach is older in maturity than he looks. And sometimes compatibility is more a function of intellectual reach than physical years, don't you think?<eos> You look relaxed.<eos> Upside of choosing unemployment.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Do you know Jason Crouse?<eos> I do.
Uh, I-I don't know anything about him.<eos> Then find out about him.<eos> I think you're in his head.<eos> He didn't sound like himself.<eos> At least return his calls.<eos> Yeah, your mother wanted to drop out of college.<eos> She wanted to go to India for a year.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Ah, well, it was a different time.<eos> No, she didn't.
- I did.<eos> - Can you tell me<eos> - about this interview? - Mr. Locke was upset.<eos> He kept saying he loved his girlfriend, that he wished things had happened differently.<eos> Differently?<eos> Um, what-what did he mean by that?<eos> It felt like he was about to confess.<eos> Did he have an attorney with him?<eos> No, he hadn't asked for one yet.<eos> - But he did later?
Yes, they were fired from a Glock 26 owned by Mr. Locke, the defendant.<eos> That seems like pretty damning evidence.<eos> - Why weren't they used at trial? - They were used.<eos> But before the defense had the chance to test the bullets, they were lost.<eos> Which caused the mistrial.<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought we should conduct a top-to-bottom search - for the bullets.<eos> - And what did Mr. Florrick say?<eos> He said he would take it under advisement.<eos> - And did he?
You-you mean Locke?<eos> Yes, my apologies...<eos> Locke.<eos> Mr. Agos?<eos> - Do you hate the Florricks?<eos> - No.<eos> But don't you have reason to be angry with the Florricks?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, Booth, I am a full-grown adult.<eos> I don't need you to babysit me.<eos> Okay, all I'm asking, is that you keep your phone on you so I can reach you at any time.<eos> My father will be back shortly, when he is, you can leave for work.<eos> Bones, why are you even doing this?<eos> You don't even believe in psychology.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
I didn't-I didn't-I...<eos> What did he look like?<eos> I couldn't see his face.<eos> It was too dark.<eos> He was wearing a sweatshirt with, um, a-a hood on it and he had... he had gloves.<eos> What else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't see anything else, I swear.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> I don't.
Roadkill.<eos> Old pets.<eos> The occasional dead bird outside the window.<eos> The other kids thought I was weird.<eos> They'd call me names. Morticia...<eos> Jenny Dahmer.<eos> But I never let it stop me.<eos> Because I knew that I was going to make something of myself one day.<eos> Well, this job was supposed to be temporary. The plan was to make enough money to get to Paris and paint. So...<eos> So why didn't you?
But, in my opinion, feelings are malleable and easily manipulated.<eos> Booth has formed a connection with the victim's father because he, too, has an addiction to gambling.<eos> It's... it's a struggle Booth knows all too well.<eos> And because Booth can now see himself in the victim's father, he no longer feels the man would be capable of killing his own son.<eos> This is why I trust science over heart.<eos> Science cannot be swayed.<eos> And right now the science is saying my husband is wrong.<eos> The victim's father mentioned, uh, owing money to a bookie. I mean, if that bookie really wanted his money, I mean, there's a possibility he may have gone after the guy's son.<eos> Your wife thinks you're wasting time on the bookie.<eos> Of course she does.
Oh, please don't tell me you made out with Barstool also?<eos> Your wedding is one of the most important days of your life.<eos> All I want is to help make it everything you want it to be.<eos> Oh, sorry... listen, uh, if you do plan on having bridesmaids, just promise me you won't do beige, 'cause it washes out my skin tone.<eos> Fine.<eos> Dr. Edison.<eos> Please come in.<eos> I'm happy to see you.<eos> Well, I'm only here because of you.<eos> I simply did my job.
I didn't realize you were aware of Mr. Krasnov.<eos> I wasn't, not until yesterday.<eos> So, two years ago, he was the one who actually pulled the trigger, right?<eos> He killed Sabine?<eos> If my son is to be believed, yes.<eos> According to Sherlock, you paid someone to break him out of a Russian prison, presumably to torture him, make him give you the name of the person who hired him.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> So he's wrong?<eos> You had nothing to do with Krasnov escaping?<eos> I did not.
The Indians scalped my father in front of me.<eos> Rounded up the women, tied us together like livestock, dragged us into the woods.<eos> The Abenaki raped my sister and slit her throat.<eos> All the while, my mother kept saying,<eos> "Your uncles will come for us.<eos> They'll hire the great John Alden to ransom us."<eos> She was waiting for a man to save us.<eos> And I was waiting for you.<eos> But you never came.<eos> No man did.
And I was waiting for you.<eos> But you never came.<eos> No man did.<eos> The only thing I ever wanted to be is the one thing no woman is allowed to be...<eos> A warrior.<eos> To take revenge for my family.<eos> Just sorry I failed.<eos> You didn't fail.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
- Great.<eos> You were expecting me to protest?<eos> We need to shred whatever physical evidence is out there...<eos> Documents, e-mails that prove the president went to war for Liv...<eos> They all need to be destroyed.<eos> Lillian can't publish until she corroborates Andrew's story.<eos> The less that's out there, the better off we'll be.<eos> Thank you for coming when I called.<eos> You didn't call.<eos> Abby did.
So let's talk about what you really want.<eos> Let's discuss your best outcome here and how I can help you achieve it.<eos> You talk this much in bed?<eos> You this... chatty on your hands and knees?<eos> That big mouth of yours work as hard as it does right now?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> You think you can take Mellie down without me burning everything to the ground?<eos> Exposing everything you did?<eos> No, I don't.
What are these things?<eos> Caper berries.<eos> Aha. And the sauce?<eos> Lemon butter.<eos> Mmm! So why'd you cheat on Andrea?<eos> (quiet cough)<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Do you know Andrea?<eos> My daughter does.
He's being held by the DOJ, the Inspector General's office.<eos> It's the Internal Affairs of the parent agency of the Bureau. They probably heard what we heard.<eos> They should be defending him, not charging him.<eos> Whoever's doing this wants me here instead of investigating.<eos> There has to be a bigger plan because they want my team distracted.<eos> Do you have a storage unit in Reston, Virginia?<eos> My wife an I had one.<eos> It's been cleared out for years.<eos> Why did you rent a van last week?<eos> I didn't.
What do you mean by that?<eos> He started rambling about how I killed his team, which I expected.<eos> But then...<eos> He started to laugh...<eos> Like he was delighted.<eos> And I'll be honest with you, in that moment, I was scared... Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.<eos> I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.
I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.<eos> But it got us digging, into you.<eos> What about me?<eos> Was your wife killed because of your responsibilities with this job?<eos> Yes. Did you question your commitment to the BAU after her murder?<eos> Yes.<eos> And how does that connect to this?<eos> Because it was then that you started dismissing procedure.<eos> I did not.
Ok, warden, we're 5 minutes out.<eos> Guys, the swatting, the reference to Asher-- this is exactly the larger plan we profiled.<eos> It worked.<eos> Rawdon has another group he's been working from the inside.<eos> By the time we clear Hotch, they'll be gone.<eos> Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
- And you think they're just gonna make up?<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> - What show have you been watching? - What did you do now? Those two can't stay mad at each other.<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> Oh, here we go. - What did you do now? [playful music]<eos> - What did you do now? Grab your Kleenex. - What did you do now?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. - What did you do now?
- Okay, I'm with you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Last night, I went out with Roman, just as friends, but by the end it kind of felt like more than that.<eos> Hmm.<eos> - You don't seem surprised.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry, you... You wanted me... sure.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I mean, nothing has happened at all... at all, but last night there was this moment...<eos> Do you know what I'm talking about?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I need a project.<eos> I got a friend of mine in New York, uh, Cubby Kirschner.<eos> You remember him?<eos> Uh-huh. That doorman at 86th Street.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> He retired.<eos> And, uh, now he's a volunteer for the 20th precinct.<eos> He mans the desk in the lobby, takes calls, does filing.<eos> I thought maybe I could do something like that around here.<eos> Oh, you did, huh?
Okay?<eos> You're doing great, you know.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Go, study, multiply.<eos> Yes, boss lady.<eos> Look, Jon, I know you've become close to the family.<eos> It's not about that, Bernie.<eos> We all want our clients to be exonerated.<eos> Of course we do.
Enjoying things?<eos> That I'm staying at that big house and you're staying with... at your daddy's... Hold it.<eos> I thought that subject was off limits on date night.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Probably.<eos> The main reason you're by yourself is so you can figure out what you want... really want.<eos> And if you're always feeling bad or guilty, how are you ever gonna know?<eos> Probably won't.<eos> I want you to thrive, Tawney.<eos> I really do.
He gets to see his family and everything.<eos> I'm thrilled, in fact.<eos> He's gonna be okay, Mama.<eos> Who is?<eos> Jared.<eos> I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> Good night.<eos> A little bird said you had a date last night.<eos> I did, at that.
I didn't want you to come back here to be my de facto psychiatrist.<eos> I really didn't, Amantha.<eos> I don't want to do that to you, not anymore.<eos> I came here wide-eyed and of my own free will, Mother... mostly.<eos> How was your date with Billy?<eos> Showing up at my work is... hard to qualify as a date, but, uh, it was... nice.<eos> He still do yards?<eos> He's still in that line of work, Mother, but I believe he prefers the title of "landscaper."<eos> You think you'll see him again?<eos> Uh, yes, in fact, I do.
I know that.<eos> I can't not be upset sometimes.<eos> I know that, too, Teddy.<eos> It just frightens me, your anger.<eos> I'm not angry, I'm upset!<eos> You don't need a husband.<eos> You need a saint.<eos> Okay, we probably went too far.<eos> They want me to see somebody.<eos> Who does?
You know, since he's not coming back here ever.<eos> That is so thoughtful of you, Jared, but I don't think Daniel really wants these things anymore.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Well, Daniel actually threw all of that stuff away.<eos> A while back.<eos> Threw it away?<eos> Then how did it...<eos> Did you pull all of his things out of the trash after he put them there?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
That right?<eos> Do you want one?<eos> No, I'm fine, thanks.<eos> Fresh and hot.<eos> Oh. Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it weird being here?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Remember that big ol' picture we used to have up here?<eos> I do.
What are we doing?<eos> Figuring things out, aren't we?<eos> What things?<eos> Our lives.<eos> Don't we have some things already figured out?<eos> If we're being honest.<eos> Some things. Not everything.<eos> I don't want to corner you, Tawney.<eos> Hem you in, put you on the spot anymore.<eos> I really don't. I...
Oh, she may already be here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You gonna go back and see her?<eos> At the fun house?<eos> She traveled a long way.<eos> Trey went back where?<eos> That's what I asked Bobby.<eos> He said that's all George said.<eos> He asked me to pass a message on to Daniel, too.<eos> Bobby did.
Hello, Daniel.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry I was so late.<eos> Do not be sorry.<eos> We've been sitting right here, enjoying ourselves.<eos> We've had some wonderful hosts.<eos> Showed us all around, the kitchen and the library.<eos> It's a grand old house.<eos> Uh, Mr. Pickle told us how you had to go back to work for a little bit.<eos> Yeah, you get that all squared away, Dan, at the warehouse?<eos> Yes, I did.
That's about 90 miles away.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cost of gas and $100.<eos> Throw in lunch?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Name's Ted.<eos> Dog.<eos> Did you say "Dog"?<eos> I did.
You just made out with my dad.<eos> Schmidt.<eos> Can I just say one thing?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So, how did it go today?<eos> Good.<eos> We got a lot accomplished.<eos> But, um... how do I say this? Um...<eos> I made out with Schmidt's dad.<eos> You did what?
Got a runner.<eos> Anthony DiNozzo.<eos> Senator?<eos> You know, I got to say, uh, you don't really look like your picture.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, neither do you.<eos> You two are looking at 20 years for impersonating a federal agent and bribing a U.S. senator.<eos> Whoa, whoa, no.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> No, no, I didn't do any bribing.
Emily Fields.<eos> I was at Spencer's when you dropped off Hanna.<eos> Emily.<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you staying here now?<eos> No, I was just... thinking about this place today and wondering what it looked like now.<eos> Do you wanna sit down?<eos> Yes, I think I would.<eos> I saw they kept the big gates out in front.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Just come on.<eos> What are we gonna do with them?<eos> She's in shock.<eos> It will wear off.<eos> Hanna...<eos> Maybe you should go wait in the car with Alison.<eos> Seriously, we got it.<eos> Just go sit in the car.<eos> No, I need to help.<eos> Okay, because if I don't do something, then...
Elliot Rollins was last seen in Baltimore.<eos> We deliberately pointed the police towards Philly.<eos> That's where the trail was supposed to end.<eos> Somebody knows what I did.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Aria, I called you last night after you went to Ezra's. Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.<eos> Well, is everything okay?<eos> Did he find out about the Nicole call?<eos> No, he didn't.
I help you.<eos> I wanna see the phone.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You should have some, it's good.<eos> Not my thing.<eos> You have it.<eos> I already have one.<eos> Just take a sip.<eos> Be careful, Hanna or you'll end up just like Sara.<eos> What did I do?
And Jesse will wait another 27 years.<eos> Well, there's four of us now.<eos> We'll smoke those sons of bitches.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It'll eat him alive if we don't.<eos> It's hard to watch someone go through that, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I never had a brother or a sister, but I've seen it over and over, when someone loses someone when they're young.<eos> It never heals over.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You never saw him again after that?<eos> Everybody in town, including my mom, thought some pervert had taken him.<eos> She was falling apart, crying.<eos> Why didn't I remember what the guy looked like?<eos> Why was I making up this lie?<eos> She still live here?<eos> Moved as soon as she could.<eos> Still thinks I should've done something.<eos> Saved him.<eos> Everybody did.
Could be.<eos> Or it could be that all the guys that were out there when I was a kid are too busy running companies to have time for hams.<eos> Yeah, or they moved online.<eos> There must be some new kids out there.<eos> I'll be out in a sec.<eos> CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Well, I was hoping to learn something...<eos> Look, I know you must be feeling real special right about now.<eos> Joe's great at that, but trust me, he will burn you.<eos> Look, I know I should have probably talked to you about it...<eos> He did it to me.<eos> He did it to Gordon. Even Donna, the nicest woman on the planet, doesn't speak to him anymore.<eos> You think you're gonna be any different?<eos> I don't know, Cameron.<eos> Listen, I get it.<eos> Really, I do.
And don't complain about being asked for by name by the next generation of coding talent.<eos> You should be very flattered.<eos> Even if I find someone, it's gonna take forever to catch them up.<eos> Ryan really understood the guts of the neighborhood code.<eos> And if we're gonna build out SwapMeet alongside it, we need someone who really gets it.<eos> Well, uh, who wrote the original code for that section?<eos> - Tom did. - Great, which one is Tom?<eos> None of them.<eos> He didn't make the trip.<eos> - Why not? - He just didn't.
325, how's that sound?<eos> We just saved you $250,000.<eos> I'd think you'd be happier.<eos> I am happy, very.<eos> I'm just a little surprised by how completely off-book you went.<eos> I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.<eos> You see an opportunity, you take it.<eos> That's the sport of it.<eos> It could have gone the other way.<eos> But it didn't.
Uh, I just wanted to say that... that I don't think you should charge for the user version.<eos> Why didn't you say that in the meeting?<eos> I've been here for, what, a week and you plunk me down in some senior staff meeting.<eos> What was I supposed to say?<eos> I just agreed with everyone else.<eos> But that's not right because it's not what I think.<eos> I'm sorry you couldn't keep up in the meeting.<eos> You made a promise to people that you wouldn't charge them.<eos> I didn't promise that I wouldn't ever charge them.<eos> Of course you did.
Hey.<eos> I want to apologize for my outburst yesterday.<eos> It was totally inappropriate.<eos> And it shouldn't have happened.<eos> So if I made anyone feel uncomfortable, then I'm sorry.<eos> Well, that little speech made me very uncomfortable.<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> - It never happened.<eos> - Come on. - What?<eos> - It so clearly did.
No, um...<eos> I was thinking about John Bosworth.<eos> Oh. I mean... really?<eos> "Man, that ain't no bear.<eos> That's my ex-wife."<eos> Grr! You know, there'll be a whole slew of Valley big shots there.<eos> It's a great opportunity for John to make some business connections.<eos> Sure.<eos> But... nobody calls him John.<eos> I do.
Left gold coins on the eyes of one of his victims last night.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> I didn't fail every course that I took in college.<eos> Warrants out for his arrest on no less than 20 murders, and those are just the ones that they can connect him to.<eos> Mr. Church just became our top priority.<eos> "Our" is not going to be enough for this guy.<eos> Ok, Felicity.<eos> Church runs with a crew, and yours is not coming back.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You want me to move out?<eos> No, no, son, come on.<eos> It's just, you know, if you ever thought about dating...<eos> Oh, I forgot to tell you guys.<eos> The, uh, the-- the girl that I've seen at Jitters--<eos> It's the girl you've been stalking for the last three months?<eos> I have not been stalking her.<eos> I've been working up the courage<eos> - to ask her out. - And?<eos> And I did.
Can I talk to you in private?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Have I'v been kidnapped?<eos> Unclear.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe.<eos> No, that's just it, Barry.<eos> I do believe you.<eos> You...do?
Maybe you should shut up and strap in.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> We're about to travel through time!<eos> Did I tell you about the side effects?<eos> What side effects?<eos> Oh! Mick!<eos> Buddy!<eos> - How'd you find me?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Pretty did.
Uh...<eos> Th-three hours, maybe.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who -<eos> - What are you, man?<eos> How did he die?<eos> He gave himself up for me.<eos> That sounds like John.<eos> And he was a Hunter?<eos> And he raised you and Sam to...<eos> Yeah, he did.
Yes, well, before you murder us all, we do have a few questions about you, your brother,<eos> Hunters in America, and how you saved the sun.<eos> Right.<eos> You shoot me, kidnap me, but yeah, happy to help.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you, Sam.<eos> You gave me no choice.<eos> And, well, I could say it was never supposed to go this way, but you're...you.<eos> It was always going to go this way.<eos> And you know me?<eos> We do.
That's great.<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I spent my life running from this, from hunting.<eos> And I got out.<eos> I never wanted this for you and Sam.<eos> Mom, I-I get it.<eos> I do.
I didn't, though.<eos> I made it worse.<eos> Now the only way I'm gonna get that job is if Nick apologizes to Sam.<eos> Jess, he hit me.<eos> He's gonna hit me again.<eos> He's not gonna hit you.<eos> Please, it's my dream job.<eos> I'd like to apologize, Nick, for punching you in the throat.<eos> I know it hurt a whole lot.<eos> Not that much, but you did it, so...
Let me tell you something, when we make love... the way he looks into my eyes without blinking, the way he-he holds me in his arms.<eos> I know it.<eos> I know he feels the same way.<eos> And, hello, this morning he-he made a massive commitment to me.<eos> Oh!<eos> What?<eos> It's the drawer, Paula, the drawer.<eos> I mean, don't you see what the drawer means?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
You know what?<eos> You're clearly no help, so, yeah.<eos> Patrons can't be back here.<eos> It's, like, a health code violation.<eos> You're painting your toenails on top of potatoes.<eos> Yeah, they're gonna be peeled.<eos> Okay, Heather,<eos> I need to find Greg.<eos> And I know you know where he is.<eos> Oh, I really don't.
Nothing you or they say will make me change my mind.<eos> How's Steven?<eos> You know he's taking the fall for Iosava's rendition.<eos> There's a warrant out for his arrest.<eos> Everything's a total clusterfuck.<eos> How do you think he is?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you know something?<eos> Does Mossad know where he is?<eos> We do not.
I mean, if the D.E.A., FBI, and the Mexican government can't find him, then what chances do we have?<eos> I'll reach out to my Fed contacts.<eos> Well, we'll drill down all of El Oso's stateside connections.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I suppose that puts the brakes on our date night.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Sorry, Castle.<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry for you.<eos> You're the one who put all the planning into our special evening.<eos> Yeah, I-I did.
I'll reach out to my Fed contacts.<eos> Well, we'll drill down all of El Oso's stateside connections.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I suppose that puts the brakes on our date night.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Sorry, Castle.<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry for you.<eos> You're the one who put all the planning into our special evening.<eos> Yeah, I-I did.<eos> I... Yeah, I did.
You think you scare me?<eos> You collaborating piece of shit!<eos> Take another step.<eos> Take one more step!<eos> Stand down.<eos> We have every right to be here!<eos> I said stand down.<eos> You want to shoot me?<eos> Shoot me!<eos> Do it!
You think he's right, don't you?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> No, you didn't say it, but you do.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> Did you two talk about this?<eos> What?<eos> No, you sound paranoid.<eos> You know, I wish people would stop saying that to me.<eos> He loves you.<eos> We both do.
Nothing else.<eos> I understand.<eos> What is going on In Abuddin makes it even more important for us To put the pressure on.<eos> This American is not going to be President forever, and before he steps aside, We need to encourage him to make a war he's going to regret.<eos> Your plan for Al-Qadi Backfired. Instead of making the American more powerful,<eos> It created an alliance against him.<eos> Now you want us to rush into war Because you see your window of opportunity closing?<eos> The Sheik chose Ihab, Loud and clear.<eos> If he were alive, I know what side he'd be on.<eos> We all do.
But what about you?<eos> You're not safe, either.<eos> You can't stay... but someone has to, otherwise it looks like we've given up.<eos> I can take the risk.<eos> He won't hurt me.<eos> I'm his best friend and he's having me arrested.<eos> What makes you think... He's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with you.<eos> I-I didn't know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
- Yeah.<eos> - So what-- what is sexy about that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I don't know, it's just, uh, uh... I use- - I work in a hospital.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - I clean.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, and-- and-- and, um, I used to just clean this one floor and then they started sending me to the cancer ward and I started seeing all these ladies with cancer, and it really gave me a very special arousal.<eos> I mean, I don't want to be off-f-fensive to you.<eos> - Ah, you don't.
You've been working that thing for hours.<eos> You need to take a break.<eos> Uh, this Edgar fellow has a serious hurt-on for me, and he killed Bryce because of it.<eos> I'll take a break when that bastard is dead.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I have unlocked the security for the worm.<eos> What is it?<eos> I recognize this code.<eos> You do?
I had to put a target on your back and make sure you wouldn't capitulate to the authorities, but you didn't.<eos> Wesley, you murdered people.<eos> You killed Bryce.<eos> You're damn right I did!<eos> He and Her Majesty's Kingdom abandoned me, so they had to be punished.<eos> Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness.<eos> Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.<eos> How can you of all people say that to me?<eos> They had it coming.<eos> They all did.
The point is this.<eos> There was no book club.<eos> Turns out, she'd park her car down by the river so she could cry, alone.<eos> And then something happened.<eos> She stopped making excuses to be somewhere else.<eos> And the girls and I stopped being a placeholder.<eos> And we became her life.<eos> I get all that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, Stefan.
So go to her.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't give up.<eos> I'm not asking you to give up.<eos> I need to make sure that she doesn't.<eos> Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
All the deaths that were covered up as animal attacks.<eos> The more I dug, the less sense it made.<eos> So what did you find?<eos> That there was at least one vampire in Mystic Falls the night Penny died.<eos> It was you.<eos> Yeah, I was there.<eos> I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death.<eos> I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.<eos> But she didn't show, did she?<eos> No, she never did.
Go.<eos> Bonnie?<eos> What did you just do?<eos> Kept my promise.<eos> No one's getting out.<eos> Bonnie, please!<eos> Look, I just didn't want you to be consumed by one moment in your life that you couldn't take back.<eos> I released Rayna and helped her kidnap Caroline to punish you for something I did.<eos> Can't blame yourself, Matt.<eos> I don't.
Where are you?<eos> Right here.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - The vault.<eos> But he closed the security door.<eos> So open it.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> Only someone from the Armory can.<eos> Why didn't you bring Enzo?<eos> I did.
Damnation and salvation.<eos> And I don't care if I was just the angel nearest the door.<eos> You picked me.<eos> Your light shined on me -- me!<eos> Oh, and the warmth.<eos> But then you left me.<eos> You left all of us.<eos> It wasn't just the saps on Earth who were praying to you.<eos> The angels prayed, too.<eos> And so did I -- every day.
You both know who we might need to help deal with the Darkness.<eos> You're Metatron?<eos> The Metatron?<eos> I'm not an archangel, I'm the scribe of God.<eos> Chuck Shurley?<eos> He's a prophet of the Lord.<eos> I don't know how prophets are chosen.<eos> I don't want to be a prophet.<eos> No, you don't at all.
I got you a beer.<eos> I don't know if you drink.<eos> I do now.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't know...<eos> if Chuck is leaning our way.<eos> You don't know?<eos> If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle, then...maybe he'll play ball.<eos> I thought they hated each other.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Lucifer stole the throne.<eos> His authority weakens the longer he's M.I.A.<eos> The time is ripe for a coup.<eos> That's why I brought you here.<eos> Together, we can reclaim the throne.<eos> Together, we can make Hell great again.<eos> Of course, I'll need your help recruiting others. When the numbers are in our favor, we'll strike, and each and every one of you will have earned a place at my side.<eos> Told you he'd do this.<eos> "He"?<eos> Do what?
Sometimes they're just about apologizing. Yeah, a-and the great thing about apologies is you don't have to mean them.<eos> You know, I-I lie and tell Sam I'm sorry all the time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> See?<eos> That's... Okay, enough from the peanut gallery.<eos> What?<eos> What would you have done?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You were my father, and you forsook me.<eos> I did.
♪ And it can always come again ♪ I'm gonna go get you some water.<eos> Chuck?<eos> What?<eos> Chuck?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
Go, go write!<eos> I'll pick up Mateo.<eos> So, I'm gonna ask Anezka to leave.<eos> I should've never let her stay in the first place.<eos> She messed up your deal!<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Come on, what?<eos> This hotel, the longevity of it, well, I... might not be the greatest mother in the regular ways... but now I've gotten in the way of us providing for them.<eos> You haven't.<eos> You didn't.
And how far out from the shore did you find the gun?<eos> - About 20 feet?<eos> - Throwing distance?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> No further questions.<eos> You testified earlier that you had the camera installed because your car had been broken into?<eos> That's right.<eos> Did you catch the perpetrators?<eos> Chicago PD did, yes.
Ms. Green, not only am I gonna sustain the objection, but I'm also going to instruct the jury to ignore what they've just seen as it's a violation of the rules of evidence.<eos> My apologies to the court.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Find a way to shut this down.<eos> If we do that, we might as well shut down the office.<eos> You can't shoot the police and we know he's the shooter.<eos> Beyond Chicago's reasonable doubt?<eos> [sighs]<eos> You do realize that I'm the black State's Attorney of Cook County?<eos> - I do.
Well, fair to themselves, which, in the end, is how most people define fair.<eos> Rangers trail three, one. Well...<eos> That was ugly.<eos> Maybe we should order some coffee down to their locker room.<eos> My two cents, Tom Sculley?<eos> I warn you, I got a bankroll from all the two cents on that one.<eos> I'll bet you do.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Did you know that he came and talked to the recruits when I was in the Academy?<eos> No, I did not.
A tip that an Arab was stockpiling weapons.<eos> A cop had been shot in their precinct in the housing projects three days before, so they were already jacked up and paranoid.<eos> Did he say anything about the shooting itself?<eos> Said it was the blink of an eye.<eos> Apartment was dark.<eos> Someone moved too fast.<eos> They just opened fire.<eos> Kid was just reaching for his wallet.<eos> Did he mention that he shot first?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Enough to keep a hairy eyeball on me?<eos> I like to think of it as me having her back.<eos> Well, you got her back on the job.<eos> Well, sometimes it spills over into real life, too.<eos> She thinks really, really highly of you.<eos> You should know that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And I think really, really highly of her.<eos> You should know that, too.<eos> I do.
She gets confused.<eos> We should never have taken her to that dreadful place.<eos> What place?<eos> John?<eos> Diana had complications and needed surgery.<eos> There wasn't time to get to the hospital, so we were directed to a maternity home, where there was a doctor attending another birth.<eos> "Doctor"?<eos> Sawbones!<eos> We nearly lost the both of them.<eos> But, thanks to God, we didn't.
I just can't favor one over another.<eos> And that's why there'll be no Christmas break this year.<eos> - What?<eos> - People might get offended. Who are these people that get offended by pine trees and snowflakes?<eos> And vacation days?<eos> Okay, I don't know, but I'm sure they're out there.<eos> Why don't we just ask the students what they think about losing their holidays?<eos> I am just trying to do what's right.<eos> In an ideal world, everyone would just wear labels that told us exactly how not to offend them, but they don't.<eos> But what if they did?
I blame you!<eos> You're the one who told me to come on the plane and throw myself in his arms like a big stupid!<eos> Okay, Gabi, just calm down.<eos> You're already on the plane.<eos> And hey, you always wanted to go to Australia.<eos> No, I haven't!<eos> This stupid plane is stopping in Hawaii, which makes this trip even longer.<eos> No, no, that's great.<eos> You just get off in Hawaii.<eos> And do what?
I'm looking for an Alderman Dooley.<eos> So when the alarm comes in, you just tap right there and that lets the alarm office know that the company is responding.<eos> It's pretty straightforward.<eos> And pretty boring, so try not to fall asleep.<eos> Well, I don't think I'll ever sleep again, so it shouldn't be a problem.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sooner or later, this guy's gonna come up for air, and the cops'll be there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for having my back.<eos> The whole house does.
How many escapees you brought in now?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Six?<eos> - Five grand a pop?<eos> That's not too bad.<eos> What happens when there aren't any more?<eos> I don't think Gotham's running out of monsters anytime soon.<eos> I really can't get you to come back, huh?<eos> Look, whatever happened when you went to see Lee, and you know I don't like to pry...<eos> Sure you don't.
Uh, Henry, uh... Henry's across the street.<eos> I think he and Matthew are inventing some game.<eos> And Paige is at Bible study.<eos> I went to EST.<eos> What, uh... What made you do that?<eos> Told you I was gonna go.<eos> So?<eos> So...<eos> I see why you like it.<eos> You do?
I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's working.<eos> You sure?<eos> Look.<eos> The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.<eos> You're right.<eos> You realize what this means?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Hang on!<eos> So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?<eos> No, just focused on work and the church.<eos> Ah. And what do you do?<eos> I work at the church.<eos> Well, they're lucky to have you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Do you realize what's happening here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, Tobias.<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> Eh, cut the act.<eos> What?<eos> Calling us to the crime scene.<eos> "Courtesy" my ass.<eos> You wanted us to fight for this case.<eos> (laughs):<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
I thought that nickname died.<eos> You mean, when my wife did?<eos> Turn ahead.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You killed your only friend in the world,<eos> Miranda.<eos> What happened?<eos> Keep your hands on the wheel.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> You just did.
It's the only thing I've done right since she's passed.<eos> Because you started using again.<eos> Do you think they'll let me bury her?<eos> With special privileges... it's not likely.<eos> Unless... you tell us what happened.<eos> I didn't mean to kill those people.<eos> It was you?<eos> It was the drugs.<eos> That woman, she gave us each, you know, a little money and-and said she was willing to look the other way as long as we never came back again.<eos> You did.
One -- put aside your personal feelings when assessing a client.<eos> Two -- he was bankrupted by this case.<eos> Because he fired like 10 of his attorneys when they told him to take a plea deal.<eos> Five of his attorneys, and don't speak unless called on.<eos> Now, we're joining this mid-trial.<eos> The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.<eos> So, how do we undo that?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?<eos> I do.
That's right, baby!<eos> We in you, Atlantic city! -So, what's our plan?<eos> Drink enough to forget that gay Aiden's getting straight married?<eos> Drunk enough to forget men exist.<eos> Except for us, right?<eos> 'Cause we're the woke ones.<eos> Hey. Uh, can I just say how happy this makes me, that we can hang out and not make this weird?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> You thought I couldn't do that?<eos> Of - - Of course I did.
Listen.<eos> You forget that my ability for kicking ass is precisely why you hired me.<eos> Shut up, Annalise!<eos> You come in here yelling at me, your boss, and you think that's gonna get you what you want?<eos> It won't.<eos> So let me put this simply for you.<eos> There's a saying where I come from... whoever can't hear must feel.<eos> So do it.<eos> Make me feel.<eos> Somebody already did.
None of this is on you.<eos> No, I...<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> He needed to see the person she really is.<eos> Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.<eos> I just wanted to go on record as soon as possible.<eos> We understand.<eos> As long as you know any statement you make here can be used as evidence at the formal disciplinary hearing.<eos> I do.
It's not cute anymore.<eos> Come home with me.<eos> What?<eos> She needs to hear you say it... That Sam forced you to keep it from her.<eos> I could've told her, anyway.<eos> You couldn't... because Sam got into your head... just like he did to me.<eos> This is a woman who wants me dead.<eos> Because she blames you for the baby, and that's fair.<eos> You know that.<eos> Of course I do.
You protect me.<eos> And I just want to do the same for you.<eos> How's... How's Meggy?<eos> Huh? Huh?<eos> Is she good to you?<eos> Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.
- Wes Gibbins.<eos> He was absent from class today.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check in with his other professors, then.<eos> Wallace Mahoney was an old client of mine, someone who was out of my life.<eos> And they think Wes shot him?<eos> His father?<eos> Biological father.<eos> Oh, my God. You knew about this.<eos> -Of course she did.
Car accident.<eos> Your father caused it. Frank helped him.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> It is.<eos> All this is happening because you keep trying to protect me.<eos> That was my choice.<eos> I took you off the waitlist.<eos> I should have left you alone, but --<eos> Why didn't you?
Edith poisoned herself.<eos> That's insane.<eos> She must've known about Karen's secret e-mails - and did it to herself.<eos> - You have no proof.<eos> Let's just say I can understand why a mother would want to punish her ungrateful children.<eos> Okay, so, you confront her during her deposition?<eos> No.<eos> You confront her during her deposition.<eos> What... you don't want the automatic "A"?<eos> Yeah, no, of course I do.
When I called you over and over again.<eos> I didn't want to involve you.<eos> And you're fine involving me now? !<eos> 'Cause I'm in love with you.<eos> My God.<eos> Stop!<eos> - You know I always have been.<eos> - No.<eos> You know, I don't know anything - about you!<eos> - You do.
Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I didn't want to worry you.<eos> Now I am worried.<eos> Why?<eos> - My God.<eos> - Tell me nothing happened.<eos> Of course nothing happened!<eos> You have to trust me right now.<eos> I do.
Any questions for me, Wes?<eos> Did I pass?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I've been cleared to testify.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.<eos> The State calls Wes Gibbins to the stand.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
- Because it's not my place.<eos> Maybe it's because you're afraid that I'll really know who you are - and not like him.<eos> - You do know me.<eos> Parts of you, but guess what, Connor... I want to know everything about the guy that I'm with...<eos> The good and the bad...<eos> That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
This is exactly what I want.<eos> You made your point!<eos> - Pull that trigger!<eos> - She can't survive this.<eos> - Pull it!<eos> Do it!<eos> - I can't survive this.<eos> - Pull the trigger!<eos> - Please don't, Frank!<eos> - Do it!
Wait, is this about Melanie's freak-out on the live show?<eos> 'Cause whatever she said, that... it was part of the script.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> We just spoke to her.<eos> She doesn't remember having sex.<eos> She said she was unconscious.<eos> I... look, look, you need to talk to the producers 'cause they must have told her to say that, too.<eos> We don't say anything unless we've cleared it with them first.<eos> So Melanie agreed to a rape kit but she has no memory of consenting to or even having sex?<eos> No, no, but Ryan does.
Great, I'm gonna need to see all those records.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Lizzie, come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So there were nine men in the house that night?<eos> Yes, but the crew left at midnight, and from the time code, Melanie's assault happened after that.<eos> Yeah, and all the crew guys had alibis.<eos> We confirmed that they were drinking at a nearby hotel bar until last call.<eos> Test them all for STDs anyway.<eos> Yeah, we did.
We should celebrate.<eos> Yeah, how about I take you all to lunch?<eos> Today I can't.<eos> Come on, Fin.<eos> Don't be like that. No, I got to go meet up with my son.<eos> He says he has some news.<eos> Hope he didn't quit his job.<eos> Hey.<eos> You told 'em?<eos> I did.
He had it detailed the night before.<eos> Yeah, probably why he didn't want her to get in yesterday.<eos> What about his cell phone, GPS, his E-ZPass?<eos> Can we put him near her halfway house?<eos> He's smarter than he looks: he turns off his GPS to and from work, and he pays cash at tolls.<eos> So nothing puts him in Charisse's neighborhood?<eos> No, we may have something.<eos> Now, the red lines are Gary's possible route to work from his home.<eos> Now, he should use either the Triborough or the Whitestone Bridge to get from the Bronx to Queens.<eos> - But he doesn't?
Listen, that's your right, but you should know that once he gets here, I can't help you.<eos> What do you want, lady?<eos> What I don't want to do is go after you for time card violations.<eos> Everybody cheats on OT.<eos> - It's allowed.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Until it gives us leverage.<eos> So I say again, what do you want?<eos> You know that Munson is a rapist.<eos> - Do I?
Yeah, he's awake, but with the anesthesia, he'll be in and out.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Lisa Munson.<eos> What? What'd you say?<eos> Lisa Munson.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She is, thanks to you.<eos> Ow. I blew it, Dad.<eos> - No, no, no, you didn't.
- Okay, so...<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Uh... no.<eos> There's something we gotta talk about. How's the medication treating you?<eos> Shitty.<eos> You know, I fall asleep at random times of the day. It still messes with my stomach.<eos> Oh, plus, they switched companies on me and I wasn't able to get any for a fucking month.<eos> - Did you run out?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't.
What's just me?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - What's just me?<eos> - How do you know every other girl I ever slept with my whole life I didn't shower with a dozen roses for weeks afterwards?<eos> Except for you.<eos> Why except me?<eos> Why except me?<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> You didn't have a good time with me?<eos> Yeah, I did, actually.
Hi, Pete.<eos> Fucking Jew faggot! Piss in my cunt!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - It happens more when I'm stressed out or...<eos> Well, Pete is making me tense.<eos> - l'm sorry, I'm kind of... preoccupied right now.<eos> - I... I know, I heard about the Probitol.<eos> - You did call her.<eos> - No, I didn't.
You ever hear of Edmund Kemper, the Co-Ed Killer?<eos> Sure, why?<eos> He killed his mother, and shortly after that, he turned himself in.<eos> He said that killing her allowed him to surrender.<eos> I get it now.<eos> You think he's gonna turn himself in.<eos> He may have.<eos> But now his actions have become more erratic, more intensified since he killed his mother on that boat.<eos> Good, 'cause I don't want him to stain his routine.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
Oh.<eos> I'm sorry, but you look horrible in that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> I can't.<eos> (Crying): I can't believe I took your advice and told him he had to make a decision.<eos> Really?<eos> Was that my advice?<eos> I actually convinced myself he was going to pick me.<eos> But he didn't.
Well, we're not entirely sure that's what happened.<eos> There's a good chance that, uh, both men were killed by the same person.<eos> No.<eos> Nope, I've never seen this man before.<eos> Um... is this Jared's desk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A few deals went belly-up last year.<eos> We could barely afford a real office, so about, uh, six months ago, my house became our headquarters.<eos> Something like that can put a lot of stress on a partnership.<eos> Yeah, it did.
We don't have a meeting with a private client.<eos> No, we've got business to attend to here.<eos> Obviously, you want to poke around in there, but I'm sure you saw the same alarm sensors on the windows that I did.<eos> Mr. Potter's security system is top of the line.<eos> I've defeated that brand on only three out of 13 occasions, so breaking in would virtually guarantee a visit from the police.<eos> So obviously we should do it.<eos> No, you misunderstand.<eos> I've got no intention of infiltrating the house.<eos> Did you know, Watson, 90% of homes with security systems fail to include sensors on the garage doors?<eos> Well, I do now.
I beg you, please don't go!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need help. I need help.<eos> - Oh! Oh.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Ah!<eos> Max!<eos> Max, it's OK.<eos> I don't know how to stop this.<eos> Fortunately, I do.
I wanted to travel, consider my options.<eos> I see.<eos> And these travels took you to the African continent, did they?<eos> They did.<eos> I fell deeply in love with a Moroccan businessman who turned out to be a drug dealer.<eos> He used me cruelly.<eos> I see.<eos> How very, very sad.<eos> I presume you, uh, craved support from family, friends, former colleagues?<eos> I did.
Pretty much.<eos> Everybody kind of scattered when the cops showed at the park, but we all ended up at the same place.<eos> Looks like you found your path.<eos> In here, every decision is made for you.<eos> Faith is one choice I could still make, so I did.<eos> Once you got back to the station, then what happened?<eos> Until my first night in here, that was the most scared I've ever been in my life.<eos> They kept saying...<eos> Tell us the truth, Seamus.<eos> I did.
It was just a minor fluctuation in the electrostatic field generated by the core.<eos> It looks like one of our secondary capacitors failed.<eos> Backup systems kicked in.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> All right, let me know if there are any other problems.<eos> I will.<eos> Nothing to worry about?<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna show up.<eos> You do know why the capacitor failed.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I would call, but I-I didn't wanna... you know, and wake up Lena.<eos> You still pissed at me for yesterday?<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> I just spaced out.<eos> Cath.<eos> That cop's funeral was huge.<eos> Did you see it on TV?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Thinks I can take him home today.<eos> - Que bueno. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Tonz pa Que andas todo preocupado?<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> - Baz?<eos> - Yes?<eos> He doesn't blame you.<eos> He better not.<eos> I didn't shoot him.<eos> What about the guy who did?
Yo, I got to make up for lost time.<eos> Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick.<eos> Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - And change my bed pan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick.<eos> Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - And change my bed pan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He doesn't.
They've been on me for cash for weeks.<eos> And now they have this big birthday plan for Pope.<eos> How do you think they'll manage that?<eos> They haven't asked me for any money.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> You haven't heard anything around the house, boys talking or anything?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'll show you a thing or two about paintball.<eos> Yeah, like you know.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Oh.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And see... these buttons?<eos> Mnh-mnh. - Hey, man.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's Cath and Lena?<eos> Oh, Lena came down with the flu that Cath had last week.<eos> Now, you and I both know that's a lie.<eos> We do.
Ever since Pope got out of prison,<eos> I'm on shaky ground with her, okay? - Oh, God.<eos> - No matter what I do...<eos> - I bust my ass.<eos> - Please.<eos> I run bullshit errands for jobs she wants to run.<eos> Basta! Basta.<eos> Do you even hear yourself?<eos> I don't know why you put up with it.<eos> I really don't.
I'm saying if you do something and you don't ask me why I'll come home.<eos> This is it.<eos> That's where he works.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait here.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming. I want to see this.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't.
- I call bullshit.<eos> - Two beers?<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Maybe I would, uh, adjust the paperwork, so all the ATMs on the U.S.S Ronald Reagan would run out of cash about three months into their deployment.<eos> Right?<eos> I'd bury... I would bury all the shortcomings and I'd make it completely untraceable.<eos> Ah. But wouldn't that get you in trouble?<eos> Not if I did it right.
All right.<eos> Now come here.<eos> Can't believe Smurf has me doing this shit.<eos> It's not Smurf. It's Baz.<eos> I haven't hit a house since, like, puberty.<eos> Jeez, man, you were bitching about the job being too hard.<eos> Now you're bitching about it being too easy.<eos> - Why you even here?<eos> - Do you wanna do it alone?<eos> - Do you?
Nicky, I don't think we should see each other anymore.<eos> Cops said there isn't much chance of getting our stuff back.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Think Smurf can make me a Bloody Mary?<eos> I mean it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wait, you're... you're breaking up with me?<eos> But you like me.<eos> - Did I do something?
Take this.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Uh, I talked to my finance guy.<eos> Turns out the tip you gave is gonna pay off.<eos> It's a little... little thank you note.<eos> We were talking hypotheticals.<eos> Hypothetically, there's 5 grand in there.<eos> IRS doesn't come sniffin' around for 5 grand, right?<eos> - I-I can't take this.<eos> - You already did.
You wanna go? Then go.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Remember when he wasn't an asshole?<eos> Okay. Ready?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I, um... I was in a car accident a few years ago, and, um...<eos> I started taking Oxy. And somewhere along the way...<eos> Yeah, my mom did heroin.
I've loved Baz since I was 16.<eos> I can't turn on him.<eos> What would that make me?<eos> Think carefully, Catherine.<eos> Walk away now, next time you see me, I'm cuffing you.<eos> I'll take that chance.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I figured I'd scared you off.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Ray.
Eh.<eos> He just doesn't trust us enough yet, but he knows he's in danger.<eos> What about the teacher?<eos> Think he trusts her?<eos> He's a teenage boy.<eos> He might just do it for pussy.<eos> Jesus, you're not considering having her sleep with him, are you?<eos> We need him to wear a wire.<eos> Do you really give a shit how she gets him to do it?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
Don't tell me what to do.<eos> You should have been here!<eos> You really want me to move out?<eos> I didn't know you were there.<eos> - I know you're lying.<eos> It's time.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake!<eos> I'm done.<eos> I love my dad.<eos> And I did.
Be nice. What?<eos> I'm an ethics teacher.<eos> I was talking to myself. Okay.<eos> So, here's the deal.<eos> You need to charm the pants off everyone here, 'cause we need their full support for you as VP. Okay.<eos> You got it?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Russell.<eos> Try not to talk about religion.<eos> No, I only do that for a salary. Great.
How do we know him?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Dad?<eos> You're the puppet guy that tried to sue us two years and three businesses ago by saying we injured you.<eos> She broke my puppet.<eos> Wait, we never had sex.<eos> Did we?<eos> Do you wiggle a lot?<eos> I do.<eos> But we didn't.
Some girls flirt their way into a sugar daddy; I get medical supplies.<eos> And more good news...<eos> Did you get me my room back?<eos> No, those days are over.<eos> We're hallway people now.<eos> But I was able to print out flyers for our dessert bar.<eos> I'd love to give them a rounded edge.<eos> Do you have scissors?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Of course I do.
This conflict is bigger than any one of us.<eos> If it means ending the war one day sooner,<eos> Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.<eos> But she doesn't have to.<eos> Look, I know you and your team think we're a group of irresponsible losers, but I know Ray Palmer, and he has a plan to get out of that bunker.<eos> We just need to give him time...<eos> Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that. You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
Oh, hey, guys!<eos> You found me.<eos> - Bad timing?<eos> - Nope. Nope.<eos> Masako, these are, uh, my friends I was telling you about.<eos> Hajimemashite.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Sake, lots of it.<eos> What he meant to say is thanks for your hospitality, but we must be going.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Ah, your man Colonel Sanders, he, uh... tells me you're his captain.<eos> In any case, he mentioned something about you having regrets about putting men in harm's way.<eos> I don't think that's something I can ever get used to.<eos> You know, by the time I had taken over this division, there had already been three other generals in place before me.<eos> They'd all stepped down and given up.<eos> But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you believe in your mission, Captain Lance?<eos> I do.
Which is probably the most heavily guarded dinner in history.<eos> I think we know someone who may be able to help.<eos> Is that so?<eos> One of Amaya's old JSA buddies, and, by old, I mean old.<eos> He may still have some government contacts - we can exploit.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Whatever Darhk is planning to exchange with the Soviets, it can't be good.<eos> Well, I'll contact the FBI.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> Except we do.
- Oh, you mean Julian Albert?<eos> Yeah, you know him?<eos> Yeah, we've known him for a while.<eos> He's the best.<eos> - Um, you need me?<eos> - No, I think I got this.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Cisco told me you showed up to his bereavement group last night.<eos> Yeah, I did.
The corn beef hash here<eos> - is the best I've ever had. - This is why you pulled me out of the Speed Force?<eos> - Buy me a meal?<eos> - Because you were about to reset the timeline again after screwing it all up.<eos> Oh, yeah, I know about that.<eos> - How did you...<eos> - After your not-so-subtle reaction when you first met me...<eos> Harry told me all that happened with Zoom and your mom and your dad, so I decided I'd keep my eye on you for a bit.<eos> - He tell you anything else?<eos> - He did.
We got pings.<eos> Looks like some of your doppelgangers out there actually cracked your code, Harry.<eos> That was fast.<eos> Let's go take a look.<eos> Guys?<eos> We're...<eos> Um... Dad seems fine.<eos> Um, yeah, no, he's still a little weird about it.<eos> You talked to him, though, right?<eos> Um, yeah, I did.
I did everything I could to save your father.<eos> Well, you lost your daughter at the same time.<eos> You're the one who went away, Caitlin.<eos> Because I had to.<eos> You realize you never acted like my mother again after Dad got sick?<eos> You would barely even look at me.<eos> I...couldn't handle the pain.<eos> My work got me through it.<eos> Losing someone like that, you have no idea what that feels like.<eos> Actually, I do.
Car alarms keep malfunctioning too.<eos> Car alarms, transformers. What is the connection?<eos> Yeah, we'll get there, fellas. We'll get there.<eos> We just got to keep trying.<eos> Maybe someone's pulling power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.<eos> Power-- yes, the monster.<eos> That's--ah, you just beat me to it, San Francisco.<eos> See, that can't be it, H.R.<eos> - Can't be it-- - 'Cause we would have detected - a surge in the power grid.<eos> - We did not.
That is how ideas work!<eos> People, you need a Muse!<eos> I can be your Muse.<eos> What about stopping all the metas on your Earth?<eos> More of an advisory role for me, but I was there.<eos> I remembered how we-- you don't think that's something?<eos> Let me present you with a scenario.<eos> You're confronted with something, a threat that you've never seen before.<eos> You don't know how to stop it.<eos> Who does?
Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad.<eos> So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Julian's awake.<eos> He knows it was me.<eos> He knows what I did.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
Yeah, let's do a test run.<eos> - Against Supergirl.<eos> - Against Supergirl, all right?<eos> Test run against Supergirl.<eos> Are we just supposed to pretend like we don't hear him?<eos> So just suit up.<eos> Mm-kay?<eos> Look alive.<eos> We're training to fight aliens by fighting an alien, so...<eos> - Do it.
I'm glad you're okay.<eos> - Don't ever do that again. - Aah!<eos> Sorry. Not sorry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you checked out.<eos> And then we can talk about how dumb that was.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay what?<eos> They don't see your potential.<eos> I do.
Good.<eos> Uh, if it's all right with you,<eos> I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my... eyes and ears while I'm out of town.<eos> Sure. Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.<eos> Heh.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?<eos> Since I trust you.<eos> You do?
Yeah.<eos> I care about you...<eos> And I will always care about you.<eos> It's a mortal lock.<eos> Viktor wanted to give you a proper gift.<eos> Guessing that's not you.<eos> That's a nice knife.<eos> Maybe I keep it after I kill you.<eos> This doesn't concern you.<eos> Actually, it does.
Such as looking for anagrams in case Prometheus was sending a message in the names of the victims he's been choosing.<eos> - Is he?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Ahh. First 4 victims--<eos> Tobias Church, Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, and Gay Eked.<eos> Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
We have to find Claybourne.<eos> We were hoping there was something here that could help.<eos> Like ashes?<eos> Those look like crematorium ashes.<eos> The question is whose?<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
He went out to track down a lead, didn't come back, his missed his last 3 call-ins,<eos> GPS on his phone's been switched off.<eos> Do you think he's dead?<eos> I think that every cop that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.<eos> Whether or not Billy's alive-- and believe me, I hope that he is-- the ACU and the SCPD, they need instructions.<eos> Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
- I'm not lying in wait.<eos> - You're sitting in the dark,<eos> - your truck's nowhere to be seen. - 'Cause I don't want to be seen.<eos> - It's basically the definition...<eos> - It's about your boss.<eos> - It's a little hard to believe.<eos> - Is it?<eos> How much did Sheriff Wilkins receive in, uh, campaign donations from Newett Energy last election?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
- All right, here it comes. - Mm-hmm.<eos> The coup de grâce.<eos> Senator Healy offered me anything I wanted to cross the aisle... appointments, PAC money, even the gavel.<eos> He needs to stop using the shutdown to play games, and make no mistake...<eos> She swallowed it, hook, line and sinker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> ...appointments, PAC money, even the gavel...<eos> Wait, you said he called Barneki.<eos> Barneki was the odd man out.<eos> He did.
I know.<eos> It was kind of... inspiring.<eos> Listen, you were right, I was totally out of line the other night, and I'm so sorry...<eos> I shouldn't have said all that.<eos> I mean, I know who you are.<eos> Maybe I was jealous.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's this town.<eos> I hate this town.<eos> - And I don't, at the same time.
No, sir.<eos> Observation.<eos> What do you got, Loretta?<eos> There's no sign of external trauma.<eos> Copious amounts of blood; possible internal bleeding.<eos> Bloody T-shirt.<eos> Men's extra-large.<eos> Probably used in an attempt to staunch the bleeding.<eos> Who'd you say the room belonged to?<eos> I didn't.
You were right about the general.<eos> Thanks for keeping me in check, King.<eos> We spur each other on.<eos> Watch each other's backs.<eos> Save each other's lives.<eos> Aw, you're tough.<eos> Little arsenic in your brew wouldn't have bothered you.<eos> Do you know what gastrointestinal decontamination is?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, well, thanks to your quick call to Pride, neither do I.
Come with me.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Protection.<eos> Oh, God knows the kind of trouble you can get into on the way to the airport.<eos> Thank you, but I will...<eos> I will take my chances.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have my number.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You cleared me.<eos> Look, I'm out of here, man.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Look, I need your help.<eos> I don't think I can solve Greene's murder without it.<eos> My memory, it...<eos> I get confused.<eos> I... you don't know what's it's like in my head.<eos> No, no, you're right.<eos> I-I-I don't but...
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a little short.<eos> My Internet business had a slowdown due to a lack of inventory, but I'll have it for you tonight.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Luther, what's up?<eos> 'Sup?<eos> 'Sup is you gave my daughter gonorrhea, you little shit stain.<eos> - That's what's up.<eos> - I did?
Okay.<eos> And did you know she has him add things to the Roommate Agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> I don't know. I like the pain of others.<eos> Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this.<eos> Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> She defends him all the time.<eos> She does not.
Here's a little something for yourself.<eos> Mahalo.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> ♪ Hawaii Five-O 6x20 ♪ Ka Haunaele (Rampage) Original Air Date on April 15, 2016<eos> ♪ And one part passion... ♪<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I thought you went to go visit Adam this morning.<eos> I did.
Right, and that Beretta is the first piece of hard evidence ever linking him to a crime.<eos> Chin, when was that Beretta supposed to be presented in court?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Without that gun, Waiola walks.<eos> Well, I can assure you my client had nothing to do with the theft of the prototype suit or that Beretta.<eos> Okay, uh, that's-that's fine.<eos> We think, uh, maybe he wasn't behind it, but he had something to do with it and knows who it was.<eos> As a matter of fact, we're pretty sure your client was the first person contacted after that gun was stolen.<eos> You have any evidence to support these claims?<eos> Yeah, we do.
You created Poopie Penguin?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> What's Poopie Penguin? That's right.<eos> What's Poopie Penguin?<eos> What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?<eos> Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points.<eos> Penguins don't fly.<eos> No.<eos> They do in my universe.
Look at this.<eos> A real office with a door and everything.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, your brother needs help with Ella.<eos> - How's Mom?<eos> - Good.<eos> Give her a call when you have the chance.<eos> So... you went to the Tax Prom a few nights ago, I hear.<eos> I did, yeah.
(phone rings)<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm on my way up.<eos> Give me another one.<eos> (laughs)<eos> Agent Quinn, you know, I don't know if you remember this at all, but you were actually one of my instructors when I first joined NCIS.<eos> You used to love mystery novels.<eos> Used to carry a paperback around in your bag.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Still do.
(inhales sharply)<eos> (sighs):<eos> I need a snack.<eos> (chuckles softly)<eos> (groans)<eos> I saw that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You saw what?<eos> You do remember her.<eos> Course I do.
Well, I, um... I had a vision... that I was... A no one... a nothing.<eos> I guess that's a fear a lot of people have... that their lives are totally unimportant.<eos> You know what?<eos> I actually do not have that fear.<eos> No, I know you don't.<eos> I've always envied that about you.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You envy something about me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, Eddie.
The other choice is you're suspended.<eos> I'll see you in two weeks, Abe.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> First I want to apologize.<eos> For letting me believe my husband fucked Miranda Frank?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why didn't you tell me what you knew?<eos> - I don't know exactly...<eos> - I do.
Like an animal?<eos> It gets even weirder.<eos> There was a strange substance inside the wound.<eos> Let me guess... sulfur.<eos> Yeah, how'd you know?<eos> Guys, isn't it obvious?<eos> Latin prayers, a claw, sulfur... Also known... as brimstone?<eos> Come on, Castle.<eos> Castle, you don't think that...<eos> Oh, but I do.
Just because Caleb switched sides doesn't mean that LokSat doesn't have him under surveillance.<eos> Any one of these people could be a LokSat agent or even LokSat himself.<eos> Do you care to put a wager on it?<eos> Wager on what?<eos> On which one's LokSat.<eos> I got 20 bucks says it's that handsy yogi over there.<eos> I'm going for the Carrot Top Cruella De Vil.<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> Does she look a bit like your first ex-wife?<eos> She kind of does.
Yeah, I never thought of it like that but I guess you're right.<eos> Well, I'm happy for him.<eos> Looks good, too.<eos> When'd you see him?<eos> Two days ago.<eos> Where?<eos> Here.<eos> He and Danny were hanging out.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I didn't.
I think you're missing the point.<eos> That can't be my baby, anyway.<eos> It has to be your baby.<eos> No, nothing happened last night.<eos> It's too soon, anyway.<eos> What, so... what are you saying?<eos> Buddy, that baby's yours.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did it.
It has to be your baby.<eos> No, nothing happened last night.<eos> It's too soon, anyway.<eos> What, so... what are you saying?<eos> Buddy, that baby's yours.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did it.<eos> Sure did.<eos> I did it!
I've called Julio six times and he still has not fixed it.<eos> Maybe it's because the super's name is Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I gave our apartment key to a guy named Julio.<eos> Really?<eos> What were you doing out there, anyway?<eos> So, I was rehearsing for an audition, to be WNY-8's new weather man.<eos> Cloudy with a chance of Tucker.<eos> Wait, wait. I thought you wanted to be an entertainment reporter?<eos> I do!
Congratulations, Danny.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> Me?<eos> Why?<eos> Him?<eos> Why?<eos> Okay, you know what? Don't ask questions we don't have answers to.<eos> - Let's go, Danny.<eos> - But I don't want to do the weather.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Yeah, there's that.<eos> You honestly have no feelings for Zoey?<eos> Okay, I guess when I saw her on the fire escape the other night...<eos> Yes, I knew it!<eos> You do, I was right.<eos> But calm down.<eos> You're forgetting something very important.<eos> She's not into me.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Well, I do now.
Hey, Polly...<eos> Have you ever met a person and just known that you didn't have to worry about them?<eos> Like, no matter where they go, everything's gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.<eos> She's a detective.<eos> She helped me a lot.<eos> So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?<eos> I didn't.
Boy, do I love restrictions.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Oh, we're the first ones here.<eos> Oh.<eos> Cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.<eos> Oh, I do.
She didn't invite any of us.<eos> It was spur of the moment!<eos> But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.<eos> I could've watched it on the Internet?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would've come?<eos> No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake.<eos> But an invitation would've been nice.<eos> You really think we made a mistake?<eos> At the time I did.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Harold.<eos> We're walking out of this place and that is it for me and Horace Pete's.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay, all Iâm saying is that you can take this and turn it into something new.<eos> Sylvia's place.<eos> Get rid of all these old ghosts and make it your own.<eos> - Harold, you said you would help me get the fuck out of here.<eos> Please, just do that.
Yeah, he hit a patch of gravel.<eos> I tried to keep it cold.<eos> Let me know if this hurts.<eos> [groaning]<eos> I see there's no abrasions on the palm.<eos> It... it feels like it's sleeping.<eos> Hmm.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think this is a very broken wrist.<eos> I do too.
Makes me loopy.<eos> Turn that up a little, will you?<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'd hoped to make it to the islands one more time.<eos> Flying's such a hassle these days.<eos> As soon as we can, we'll get you out of the ICU and into a room... one with a view.<eos> Hey, easy there.<eos> Dr. Rhodes... You know what I'm facing.<eos> I do.
- Come on.<eos> - Come on, we have to go.<eos> - No!<eos> We need to go now.<eos> Detail, atten-hut.<eos> Present arms.<eos> Order arms.<eos> Fall out.<eos> I did not save lives today.<eos> You did.
We just hit it every now and then.<eos> Hey, Debs, you're late!<eos> You missed a kick-ass party.<eos> I had a date.<eos> Just ended.<eos> A little sexy time?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Did you know that "Jenga" is the Swahili word for "build"?<eos> And that Candy Land was invented by a school teacher recovering from polio?<eos> I did not.
- Oh.<eos> Hey, you can let go.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> Hey, little man, it's okay.<eos> Separation anxiety kicks in at this age.<eos> Bye.<eos> Yup, it's separation anxiety, all right.<eos> Come on, you deserve it, Jane.<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Okay, I did it.
What?<eos> Nothing, we just... we have a complicated history, which mostly involves me being horrible and Jane being a perfect human being and sometimes... sometimes, it just gets to be too much.<eos> What is this complicated history?<eos> For one she... she got accidentally, artificially inseminated, which led to...<eos> _<eos> Bye. Bye.<eos> Mommy would love to play with you, but she's got to work.<eos> Bye, bye, baby.<eos> Well, I not thinking Jane is perfect, not at all.<eos> Rafael does.
- No.<eos> - The moon landing.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Fine, you're right.<eos> It's a completely random number.<eos> Look, the feds are useless.<eos> They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.<eos> I want to get home and see Amy.<eos> Don't you want to see Kevin?<eos> Of course I do.
That is why I'm here.<eos> - This way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I found our suspect.<eos> Her name is Jordan Karfton, and she lives on Shula Lane.<eos> How did the snake removal go?<eos> Eeeee! It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
You practically dragged him out of his girlfriend's bed.<eos> - He was embarrassed.<eos> - He should have been.<eos> - (knock on door) - I hope it's Brandon.<eos> He has a key.<eos> Hey, look, look, look, I'm still wearing your necklace.<eos> Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?<eos> What about Mat, huh?<eos> You don't love him?<eos> No, I... I don't.
Why are you being like this?<eos> You stood here less than 24 hours ago and said you weren't gonna see him again.<eos> And then Stef and Lena asked for my help.<eos> And I feel guilty about Gabe being on the list all these years.<eos> I feel like this is part of my amends.<eos> Come on!<eos> Your amends?<eos> He's the guy that got you into drugs in the first place.<eos> He didn't make me an addict.<eos> I did that.
Happy anniversary.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Well, goodnight.<eos> - Night.<eos> - Night!<eos> - Good night, my babies.<eos> Idiot.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> You really want that?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Hi, I'm Callie Adams Foster, and this is Aaron Baker.<eos> We talked to a friend of yours at the rec center, said we could find you here.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're friends of Kyle Snow.<eos> Do you remember him? Yeah.<eos> He killed that lady, right?<eos> He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.<eos> Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered. And you were watching a Clippers game.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Remember, guys, this is a coopertition.<eos> Huh? Okay, let's weigh this thing in.<eos> Look who's here.<eos> - Hey there.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> Just came to watch you lose.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Well, you're gonna be very disappointed.<eos> - So, you got a hanging arm?<eos> - Yeah, we do.
It's tradition, but it's not a rule.<eos> And we've got a hanging arm, which you need to beat Palomar Alliance.<eos> Mariana.<eos> - Okay, deal.<eos> - Great.<eos> There's just one problem.<eos> - Our arm doesn't work. - Wait.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> But here's the thing: Palomar doesn't think it works.<eos> - Because it doesn't.
Now it's just a matter of pulling up to score the 15-point bonus.<eos> - Can they do it in time?<eos> - (cheering) - (cheering)<eos> The blue alliance wins!<eos> The blue alliance wins!<eos> Brant Country Day, Anchor Beach, and High Tech LA came from defeat<eos> - with a dramatic last-second win!<eos> - with a dramatic last-second win!<eos> So, the strategy that we used was to tell everybody that the arm worked.<eos> - Uh, because it did? - Uh, because it did?
Okay?<eos> Thank you for your time, Mr. Harvey.<eos> You have a good day.<eos> I'll get the door.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you think?<eos> He's a nut-job, it doesn't make him a murderer.<eos> So, did you figure out your room situation?<eos> Uh...<eos> Yeah, I did.
See what he can do with it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> It sounds like Gray is keeping an eye on you.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I'm so glad... you're home.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You fell asleep.<eos> No, I didn't.
You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.<eos> We'll change their minds.<eos> You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
- I think she might be proposing.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Leaving you at the altar was the biggest mistake I ever made, and I've made a lot of them.<eos> But I never make the same mistake twice.<eos> Yup, she is definitely proposing.<eos> You're the sweetest man I have ever known and I never want to spend another night without you.<eos> Adam Foley, will you marry me?<eos> Again?<eos> Whoa, I did not see this coming.<eos> I did.
You know what I wish?<eos> I just wish things would go back to the way they were, when I liked Josh and he liked me, and everything was simple.<eos> - Gabi?<eos> - Josh?<eos> I've been an idiot.<eos> Oh, thank God you realized it!<eos> Elliot, let it go.<eos> We all made mistakes out there.<eos> Alan didn't save you.<eos> And I did.
I never noticed it before, but you and Elliot are like twins.<eos> Wait, where's Elliot?<eos> Where's my husband?<eos> You know, if they can't find his body and you need a shoulder to cry on...<eos> Back off, bitch!<eos> Elliot!<eos> You're okay!<eos> I was in the bathroom when I heard the announcement, so I panicked and hid in the tub!<eos> I can't believe you came up here to save me.<eos> Of course I did!
Depends on which state.<eos> Hmm.<eos> (baby fussing) ANNE:<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Honestly, I would choose to stay home if I could, but when my sister was ill, we took on her medical bills, and it drained our savings.<eos> So I work during the day, and I study for the bar at night.<eos> I never meant it to affect my children this way.<eos> Do you know who broke into our house?<eos> Yeah, we do.
HENRY:<eos> So, your dad was an admiral?<eos> Yeah, four-star.<eos> Did he deploy a lot?<eos> Mm, all the time.<eos> I remember this one day, before he was gonna leave, I accidentally fell out of a tree, broke my arm.<eos> I was, uh, I was six years old and, uh, I remember my arm was killing me, but, uh, I was smiling all the way to the E.R.<eos> 'Cause you didn't think he'd leave if you were hurt.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Did he?
The Russians would rather have her dead than captured.<eos> That was our assumption, too.<eos> But since the target was neutralized, the mission was deemed a success.<eos> And the conveniently-timed sniper hit was just written off.<eos> Clearly someone on the inside leaked the details of the op.<eos> Which is exactly why I conducted an off-the-book investigation.<eos> All my operatives were cleared.<eos> The leak did not come from MI6, it came from NCIS.<eos> And why didn't you relay this information to Morrow?<eos> I did.
And George?<eos> Did you question him any further about his possible sexual involvement with Hanna?<eos> I mean, given Daniel's assertion that it was the other boys and not Daniel himself who had sex with her that night.<eos> I fully intended to, Ms. Person.<eos> But?<eos> Once Holden had confessed to murder, to rape,<eos> Roland felt like that we should just cut George loose, cut all the kids loose.<eos> But before that?<eos> Before you cut 'em all loose, before Daniel broke, did you question Trey about George's claim of rape by Holden?<eos> Roland did.

It's not fair for you to have to sit on this.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> If somebody else finds out, though, you know?<eos> I just gotta go on and do it.<eos> Get it over with.<eos> He's in the backyard, mulching.<eos> Do you mind being back there with us?<eos> I think it might help.<eos> If you want me to.<eos> I do.
You're a kind man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice day, isn't it?<eos> It is.<eos> I notice those more now.<eos> That's good.<eos> I hope you can enjoy a nice day once in a while too now, Jon.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Did you really quit Justice Row?<eos> I did.
God...<eos> Safe travels, sir.<eos> And hug my brother for me, will you?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> See you around sometime.<eos> See you around.<eos> Hey!<eos> I got you.<eos> You did.
But the recent ones are special, because nobody reads them but me.<eos> Jon's coming to see ya.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm sure he'll call first, but things are changing.<eos> They usually do.<eos> I mean down here, in Paulie.<eos> The truth may be finding the light after all these years.<eos> Did you know that Harry Nilsson and John Lennon made a record together?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.

I've got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Me too.<eos> Tell Jared I said hi.<eos> I will.<eos> That's tough, Dan.<eos> That really is.<eos> Women... they're what makes this world go around.<eos> They can sure make the world feel like it's got some kind of direction, yes.<eos> Sounds like you cared a lot about this lady, Dan.<eos> I did, Tyrus.

Why would he make that choice, do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'll have to ask him.<eos> So what did you do when you realised what had happened?<eos> Did you call for an ambulance?<eos> Did you call the police?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> It didn't occur to me.<eos> What did you do?
This interview has strayed way beyond its stated purpose.<eos> And there's a voice.<eos> There's a voice saying, "We're losing him, we're losing him."<eos> So, there must have been at least one person who cared whether I lived or died.<eos> That was me.<eos> That was my voice.<eos> And I did care.<eos> I thought death would be too easy for you, too easy an escape.<eos> And I didn't want you to cheat the system.<eos> And I still don't.
Getting too old for this.<eos> I bet you're glad I saved his life.<eos> How's Tom Anderson?<eos> His arm's broken.<eos> He's undergone a closed reduction to pull the bones back into position.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should... keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.<eos> Don't you have a home to go to?<eos> I do.
Did you see what happened in the paper?<eos> No.<eos> But you were right about it.<eos> Hi. Sorry.<eos> I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No.<eos> Hey. Um, did you want to order?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> And you have a consult, right?<eos> - Yeah, I do. Yeah.
You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But it's locked.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We were just playing.<eos> It went off.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
It's in a safe place.<eos> Didn't even notice was there.<eos> I wanna know where it is.<eos> It's in a box under the bed.<eos> It's under our bed? !<eos> That's where we'd need it.<eos> I don't want a gun in my house.<eos> It's my house, too.<eos> It makes me feel safer.<eos> - Does it?
It's very unlikely.<eos> The gun was locked up.<eos> It was supposed to be locked in a drawer. It was.<eos> - I don't know how they...<eos> - Kids watch.<eos> They pick up everything you do.<eos> I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die?<eos> No. He didn't.
- I-I don't know how you do it, Mer.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Love your kids like this.<eos> I really love them.<eos> - They love you, too.<eos> - No, I love them like...<eos> If something happened to them, I would die.<eos> Like, my heart is so wide open, and they're so fragile.<eos> I don't know how you live like this.<eos> I don't.
I, uh... I...<eos> And when she found out, she called.<eos> She told me.<eos> And I said...<eos> I said...<eos> "Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.
Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.<eos> And that was the last thing I ever said to her.<eos> You didn't mean to.<eos> Got a late one, huh?<eos> I do. Everything okay?<eos> I wondered if you wanted to go in the morning to the OB.<eos> O-Of course I do.
So many objections.<eos> Badgering, irrelevant...<eos> - Sustained.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I don't mean to belabor the point, but you said it yourself. You've only known Sofia a few months, so...<eos> No, that is not what I meant.<eos> But that is what you said.<eos> All right, Counselor.<eos> I know what grade she's in.<eos> I do.
I hope you don't have to.<eos> I tried... not to love Penny, Mer.<eos> I tried.<eos> So hard.<eos> I know.<eos> This all sucks.<eos> Come on, Sofia, honey.<eos> You had a really good time with her yesterday, okay?<eos> - Unh-unh.<eos> - Yes! You did.
- She is.<eos> - It must be nice for you and Dr. Torres to have daughters around the same age.<eos> And they get along, right?<eos> It is very nice.<eos> They love playing together.<eos> So, who's watching your daughters right now while you're here?<eos> Their Aunt Amelia.<eos> You recently lost your husband.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I did.
- Professionally.<eos> - We have.<eos> Are you a trivia buff?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, you and Dr. Robbins have enjoyed trivia nights together.<eos> That's correct, yes.<eos> You go and play, drink, and flirt with women... is that correct?<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - I'm married and I don't drink.<eos> So Dr. Robbins did all the drinking and flirting.
They agreed after the fact, but, yes, Mark was Sofia's father.<eos> Callie and I were together.<eos> We were a couple before the pregnancy and then after Sofia was conceived.<eos> So, you became part of the parenting plan later, correct?<eos> Just to be clear, Dr. Sloan and Dr. Torres were Sofia's parents and then you came around.<eos> No, I didn't "come around. "<eos> I'm Sofia's mother.<eos> I legally adopted her.<eos> She doesn't want to go there.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Did you ask him to stop?<eos> Yes.<eos> But he's insisting on taking the baby out.<eos> - Is he into the uterus?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Well, did he cut the cord?<eos> - No, but he's close.<eos> Tell him not to.<eos> Damn it!<eos> I did.
Why would I need your sofa?<eos> Everything okay between you and Bailey?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> No, you're still living in the same house, but you're not talking to each other, right?<eos> - I'm aware.<eos> - Counseling?<eos> Well, if we go to counseling, then we'll have to talk, and then we'll yell, so not talking is better.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> - Do?
For an average surgeon, sure, a ventricular washout could be a Hail Mary, but, Edwards, this is me.<eos> Either come in or stay out, but don't do whatever it is you're doing.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was thinking. Uh, maybe... I can postpone leaving... for just a little while, just until things are better, until you and I are... are better.<eos> What's the point?<eos> What?<eos> Two days?<eos> A week?<eos> - We both know how this ends.<eos> - No, I don't.

Come on.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Live a little. - Okay.<eos> Like where?<eos> I have a bunch of gigs lined up in Europe.<eos> Come on tour with me for like a month.<eos> I'm a surgeon, not a groupie.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know you want to see me play.<eos> I do, actually.
Stephanie, stop.<eos> We tried everything we could.<eos> His brain had already infarcted from herniation.<eos> It was too far gone.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And she's standing there with these sad eyes like she's the victim.<eos> She's not the victim.<eos> Callie caused all this, she set it all in motion, and now here we are and there's not one part of it that doesn't suck, you know?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Maze always turns up eventually.<eos> She's like a bad penny... in tight leather pants.<eos> Unless, of course, you scared her away for good.<eos> Iscaredheraway?<eos> Well, everything was fine until you went all lovey-dovey on her.<eos> Because I seem to remember her telling both of us where to shove it.<eos> Luci, you don't think she helped Mom escape, do you?<eos> Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of evil, duplicitous thing a demon would do, now, does it?<eos> But, no, I don't because I found Mum.<eos> You did?
Look,<eos> I don't know what your deal is, but you make me a better detective.<eos> And you've always got my back.<eos> What more could I ask for?<eos> And you need the eggs.<eos> Damn right I do.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> We don't have an appointment.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't. I, uh...
I didn't want to do this...<eos> Me run for President.<eos> Sounded... ridiculous.<eos> But you convinced me.<eos> It took you months, but you convinced me.<eos> You made me want it, and then you took it away.<eos> You have to believe me when I say how sorry I am, and that I know I screwed up.<eos> But honestly, I did it for you.<eos> Because I believed in you so much...<eos> - No, you didn't.

It is the wedding of NSA Chief Jake Ballard and attorney/Washington socialite Vanessa Moss.<eos> The two are set to wed later today in what many insiders are calling the wedding of the decade in the nation's capital.<eos> When you break the news to Jake that he's still going to marry Vanessa, tell him that you've changed your mind.<eos> I know what you're planning, Olivia.<eos> He's throwing his life away for you.<eos> You think this is about me getting power.<eos> See, unlike you, I've had power, achieved greatness.<eos> This is about Jake finally stepping forward and accepting his own greatness.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> He never did.
Between you and me, nothing anymore.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't say that, all right?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Whatever I did, I can make it up to you, I promise.<eos> It's not gonna work out, Tom.<eos> Hey!<eos> You made it!<eos> We did.
Really?<eos> - I know it's crazy.<eos> Which is why, if Eddie has anything that can clear her, I have to go.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> Worried is exactly what I should be.<eos> - You should call the cops.<eos> - No.<eos> No! Wait.<eos> Not until I have something real. I thought you understood that.<eos> I do.
Let's get out of here!<eos> Thanks for making sure I got home okay.<eos> You lied to me, Emma.<eos> You said you wouldn't go and you went anyway.<eos> No, I-I didn't lie. I changed my mind.<eos> Going there tonight made no sense.<eos> I asked you to trust me.<eos> So, trust me.<eos> I have to figure this out, and I really need you to understand that.<eos> I do.
You think he actually cares about?<eos> He'll do anything to get what he wants.<eos> But, hey.<eos> You...<eos> You got the girl.<eos> ♪ I can't live without your touch ♪ Congrats, bro.<eos> ♪ Cold without so much ♪ Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't actually believe him, do you?<eos> Actually, I do.
No.<eos> He should not be killed, he should be made to testify.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, Watson and I have got some...<eos> Against whom?<eos> What?<eos> You said he should be made to testify.<eos> Against whom?<eos> Against whoever hired him, obviously.<eos> You already know who it is.<eos> I do not.
- it hurt my feelings.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> I was kidding.<eos> Didn't feel like kidding.<eos> Everybody there said they were happy for me, proud of me, even the waitress gave me a free piece of cheesecake.<eos> All you did was put me down.<eos> For God's sakes, that was just me kibitzing.<eos> That's what I do, I kibitz.<eos> You still never said you were proud of me.<eos> Yeah, I did.

It's good to meet you, Henry.<eos> You, too, Dr. Sherman.<eos> Well, um...<eos> Like I said on the voice mail, I thought that maybe we could use one of my tune-up sessions to talk through some of the things that Henry's been going through at work.<eos> Affecting things at home, that's on me.<eos> We're not so much about blame here.<eos> Thankfully, Henry has been really open to giving it a try, so...<eos> We do not need couples therapy.<eos> I-I know you think it's going to be hooey.<eos> I did, too.
But, no, it's Cameron, and... she has this look on her face.<eos> I'll never forget it.<eos> Ah! What happened next?<eos> Okay, so you had the honeymoon before the wedding.<eos> And, uh, how did you propose?<eos> - Technically, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I proposed to him.<eos> - Mmm, no. - Mm-hmm?<eos> Technically, you didn't either.<eos> - Yes, I did.
She changed her mind about the IPO. What?<eos> She wants to kill it?<eos> That is not her intent, but if she has her way, it will be the result.<eos> Well, sorry to hear that.<eos> Nothing's settled yet, but moving forward means getting all the equity owners to overrule her.<eos> We've got 35%, and then there's Diane and Bos and Doug and Craig.<eos> And Cameron has no idea this is happening?<eos> It's all talk at the moment, but I...<eos> We don't own 35% of the company.<eos> - Yeah, sure we do.
This can't wait?<eos> No.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> I've had... some concerns about Mutiny's direction, concerns I haven't effectively expressed.<eos> That's on me.<eos> Things are moving fast, faster than I ever imagined they would.<eos> It's an exciting time.<eos> But we are at a crossroads and we have a decision to make... together.<eos> I know you all want to move forward on the IPO.<eos> I do, too.
I entered into this relationship with my eyes wide open.<eos> So did Agent Ressler and the others.<eos> I admire that about you, Harold.<eos> I know so many zealots, men and women who choose a side, an ideology by which to interpret the world.<eos> But to get up every single day and do the hard work of deciding what to believe, what's right today, when to stand up or stand down,<eos> that's courage.<eos> It's been a privilege, to see first-hand why the people you lead love you the way they do.<eos> But sadly, our time together has come to an end.<eos> On this case. You don't mean...<eos> I do.
He did offer me a job, though.<eos> - What was the pitch?<eos> - Oh, you know, the ushe. ASM's doomed.<eos> Miami Wealth is my only lifeboat.<eos> I shouldn't trust you.<eos> Trying to turn this whole thing around on me, huh?<eos> See you dudes later.<eos> Good luck with that cough.<eos> You do trust me, right?<eos> Yeah. Of course I do.
You know how it is when these players come out of college.<eos> They're going through a lot of stress.<eos> I'm helping him with that transition.<eos> - Like a mentor.<eos> - You're a really good person.<eos> Just doing this out of the kindness of your heart. - I like it.<eos> - Till I get my registration.<eos> I got to keep a little safe distance.<eos> - Come on, you know the game.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
As soon as Jacori took off, man, it was game over.<eos> - Like that, loss of six, baby.<eos> - I like that.<eos> All right, another play right here.<eos> Tell me what you're telling Kevin Hunter.<eos> I was calling disco, discounting the play. Telling Kevin we're going off reservation. Really?<eos> Man, you went outlaw just like that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Wow, Coach Fisher really must have faith in you. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he really did.
Please, go ahead.<eos> We're aware that Andre's been making a bid for the company.<eos> And I'm sure that he's been saying a few choice things about me.<eos> So I just want to come clean and let you hear my side of the story first.<eos> You failed your registration, Spencer.<eos> What?<eos> NFLPA doesn't want you handling their players' money.<eos> Said that you were not a qualified custodian.<eos> I got it in writing, actually.<eos> And now you do, too.
Ma'am, all due respect, I have a material witness order that says he has to come with me.<eos> You people.<eos> You're always punishing the wrong ones.<eos> My Willis didn't do a damn thing.<eos> It's that animal, Tariq and his crew out there killing people.<eos> Which is why it's important for us to find your grandson.<eos> Don't you want Tariq off the streets?<eos> Willis says one cross-eyed word about Tariq in that courtroom, and he might as well be shooting himself in the head.<eos> Mrs. Stratton, I understand where you're coming from.<eos> No, you don't.
Then cut me some slack.<eos> You don't think I want to do that?<eos> Well, then do it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause I'm a cop, and this is a court order.<eos> You know what's gonna happen if you take me in there, make me testify?<eos> They're gonna kill me, Anthony, and not quick either.<eos> Look, we don't know that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Thought we're on the same side here, Joe.<eos> We are.<eos> But please put the bag down.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember, Joe, when you told me that you'd do anything possible to find the animal who did this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, so would I.<eos> He did it, Erin.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
No, does it mean out of hand?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Well, then I don't want to know about it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because if I know about it, I got to do something about it.<eos> Think, Garrett.<eos> I'm on to you, you know.<eos> There's no way you were ever gonna cancel that party.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
That's my mechanic.<eos> I don't fly without my mechanic.<eos> We're a package deal.<eos> If you want this job, you make an exception.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> I don't want the job.<eos> Why you got to waste my time, Nate?<eos> All right, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Francis knows you.<eos> I don't.
No! No!<eos> I want to eat something else.<eos> Tomorrow I'll fry eggs for you.<eos> Eat a bit.<eos> Good kid.<eos> Aigoo, my darling eat deliciously.<eos> Dong Yi, are you still picking bottles and selling it?<eos> Why aren't you listen me?<eos> Just like a begger.<eos> You did it too!
Okay, tracked down curly fries.<eos> I love you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I officially canceled Mateo's birthday, which I probably should have done a few days ago.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I was overwhelmed, there was so much going on, and my grandma pointed out it wasn't so much for him as it was for us.<eos> Yeah, so what if it was for us?<eos> I mean, we got him through a whole year.<eos> Don't we deserve to celebrate that?<eos> Yeah, we do.
But I'll get a bad grade if I don't turn it in on time.<eos> Oh, well, go ahead, honey.<eos> And if Dad doesn't get home soon, I'll give you a ride to school.<eos> Missing a kitten?<eos> No.<eos> I'm looking for office space.<eos> Jacob Nighthorse hired me to open a legal-aid center.<eos> You are working for Jacob?<eos> Does Walt know about this?<eos> He does.
How much money did he win?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Olivia, do you mind giving me a few minutes alone with your mother?<eos> Ms. Safford gave me your worksheets for today.<eos> Now, I know Ruby would be happy to help you if you need it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry if this is a little direct, but does Vincent have a gambling problem?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> You didn't know he was at the casino either night?<eos> No, I didn't.
You think, uh, we're covering something up?<eos> Maybe it's just due to negligence on the part of your security team, Jacob.<eos> Malachi, please keep reviewing the video, every single thing from the last 48 hours.<eos> [Walt] Vincent Parr had his wallet.<eos> None of his winnings were in it.<eos> Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.<eos> Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."<eos> I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.<eos> You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?<eos> I do.
Mom.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Mom, Dad's dead!<eos> Mom!<eos> You didn't have to come all the way out here, you know.<eos> I would've found the place... eventually.<eos> Finding the place was not my concern.<eos> Your safety was.<eos> You love me like a father, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
So, I will give you the benefit of the doubt and give you an answer.<eos> You see, I missed a little bit of work recently.<eos> It's a long story... you know, kidnapping, gunshot wound.<eos> And so I have been working overtime to make it up.<eos> Does that work for you? Hmm?<eos> Or do you have some follow-up questions concerning your boss's private life?<eos> [Vic] Thanks... you know, for coming down to my level and granting me a response.<eos> But while we're on the topic of not understanding what Walt sees in other people, let me be unsubtle.<eos> I have no idea what makes you worthy of him.<eos> I really don't.
Can you please just be honest?<eos> Honest about what?<eos> About everything!<eos> About anything.<eos> I...<eos> I'm not doing good here, man.<eos> Everything's a frigging joke to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I am the master of the splits.<eos> Or at least I used to be.<eos> How did this happen? How did I get here?<eos> JC, I used your shower and now I'm all sticky.<eos> It's coconut water.<eos> Your shower uses coconut water?<eos> All of the plumbing uses coconut water.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You never do.
Mr Greene.<eos> Uh, well, um,<eos> Your Honour is no doubt aware of the extremely serious if utterly spurious conflict of interest that this causes me.<eos> I am.<eos> The integrity of this entire trial is at stake, Your Honour, and thus it behooves me at this juncture to undertake the most drastic action that any member of a bar can ever undertake.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you, Your Honour.<eos> This is most unusual.<eos> Given the circumstances, you intend to stay at the bar table, do you?<eos> Ah, indeed I do, Your Honour.
Clean that shit up.<eos> Ja.<eos> The proof of life photos that Robert got of losava<eos> - from the traffic cam footage... - Yeah?<eos> He got those directly from the Germans, right?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Wasn't logged with all the hubbub that night.<eos> No, it wasn't, was it?<eos> Doesn't it strike you odd the Germans all of a sudden became so cooperative after they blamed us for everything... the mall, losava's rendition?<eos> Now it does.
That bad attitude will fit right in with the Germans.<eos> Hector, your field work in Chechnya caught our attention.<eos> Anybody who can navigate Chechnya will find Berlin an absolute swim.<eos> "Will"?<eos> You both sound a little presumptuous.<eos> We don't like to confuse "offer" with "choice," unless you've decided to really hang up your jockstrap.<eos> You work with this guy?<eos> Every blessed day.<eos> But he kinda grows on you, believe it or not.<eos> I do.
Then I started to think about Thomas Shaw.<eos> And for months, he would randomly hit station after station all over the world.<eos> Then all of a sudden, he decides he's gotta focus entirely on my station.<eos> Thomas Shaw works for you.<eos> Just tell me where he is.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> So you can clean up the last of the evidence, find Shaw, and then kill him?<eos> Do your colleagues... do they even know about this, Hans?<eos> Do they?
After you've listened to all of Germany's telephone calls and read all our mail?<eos> After you have dragged us into a war on terror that you started?<eos> You think that with the Marshall Plan, you bought this continent? You did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That's politics!<eos> Don't hide behind that.<eos> You fucked me over for months... months... while you smiled in my face.<eos> I wake each morning feeling breath on the back of my neck.<eos> - You feel it, too.<eos> - No, I don't.
I'll arrange for both of you and the kid to go stateside.<eos> Just like that.<eos> Welcome to the seventh floor.<eos> Have you heard anything?<eos> The Germans are barely speaking to us. Oh, God.<eos> But they know better than to mistreat Steven.<eos> He gave me this for you.<eos> - Do you mind taking a drive?<eos> This is a file on Zoltan Vasile, the Romanian who kidnapped Aleksandre Iosava, the man the Germans think that Steven hired.<eos> Well, did he?
Clay Williams... he's trying to kill you.<eos> He made a deal with Hans.<eos> Why did you call to warn me?<eos> I'd be one less person that knew you and Hans were running Thomas Shaw.<eos> My death makes you safer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Probably does.<eos> Germany's interests are more important than your feelings.<eos> Didn't you tell me that?<eos> Of course I did.
_<eos> Four coming in, Robert.<eos> Got it. Thanks.<eos> Valerie Edwards!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm an American diplomat.<eos> We got company.<eos> I swear to God, if this doesn't work out, - I'll fucking kill Hector.<eos> - And if it does?
- Don't answer it.<eos> Fine!<eos> I'll answer it!<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey!<eos> Gabi, it's Josh, your former boss.<eos> And other stuff.<eos> Oh. Hi, Josh. It's, uh, me, Gabi, which... you know 'cause you called me.<eos> So did you get the invite to Yolanda's birthday?<eos> I did.
What's up?<eos> Why is there a pig on my terrace?<eos> Uh... because you said I could put him there.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, when did I say that?<eos> Tonight.<eos> I went to your office when you were sleeping, and I asked you, and you said yes.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> A "yes" when I'm asleep does not count.<eos> It doesn't?
You have to help me because if he comes back here and sees the three of us, we're going to get fired.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Why is it lying down?<eos> Why is there a little hoof coming out of its...<eos> Oh, my God, it's pregnant!<eos> And it's giving birth right now!<eos> - Aww! - Ew!<eos> Well, what are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know how to deliver a piglet.<eos> Yeah, neither do I.
I mean, it's no art gallery, but there's less chance of me dying of boredom.<eos> How's Lee?<eos> We're not together.<eos> No.<eos> I thought by now you would've chased her down, put a ring on it.<eos> Did you dump her?<eos> Oh, I bet you dumped her, didn't you?<eos> You're such<eos> - a heartbreaker. - I feel like I walked into something.<eos> 'Cause you did.
Not Indian Hill, not the corruption within my company, not my parents' murder.<eos> I see.<eos> Alfred.<eos> It was the only way.<eos> You weren't the only one they threatened, were you?<eos> Hey?<eos> No.<eos> Do you intend on keeping your word?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Then give me something to fight this until I find him.<eos> There's usually a trigger that brings on the hypnotic state.<eos> What's the last thing you remember?<eos> He pulled out his watch.<eos> Asked if I could hear it ticking.<eos> That's it, then.<eos> His watch.<eos> Anything resembling the ticking will trigger the impulse.<eos> He's made you a prisoner in your own skin.<eos> He did it to you.
Nice to see you, too.<eos> Uh, Jim, could I have a word?<eos> Wanted you to hear it from me, um, my engagement announcement is coming out in The Gazette tomorrow.<eos> And it will feature Mario's name.<eos> I think that's customary.<eos> His family name.<eos> You mean Falcone.<eos> You knew?<eos> You knew and you didn't say anything?<eos> Sure I did.
The badge holds expectations.<eos> People want a hero.<eos> And I'm not.<eos> You know what makes a hero, son?<eos> A man who values protecting others above protecting himself.<eos> A man who knows his limits but isn't afraid to fail.<eos> A man who knows when to ask for help when he needs it.<eos> Now... I-I wasn't always that man, but damn, that didn't stop me from trying.<eos> - I don't know how to be that man.<eos> - Well, sure you do.
Dr. Calvi?<eos> We need your signature, please.<eos> I'll get somebody to take the I.V. out.<eos> Half an hour, a glass of orange juice, you'll be good to go.<eos> So while I did... kill my girlfriend, who does look rather similar to you, it was not out of malice or intent.<eos> It was an accident that I deeply regret.<eos> And I was not gonna tell you this, but then...<eos> Edward,<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You do?
Best to end things now.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't deserve him.<eos> Glad we agree.<eos> Bye.<eos> But I'm not gonna let him go.<eos> He loves me.<eos> And I love him.<eos> Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?<eos> Of course you do.
I want to rejoin the GCPD.<eos> Welcome back, Detective.<eos> Captain.<eos> I'm so glad you came.<eos> I came to congratulate you.<eos> If a person comes into contact with my blood, it changes them.<eos> You and I are gonna make a difference in this city.<eos> We're gonna clean it up.<eos> Sentence served. Symon.<eos> Who did this?
Lead detective for a high-profile murder, and you don't collect statements from everyone present?<eos> Me.<eos> Well, let's do it now.<eos> And for the record, I waive my right to counsel.<eos> Captain...<eos> Ask your questions, Gordon.<eos> Did you see Symon at the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No, I did not.
That's good.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> I know what you're thinking, Jim.<eos> You're thinking, "Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes, Mr. By-the-book, blow a hole in this unarmed scumbag?<eos> Could it be that he actually killed Symon, too?"<eos> You see, I know that you've been investigating me, Jim.<eos> - Did you kill Symon?<eos> - Is that what he told you?<eos> I know he said something to you before he died.<eos> Yes, he did.
End of the line.<eos> Just as I suspected.<eos> The brake lines are cut!<eos> How is it... that not one single ignoramus from the GCPD noticed that the brake lines were cut?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Someone paid 'em off.<eos> The question is, who?<eos> Who has that kind of money and influence?<eos> You don't know.<eos> But I do.
For exposing him as the leader of the Red Hood gang.<eos> That makes perfect sense.<eos> I swear to you, Ed, we will find him and make him pay for what he has done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> I feel like this office is cursed.<eos> You think Barnes'll be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> You didn't.
Dmitry is an initiate.<eos> The mask ensures his silence until he proves himself<eos> - and becomes a full member.<eos> - Of what?<eos> Who are you?<eos> We are called the Whisper Gang.<eos> Gotham's most notorious smugglers.<eos> We used to number in the hundreds until the Court saw our growing strength, and they offered us a partnership, only to betray us.<eos> Many escaped back to Ukraine but a few of us stayed back, hoping to find a way to enact revenge.<eos> And we did.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse, I ran back in time and created the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.<eos> I restored the timeline to how it was, only to find things weren't as I left them.<eos> I brought new threats to our world, and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> They don't see your potential.<eos> I do.
The wrath of Savitar!<eos> Did it work?<eos> That was so scary.<eos> I mean, that was...<eos> was it not truly frightening, what the voice and the prophesies and the... it was...<eos> I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
Now...<eos> I need you to say the special word.<eos> Incendia.<eos> Excellent job, girls.<eos> - I think you're ready.<eos> - For what?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Enzo!<eos> You came back to me.<eos> Of course I did.
Sure thing.<eos> Go right ahead.<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> Sorry to bother you folks.<eos> I don't want to sleep anymore.<eos> Looks like someone's taking charge.<eos> Why are we stopping here?<eos> Because I have been with you for roughly five hours, and in that time you've almost been captured by the bumbling human authorities, not once... twice.<eos> On the plus side, I'm happy to see that there's some wiggle room in this arrangement of eternal servitude. So, let's do this.<eos> - Hmm? - Do what?
Ric's intern?<eos> She's the last person I killed.<eos> It's reverse chronological order.<eos> The names were a habit I picked up along the way.<eos> Where'd you pick that up, exactly?<eos> In Monterey.<eos> I don't remember doing this.<eos> Recognize him?<eos> That you showed remorse meant nothing to me.<eos> But for some reason, it did to her.
They're on their way here, but they haven't found her, either.<eos> Nothing for me. I'm too upset.<eos> Me neither, I can't eat at a time like this.<eos> Two root beer floats.<eos> How could I have trusted our daughter with Gabi.<eos> I'll tell you how!<eos> I wasn't thinking!<eos> And now look what... - You said "our daughter."<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
- Seriously?<eos> - Yeah. So hand over that fake I.D.<eos> What fake I... fine!<eos> Beyoncé Rihanna?<eos> Look, I'm sorry I made it seem like I didn't want you around.<eos> It's just... (sighs) I've never had a daughter before.<eos> Yeah, well, I've never had two dads before.<eos> Aw, she called us "dads"!<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Excuse me?<eos> Mr. Richards, when was the last time your wife was home?<eos> Oh, god, uh...<eos> Three days ago, maybe.<eos> You didn't file a missing person's report?<eos> She's always traveling.<eos> Doesn't always tell me when.<eos> Did she tell you she was bonking her associate bradley?<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Did she?
That stupid video was my breaking point.<eos> Everyone saw it.<eos> Everyone laughed at me!<eos> No one's laughing now, Tommy.<eos> So after everything that happened, what, you-you wanted to make him feel your pain?<eos> He deserved what happened to him.<eos> Yeah, but you're not answering the question.<eos> Did you kill Nick?<eos> I understand punishment all too well, Tommy, and Nick deserved to be punished.<eos> He did, didn't he?
Get away scot-free?<eos> We both know you can't stop because you love it!<eos> Just like the people you punished.<eos> I don't!<eos> I do.<eos> I-I like seeing them beg for forgiveness.<eos> You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem, Ray.<eos> Someone deserving punishment.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.
We both know you can't stop because you love it!<eos> Just like the people you punished.<eos> I don't!<eos> I do.<eos> I-I like seeing them beg for forgiveness.<eos> You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem, Ray.<eos> Someone deserving punishment.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
Right. Of course.<eos> Remind me at some point to give you a refresher on the meaning of loyalty.<eos> It's what's best for everyone.<eos> She goes back to Hell, where she belongs;<eos> Chloe is safe, and I don't have to clean up your mess anymore.<eos> More importantly, you get to keep your word.<eos> I am keeping my word.<eos> You're serving out your sentence here on Earth.<eos> You know that's not what your Father wanted.<eos> Do I?
I've heard every dumb quip you have to say.<eos> Right, let me guess... in your version, I deliver Mom to you, apologizing, tears streaming down my face.<eos> Actually, no. In my version, you refuse to give Mom up and your human friend dies.<eos> Yes, you've tried that twice now.<eos> Not much luck.<eos> Maybe you're not as good at this as you thought.<eos> Maybe I'm building up to a big finale.<eos> All right.<eos> Uriel... you don't know what Dad wants.<eos> None of us do.
Not much luck.<eos> Maybe you're not as good at this as you thought.<eos> Maybe I'm building up to a big finale.<eos> All right.<eos> Uriel... you don't know what Dad wants.<eos> None of us do.<eos> - So I think...<eos> - You're right.<eos> I don't know what Dad wants.<eos> None of us do.
I don't know what Dad wants.<eos> None of us do.<eos> Right.<eos> Great, well, I'm glad we had this talk.<eos> I'll see you at the next family reunion.<eos> I'll buy the first round.<eos> But I do know what he needs.<eos> Mom's out. It's only a matter of time before she finds her way back to Heaven, and then he'll forgive her.<eos> - He would never do that.<eos> - Why not? You did.
I know, right?<eos> You want to hop on?<eos> Okay, if we're gonna live together, we need to have some house rules.<eos> Rule number one, and I can't believe I'm saying this, no sex swing.<eos> You said I could bring my furniture.<eos> A sex swing is not furniture.<eos> We have to agree on what's gonna be in the common area, Maze.<eos> Fine, I don't agree with your cheesy decorations.<eos> You don't like Halloween?<eos> Of course I do.
What murder are we solving today?<eos> I mean, everyone here looks dead.<eos> We've have an injured groom and a deceased bride.<eos> Oh, they got to that "till death do us part" nonsense quickly, didn't they?<eos> The bride suffered a gunshot wound to the chest.<eos> Chest?<eos> Shooter didn't go for the head?<eos> First rule of zombie killing.<eos> Do you want to work this case with me or not?<eos> Of course I do.
Dr. Jack Peterson.<eos> And since Williams is targeting spouses, if we find Mrs. Peterson, assuming...<eos> No, wait... crap.<eos> - What?<eos> It also says that the trial was run by a Dr. Sally Peterson.<eos> They're a husband and wife team.<eos> Great. Who's the target?<eos> Well, it could be either one.<eos> We got to get to both of them.<eos> Yeah, before he does.
I can't keep track of all these elaborate metaphors.<eos> But it's not a metaphor, Doctor.<eos> You need to take me seriously.<eos> You need to believe what I'm saying.<eos> Otherwise, you'll never understand...<eos> I'm a monster.<eos> A monster who... deserves to be punished.<eos> I believe you feel that way.<eos> And I want to understand.<eos> I truly do!
Someone... better, more helpful.<eos> - More boring.<eos> - Okay... got you a hot, soy latte, extra foam.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You okay, Chloe?<eos> All good.<eos> Just on my way out.<eos> Something's seriously bothering her.<eos> Oh, I hadn't noticed.<eos> But you did.
16 years.<eos> He recorded this the day my father was killed.<eos> Three minutes before he died.<eos> What part of town is this?<eos> It's our old apartment in Venice.<eos> My father was killed across the city in Korea town.<eos> There's no way your father could have recorded this and gotten to the crime scene in time.<eos> So it's true. He didn't do it.<eos> Which means whoever did kill my father got away with this and is still out there.<eos> I did it.
His name is Boris Sokolov.<eos> Owns the bathhouse.<eos> Connects criminals but keeps his own hands clean.<eos> No one has ever been able to get to him.<eos> Yet.<eos> Detective Dan and I won't rest until we get to the bottom of this, I promise you.<eos> Wow. Look who bought a ticket to the gun show!<eos> Divorce becomes you, Detective.<eos> I do not sound like that.<eos> Of course we do.
All right. Tell him I need a fall guy for a murder I'm gonna commit?<eos> - Exactly. - Hmm.<eos> But like I said before, he spooks really easily.<eos> So, don't go...<eos> Boris!<eos> Like that.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Uh, I'd like to talk with you, if I may.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> - You don't.
Sunshine.<eos> Beautiful people.<eos> Expensive cars.<eos> The glamorous life.<eos> Get ready to see the real<eos> Los Angeles on this thrill ride tour.<eos> Well, it appears I've been misled.<eos> Whoever put together this brochure should get special treatment in Hell.<eos> I don't need you to show me around the city.<eos> Well, of course you do.
You look scary. But look, I apologize for my controversial testimony, but I was clearly bamboozled.<eos> You didn't expect me to lie on the stand, did you?<eos> It's not about your answers.<eos> It's about Charlotte's questions.<eos> She wouldn't have even asked them unless she already knew I was first on scene.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Who could've told her?<eos> Detective, I didn't.<eos> You say that, but you also said your relationship with Charlotte wouldn't affect this trial.<eos> It just did.
She told me. She did?<eos> Yes. We're past that.<eos> What I don't understand, though, is how the detective can think I'm the one who leaked sensitive information to my mum.<eos> How could she?<eos> Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.<eos> Mm.<eos> If only I knew who really gave Mom that information.<eos> Right. If only.<eos> Oh! Good. You came.<eos> Yes, he did.
Detective.<eos> Sorry, I thought...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Are you on your way out?<eos> I am, yes.<eos> Oh...<eos> To see you, actually.<eos> I believe I owe you dinner.<eos> Now we know why Chloe's so special.<eos> Don't we?
If I wanted to violate you,<eos> Shine, you'd be getting patted down with some bullets. Yeah.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Well, I got four shooters outside that say you won't.<eos> No, you got three.<eos> One stayed back at a five-star hotel, where he's getting some room service sent up by me right now.<eos> And if you like, I can send your boys outside a snack, too.<eos> Don't forget I do this, Shine.<eos> No, you don't do this, Lucious.<eos> I do this.
You are a hateful snake.<eos> In any case, Lucifer can't be sent back to the cage while he's in a vessel.<eos> He won't be.<eos> Not by the time we're ready.<eos> Where's all this warding you mentioned?<eos> It's cloaked.<eos> It's very powerful.<eos> You brought your mother?<eos> Hello, Castiel.<eos> Yes, he did.
Dude, it's noon.<eos> Let me in.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Pretty dressed up for rehearsal, don't you think?<eos> Rehearsal.<eos> Brother, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I just can't make it to rehearsal.<eos> Yeah, you got better plans?<eos> I do.
I mean, this was your case, you know?<eos> And...well, you kicked ass.<eos> Again.<eos> I kicked ass?<eos> You saved me.<eos> I --<eos> Yeah, but you were right.<eos> You know, those kids were innocent.<eos> I mean, hell, we didn't even know what Moriarty's deal was.<eos> I do.
What did you do?<eos> Eat.<eos> What did you do?<eos> ! This is how we will stay together.<eos> We will enter Heaven as a family.<eos> Eat! Elijah, do not eat that.<eos> Elijah!<eos> Mom?<eos> Eat.<eos> Elijah, do not do it.
I'm not!<eos> Throw some holy water on me, see what happens.<eos> Anybody packing'?<eos> We can just make more.<eos> Uh, no, we can't.<eos> The water's off.<eos> - She knew it.<eos> You knew that.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> What did you do?
I've seen around all stripes of Vince, all right? Drunk Vince, depressed Vince, megalomaniacal "I'm a Golden God" Vince. The Vince who threw me through that door... that wasn't him.<eos> If you hear from him, don't hesitate to call.<eos> Okay, Agent...<eos> Beyoncé.<eos> This vessel hopping's getting old. Just as I get used to the limitations of one meatsack, I gotta cut bait and jump to the next flawed lump.<eos> Then you want me to make this vessel permanent?<eos> Strong enough to hold you?<eos> Does look good on me.<eos> Festina!<eos> Red, what did you do?
And my dad... he doesn't want me to be that guy.<eos> And Rose...<eos> No one wants me to be that guy.<eos> What if you are?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I know that you're just some... some spoiled-ass rich kid.<eos> But you know everything 'cause your mom's a junkie?<eos> Okay, you didn't have to say that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Neither did you.
If we don't do this today, we lose it forever.<eos> Can you do it or not?<eos> Look, I'm no expert.<eos> I'd need to see exact specifications.<eos> Well, I've been doing some research.<eos> It's a Japanese land bomb type 80.<eos> I'll get the specs to you.<eos> And I'll need a second, someone with engineering skill, someone I can trust.<eos> I don't know anyone like that.<eos> I do.
All right, let's do this.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Told you we did it.<eos> So this girl wasn't in here two nights ago?<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She was here a while back, though.<eos> Please tell me you remember who she was with.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Cool.<eos> Yeah, I can scoop up the money tomorrow.<eos> He's just got to authenticate it.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> Well, at first, I thought it was some kind of "Star Wars" spaceship.<eos> - It's actually a camera.<eos> - Yeah, it's a Polaroid.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You like taking pictures, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You think they took you in for the money?<eos> I'm not sure why they took me in, but I just...<eos> I don't want to go back there anymore.<eos> Well, you better not leave Tivoli.<eos> Does your stomach hurt?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, you know, that's how you know that you're in love.<eos> Is it?<eos> Nope, don't feel a thing.<eos> - You do now, right?
No.<eos> She won't return my calls.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me know about the gun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Heat up your dinner.<eos> It's been sitting there for a while, so it only needs a minute.<eos> I wanted to tell you.<eos> I really did.
Lie, like you did.<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think... because I wanted to get close to people.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't need to do that with me... or with Helen.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> No.<eos> I don't... no.
Sita's dead.<eos> God.<eos> Poughkeepsie Police found Sita's body floating downstream.<eos> God, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Why haven't you told anyone?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I guess I thought if I didn't say anything then maybe it never happened.<eos> You know, maybe she never jumped.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.
It just hasn't come up.<eos> I guess.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What's the prognosis?<eos> They got him stable, but he's in a coma.<eos> And they're moving him to an ICU.<eos> You know this could have happened on anyone's watch, right?<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
- Helen, where are they?<eos> - They're with Gabe.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But I need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Did you know that you snore very loudly?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - You do.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you do.
Try again.<eos> ...engaged?<eos> Ding ding ding.<eos> Well, I may have been stupid, but at least I was in love.<eos> And of age.<eos> Too bad I missed the shit show.<eos> - No, I got work in the morning.<eos> - Well, I need it... after Sierra ripped me a new one.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> So I heard from the bank.<eos> They'll give me a loan for 80 grand.<eos> For what?<eos> For the Laundromat.<eos> The lease.<eos> You'd give me 80,000 for this place?<eos> I never thought it was worth that much.<eos> Do you remember our conversation yesterday?<eos> Of course I do.
It was.<eos> The rogue code that did this to him - where did it come from?<eos> We're still working on that.<eos> Because it rewrote his neuromorphic architecture.<eos> Artie's brain had a whole new digital structure to run and store the consciousness emulation - if it is an emulation.<eos> Now I want to see one running live.<eos> You know there are more possible moves in Go than there are atoms in the observable universe?<eos> Just a bunch of little stones on a piece of wood.<eos> I think people like you and me, we need facts like that to remind us of our own insignificance.<eos> Don't you?
I want to lie.<eos> And you won't let me.<eos> I don't...<eos> - K.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> The woman I live with keeps elastic bands on a door knob in case they come in handy.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Karen or Beatrice?<eos> You once told me... that you liked sitting in a parked car in the rain.<eos> Well, who does, which you?
No, I can't.<eos> I don't lie ever.<eos> Are the things you choose not to keep secret things that could get you killed?<eos> No.<eos> Well, that must make being open a lot easier.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I didn't know if I could trust you.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Because... you liked me and I didn't want you to stop.<eos> Well, I didn't.
I'll be back.<eos> I was working on your commencement speech, and I was hoping you could give me some personal anecdote that-that proffers some nugget of wisdom that we could give the kids.<eos> Uh, saving the Pacific Rim Trade Agreement, for example.<eos> Détente with Russia.<eos> Dropping the embargo with Cuba.<eos> I mean, there's a lot of good options.<eos> Yeah, I-I-I don't know if any of that really jibes with my overall message.<eos> You have an overall message?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
Well, that's less than 50.<eos> With 32% saying they'd view it "extremely unfavorably."<eos> And how would they view President Dalton for making such a trade?<eos> Ah, that came in at 78%: "What are you, nuts?"<eos> Figured as much.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> Wha...?<eos> I have no idea what's going on.<eos> It's Washington.<eos> Who does?
Well, he didn't just ask me. - He put this ring in the parfait,<eos> - Ring?<eos> and I almost choked on it.<eos> - Ring?<eos> - Let me see.<eos> Yeah, I forgot.<eos> Um, yeah, and he got down on one knee and-and... the whole restaurant was watching.<eos> - Oh! - They all applauded when I said yes.<eos> Wow, because you said yes.<eos> Of course you did, with that ring.
No. From dad's library.<eos> There's Trégortin castle, the Druids' tomb, where we found him, even the Fairies' Mirror where he met Lucie.<eos> His memories relate to the book?<eos> All his drawings are in the book, except one.<eos> This one.<eos> It is the most detailed.<eos> There's emotional violence.<eos> I think this drawing means something special.<eos> He invented it?<eos> No, he didn't.
V and I aren't married.<eos> Svet and I aren't married if she's already married to Yvon.<eos> Wait a minute... when you divorced Mickey to marry V, you weren't even really married to Mickey?<eos> Correct.<eos> So you never really got a divorce?<eos> Correct.<eos> So they only two people that are married is Svetlana and Yvon?<eos> Yes, Kev.<eos> We all understand what's going on.<eos> - I kind of don't.
Can you give me a little time to go get the money?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll go get the tools.<eos> Job's gonna take a few hours anyway.<eos> Silas Turner?<eos> Silas Turner?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You're being selfish.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Did you?
Sailor.<eos> Sailor.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> I have to be judicious with the antimalarial treatment because of her pregnancy.<eos> - Did you test her blood?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Both Kyoko and her husband have the virus and the cure in their bloodstream.<eos> - The cure is just not working. - Then you need to run more tests.<eos> Sir, now that Dr. Scott's lab is broken down, I don't have the equipment to do extensive blood work.<eos> And even if I did...
Is that "Flamingo Drag?"<eos> "Watermelon Pie."<eos> You would do that?<eos> What, to kick those up a notch?<eos> Hey, why don't we both go?<eos> We'll grab some more colors, a couple of lattes, and then we'll come right back.<eos> (quietly):<eos> You can trust her.<eos> (in normal voice):<eos> I do.
What is it, Director?<eos> I just got a call... (voice breaking):<eos> from Tel Aviv.<eos> You'll want to sleep on the plane, son.<eos> I can give you a little something that works for me.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I'm not gonna sleep, Dad.<eos> Look, it's gonna be fine, Junior.<eos> You do know that, right?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
(sighs heavily)<eos> You all right, boss?<eos> We need answers.<eos> You know, there's something I've been thinking about a lot lately.<eos> Something you said to me when you first hired me.<eos> Something I never forgot.<eos> You asked,<eos> "What happens when the best agents in the world want to accomplish something?"<eos> "They get it done."<eos> Damn right they do.
(gunshots)<eos> Freeze!<eos> Old friends and new.<eos> But not the one I expected.<eos> TONY:<eos> I'm here.<eos> DiNozzo.<eos> I had no idea she'd be in the farmhouse.<eos> You know that.<eos> Do I?
Empowering?<eos> (chuckles)<eos> I just have something I need to tell you before you go.<eos> How do you know I'm going?<eos> Because I'm Abby Sciuto, and I know things.<eos> (chuckles) Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much...<eos> Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
Jess' room is meant for sex.<eos> I know.<eos> Come here.<eos> So, Just-just hit lobby and let technology do its thing.<eos> Yeah, cool. When-when I get in there, I'll just hit lobby.<eos> Cool. Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
Come here.<eos> So, Just-just hit lobby and let technology do its thing.<eos> Yeah, cool. When-when I get in there, I'll just hit lobby.<eos> Cool. Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do. I mean, I know.<eos> You do?
- But it wasn't right.<eos> - Just say it like all one.<eos> In all one.<eos> Yeah, Schmidt is asleep.<eos> - You could just say, Schmidt's asleep.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Schmidt's asleep.<eos> Got it.<eos> No, you're putting weird emphasis on weird syllables.<eos> - You do it.
- Hi.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm good. How are you? - Good, yeah.<eos> Great, look at this.<eos> What is that, a towel?<eos> - I think it's a pashmina.<eos> - "Pashomina"?<eos> Pashmina.<eos> I'm sorry, I just can't believe you came.<eos> I did.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah. And then he says the word "relationship," and I freaked out, because...<eos> I mean, you guys were together.<eos> What happened?<eos> We were kind of a mess.<eos> I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.<eos> And... he wanted me to not care about those things. That's not so bad. I mean, who really has a plan for their life?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Me.<eos> Me. I d... I did it.
Did you kill Alyssa?<eos> No.<eos> But you did have sex with her.<eos> They can believe whatever they want to believe.<eos> Is there any reason anyone would have seen you with her at the time she was strangled?<eos> No, I wasn't with her.<eos> Then where were you?<eos> To be honest with you, I don't even remember leaving my room.<eos> I had too much to drink.<eos> We all did.
Which makes handcuffs in bed more popular than either political party.<eos> Uh-huh. And it corresponds with such positive traits as extroversion, openness, and conscientiousness.<eos> Is this why you called me out of my meeting?<eos> Those photos got leaked to the papers.<eos> He said those pictures weren't sexual.<eos> They're not sexual?<eos> Let me help you, Liberty.<eos> Why, thank you, kind sir.<eos> Self-reliance, that's my motto.<eos> Do it yourself.
Let her go.<eos> Sergeant...<eos> What do you think?<eos> What the hell do you think?<eos> She only hauls food?<eos> This bitch knows where you sleep, what you eat, what you shit!<eos> She want to fuck us up and nobody's doing that to me!<eos> It's for your brother.<eos> It's just food, I have nothing to do with this war.<eos> You do now.
I don't want to end up like Juan, - unable to go home.<eos> - Staying here is madness.<eos> And I'm not mad.<eos> On your knees!<eos> On the ground!<eos> On your knees, the three of you!<eos> I knew you'd run off eventually.<eos> Right?<eos> Do you know the penalty for treason?<eos> Do you?
Say they died of beriberi.<eos> I'll put down the real cause, it's my duty.<eos> Soldiers!<eos> Fix yourselves up right.<eos> When you go outside... look up to the sky.<eos> While we're at it ask God where He's been all this time, huh?<eos> To hell with Spain!<eos> This is for you, a letter of exemplary conduct.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> I did one for each man.
I'm a friend of his.<eos> I was just passing by.<eos> He won't be in today.<eos> I see.<eos> And your name is?<eos> I'll call him later.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Did you happen to know...<eos> that he's going through some trouble lately?<eos> You didn't.
My hands are up.<eos> You got not witnesses.<eos> So go ahead.<eos> Kill me.<eos> You gonna test me?<eos> Come on.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Kill me like you killed that kid.<eos> Well, I suppose I could.<eos> Do it.
So go ahead.<eos> Kill me.<eos> You gonna test me?<eos> Come on.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Kill me like you killed that kid.<eos> Well, I suppose I could.<eos> Do it.<eos> But then I'd be saving you... from a life in prison.<eos> Do it. Do it!
Looking for love in the wrong place.<eos> We're doing our job.<eos> Yeah, well, Russell and Hayes were doing just that, their jobs, and now they're looking at losing those jobs.<eos> Santana has to pay for shooting a cop.<eos> All hands should be on that deck.<eos> Okay, but that's not the way it works, and you all know that.<eos> Search of his apartment came up empty.<eos> The guy's good at covering his tracks.<eos> That's because a snake never leaves tracks.<eos> Actually, they do.
But then I came to camp, and I met someone.<eos> I didn't have to tell her I was gay.<eos> She just understood that I was different.<eos> And her response was to give me that tape.<eos> Bowie lives how he wants to live.<eos> He does what he wants, and he doesn't care what people think.<eos> Listening to Bowie gave me the courage to come out.<eos> And everyone just accepted you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But Cricket did.
Hey, we're approaching the rendezvous location Devon's black market contacts gave us.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> He is flying the "Marauder" over to the ship with the drug dealers on it to make the trade.<eos> And you're going with him as backup.<eos> I can fly the "Marauder".<eos> Four can be my backup.<eos> He's a better pilot.<eos> Gear up.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I think she's just doing this so I'll be complicit in the deal.<eos> It doesn't.
Not a chance.<eos> You're just looking for an excuse to be mad at me.<eos> I don't need an excuse.<eos> I got a damn good reason as it is.<eos> All right, you want me to say it?<eos> I'll say it.<eos> I'm sorry I turned you in.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Didn't know who I was.<eos> Now I do.
- Uh, my name is Gordon... - Joanie?<eos> number 108A-2...<eos> Joanie, that is private. Mm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Making a video that screams<eos> "I need to get laid" is totally private.<eos> "Get laid"?<eos> Who taught you that?<eos> Dad, I know kids in school giving handjobs in the parking lot.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, how long?<eos> They're just busy with other calls at the moment.<eos> 45 minutes or so.<eos> Oh, you've got to be kidding me!<eos> What?<eos> What did she say?<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> No, no, what did she...?
That's hardly in your way.<eos> Well, here's the thing, Lana...<eos> - Laurel.<eos> - You've been slinking around - my chief of staff...<eos> - Really?<eos> - Distracting him.<eos> - He tell you that?<eos> No, no.<eos> He doesn't know what you're about.<eos> I do.
How could it be unknown?<eos> There are some other oddities here.<eos> It moves.<eos> Even after you cut it up.<eos> Do you have the bug here?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here.<eos> And we don't have the equipment.<eos> The CDC does.
♪ ♪<eos> [bells jingle]<eos> HENRY: Here are the shells.<eos> Good luck with the bird.<eos> Good to see you, Bob Lee.<eos> Got your regular order right here.<eos> Not today, Henry.<eos> I'm trying out a new rifle.<eos> You got any .338 Lapua Magnum?<eos> Sure we do.
But did you read what she had written?<eos> How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I was just using my freedom of speech.<eos> - To send a threatening message.<eos> It was funny, okay?<eos> And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.<eos> You wished she was dead.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> No, no, I didn't.
I used to be a Scout, remember?<eos> You know, I did Scouts for a bit.<eos> - You weren't patrol leader, though.<eos> - No.<eos> You were just a regular Scout, just a junk Scout, like a peasant.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Ella?<eos> Yes, Thomas?<eos> Did you get that washing out of the machine?<eos> - No, I did not.
Tails!<eos> Stand aside, sir.<eos> What the devil...?<eos> Well, I've never known a woman promise so much and deliver so little!<eos> Where's Demelza?<eos> Out.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since she went t' Bodrugan's party.<eos> Did she say she would stay the night?<eos> Did she?
Did you have a pleasant time at Trenwith?<eos> I told you, I went to Truro to meet Richard Tonkin.<eos> Whatever you say, Ross.<eos> Do what you will.<eos> Go and live with her if you wish.<eos> It's quite possible that her marriage will still go ahead.<eos> No doubt you did your best to prevent it.<eos> No doubt I did.<eos> So does she love George, then?<eos> No, she does not.
- Okay, I'll walk you to it.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> My apartment is just around the block anyway, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... good night.<eos> You want to come by for a night cap?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
There's no known connection between him and Escobar, yet somehow he ends up the driver.<eos> Makes sense for La Quica to hire someone the police didn't know about.<eos> What does she want out of this?<eos> A ticket to Disneyland?<eos> She knows she doesn't get shit if it doesn't pan out.<eos> If this is true, she can tell us when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.<eos> You were there.<eos> You trust her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Let's do it.<eos> Thank you, everybody!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And welcome to the first ever Grand Tour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
It's a segment we are calling Conversation Street.<eos> - Well...<eos> - What?<eos> We put a lot of work into that!<eos> It was really, really hard doing that.<eos> Better than that, rather brilliantly, we have made a bespoke version of that sting for every single episode we're gonna make for the next three years.<eos> How about that?<eos> But hold on.<eos> The slight problem with that is that we were so busy doing that we didn't think actually of anything to talk about.<eos> - We did. - Yeah.
Uh, I just invited Superman to visit our mystery guest.<eos> Follow me.<eos> - What's with those two?<eos> - Beats me.<eos> Your cousin smells terrific.<eos> Enough.<eos> He landed on Earth last night in a Kryptonian pod.<eos> We don't know who he is.<eos> Did you try using a Quantum scan to determine his age?<eos> First thing we did.
Lena Luthor wasn't behind the explosion.<eos> She was the target.<eos> Should be a smooth flight, Ms. Luthor.<eos> I hate flying.<eos> I know statistically, it's the safest way to travel, but still...<eos> What the hell?<eos> I thought you two might show up.<eos> You spoil all the fun.<eos> You know, if you were expecting us to show up, you really should've brought something a little more powerful.<eos> I did.
If you want somebody high-profile killed, this is the guy to hire.<eos> But who would want Lena Luthor dead?<eos> Hey, where's Kara?<eos> Trying to talk Lena out of going through with the renaming ceremony.<eos> Sound likes she's just as stubborn as her brother.<eos> I'll have Agent Danvers on hand.<eos> This Corben doesn't seem like he cares who gets hurt so long as he gets his target.<eos> Kara and I will be there, too.<eos> Don't you think you two should talk?<eos> Apparently, you do.
Hello.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> If you're going to pretend to be a member of my team, act the part.<eos> Stand up straight. Look people in the eye.<eos> Anyway, you are the least famous member of your crew.<eos> No one's going to recognize you.<eos> Commander Truffault.<eos> Commander Nieman.<eos> We meet again.<eos> Yes, we do.
He thinks I'm a slut.<eos> I never said that.<eos> Felix, have you seen Oscar?<eos> Honey, look where I am!<eos> Are you in London?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Felix sent him to spy on me.<eos> Oscar, we're supposed to be having dinner.<eos> Didn't you get my text?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Wind?<eos> West, about seven knots.<eos> You aim at the grenade?<eos> Just the tip.<eos> Hmm.<eos> So in short, that was one hell of a shot.<eos> That it was.<eos> You think the enemy feels the same?<eos> I don't really give a shit what the enemy thinks.<eos> Well, I do.
You think we're stupid?<eos> I know you saw what we've got.<eos> Okay, man, whatever you guys are planning, I'm sure you got good reason for it.<eos> But it's got nothing to do with me.<eos> So I'm just gonna push on.<eos> You can't win a war that hasn't started.<eos> People need to wake the hell up, and we're gonna wake them.<eos> Joey, we got a situation.<eos> You got eyes on Swagger?<eos> God damn right, I do.
You keep counting calories, and you're gonna really turn me on.<eos> - Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?<eos> Is... but is it even legal?<eos> No. Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Ah. - Uh... - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.
Is... but is it even legal?<eos> No. Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Ah. - Uh... - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> It's just been a long time since this has even been an option.<eos> Hey. I know, I know.<eos> Um, you don't.
Queens, New York.<eos> Get out!<eos> Bayside, born and bred.<eos> Right here.<eos> You a Mets fan?<eos> Was.<eos> I don't follow baseball much anymore.<eos> Yeah, but still, you got to love watching the Yanks get slapped around, right?<eos> The Yankees?<eos> Who doesn't?
This thing isn't even al dente.<eos> I don't know what happened!<eos> I saw one high leg kick, and I passed out!<eos> - Boo! - Smith's a tease!<eos> Steve.<eos> Did you paint a shadow on your face?<eos> I was dressed up in blackface earlier.<eos> You're not the only one with stuff going on.<eos> Looks like you finally figured out the story.<eos> No, I didn't.
Risky?<eos> Suicide's just that thing when you mix all the sodas together into one super soda.<eos> Here, Dad, drink this tea.<eos> Uck! That was terrible!<eos> - It was Jeff's Brazilian tea.<eos> - You drugged me? !<eos> Dad, you're out of time.<eos> Maybe this will rewire your mind, help you improvise and beat Bullock.<eos> I haven't had mushroom tea in ages.<eos> You did it last weekend at the Sheraton Hotel... ton Hotel bar.
You mean this is happening he... here?<eos> According to this, they would have buried a lock of hair, a deer heart, and a skull for the ceremony to be complete.<eos> So I went out there and started digging.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Which means they weren't doing this ritual, which means my theories are crap, which means I'm an idiot.<eos> So, why are you out here? Because you're not an idiot.<eos> Something is happening there.<eos> I didn't believe it, but...<eos> Where'd this come from?<eos> We... did a seance tonight. - What?
She... fractured her pelvis.<eos> Kara's here?<eos> Wait.<eos> Kara was driving the car?<eos> She's pregnant?<eos> You have got to be kidding me!<eos> She had the nerve to show up!<eos> - Kara did this to us?<eos> ! - She said it was an accident.<eos> - Of course she did. Classic.
If I pictured it, I thought we'd go together... holding each other's hands.<eos> Honey...<eos> Kara's back.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Kara came home.<eos> Our baby came home.<eos> - A felony?<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, he did beat him up really bad.<eos> Yeah, he did.
All right? Karev is your friend.<eos> He's your... He's your guy.<eos> Things are gonna be awkward enough at work.<eos> Can we just say three weeks?<eos> It's just that my medical bills have been eating up a lot of my savings...<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> I don't...<eos> That's not... No, I don't want that.<eos> You don't?
Should have seen the intake.<eos> It was gnarly.<eos> How gnarly?<eos> Uh, about 8, 9.<eos> Nice.<eos> You are bored out of your freaking mind.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so bored.<eos> And I can't move as much as I want to, so we just sit and stare and stare and stare.<eos> And I love Harriet.<eos> I do, obviously.
My sister from another mister.<eos> Don't take this wrong, but you look like hell.<eos> What's the right way to take that?<eos> When's the last time you slept?<eos> Do you want me to try to round you up some Adderall?<eos> There's some speed queens at table eight.<eos> No.<eos> Just gonna take this whole pot across the street.<eos> Get Etta a cup of coffee and some cherry pie, and don't charge her.<eos> Done and done.
I'll mention the pie in my review.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Hello, love.<eos> I brought lunch.<eos> Vegetarian chili, Spanish sardines, and... the hell?<eos> Pickled baloney?<eos> I'm not eating that shit.<eos> Why don't we ever go out anymore?<eos> You're right.<eos> We don't.
After I stopped screaming from the pain, we fucked like rabbits.<eos> And from that night on, I knew I would give up everything for that woman.<eos> My God, we had fun.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I sound like I'm still stuck on her.<eos> She burrows under my skin like a fucking tick.<eos> Evil.<eos> My God, and the years I wasted, broken up over her.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Sure, you do.
That's not for you to decide whether she is or...<eos> Hi, sorry I'm late.<eos> I'm the grandmother.<eos> I'm the grandmother.<eos> Okay, settle down.<eos> The father of the child withdrew from the child's life initially.<eos> Is this correct?<eos> - She forced him to knock her up.<eos> You can't force someone to do that.<eos> She did.
That's a decision I had no part in.<eos> Gave up the right to that decision when you punched my ex in the face.<eos> We were having fun, right?<eos> We were... we were good.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> You do too.
Okay, sweetheart, that was an accident.<eos> No, it wasn't, my love.<eos> How was I supposed to know that your dress was caught in the door?<eos> Because I was screaming!<eos> The radio was blaring Layla, remember?<eos> No, you were getting back at me for throwing you in front of the El.<eos> If I hadn't climbed off the tracks, you would've killed me.<eos> Yes, and it serves you right for fucking that slut with the cauliflower ears!<eos> I was not fucking her!<eos> - Yes, you did!
No, it wasn't, my love.<eos> How was I supposed to know that your dress was caught in the door?<eos> Because I was screaming!<eos> The radio was blaring Layla, remember?<eos> No, you were getting back at me for throwing you in front of the El.<eos> If I hadn't climbed off the tracks, you would've killed me.<eos> Yes, and it serves you right for fucking that slut with the cauliflower ears!<eos> I was not fucking her!<eos> - Yes, you did!<eos> - No, I didn't.
She hasn't been in the office the last four hours.<eos> And someone is trying to break the encryption on her phone.<eos> I'll tell Cornish we can get started with her.<eos> You're seeming pretty anxious about this.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I want to stop the terrorists.<eos> Why else?<eos> Hello?<eos> You know who this is, Agent.<eos> I do.
You were lucky.<eos> See you again.<eos> You're okay.<eos> - Oh, my God, are you all right?<eos> - We've been trying to find you.<eos> - Your brother is going crazy.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> I don't know how you did it, but thank you.<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> You did... for a while.
It's unfortunate, but it does.<eos> You couldn't have saved this.<eos> I'll go tell her.<eos> That's the truth, right?<eos> What?<eos> That we couldn't have seen this coming.<eos> - That's true?<eos> - Why would you ask me that?<eos> Because I need to make sure that our decision to wait didn't put this woman in a wheelchair.<eos> No, it didn't.
If someone was constantly bothered my another person, would you take the case?<eos> I'll take this.<eos> Do you have it in my size? Thank you.<eos> - You don't want to answer?<eos> - Yes. I'm sorry.<eos> You mean harassment?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - You're the interested party?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Is that the woman?<eos> I don't know her.<eos> Right, but that is a woman.<eos> What are you even talking about?<eos> Give me the dog, or I'll kill her!<eos> Give us the her or we'll throw the dog off the bridge!<eos> - I'm bluffing, but if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge.<eos> - Why did you attack us?<eos> - We didn't! - How do you know who we are?<eos> - We don't.
I'm a rock star!<eos> I'm a rock star.<eos> I'm a rock star!<eos> I have mace.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> You're Lydia Spring.<eos> Are you the one that wrote this letter?<eos> I am.<eos> Do you really have answers?<eos> I do.
Good to finally meet you.<eos> You said you were attacked.<eos> Yes, so many times.<eos> There's a group of people, some kind of cult or secret organization hunting us.<eos> They said they didn't kill Patrick, but they have Lydia.<eos> They're a key piece in what's happening.<eos> Two of them even came after us while we were trying to dig up the machine.<eos> - Got them both, though.<eos> - Yeah. You killed them?<eos> Well, the shark did, certainly.
When we met? You were right the first time.<eos> Farah!<eos> You're going to have to come with me.<eos> This is lunacy.<eos> You must see that. Cops showed up at the temple, had to kill one of them.<eos> Should I be expecting more?<eos> You lost your mind when you betrayed Rainey.<eos> The Supreme Soul had a plan for us, for all of us.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Did he, now?
Uh, okay, cool.<eos> You know we really love our donuts here.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> What could possibly stop me?<eos> Oh, hey, Josh!<eos> How was karate?<eos> Were you the best one there?<eos> Becks, the only person I'm trying to be better than is the person I was yesterday.<eos> - Mm. - And today, I kicked Yesterday Josh's ass!<eos> Yeah, you did!
I was embarrassed.<eos> I'm sure you heard.<eos> DUI, alcoholic, blah, blah, blah.<eos> I heard. Yeah.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I really have been doing a lot better.<eos> But then I heard about you and Chan.<eos> And... you had a drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't.
I heard. Yeah.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I really have been doing a lot better.<eos> But then I heard about you and Chan.<eos> And... you had a drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> I thought about it.<eos> I almost did.
Guys, don't do this.<eos> If you fall down the rabbit hole of Internetting an ex's current girlfriend, you may never come back.<eos> Shh... Look at her. Shh.<eos> Oh, she's so pretty and cool.<eos> Also, she has, like, a permanent flower crown filter face. What?<eos> How do you get that?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I know who she is.<eos> I read about her in Us magazine.<eos> She does eyebrows for celebrities.
Ugh!<eos> Her weight!<eos> Try her weight!<eos> 115! Try it!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> She doesn't weigh herself, remember?<eos> Of course she does.
Paula, I'm really sorry that I didn't have a blank T-shirt to work with and I had to write on the back, but I think it looks great.<eos> What T-shirt is that?<eos> What-what T-shirt is that?<eos> Remind me.<eos> Oh, the Breast Cancer Rock and Roll<eos> Walk/Run 5K, Parsipanny, New Jersey.<eos> That's a great cause, great organization.<eos> Sorry, I didn't make you a shirt, Paula.<eos> I-I don't know how these girl groups work.<eos> Did I do something wrong?
That hurts me.<eos> You've never been there for me when I need you.<eos> Yes, I have been.<eos> Just the other day I... I came to your house when you were, you were sick with the flu or whatever.<eos> - You didn't tell me what it was.<eos> - That wasn't the flu,<eos> I had an abortion.<eos> (sighs) Oh, my God.<eos> You had an abortion?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
Yes, I have been.<eos> Just the other day I... I came to your house when you were, you were sick with the flu or whatever.<eos> - You didn't tell me what it was.<eos> - That wasn't the flu,<eos> I had an abortion.<eos> (sighs) Oh, my God.<eos> You had an abortion?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.<eos> - You didn't tell me?<eos> - No, I did not.
- Okay...<eos> You've known him for, like, three days!<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> And he listens to me.<eos> I listen to you, I would've listened to you. You just didn't give me the chance.<eos> I was, I was sitting there...<eos> I was sitting there on the edge of your bed, and you said nothing.<eos> I mean, I asked you, I asked you point blank if anything was wrong.<eos> - You didn't really mean it.<eos> - Yes, I did, yes, I did.
- Thank you.<eos> I'm mildly obsessed with a turn of the century composer.<eos> This is how she dresses.<eos> I used to dress up as Lord Byron and smoke opium in college.<eos> - No shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I was you before you were you, Dee Dee.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't want to resign.<eos> Well, then don't.
Some people with Space Bugs in their heads experience stumbling, loss of balance or loss of hearing in one ear.<eos> This is normal since part of your brain needs to come out somewhere.<eos> Some people with Space Bugs report an aversion to sex and also alcohol, plus an interest in vegetables, vegetable juices, and the curative properties of juicing in general.<eos> ♪ Get the Space Bugs in your head ♪<eos> ♪ Space Bugs in your... ♪<eos> ♪ Get the Space Bugs in your ♪<eos> ♪ Space Bugs in your ♪<eos> ♪ Head... ♪<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> You did... for a while.
Thank you, Senator.<eos> Uh, Dr. Samira...<eos> Is that your lab coat?<eos> What?<eos> The coat you're wearing... your lab coat, is it yours?<eos> I, uh... no.<eos> No.<eos> Uh, who gave it to you?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Red did.
'Cause that makes it harder for people to fight them. They're too busy fighting each other.<eos> Republicans, Democrats.<eos> Americans, Russians.<eos> Why "You Might Think"?<eos> - The song, "You Might Think"... why do you all like it?<eos> Why not?<eos> It's a beautiful song.<eos> Don't-don't you think it's beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
But if we can't get out, can it get in?<eos> Shouldn't we stay here?<eos> The lady makes a good point.<eos> Baird...?<eos> Whatever you are, show yourself.<eos> I surrender!<eos> - To who?<eos> - To you.<eos> You don't need to surrender to me.<eos> Okay... I don't then?
It's much worse.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes. I'm afraid the whole topic is still not taken seriously.<eos> Oui?<eos> C'est bon.<eos> You're very lucky to be surrounded by such enlightened chaps such as myself and Blake. Professor.<eos> It's curious, though. In this case, the two parties agree on what happened.<eos> She gave him a blowjob.<eos> He didn't force her to.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Yes, I did.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> I behaved like a total asshole.<eos> I just... it's Noah Solloway.<eos> He just makes me so agitated.<eos> I mean, I didn't know he was gonna be here.<eos> I mean, why did you invite him?<eos> We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so...<eos> I'm taking his class. Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't.
- Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Please come here.<eos> Please come here.<eos> Yes.<eos> I got to pick up the balloons, buy a new camera battery, make the gift bags...<eos> I got the kids all personalized sunglasses with their names on the sides.<eos> Pink for the girls, green for the boys.<eos> Hey, um, did you confirm the entertainment?<eos> Already done.
Too bad.<eos> Where were you really?<eos> - You could've warned me.<eos> - About what?<eos> - The cops, Alison.<eos> The ones asking me if I tried to murder your husband.<eos> They came here too. I'm...<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I-I didn't know they would go to you.<eos> Well, they did.
You did it!<eos> My brave girl. Hey.<eos> My brave girl.<eos> All right, so, what shall we do now?<eos> - Swings.<eos> - Swings.<eos> God, you're so big now.<eos> Look at you..<eos> Do you remember when I was born?<eos> Yeah. Of course I do.
- So, Marlena left?<eos> She had another appointment.<eos> Well, how did I do today?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, did she say anything to you about, you know, my behavior?<eos> I saw you two talking, so...<eos> We were talking about her kids.<eos> We don't talk about you. That would be unethical.<eos> I just, you know, thought maybe she said something about...<eos> She didn't.
I don't want to ride the pony.<eos> I want more cake.<eos> Okay, you can have another piece of cake after you ride the pony.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Look, I can take her for cake.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - It's fine. I can.<eos> Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.<eos> Look, she doesn't want to ride.<eos> Of course she does.
- Yeah, so F'd.<eos> Yeah, for some reason, I thought there'd be stuff in here to help us get home, not a sex swing.<eos> We need to find out who this pervert is.<eos> What?<eos> Why? Because, Danny, you're not packing "The Jackhammer," unless you mean business.<eos> This guy could be a full-on sexual deviant.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> We don't know anything about who we're trapped here with.<eos> You know what? You're right.<eos> - We don't.
I'm gonna name you Meat.<eos> All right, Owen.<eos> The was quite the prank.<eos> Well done.<eos> I think this should end now, though.<eos> I want everyone to get back to the shelter.<eos> What's the matter, Steve, huh?<eos> You worried that if people don't find this place livable, they might want to give me the tarp?<eos> Owen, do you know the name of that actor?<eos> Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't.
That is some grade-A, 100% flank steak.<eos> Put a little bitty pat of butter on that.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I don't care if I'm starving or going insane.<eos> I am not eating a person.<eos> That's a bridge you can't uncross.<eos> Okay, so just... Aah!<eos> - Yo, Gary. - Uh-oh.<eos> I don't even think this dude wants to live.<eos> He doesn't.
- A mistake? - Yeah.<eos> You know, you fell for me because you were bored and you felt trapped by Helen, your kids, your fucking father-in-law.<eos> And you wanted a fling, but you chose me, who had lost a child, and who was so incredibly sad you couldn't just abandon me, so you convinced yourself that you loved me.<eos> And I convinced myself that I loved you, because I so desperately needed someone just to take me away.<eos> I used you. You used me too.<eos> That's what happened between us.<eos> You... you really think that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know it's true.<eos> And you do too.
You haven't become her, Alison.<eos> Haven't I?<eos> Fires, oceans, and babies.<eos> Those are the things I could watch forever.<eos> Fires, oceans, babies.<eos> I don't know how you made it through Gabriel's death.<eos> I thought about it a lot when I was away, and just... 29 years old, and you lose your child.<eos> No real parents, no one to take care of you.<eos> I-I don't know how you survived.<eos> I didn't, really.
It's time for them to fear us.<eos> Tell me your plan.<eos> The silo is guarded around the clock.<eos> We capture someone with access and apply pressure.<eos> There's a better way.<eos> What if we kept him?<eos> He's not real, K.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Who says I'm real?<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> But you're a human.<eos> Not completely, remember.<eos> I have always felt like one of you.<eos> I've always wondered, where is it?<eos> This embedded part?<eos> Here.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Do you love me, Leo?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Who?<eos> - The whole world.<eos> Online.<eos> Everyone hates me.<eos> Thinks I killed Molly.<eos> Did you sleep at all?<eos> I tried, but...<eos> Hey, I know it's horrible what those people are saying, but you can't pay attention to that.<eos> - They don't even know you...<eos> - Carolyn Bloom does.
Please say we're not calling it that.<eos> So is no-one going to ask about the robot?<eos> Wait!<eos> Jesus, Ram.<eos> You meant what you said?<eos> You didn't care if it killed you.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> It left me with the rest of my stupid life, didn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Rob's my mentor.<eos> He taught me how to be DEA, for God's sake!<eos> But?<eos> What is it, Valentine?<eos> About six months ago, I was going over numbers for the program... and the loss incidence for weapons was being underreported.<eos> And who did you bring this to?<eos> A friend at the DOJ.<eos> And Rob.<eos> He thanked me for the catch and promised he'd deal with it.<eos> And did he?
It's a big step up, right?<eos> And... And I can talk to Snapper for you, if you want.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But I'm gonna have to make my own luck on that one.<eos> Congrats, boss.<eos> I like the sound of it.<eos> Don't get used to it.<eos> Five-hundred words on the dual Metallo attacks in Metropolis and National City with eyewitness accounts, comments from police sources and zero adjectives, all thoroughly vetted and verified.<eos> - You don't work here.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Oh, please.<eos> That's just happy-clappy stuff teachers want you to believe.<eos> You know, some people are grateful for so-called normal.<eos> Like who?<eos> My mum was in a wheelchair for eight years.<eos> Yeah, well, she's not anymore, is she?<eos> Wow!<eos> Why are you being such a dick?<eos> I really don't know.<eos> I really don't.
What are you doing?<eos> ! Wait, I'm being yelled at.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - My mum.<eos> Like me, like memory, but you're there.<eos> I was little and... ..I stole some sweets from an off-license.<eos> I tried to pretend that I didn't know it was wrong, but my mum sat me down and said...<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> And you did.

Guys, how bad would you have to be to be put in a prison in space?<eos> And if he's still here, does that mean the prisoner's escaped?<eos> Ram! What are you doing?<eos> Tanya, what did the prisoner look like?<eos> I don't know. I just felt it.<eos> If he's here, don't you think we should find him before he finds us?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> I'm trapped in a confined space, which is making my heart beat nearly twice as fast as normal, you're afraid of me, and everyone thinks I act like a prince asking stupid questions.<eos> No, they don't.
But there's this one girl called Susan, and all the time I'm reading these books I'm thinking,<eos> "This author really, really hates Susan."<eos> Because, well, for one thing she doesn't get to go to heaven because she wears make-up.<eos> What are these books about?<eos> But the other thing is that she overhears a friend talking about her when she shouldn't, and the friend says not nice things, and it's a moment of weakness for the friend, but the friendship is ruined forever.<eos> Do you never complain about your friends?<eos> Do you never complain about me?<eos> Even in the privacy of your head?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I never actually do.
He wanted someone guiltier than him to end his suffering.<eos> And you stopped him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because I'm not innocent.<eos> Not in my heart.<eos> For a Rhodian, a wish is the same as an action.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I think we have some things to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
Right, now remember, this is a serious proceeding, so it should be treated as such.<eos> All right, court is now in session.<eos> People, the case is clear.<eos> There is no proof that Pack attacked Danny.<eos> There is proof that Danny shot Pack.<eos> And shooting people is a crime.<eos> If it wasn't, I would have put a bullet in my brother-in-law years ago.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, did Danny shoot Pack?<eos> Yeah, he did.

I'm trying to do New Zealand.<eos> Yeah, well, back at our camp, we all make decisions together.<eos> - No one woman rules everyone.<eos> - Really?<eos> And you're okay with that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Because you're the person who paid to have "Head Flight Attendant" embroidered on your uniform.<eos> I did not pay to have it embroidered.<eos> I did that myself.
Javier, Owen is not here to "steal our women."<eos> And by the way, Britney, Vanessa, and I can take care of ourselves, thank you very much.<eos> Look.<eos> Owen is not here to do us any harm, and even if he were, we'd take care of it, okay?<eos> You know, I don't really want to cause any trouble, so I think I'm just gonna go.<eos> What?<eos> Where you gonna go?<eos> - Just gonna go back to my camp.<eos> - I thought they banished you, though.<eos> They did.

Yeah.<eos> You were tending the bar that night.<eos> You stayed late to clean up.<eos> Yeah, that's what we always do after the...<eos> Then you saw Scott coming down from the stairwell leading to the roof.<eos> He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty.<eos> You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
What do you want a 30-year-old gun for?<eos> Just in case.<eos> I got rid of that gun years ago.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> There's no time.<eos> It could already be too late.<eos> Gary called.<eos> He said you're sick, Mike.<eos> They didn't understand in 1988, and they don't understand now.<eos> And you do?
I need to tell you something.<eos> What is it?<eos> When they searched the woods up there, they never found anything.<eos> Which is very strange.<eos> Why is that?<eos> You know, I've worked with some mothers who, for various reasons, are unable to bond with their children.<eos> Some love really is conditional.<eos> Honey, that's true.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course I do.
Can I see?<eos> Wow.<eos> You've always been very good.<eos> All right.<eos> Would you like me to read to you?<eos> Do you know what book?<eos> Hmm.<eos> "Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen, having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, and keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island..."<eos> When you think about this, it'll just seem like some nightmare you had.<eos> It already does.
Stop now!<eos> Stop!<eos> Liddy!<eos> Hey, it's dead, it's dead.<eos> You mercied him.<eos> Oh. You really did.<eos> I knew this zombie once.<eos> He was my doctor.<eos> - Somebody kill it!<eos> - Somebody already did.
- Thank you.<eos> And look who's back from Hawaii.<eos> Oh, what was it like playing with the Honolulu Phil?<eos> - Dreamy.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, great cameo.<eos> Loved you flailing around on stage.<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - The whole world did, sweetie.
Yow! Oh, my God.<eos> Whew. Oh, Jesus.<eos> Do you even have a license?<eos> Why, I have an English one.<eos> Uh, does that count?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> Listen. Now we have the chance.<eos> Shall we just blow out of here and go to Sag Harbor for the weekend?<eos> You don't want to meet them.<eos> Of course I do.
Okay, let's keep on rehearsing.<eos> - You need a rest. - Okay.<eos> No.<eos> - It's okay. - Mm-hmm?<eos> Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay. Okay.<eos> Why don't you rehearse? Okay?<eos> Why don't you keep on rehearsing a little bit?<eos> Okay? Let's keep on doing it, and I will be from here supervising. Okay?<eos> - But you guys do it--
That's just a book report.<eos> Uh, you can't just conduct something because you think it's interesting.<eos> You see, I'm trying to get you to find a piece of music that you can really feel and conduct like no one else can.<eos> Hai Lai, hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What's up?<eos> I really have to talk to you.<eos> Uh, yeah. Are you just appearing places now or--<eos> - I live here. - No.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Yes, what?<eos> Do you want to have a child with me?<eos> What?<eos> Let's have a child, you and me.<eos> Uh, I'll be right there.<eos> I'm doing something that's really important to me, and I would really appreciate it if you would give me the space to do that.<eos> - I give you the space.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Do you want to do this or not?<eos> I really, really do.
Yeah, but that's what war is, though, isn't it?<eos> You're always waiting to die.<eos> You have no idea what war is.<eos> Sorry, what was that, April?<eos> We sit here and talk about war like we have the first clue.<eos> The mindset of the soldier.<eos> How can anyone here even guess?<eos> Well, imagination is an act of empathy.<eos> Of course we don't know what it was actually like.<eos> No, you don't.
You were wearing a green skirt.<eos> You were on your second pint.<eos> You asked me my favorite book.<eos> I wrote my number on your business card.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I swore I wasn't going to kiss you.<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> I swore I wasn't going to kiss you.<eos> I swore I wasn't going to kiss you.<eos> Then you did.
So, so cool.<eos> Everybody wants to drive around with a fat guy.<eos> Wrong hill, pal!<eos> Okay, let's go get JJ a voice.<eos> Gonna miss you, bro.<eos> You're leaving a lot of ass on the table.<eos> I'm gonna miss having someone else around who cares about astronomy.<eos> But, dude, you're my wingman.<eos> If you're not talking me up, I'm not sure I'd get that Sophia at that party last week.<eos> IâI did.
He asked me about Jacob Appley.<eos> He asked me did I see his face.<eos> He wanted to know if it looked like Appley was looking for Dr. Benton.<eos> And then what did Appley do afterwards?<eos> Did he just run or was he looking at Dr. Benton on the ground?<eos> And, um, he wanted to know, did I see anyone else there?<eos> Anyone else?<eos> What did he mean by that?<eos> Did I notice anyone odd or different or unusual?<eos> - And did you?
Ruben Locana's been running trials for a long time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get our way.<eos> Detective.<eos> I advised your English colleague that if he persisted with his obsessive, aggressive attacks, that he would only end up hurting himself.<eos> We have a job to do, Nick.<eos> We are going to do it.<eos> Uh, please try to see.<eos> -You really don't want to know.<eos> -But we do.
- Well, I'm not Portia.<eos> - No.<eos> Her's was... a ruthlessness born of insecurity.<eos> But you, you hold a strength drawn from confidence and compassion.<eos> I don't miss Portia Lin.<eos> - So?<eos> You going with?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - He didn't ask you?<eos> - No, he did not.
Well, that much is clear.<eos> Drago-san.<eos> Welcome back, Ryo.<eos> Citizens of Zairon, we interrupt your viewing to bring you this live stream from the Royal Court of Ishida.<eos> I deliver the prisoner unto the judgment of the court.<eos> Han-Shireikan, join us.<eos> Ishida Ryo.<eos> You stand accused of the death of your father, Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> I don't.
[Vic] So, did your girl find a pack to take her in yet?<eos> [Pyper] Nope. [sighs]<eos> It appears the world still doesn't know what to do with an alpha female.<eos> Which is why us alpha females need to take matters into our own hands.<eos> You want to buy my crappy old motor home?<eos> I do. [laughs]
What opportunity is that, boss?<eos> Early retirement with a big, fat bank account.<eos> And all you have to do is... is bring Hector to me.<eos> Dead or alive.<eos> Hector's already dead.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> He's just a ghost story now.<eos> No way.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Or I almost did.
Oh, Walter.<eos> There you are.<eos> Bob Barnes just called, and they're kicking Billy out of the rehab facility.<eos> Kicking him out?<eos> What for?<eos> Well, Bob can't afford it.<eos> I've been calling around to see if the state facilities can take him, but they've all got wait lists.<eos> I remember what a sweet little boy he was.<eos> Do you know anybody with some pull that could maybe help him get moved up the list?<eos> Actually, I do.
He owed me.<eos> What'd he owe you?<eos> Money?<eos> Let's say, hypothetically, a girl needed medicine.<eos> But that girl has no money.<eos> So, hypothetically, this girl becomes really friendly with the guy with [chuckling] a lot of medicine so she could get more.<eos> You slept with a drug dealer for heroin?<eos> [Jule] Yeah.<eos> It's not actually something you would put in your annual Christmas letter.<eos> But, yeah, I did.
What?<eos> So we decided to form this furious four.<eos> Bob, seriously, man, one suggestion?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I mean, the baby is already asleep.<eos> Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.
Actually, it's... it's my dad.<eos> What about him?<eos> I'm worried about him... and you.<eos> Well, you know.<eos> Your dad and I have always... been on opposite sides of pretty much everything.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I love my dad.<eos> But I don't always agree with him.<eos> And I-I don't want you to think that I-I share his feelings about you.<eos> Well, I don't.
Where were you?<eos> - What?<eos> - You missed our first deposition.<eos> Didn't you say you wanted to be there?<eos> You wanted to fight?<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
And I want to be safe.<eos> I think there's a way we can do that.<eos> Manifest Destinations doesn't have a website or a single Yelp review.<eos> So, uh... how'd the deposition go?<eos> Not great.<eos> Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?<eos> Now we do.
The good people of Absaroka deserve to hear this evidence in court.<eos> And the citizens of this county deserve to know what kind of sheriff they elected.<eos> And when they do, they're gonna realize that poor Barlow Connally deserves a hell of a lot more than $250,000.<eos> So, if you'll excuse me, Counselor, I need to practice.<eos> I brought you these fish.<eos> Now there's no reason for you to come back to Absaroka.<eos> I'm gonna be very polite, but very clear.<eos> I want you out of my county.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> The FBI does not.
Do you know if your daughter still has that letter that Tony sent?<eos> It might help shed some light on this.<eos> I shredded it for her own good.<eos> Two years, and she's still mooning over him.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is A-Asha with you?<eos> Um, no.<eos> She's not.<eos> - But you got my message.<eos> - Uh, yes, I did.
- No, you can't.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - She's my cousin.<eos> - I called her to come get me.<eos> - Asha, I'm so sorry.<eos> I cannot let you do this.<eos> I heard J.P. on your answering machine.<eos> Your restraining order worked.<eos> He... He said he's sorry.<eos> Of course he did.
Is that Grand Teton?<eos> South Teton.<eos> We were gonna do the Grand the next summer.<eos> So, what brings you here?<eos> You can't possibly have more bad news.<eos> No, but, uh, I got to ask you some questions that aren't gonna be too much fun.<eos> Were you aware that your husband might have been unfaithful?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sheriff, I knew who I was marrying, but I loved him anyway, no matter what.<eos> I still do.
- You knew that he was dead?<eos> - She killed him.<eos> - No!<eos> - She stabbed him.<eos> And then she stuffed his body in a hollow tree.<eos> That's not true!<eos> I did not!<eos> Then you just hired somebody to do it.<eos> Tizz, you didn't know what Tony was really like.<eos> Yes, I did.
Would you be all right if we just watch a movie tonight?<eos> Well, what made you think that I invited you over here for anything else?<eos> You were trying to get me drunk.<eos> You think you're safe in there?<eos> !<eos> Shit.<eos> - You think you're safe in there? !<eos> - Go in the kitchen, and close the door.<eos> - I thought we were...<eos> - Please, Asha, just do it!
How else would the mob have known when and where to ambush Ferg?<eos> If I give this guy's name to the FBI, he'll find out, go into hiding, and be even more likely to send somebody after me.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> We need to find whoever was sent before they get the drop on me or Nighthorse.<eos> We'll check airline manifests, hotel rooms, rental cars... look for whoever came in from Boston.<eos> Who are we looking for?<eos> Well, it's probably not the boss himself.<eos> He probably sent somebody else.<eos> - But if he didn't and...
- Yeah, I am.<eos> - Can you educate us?<eos> It's the law that says you can't kidnap someone.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - And it's punishable with a sentence<eos> - of 20 years to life. - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> This is not the sentencing phase, is it?<eos> Sustained.<eos> Now, Ms. Moretti, do you know what the Fourth Amendment says?<eos> I do.
We took Malachi out there to banish him for betraying his tribe, for bringing the mob and heroin and despair to our people, for killing Mingan.<eos> Nighthorse cut him, and I got him to sign the Red Pony back over to me.<eos> But when we left him, Malachi was alive.<eos> - So who wrote out "Hector Lives"?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> Who knew you were taking Malachi out there?<eos> Just Jacob.<eos> What is it?<eos> Walt said that he suspected that Nighthorse put on a show for me, then went back to kill Malachi.<eos> Maybe he did.
Lie down.<eos> No.<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.<eos> We've gone to a lot of trouble.<eos> What hell am I doing here?<eos> You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> We all do.
We all do.<eos> We see her in our dreams.<eos> She told us about you.<eos> How you'd wake up early and make breakfast so she could sneak out and make her sculptures.<eos> How, after your father left, she told you to go with him.<eos> She said, "Go be the hero of your own life."<eos> And you said to her, "A hero doesn't leave."<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I see her in my dreams.<eos> We all do.
Is there any actual evidence of a malfunction?<eos> Do you want to tell them, or should I?<eos> There was an oversight.<eos> When I took the ship into the atmosphere on Galen 2, I neglected to initiate the electrostatic buffering sequence.<eos> As a result, one of the secondary capacitors failed.<eos> There was no serious damage.<eos> This time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> - Why didn't you?
The Android is working on repairs, but it-it's slow going.<eos> Android, come in.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> What's our status?<eos> Life support has been restored, but most other systems are still down.<eos> Unfortunately, repairs will take quite some time.<eos> Well, have you restored your neural link?<eos> That should speed things up.<eos> I wasn't sure you wanted me to do that.<eos> Of course I do.
And as you're no doubt aware, I've been asked to be a special prosecutor on this leak case.<eos> Yes, yeah.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> No. Uh, if you don't mind, I'll...<eos> I'll stand.<eos> I'm-I'm having some health issues.<eos> If I sit, I might not get up again.<eos> So, let me just say this first.<eos> I know you leaked.<eos> - You do?
Just the way your voice sounds... It doesn't sound like a funny thing.<eos> No, it's funny.<eos> The newest oppo research has you sleeping with someone I know is wrong.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to know who?<eos> Sure, if you want to tell me.<eos> Michael Moore.<eos> You know, Michael Moore, the liberal.<eos> I do.
Dad, my friends are counting on me.<eos> Please don't make me go back on my word.<eos> Keep your word.<eos> We're good, guys.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Honey, come quick.<eos> He's learning to wave back.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you wave?<eos> You did.
_<eos> _ _<eos> Are the cufflinks finished?<eos> Yes.<eos> I just need to polish them.<eos> Well, get a move on.<eos> Everything must be absolutely "pafekuto."<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You do know what today is.<eos> Of course I do.
I wrote it myself;<eos> they can't take it away from her any more than they can take my deal away from me.<eos> But you need to tell me exactly what Cahill said to you when he told you to turn on Sutter.<eos> Nothing.<eos> He never said anything to me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm telling you I've never spoken to Sean Cahill in my life.<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> But I gave you seven days to find that witness, and then you went behind my back, so you better have a good reason why you're in here asking to reopen this case.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
Cameron got wind that I'm trying to get Gallo parole.<eos> And now I got to think of something or perjure myself tomorrow, or he's gonna end up right back in here.<eos> Well, that's even more reason why we can't leave Kevin behind.<eos> If Gallo doesn't get out and I do, the first person he's gonna go after is Kevin.<eos> And I didn't sign on to get someone killed.<eos> No, you signed on to get yourself out.<eos> Now if you don't drop this suit,<eos> Cahill's gonna threaten to pull your deal.<eos> What?<eos> He already did.
I didn't do shit.<eos> But I sure as hell am gonna take advantage of it.<eos> I'm not leaving without Mike.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> And I don't care if I have to drag your ass out of here myself.<eos> You're leaving right now.<eos> Harvey, good, you're here.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> You said you'd reinstate the deal if Mike dropped his suit.<eos> - And I did.
And irony of ironies, because of some prisoners' rights lawsuit way back when, there are no cameras in cells.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> No, the time for waiting is done.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I meant, don't you want to hear about the camera that's in here?<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Smile, you son of a bitch.<eos> No!<eos> You did not keep yourself in here just to do this.<eos> Yeah, Frank, I did.
But you dropped the ball.<eos> Leonard Bailey went to death row.<eos> And you'd rather let him stay there than to admit the truth.<eos> - Ms. Casey, in your estimation, was Leonard Bailey innocent?<eos> - Objection, Your Honor, calls for a conclusion.<eos> - Your Honor, they opened the door to this when they put her on the stand, and no one is more qualified to answer than his own attorney.<eos> - I'll allow it.<eos> Ms. Casey?<eos> - I thought Leonard Bailey was guilty.<eos> And I still do.
That's not funny.<eos> It's Vladimir and Estragon.<eos> "Waiting for Godot."<eos> You know, when they brought "Godot" to America, it opened in Miami in this dinner theater.<eos> It was billed as the laugh riot of two continents, and it bombed.<eos> So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing.<eos> People said it wouldn't work.<eos> They wouldn't get it.<eos> It was too highbrow.<eos> Of course, they did.
You gonna...<eos> I'm gonna watch Tweedledee and Tweedledumbass.<eos> How do we know you are who you say you are?<eos> I don't often like to brandish my credentials, but you've left me no choice.<eos> Wendle.<eos> Football, please.<eos> Or should I say, nuclear football.<eos> The codes are in here.<eos> Who voted for you?<eos> I didn't.
They shouldn't see their father as a criminal.<eos> Kevin, come on, man.<eos> I know it's hard on them.<eos> It tears me up every single day that I'm here.<eos> But they're kids.<eos> They're resilient.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Well, Mike, you don't have kids.<eos> So you don't know.<eos> No. I don't.
I want everyone to know what happened here today.<eos> They saw what happened.<eos> Yeah, there's a difference between seeing and knowing.<eos> You Kevin Miller?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> I'm Mike Ross's lawyer.<eos> Look, I already told the warden I didn't see anyone touch his food.<eos> Did you see Frank Gallo with him?<eos> Did you or didn't you?
I'm touched.<eos> Now take this and get the hell out. - What's that?<eos> - It's an eviction notice.<eos> I gave you a warning.<eos> You screwed the pooch and now you're out.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You come at me, I apologize to you, and then you do this?<eos> Well, in between those two things, your traders were playing touch football in my beloved bullpen, so I don't accept your bullshit apology.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> I already did.
I don't care about that.<eos> You asked me to take a chance on you, and now you march in here and tell me you're giving up?<eos> No, no, Mr. Bailey...<eos> You said you would fight for me.<eos> I did fight for you.<eos> Well, then fight goddamn harder!<eos> I'm sorry, and I understand how you feel, but there's just nothing more that I can do.<eos> How do you know what I feel?<eos> You don't know what it's like to be kept away from your loved ones.<eos> - Actually, I do.
Rachel, I wish I could tell you I had an extra hour to give, - but I don't. - Jessica, please.<eos> If you would just come with me - and meet this man... - No, this is my point.<eos> I just found out we have less time than I thought we did to get this firm back on its feet, and I can't afford to spend one minute on anything else.<eos> But, I mean, really...<eos> Rachel, I'm sorry.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.<eos> - You must trust him a lot to let him in on your little arrangement.<eos> I do.
Until this thing goes through, not only are you gonna keep your hands off Mike, you're gonna be his personal protector in here.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Not bullshit.<eos> He so much as twists an ankle in the yard, I'll withdraw that motion.<eos> Now, aren't you forgetting a little something, champ?<eos> I don't need you to handle this thing for me.<eos> Now that I know what's what, I'll get my own attorney.<eos> Yeah, you do that, and I'll tell the courts that you just admitted to me that you tried to poison Mike.<eos> You know how much time that's gonna add to your sentence?<eos> - I didn't do shit to him!
- You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, well, I know what happens if either one of us turns on him.<eos> We won't have a penny to our name.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Is he paying you to be in here?<eos> Listen to me, everything we have is tied to that man.<eos> And if he goes away, we lose it all.<eos> That's not what I asked.<eos> Did he promise you money if you kept quiet?<eos> Of course he goddamn did.
I already have a way, I just need to know you did that other thing you were supposed to do.<eos> I need to know you got Gallo his parole hearing.<eos> Let's get to it.<eos> What happened?<eos> Good news.<eos> The court granted our motion.<eos> They pushed your execution back a month.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You convinced my aunt I didn't kill those people?<eos> - No, Leonard, I didn't.
- I don't understand.<eos> You said that she had to agree to be there for me.<eos> She agreed to sign the papers.<eos> But she's not gonna come.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Leonard, don't take your eye off the ball.<eos> This was about buying us time.<eos> Take my eye off the ball?<eos> Do you even give a shit about me?<eos> Of course we do.
Welcome to Danbury, Sean.<eos> You know you're taking a big risk that someone's gonna recognize me and figure out that you're up to something.<eos> Well, I'd be taking an even bigger risk if I didn't hand this to you personally.<eos> You're not gonna weasel out of my deal again.<eos> What is this?<eos> That is an iron clad agreement between your office and Jill Miller.<eos> You're representing Jill Miller now?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Does she know that you're not a lawyer?<eos> She does.
You can change.<eos> You can fix this.<eos> Whatever it is, I will help you.<eos> No, but that's the thing.<eos> You just said it.<eos> I have to throw the punch.<eos> That's why I came out here alone.<eos> You can't do it for me this time.<eos> Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?<eos> Yeah. I do.
D?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, too risky to follow on foot.<eos> Let's call it a day.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> - Did you get the apartment?<eos> - The...<eos> - Did you call?<eos> What did they say?<eos> Yeah, uh, I did.
Shyvon's my girlfriend.<eos> I just looked at Ashley.<eos> And you took those photos, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what about last night?<eos> She was there posing, looking at you?<eos> Thought, "Maybe she wants to have sex with me?"<eos> Right?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yeah, Charlie, I do.
My studio's two blocks away.<eos> Can I go now, coz?<eos> Just don't go too far, coz.<eos> Look, this guy's lying about something, so get his mug in a photo array and show it to the mother and the daughter.<eos> They're in Boston until Wednesday.<eos> Oh, and Hype's not the only one lying.<eos> Security video confirms that Eva's boyfriend Logan left his law firm at 11:30 and didn't return until 1:45.<eos> That's not a quick lunch.<eos> No, not unless you live in Italy.<eos> And he doesn't.
It belongs to Vincent Love.<eos> So Hype used my gun to shoot Cash?<eos> He must've stolen it.<eos> He knows I own many guns, man.<eos> What, you just keep 'em out in the open?<eos> I keep everything locked up, but I always keep one right here in my desk.<eos> Oops.<eos> At least I thought I did.<eos> Did Hype know that you kept a gun in there?<eos> Of course he did.
Shut up, just go.<eos> I tell ya, 15 years ago, I would've played this a lot different.<eos> I'd just work my way up the ladder, making arrests till some shot-caller stomped it all down to keep business rolling.<eos> Well, we're not there anymore.<eos> No, sir, we ain't.<eos> I mean, now I'm just a guy sitting in front of a computer that predicts which child's gonna be shot next.<eos> It's a whole new thing.<eos> I'm here to tell you, you both got played.<eos> Park Lords didn't hit TK, someone else did, to pit you against each other.<eos> Then who the hell did it?
All right.<eos> All right, guys...<eos> Fentanyl?<eos> 300 K worth.<eos> My guy in Narcotics says recently they've been pulling heroin off the streets that's been cut with it.<eos> Makes it, like, 1,000 times more potent.<eos> It's killing people all over Chicago.<eos> Hey, Sarge.<eos> I heard Mouse came looking to get a felony dropped so he could re-enlist.<eos> And if he did?
No criminal record, but the last few weeks, he suddenly appears all over Tyler's social media profile.<eos> Mouse, you dump his phone records?<eos> Yeah, there's dozens of calls between Tyler and Tony Chin, all less than two minutes in duration and at all sorts of crazy hours.<eos> Have Atwater and Ruzek take a run at this guy.<eos> You know, uh, Tyler... he was 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine.<eos> - When?<eos> - '08.<eos> He was spitting distance from us in Kandahar.<eos> All right, well, they saw some action.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Either way, we're after a fentanyl ring.<eos> Waypoints for Blind River, Ontario,<eos> Mackinaw City, Michigan, and Chicago.<eos> We ran a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the sample from the lake.<eos> It's not coming back as fentanyl.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Chemically, fentanyl's a pharmaceutical designed to treat cancer patients... potent enough that a molecule on the head of a pin is deadly, but if even a molecule's altered, then technically, it's not a controlled substance.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Do you know how many OD's we have off this stuff down at Med?<eos> I do.
- Uh, Tariq Bolad...<eos> Two gunshot wounds, center mass, wallet and keys still on him but no cell phone.<eos> Who called it in?<eos> Shot spotter picked up possible gunfire.<eos> Dispatch put it over the zone.<eos> We were first on the scene.<eos> Is ASA Stone around?<eos> The Ariel Kincaid murder.<eos> You remember it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Where's that little smile today, Oliver?<eos> You know, of all the people you hurt, you can add one more to the list... your sister.<eos> State's Attorney's gonna push for three years.<eos> You're pissed. You're miserable.<eos> You want a new partner.<eos> I get it, but, Burgess, it is not that easy.<eos> You're just gonna have to suck it up.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> - You're right.<eos> You didn't.
Well, the truth is we're not actually fishermen...<eos> We're pirates, motherfuckers!<eos> - Motherfucker, motherfucker.<eos> - Hey...<eos> What...<eos> What are you doing right now?<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you serious right now?<eos> What... What did we talk about?<eos> How many times do we
A fan?<eos> A fan fell on the car?<eos> Hey, get the blueprints.<eos> There's a fan above the car.<eos> This is very important.<eos> Put it there. As we look... just a sec.<eos> We've got blueprints... it's ripped there.<eos> We can still check it.<eos> When you were driving, did you see the exit?<eos> No, I didn't.
So that means we touched bottom, right?<eos> Right.<eos> We reached bottom.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We've got a piece of fan... Bring the blueprints!<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Go check it out.<eos> Mr. Lee?<eos> You didn't see the drill?<eos> No, I didn't.
What can we do for you, Roy?<eos> We share the same goals.<eos> We want to make this right.<eos> First rule of diplomacy: gain trust.<eos> I know your playbook, ma'am.<eos> I wrote it.<eos> And here we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Madam Secretary, do you know why civet coffee isn't bitter?<eos> No, I don't.
"I Dream of Jeannie" was a show.<eos> Guy finds a genie and everybody goes apeshit.<eos> Especially that jackass Admiral Bellows.<eos> Big Roy's got a truck full of chili, but he's stuck on the ice.<eos> Sure as shooting, in the Army, they'd give him the black capsule.<eos> - The what? - Black capsule, cyanide.<eos> The astronauts had 'em too.<eos> You get stuck in orbit or captured by the enemy, you'd just bite into that thing and it's see ya soon, you big baboon.<eos> The astronauts had cyanide?<eos> They sure did.
- Amy, wait!<eos> - Amy!<eos> They were immigrants and nobody told them the history of the house.<eos> They didn't have a clue what hit them.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> So, the Chens fought back the only way they knew how.<eos> They prayed to their ancestors and they made offerings to protect them from evil.<eos> But their ancestors were no match for what was already here.<eos> I guess they never had a chance.<eos> But you do.
I'm your dad.<eos> I know I haven't won any awards in that department...<eos> This is not a referendum on you.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't there.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't a father.<eos> Okay, see?<eos> That... that right there.<eos> Why does it always go back to that?<eos> Does it ever occur to you that I have moved on?<eos> I... didn't.
I know.<eos> It never does.<eos> It must be hard.<eos> It is.<eos> She is such a bright light.<eos> A breath of fresh air.<eos> You should see how people spark up when they see her, and how happy it makes Karina.<eos> It's like she feeds off of it.<eos> If you don't operate... I'll be taking that from her.<eos> Do the surgery.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Concerned citizens don't walk around wearing battle gear.<eos> This isn't your average weekend-warrior vest.<eos> This is advanced military tech.<eos> Just like the EMP.<eos> This isn't the Inhumans.<eos> It's a setup. They're being hunted.<eos> And guess who's doing the hunting.<eos> So, how you know Robbie?<eos> I don't.
Uh, but this is for you.<eos> - "A team that trusts is a team ..."<eos> - Don't.<eos> Robbie.<eos> Hey, what's up, man?<eos> Look, uh, sorry about all the drama.<eos> - I'm just glad to see you're safe. - Me?<eos> What about you, disappearing like that?<eos> - I thought you trusted me.<eos> - Well, I do.
He bent down to check on you.<eos> And then you moved.<eos> - That's when I knew you were alive.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
It's not a mask ...<eos> it's a balaclava.<eos> Thought that was a dessert.<eos> What?<eos> No, ma...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Director just wants you to keep a low profile.<eos> There's a lot of media out here.<eos> - I don't answer to him.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Can you do a little recon up ahead?<eos> - Well, that depends.<eos> If "recon" means "look around," sure.<eos> Yo-Yo!<eos> You like playin' with fire, Eli?<eos> Let's play.<eos> Director ...<eos> Sir, i-if I may explain,<eos> I wasn't trying to fool anyone.<eos> But you did.
- Anything on Robbie? - No.<eos> His camera's all glitchy.<eos> The feed keeps cutting in and out.<eos> Going through the fire probably didn't help.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> We got something.<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> Anyone seeing this?<eos> We do.
- Hope it's not cesium again.<eos> Cesium?<eos> Is that what ignited the entry hall?<eos> Based on the spectral analysis of Yo-Yo's jacket, yeah.<eos> It's highly unstable.<eos> And pyrophoric, yeah.<eos> Reacts on contact with water.<eos> First carbon, now cesium ... it's like Morrow is testing his abilities, making his way through the periodic table.<eos> Who knows what other traps he's set?<eos> I do.
- Daisy, wait.<eos> You realize we're trying to hide you from the press, right?<eos> "A" ... I don't care.<eos> "B" ... that wasn't me.<eos> Um, guys, the problem is bigger than you think.<eos> There's something in that building everyone needs to see.<eos> The "demon core?" Seriously?<eos> - You cannot make this stuff up.<eos> - I didn't name it that.<eos> The physicists at Los Alamos did.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.
Sorry.<eos> I'm a little nervous. I've never gone out with someone I met online before, so...<eos> You're kidding. No.<eos> Well, I am on all of them...<eos> Tinder, Hinge, Holefinder, you name it.<eos> Although after tonight, I may be closing my accounts.<eos> O-kay...<eos> You want to go screw in the toilet?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
He doesn't just have people killing for him, he has them sending him pictures, evidence of his work.<eos> That is a highly sophisticated form of manipulation.<eos> The government of Hawaii has empowered us to do whatever is necessary to, uh, to catch whoever's responsible.<eos> So I need you to tell me what it's gonna take for you to come and work for us, temporarily, of course.<eos> I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm...<eos> I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.<eos> It does.
Thank you for asking.<eos> How is Mr. Walters?<eos> George is a tough son of bitch.<eos> - So is cancer.<eos> So it goes. - Yeah.<eos> Well, I have seen the place about a dozen times, but let's make it official.<eos> Right.<eos> You brought the Pope.<eos> I brought the Pope.<eos> Well, the Second City First Committee did.
There some kind of law against running?<eos> In my experience, when you run from cops, it means you're guilty.<eos> In my experience, you don't run from the cops, you're an idiot.<eos> You live six blocks from Mrs. Jeffries' apartment.<eos> What were you doing clocking what I was doing there?<eos> I don't know. I was just looking.<eos> You was just looking?<eos> Do you know Ms. Jeffries?<eos> You know anything about Ms. Jeffries?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Oh, come on.<eos> You guys didn't even smile?<eos> I did.<eos> Maybe a little.<eos> It was more out of shock than anything else.<eos> Nobody smiles in shock, Baker.<eos> Well, did you read the comments?<eos> What comments?<eos> The responses to Officer Clark's caricature.<eos> Uh, no, I did not.
No hooks on this, please.<eos> You know, in his day, Teddy was drawn as anything from a bull moose to a fishwife to a rogue elephant.<eos> I'd like to think he kept his sense of humor, too.<eos> Does the name Frankie Reed mean anything to you?<eos> Was he a friend of your father's?<eos> No, Ma.<eos> He's a con man with a rap sheet a mile long.<eos> Oh, I would never have anything to do with someone like that.<eos> Uh, you-you wrote a half a dozen checks for him for a few thousand dollars apiece.<eos> I did?
I mean, you don't know me.<eos> I'm just some stranger who sat down next to you to shoot the breeze.<eos> I don't know you?<eos> You don't remember me sitting down, do you?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> You remember offering to loan me money?<eos> No, did I?<eos> You did.<eos> You said my son's life was worth a hell of a lot more than a measly $2,000.<eos> I did?
- (applause and laughter) - Thank you!<eos> - Inspector.<eos> - Good evening, Doctor.<eos> I was wondering if I could have a word.<eos> I know it's hard to shake, but there's no shame in it.<eos> In what?<eos> Fear!<eos> You know that I've felt it;<eos> you helped me get over it.<eos> You did that yourself.
Joe Murphy.<eos> "Joe Murphy"?<eos> What was the address?<eos> General delivery at the Temperance Exchange, sir.<eos> Right.<eos> Henry, head down there and see if anyone collects that telegram.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Joe Murphy, sir.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't either, George.
- (machine beeping) - [And where are you, George? ]<eos> George: [Wilkins and King.]<eos> Murdoch: [Constable McNabb, what's your reading? ]<eos> - (McNabb): 3.4. - (tapping)<eos> [Parliament and King.]<eos> [Uh, it's, uh, Derby Street.]<eos> Did you find her?<eos> Young Molly?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
You might also want to consider what you leave on your blackboard.<eos> Molly loved Joe.<eos> But when she found out he and his family were criminals, she wanted out.<eos> More importantly, she wanted her son out.<eos> - But Joe wouldn't have that.<eos> - He tried to kill her.<eos> Molly fought back.<eos> She grabbed a knife... it must have hit the carotid artery because there was blood everywhere.<eos> From that moment, she was a dead woman unless I helped her.<eos> So I did.
I believe we have it.<eos> Are you going to ask me something?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What would be the point?<eos> We both know you didn't do it.<eos> Then why am I here?<eos> We have to blame someone.<eos> The function of the police is to attribute blame on behalf of the community.<eos> But the community doesn't particularly care if we blame the right person.<eos> Of course they do.
Oh please, call me Roger.<eos> Are we not well-enough acquainted by now, George?<eos> No, we aren't, and I don't think we ever will be.<eos> You can call me Henry.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Why thank you, Henry.<eos> I shall, Henry.<eos> So, what are we going to do this evening?<eos> We're going to ensure that Mr. Newsome doesn't come to any harm.<eos> Yes, but what do we do while we do that?
But Miss Nina Bloom is.<eos> George's sweetheart?<eos> Nevertheless, sir, many young women wear lip rouge.<eos> At this point we're simply following the evidence, George.<eos> I just don't think it's possible that Miss Bloom would be involved in something as... dastardly.<eos> If you are uncomfortable, you may excuse yourself from this case.<eos> I think I'll stay, sir.<eos> It's quite rare to see you make a mistake.<eos> Of course I buy rouge sticks.<eos> - We all do, don't we, girls?
Yes, I had Tom bring back a pair of antique<eos> Japanese katana swords from St. Louis. Ah, yes.<eos> The weapons used by the Samurai during the Muromachi period.<eos> - Oh yes, very good, Murdoch.<eos> - Do you have them?<eos> They're at home.<eos> I'll bring them in Tomorrow.<eos> Right then James, it's six o'clock.<eos> - You know what that means?<eos> - I certainly do.
Egyptians aside, the most impressive achievements on view at the fair have come into being in the last ten years.<eos> - We are in the age of invention, James. - Indeed we are.<eos> Another?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just call me Ten Tankard Tommy.<eos> Ten Tankard Tommy.<eos> Is there something troubling you, William?<eos> No.<eos> I heard James Pendrick dropped by the station today.<eos> He did.
It was just a messed-up try to announce ourselves to the neighborhood.<eos> You're a nice guy, and you... All of you... Deserve to know now, we're lousy neighbors.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're not gonna take in our trash bins.<eos> We're not gonna fix up our house.<eos> If we receive your packages, they will become our packages.<eos> We had a snake when we moved in.<eos> Where it is now is anyone's guess.<eos> And we're definitely gonna swim in all of your pools.<eos> We already did.
We're just talking.<eos> I gave you a compliment.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - Walking around in a dress like that, like you don't want attention?<eos> Look at that!<eos> I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.
I gave you a compliment.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - Walking around in a dress like that, like you don't want attention?<eos> Look at that!<eos> I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.<eos> You do.
You can't just go deposit that.<eos> I know that.<eos> I mean, you know, it's kind of a symbol.<eos> The actual money comes in a wire transfer.<eos> - Yes. - And the other money I give, money I raise, I don't just go out in my backyard and shake a money tree, you know, I work for that money... hard.<eos> I appreciate your generosity.<eos> You know that.<eos> Then show me the respect.<eos> By disrespecting the law?<eos> By doing a good friend a favor.
Again.<eos> Mm-hmm. Hate to say it, but... I did tell you so.<eos> What's your problem, Danny?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How many times have you begged me to pursue a long-shot prosecution because you wanted justice for a victim?<eos> Well, that was different, Erin, 'cause, you see, in those cases, the victim was willing to step up and take the stand.<eos> Emily Harrison was raped and beaten.<eos> She's traumatized and scared.<eos> I get it.<eos> Do you?
Stepping up for what?<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> Well, he's kind of helping me out with the Gormley assault.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> I thought so.<eos> No, I meant nice.<eos> As in, my go-to detective is working on a case for you and neither of you thought to tell me.<eos> I just did.
Sean doesn't know how to mind his business.<eos> How so?<eos> There was this fight at school.<eos> And?<eos> Well, these girls jumped a new girl in the stairwell, and they were beating her up.<eos> And you were there when it happened?<eos> The assistant principal asked for witnesses to come forward and say who started it.<eos> And, Jack, you didn't say anything?<eos> I wasn't the only one there.<eos> Well, did they?
I reached out to that NYPD lieutenant in the cabby arrest.<eos> And?<eos> Turns out he didn't have the appetite for signing the supporting deposition.<eos> They let Salem out a couple hours ago.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> From your description, it sounded like our lieutenant was just going along with the arrest, not driving it.<eos> You were right.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I had misgivings when you decided to come on the job.<eos> Still do.
There it was.<eos> There what was?<eos> You used to be such a patient person.<eos> So, pay no attention to the young man attempting the free throw.<eos> Look at the two figures in the deep background.<eos> Oh, there's no way he lived through that.<eos> This video features the same teenager as several that preceded it.<eos> Obviously, his family brought in their old film to Stone Post for digitization.<eos> So I doubt they knew what they had.<eos> Aaron obviously did.
I, um... I, uh...<eos> I took the liberty of talking to Paige.<eos> We, um... we discussed her reservations about marriage.<eos> Look, I don't know why you've decided to get in the middle of this, but, I got to say...<eos> I managed to lower her defenses.<eos> I've taken it as far as I can. But at some point in the process, uh, your absence became, you know, quite limiting.<eos> What process?<eos> She told me about the weekend getaway that you have planned.<eos> Um, sounded like a excellent opportunity to... elope.<eos> And, uh, if you do, then...
All right, we got our homework.<eos> Hi, Taylor.<eos> Chris?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Your house is way nicer than Anne Murray's.<eos> We broke in there, too.<eos> Taylor, why'd you write that song about me?<eos> I thought we had a real connection.<eos> We do.
Neither are the cops when I call them.<eos> - Whoa, okay.<eos> - Which I'm gonna do now.<eos> Okay, w... wait.<eos> - I'm dialing.<eos> - Give me a second to get my bearings, okay?<eos> Don't you think I want to know what happened<eos> - just as much as you do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you?
I don't care.<eos> It's not my problem to figure out.<eos> - I'm calling.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Lin, I'm sorry about what I said about the hobbit bed.<eos> I didn't mean that you and Katz are like those two goons.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> And we won't be,<eos> - 'cause we don't live together.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It's not my problem to figure out.<eos> - I'm calling.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Lin, I'm sorry about what I said about the hobbit bed.<eos> I didn't mean that you and Katz are like those two goons.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> And we won't be,<eos> - 'cause we don't live together.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, we don't.
Sorry that I'm like this, that he hurt you.<eos> I'm not done Jaclyn.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Stuff from my past.<eos> Blackstone broke in, left it in my car.<eos> It's old news, but it's still damaging if it fell into the wrong hands.<eos> I just want to take this guy down.<eos> A Crown Vic's an easy car to break into.<eos> Take a thumb drive, download whatever files he's got.<eos> - When do we do this?
Any ideas where we can find him?<eos> Ah, as it so happens, exactly one Brevakk registered in National City for the President's Alien Amnesty Act.<eos> I got an address.<eos> Shall I get a strike team to gear up?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Sawyer?<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Now you do.
I heard you took out Draaga.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for the tip.<eos> Yeah, I thought it would be fun to have these powers.<eos> It can be.<eos> It will be.<eos> I'm going to teach you how.<eos> I got the impression that you didn't want to spend time with me.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> I didn't.
Alien guns are bad no matter who controls them.<eos> The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms.<eos> Even if those arms are ray guns.<eos> That's what Cadmus wants.<eos> They're the ones handing out these weapons,<eos> They want us to be afraid of each other.<eos> to not trust each other anymore.<eos> Well how do you know what Cadmus wants?<eos> I...<eos> I just do.
Maybe it's just a phase.<eos> You know, maybe it isn't real.<eos> No, it's real.<eos> You're real.<eos> And you deserve to have a real, full, happy life.<eos> Okay?<eos> Tell your family.<eos> This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to you, and you shouldn't have to do it alone.<eos> - I have you.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Everything is fine, A-okay.<eos> Let's just take a seat.<eos> - Come on, there you go.<eos> - Where do...<eos> Hey, you're really tall.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> What's the emergency, Mr. Schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> Of course he did.
- Come on, there you go.<eos> - Where do...<eos> Hey, you're really tall.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> What's the emergency, Mr. Schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
I don't know what else I should have expected from a...<eos> From what?<eos> - From a Daxamite?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, but you were going to, Kara.<eos> Okay, I may have your powers but I don't have this...<eos> This innate desire to go leaping into trouble.<eos> But that doesn't make me a bad person, all right?<eos> - It kind of does.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Guardian, huh?<eos> Not bad, could have been better.<eos> Look, I want to help people, and what better says that than Guardian?<eos> You did pretty good out there last night.<eos> Taking down the Purple People Eater.<eos> Not too bad, yourself, man in the van.<eos> You want to keep on doing this, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So do you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You okay?<eos> Oh, I'm okay.<eos> Just a little nervous, you're not very good at this.<eos> Oh, well, clearly the drugs have kicked in, because you are done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> I told my mom.<eos> You did?
What was the story gonna be?<eos> Help me out here, buddy.<eos> Some corrupt undercover cop, he goes off the reservation, he gets himself shot.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Not to start a brushfire here, but if Little Jay had taken you out, what difference would any story make to you?<eos> Two years.<eos> I put myself on the line for you for two years, and you can't tell me why... why I got shot?<eos> Whoa.<eos> What makes you so sure I got answers?<eos> Somebody does.
You chose the job.<eos> Yeah, and I got shot for you trying to make my way back.<eos> I know.<eos> I saw the plaque.<eos> Do you think that I did that for me?<eos> No, I-I did that because I was trying to do something good.<eos> I was trying to do something... something for you, something for Raimy.<eos> Something that would make you proud.<eos> And I understand you've been through a lot.<eos> I do.
Don't listen to him, Father.<eos> Jafar is controlling you.<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> So, I can do what I want to you.<eos> You stay away from me.<eos> The Savior will be here soon.<eos> Oh, do you mean Aladdin?<eos> The thief with a heart of gold, or is it the heart that desires gold?<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
- It's the job, Frank.<eos> It's always the job, right? You know I get it. You know, I'm under the same kind pressure, but, Frank, it's been two years of<eos> "Daddy will be home for Christmas."<eos> He'll be here for your birthday when you're seven, or when you're eight.<eos> Maybe you just shouldn't make promises.<eos> No, I want her with me.<eos> I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me. I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
Amanda's good.<eos> I can see why you had a thing for her.<eos> Reese became obsessed with him, started stalking him.<eos> If I had known that she bought a gun, I would've told the police back then.<eos> Right on script.<eos> That's the podcast verbatim.<eos> AMANDA: Nothing further.<eos> Ms. Stefano, did you and Mike Tasker ever fight?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Every couple does.
Turns out Mike was about to blow the whistle on the team using steroids, so the coach had motive to kill Mike and Ellen.<eos> You were right.<eos> Mm. You came all the way here to tell us this?<eos> Actually, I came to talk to you.<eos> Mm, I haven't had a sip of this yet.<eos> I'm gonna go play guitar.<eos> I was impressed.<eos> That passion... that's what I first remember about you when you started at the D.A.'s office.<eos> (lightly chuckles) Look, Amanda, you don't have to.<eos> No, I do.
We better get there right away.<eos> Sure.<eos> Except the humvee's dead and the foot path is rough, but you can follow me.<eos> All right, great.<eos> We'll follow you.<eos> Get it back.<eos> Get the footage back.<eos> I need to see more.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, but it's not working.<eos> Just do it.
Cassandra.<eos> Just used a small reconstruction spell from "Merlin's Remedial Sorcery," and... well, just look.<eos> That's not Charlene.<eos> Nope.<eos> I looked her up.<eos> Her name's Corporal Victoria Moore.<eos> She worked perimeter security, had full access to the base.<eos> That's who Apep possessed?<eos> That means at the temple Apep got the pendant but Charlene got away.<eos> Of course she did.
Right?<eos> Isn't it perfect?<eos> You should have this. It looks better on you anyway.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. Thanks.<eos> That's very kind.<eos> Well, you know where we are if you want it back.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Jaclyn. I don't know why I remember it.<eos> But I do.
He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.<eos> You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.<eos> Does that help?<eos> Well, for a while.<eos> Then he comes back.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<eos> You did already know, right?<eos> No one at the office did.
Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.<eos> Does he even like lemon bars?<eos> Not really.<eos> But I'm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.<eos> Something happen at the meeting?<eos> They made me promise I wouldn't talk.<eos> And you talked?<eos> Well, now, see?<eos> You knew what was gonna happen.<eos> Why didn't they?
Um, when was the last time you saw this "Big Earl"?<eos> 1961.<eos> We were sweethearts.<eos> But I went to Havana to visit my family and to bring Earl back some cigars.<eos> Then the revolution came and the rest is communism.<eos> Earl's got people hunting him down across time and space, and I can't get a second date?<eos> Earl!<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> I recognize that swagger.<eos> She does?
Hello, Pete, have you five minutes for me?<eos> Sure, Father Gutierrez.<eos> I was just wondering if you'd had a chance to think it over.<eos> Yeah, I've thought it over.<eos> I'm not gonna press charges against Archbishop Kurtwell.<eos> Why, why not?<eos> None of the others filed charges, but at least they got plenty of cash.<eos> - And have you ever asked yourself why they took the money and I didn't?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Why didn't you?
Your Holiness, don't you feel well?<eos> No, no.<eos> Just a passing discomfort.<eos> - Should I call the doctor?<eos> - No, no, it's nothing serious.<eos> It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
I've counted.<eos> But all the world leaders from the summit are in Federal Hall.<eos> They don't want them.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Sit down.<eos> All I know is, the hostages from Federal Hall are getting too much for the terrorists to handle, which is why they want to trade them all for Boyer.<eos> You can't let that happen, Raina.<eos> But that's almost 1,700 hostages.<eos> - You don't want them rescued?<eos> - Of course I do.
You do?<eos> You're hanging around me, no spikes.<eos> I'm your teacher, you know me, I'm harmless, and you're good with teachers, aren't you, Alex?<eos> But I don't play on that side of the pool.<eos> Not with my recruits.<eos> And if you don't start doing better, next cut, you're out.<eos> For every 10 hostages you release, we'll take one foot forward with Boyer.<eos> When all the hostages have been freed, we'll fall back and leave Boyer in your custody.<eos> Come on, Raina.<eos> Don't do it, Raina.
Doesn't want you barking up any wrong trees.<eos> Thinks injustice is your weakness.<eos> Last week, you told me the CIA was better off without me.<eos> I was angry.<eos> And I'm beginning to think they want me to be so I can do their work for them.<eos> Are you?<eos> I thought you slept naked.<eos> And I thought you prayed.<eos> I haven't seen you do that for weeks.<eos> I do it.
Now.<eos> I don't think you have a choice in this matter.<eos> There's a mission I need your help with.<eos> It's an important one, and when it's done... you will see that this ship... is exactly where you belong.<eos> Henry, what are you doing?<eos> What my mom asked you to do... getting rid of these.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
I thought there was something different about you.<eos> I've never seen people work so hard at not working.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Take a look at my sweet ride.<eos> It's a minivan.<eos> I've been test driving this bad boy with this other bad boy all day.<eos> For six hours.<eos> We went through every Wendy's drive-thru in Queens.<eos> I wrote "Help me" on a napkin.<eos> But nobody did.
Just so you know, that is a flashlight in my pocket.<eos> Are we gonna talk about what happened?<eos> Max, please tell me they make really, really small flashlights that move on their own.<eos> Do you want me to lie to you or do you want me to tell you that was Han's penis?<eos> Wow.<eos> Caroline and Han are really getting at it over there.<eos> This storm is turning people on more than alcohol and low self-esteem.<eos> Even Han got some action.<eos> I don't hold hands and tell.<eos> Or maybe I do.
♪ Previously on BrainDead... ♪<eos> ♪ Previously on Gunsmoke... ♪<eos> Oh, I like him.<eos> - You do?
I'm sure you'll break the curse.<eos> Hey, it's good to have you on board.<eos> Let's give them hell.<eos> Senator, do you want me to work up a statement on the war vote?<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> About losing the war vote.<eos> We've been getting calls for a statement.<eos> We didn't lose the war vote, buddy.<eos> - We didn't?
Go to Room SRB-54, all right?<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> That's the room you were upset about for a while.<eos> I want you to pick up something.<eos> Tell them... we're ready to release it.<eos> Release what?<eos> It.<eos> And, uh, set up a press conference for me for tomorrow.<eos> Senator, do you still trust me?<eos> Do I...?
It's downstairs.<eos> That's the room you were upset about for a while.<eos> I want you to pick up something.<eos> Tell them... we're ready to release it.<eos> Release what?<eos> It.<eos> And, uh, set up a press conference for me for tomorrow.<eos> Senator, do you still trust me?<eos> Do I...?<eos> Of course I do.
Don't you?<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you're like a... total control freak.<eos> Look at this house.<eos> It's like a museum.<eos> You just can't stop cleaning things even though everything's already clean.<eos> I mean, everyone's got a little OCD, but you're like off the charts.<eos> You think you know me?<eos> Yeah, in fact, I do.
I fixed your hammer.<eos> Is there any way we can finish this in time for paintball?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mom seemed so sure we could.<eos> Hey, Dad, after we're done fixing this doorjamb, - how much work is left? - Well, God, I mean, after that, we need to, uh... we...<eos> we should probably, uh...<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I don't know how to do this.<eos> I'm not handy!<eos> She did it again. Ha!
- Me too.<eos> Son of a [bleep]!<eos> I broke my ass.<eos> She proved her point before this, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey!<eos> The DiMeos are home!<eos> I want to be clear.<eos> I did not do this.
I was pretty shook up.<eos> But in the hospital, I was trying to think of anything, and I...<eos> I've been making pickups from those idiots for years, and I recognized their shoes.<eos> So, you just went to the house, found the truck, and just drove it away?<eos> It was so easy.<eos> Then I heard about what happened to those guys, and I...<eos> I'm scared, Roger.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Yeah, Ned.<eos> You did.
- Put it away!<eos> - Detectives, what's going in?<eos> We gotta get you guys out of the building, let's go.<eos> Sorry, I can't let that happen.<eos> Look, Jackson, this is not the way.<eos> Oh, it's the only way.<eos> They poisoned my brothers!<eos> They poisoned my brothers.<eos> I gotta make sure it never happens again.<eos> Detectives, please do something.
And what's the alternative?<eos> What alternative have you got?<eos> That she stays here, a place that she has never been?<eos> A place that you would never have come to if she hadn't died?<eos> Better than spending eternity in some monstrosity just so you can show off to your rich mates.<eos> That's unfair.<eos> Is it?<eos> Mum would hate your idea.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
But also safe. Hmm.<eos> Oh! So I was making a purchase... at the Super Store and people saw, and so now people think the purchase was for you.<eos> Well, why would they think that?<eos> It just kind of played out that way.<eos> Right.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> We both do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course you do.
How was work last night?<eos> It was OK.<eos> Yeah, well, Fiona and I had a talk about you and Emma, and we're OK with it.<eos> Dad, please. No, no, no, listen. It's good to talk, especially where sex is concerned, because sex is a big deal.<eos> No, no. Seriously.<eos> Just a word.<eos> And if you're mature enough to do it, you're mature enough...<eos> Don't mind me. Don't mind me.<eos> I did not hear a thing.<eos> Yah! I did. (LAUGHS)
See, no reason you can't be stylish and covered.<eos> There you go.<eos> What is this?<eos> That's called a medieval torture device.<eos> What's a medieval torture device?<eos> Umm, it's when you want to hurt somebody really really badly.<eos> What's it doing in here?<eos> We'll go over sarcasm later.<eos> That's a thing that women used to wear.<eos> Some probably do actually still.
Well, fantastic!<eos> I will get you a draft of the script so that you can start memorizing.<eos> Oh god!<eos> Oh no!<eos> Oh, I love Halloween, so much fun, so much fun.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Oh, cool chimpbot costume!<eos> I wish they made those in adult sizes.<eos> Maybe they do.
You think?<eos> Yes.<eos> Very mature.<eos> And that's quite a sacrifice for you, no Chimpocalypse for a month?<eos> What?<eos> No, that was for Evan.<eos> He ran away, not me.<eos> I gotta say, Oscar, seeing you step up like you did there was pretty sexy.<eos> You want that candy don't you?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
I do that sometimes.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I just want to grab some clothes and shoes that I left here.<eos> Sure, yeah, okay.<eos> Hey, I'm curious.<eos> How do you know when it's time to buy a new pair of shoes?<eos> To be honest, shoes for me are whimsical.<eos> So, I heard what happened.<eos> Of course you did.
Look, you want to analyze this, or you want to put it to good use?<eos> Let's go. Wouldn't hurt if you kept crying.<eos> Okay!<eos> The first time I had sex sober I was so nervous, I had to call my sponsor before and after.<eos> I called mine during.<eos> I remember.<eos> For me, it was the first time I really paid attention to what men look like down there.<eos> I couldn't help wondering, "What was God thinking?"<eos> Maybe he was high and figured he'd fix it in the morning.<eos> Well, he didn't.
You're making drinking look cool.<eos> I make everything look cool, it's what I do.<eos> Don't you sass me!<eos> Don't you talk to me like I'm a six-year-old.<eos> Nobody told me I can't drink in front of the kid.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why didn't you tell him he couldn't drink in front of Roscoe?<eos> Because that's stupid,<eos> - and I don't say stupid things.<eos> - Sure you do.
Take your time.<eos> Put those down.<eos> Are you gonna yell at me, too?<eos> No. I think your mom's done enough of that for both of us.<eos> I just want to know how you're doing.<eos> Everybody keeps asking me that.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You know what, that's probably true.<eos> I think you are fine.<eos> You do?
Why is that?<eos> Actually, we try not to have the television on while we eat or discuss matters better left at work.<eos> I imagine it must be difficult having such important husbands-- wanting to be supportive, of course, but then at home there's things they can't talk about, even to you.<eos> It certainly can be difficult.<eos> Actually, a woman's role in the Reich is to run her house and rear her children, and they make the world look like a completely different place.<eos> Every choice that you make is no longer about your future alone.<eos> Everything changes.<eos> You said that you had a serious boyfriend out west.<eos> You didn't want children?<eos> He did.
It did not come from her, Frank.<eos> It came from an old war buddy of mine and the kind of guy who would give up his life for you.<eos> He wouldn't lie.<eos> And did he know about your day job?<eos> All right.<eos> Frank, that's fair.<eos> I wouldn't expect you to understand what I did for my family, but do not call my daughter a liar.<eos> She never betrayed you. She never betrayed any of us.<eos> And I'm here today because she asked me to come and tell you and Ed to get the hell out of this city... because she still cares about you.<eos> So I did it.
Always tomorrow!<eos> At work no one's capable of anything either, I have to order them around, same here.<eos> I'm a woman, I want to relax for once.<eos> You could at least fix the clothes-stand!<eos> Why are you staring at me?<eos> Why are you staring at me like that?<eos> Fine, I'll fix it.<eos> Sure, put the headphones on, remove yourself.<eos> I don't want to do that.<eos> But I do!
It's great that your wife is up to this, it wouldn't work for you as a monologue.<eos> I'm a pulmonologist.<eos> Pulmonologist, sorry.<eos> Do you realize that this night will cost me 600 euros per hour?<eos> That's a great way how to buy off.<eos> Six hundred euros per hour...<eos> Yes.<eos> And everyone's happy.<eos> Wait, so it means that your girl... she doesn't even want to be here.<eos> Sure she does.
Then you should have also seen that I only slept with you because of foolish nostalgia.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Why didn't you come that time?<eos> Why, why, why?<eos> Because I knew that we would live exactly the same way as my parents do.<eos> Soviet furniture — the main attraction!<eos> And those special dishes that you only use when special people arrive on special occasions!<eos> God, do you understand, do you realize that I wanted everything to be special for me all the time?<eos> Wait, you no longer believe in love?<eos> Of course I do.
Here you go.<eos> No!<eos> Bunny!<eos> You...<eos> Oh, you!<eos> My bunny!<eos> Is that a yes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't have sex with him.<eos> I didn't.
Who told you to take those shots?<eos> And what should I have done?<eos> Radioed in and asked your permission if I could take the shot in the two-second window I had?<eos> I was getting through to him.<eos> That guy's life was over even before - you went in there. - With little more time,<eos> - I would have had him in cuffs.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, I wasn't willing to take that risk.<eos> What if you'd missed?<eos> - I didn't.
I had to drink to find Aladdin.<eos> And you kiss me with that mouth?<eos> Let's get this up to Henry so he can pack the Bug before the new tenant comes.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, Hang on, hang on.<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little baby tree thing and defeat the Evil Queen.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little tree thing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What if they don't?
Get it.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Snow!<eos> Aren't you a real Prince Charming.<eos> You... You saved me.<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> May the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> If you need anything, I will always find you.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> I do.
"What's time to a pig?"<eos> That's a riddle.<eos> Or what is it?<eos> No, I hate riddles.<eos> It asks you to consider whether the baggage you carry is really necessary, or if it could just be set aside, if only you'd try.<eos> That girl you stalked. Was she a patient?<eos> Raymond showed me her file.<eos> He wanted me to see it.<eos> Thought it would scare me off.<eos> But it didn't.
Give or take.<eos> My memory of it's not the best.<eos> Did you see her after, ever, seen her since?<eos> No.<eos> And, between her and me, there was no one else?<eos> Not like that.<eos> Not like you.<eos> There was my wife.<eos> She didn't know what she was getting into.<eos> Still doesn't.
Venga, pues, pásele.<eos> Cuídate, Jackie.<eos> It's all here.<eos> How much he makes, how he cleans it, where it goes.<eos> Your cop friend will understand it, even if you don't.<eos> She said you weren't coming back.<eos> She just wanted to be the one with you.<eos> I think she gets tired, being the strong one.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
I'll be right right back.<eos> So what time did Rebecca leave last night?<eos> Well, we slowed way down after happy hour, so I let her go around 9:00.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Rebecca was a friend of mine.<eos> We met on the flight over.<eos> And?<eos> That no hooking up amongst the staff policy-- the staff work together hard to make sure Mr. Quinn believes it's working.<eos> Though it isn't.<eos> Maybe it did, in the last century.
child pornography.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Two words that together run neck and neck with child molester as the charges that bring everybody, and I do mean everybody, together.<eos> This is not a political campaign.<eos> Sometimes it is.<eos> And this is one of those times.<eos> Why did your doc back out?<eos> Can I guess?<eos> You don't have to; you know why.<eos> Yes, I do.
I wish I had been.<eos> What happened?<eos> She got hit by a car.<eos> That's not why you're here.<eos> No.<eos> She got hit by a car and she was pumped up with coke that was laced with W-18.<eos> You ever heard of that?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of that.<eos> Um... I've never tried it, but...<eos> But she did.
You didn't tell me.<eos> Tell you about what?<eos> The club, the Yakuza, and the Pon who pointed the gun but didn't shoot you.<eos> Was that Kido or Yoshida?<eos> I don't... I'm... I'm not sure what you're getting at.<eos> I'm getting at the kempeitai sparing your life instead of shooting you dead.<eos> Childan told you about that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He doesn't know anything about it, Frank.<eos> Neither do I.
So start explaining it to me.<eos> It's when I met Mr. Kido. He beat me, and he starved me, and he told me he'd kill us and everybody in the factory if I didn't agree.<eos> Agree to what?<eos> I told him things.<eos> You told him things. I...<eos> I did, but listen.<eos> It was only about the Yakuza and the counterfeiting.<eos> Most of the stuff he already knew.<eos> What did you tell him about the bomb?<eos> No, I didn't. Nothing about the bomb or Gary or Sara or any of that.
This is you! Wow. A published author.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'd...<eos> I'd love to read this. - Okay, you're all set.<eos> - Let's go to the hospital,<eos> - get you some stitches.<eos> - Oh, can I bring Bella?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No. Bella gets so nervous alone and you have no idea how hard it is to find a good sitter.<eos> I do, actually.
So, Grant.<eos> Grant?<eos> Against the advice of police,<eos> Stella has decided not to press criminal charges.<eos> I was never gonna hurt you.<eos> I was just upset, that's all...<eos> Yeah, we're looking forward, Grant, not back.<eos> My recommendation is that you voluntarily commit yourself to the Springfield facility and begin the process of getting well.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm... Look, I... I know...<eos> I do.
I mean, - he helped define modern America.<eos> - And he's able to do all this because the U.S. pardons him.<eos> He never gets punished.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, let... let me ask you a question here.<eos> If Von Braun is so important to America, why didn't Flynn just kill him?<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't you know how to knock?<eos> I did.
I understand, Elizabeth.<eos> I know some of what you've been through, but little Agnes will be here soon.<eos> And when she's here, you will need your strength.<eos> Tell me about Kirk.<eos> How long have you known him?<eos> I have worked here for nine years.<eos> I took over from my mother.<eos> She worked my entire childhood maintaining the Summer Palace.<eos> So you know him well?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
Where's my money?<eos> I'm working on it, but that amount of money takes time.<eos> "Better than he deserves."<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> You ever invented anything?<eos> You ever experience that moment of discovery?<eos> It's a revelation.<eos> And the man you shot?<eos> Will never know what that feels like.<eos> But I do.
Oh, boy.<eos> Anyway, I'm not saying be dishonest, boys, but you got to play the game, otherwise you get eaten alive.<eos> Pass the potatoes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Was up to now.<eos> Homeland Security's gonna arrest Coryna within the hour.<eos> And, uh, you want me to pull some strings?<eos> No, I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> I did.
They can't.<eos> He's an adult.<eos> What if they give him some drugs?<eos> Hmm? And get him to sign something?<eos> No. Then he'll argue that he was drugged.<eos> It's almost impossible in this day and age to gain that kind of conservatorship over someone against their will.<eos> Disinheriting someone is one thing.<eos> Having them put away is another.<eos> You don't know the father.<eos> Do you?
Well, I'm not on your team.<eos> Besides, Owen said day one there's no such thing as team in the CIA.<eos> But... how would you feel about second place?<eos> You're helping me?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I like you.<eos> And unlike everyone else, you don't lie about who you are.<eos> How are we gonna win?<eos> They told us to leave our phones there.<eos> I did.
You knew they'd listen.<eos> After nearly 15 years of being landlocked, dedicating your life in service to them, the company would do anything to make you happy, especially when it involved what, hmm?<eos> Spending some quality time with your daughter.<eos> The right turn of phrase can give an operative's connections away.<eos> It didn't take many calls to figure out it was you.<eos> All I said was that I wished I saw you more.<eos> And I do.<eos> You knew they owed you.<eos> You knew what it would mean coming from you, and worst of all, you knew it wasn't what I wanted.<eos> But you did it anyway.
I did what I had to do in the moment.<eos> Good night, Shelby.<eos> All right, Alex, tell me.<eos> Three of you went into that room.<eos> Two of you came back here.<eos> And one of you was last seen being escorted away by the police.<eos> I want to know how you pulled it off.<eos> You know what they say about a good magician.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Not how you did it.
All right.<eos> You're under arrest for possession of narcotics.<eos> Come on. Let me go!<eos> - Damn it!<eos> - Get your ass in there.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> !<eos> Rachel!<eos> Do you have any idea who you're messing with?<eos> I do.
Come on. Let me go!<eos> - Damn it!<eos> - Get your ass in there.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> !<eos> Rachel!<eos> Do you have any idea who you're messing with?<eos> I do.<eos> Detective Riggs, meet Dylan Ashworth.<eos> Now he does, too.
And you just... what?<eos> Just happened to be there?<eos> What are you getting at, Martin?<eos> This is Julian's.<eos> It's full of the names of all of his clients, and the names of the girls that are paid to hook up with 'em.<eos> Guess whose name's in here?<eos> Give me the book.<eos> All of these names are coded.<eos> How did you even know I was...<eos> - You didn't.
She's a human being.<eos> Now it is for our brother.<eos> Yes, but we have to ask her.<eos> What will you ask her?<eos> "Mind going to bed with our crippled brother..."<eos> "for a joke."<eos> Have you ever been with a woman?<eos> I will ask her and see how she feels.<eos> I know how she will feel.<eos> No, you don't.
What, you're looking for a list or something?<eos> His death wasn't accidental.<eos> He was poisoned.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Well, then you got your work cut out for you.<eos> Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> (elevator bell dings)<eos> Abbs,<eos> McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.
Oh, no, no!<eos> I just... I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater.<eos> Oh!<eos> (chuckles)<eos> But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS.<eos> Well, thank you very much.<eos> Do you want a tour?<eos> I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to...<eos> He wants to find out where the earring came from.<eos> Of course he does.
I'm not a prince.<eos> I'm just a middle schooler wearing Grandpa's tie.<eos> Now, don't sell yourself short, Henry.<eos> Never do that.<eos> You will always be royalty no matter what world you live in.<eos> And who knows?<eos> Someday we might go back to my castle.<eos> And you might be king.<eos> I kind of think I need to finish high school first.<eos> Well, of course you do.
I'm... I'm sugaring my coffee.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you do that back at the doughnut shop?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I was the sheriff.<eos> I can't... I can't let people know I take my coffee sweet.<eos> They might think I'm a little sweet if you... If you know what I'm saying.<eos> It's gay to sweeten coffee?<eos> Look, do you think John Wayne took sugar?<eos> I don't.
That was basically the same thing.<eos> I count that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just-- want us to be normal again.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> - I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why did I say that?<eos> - Why did you kiss Holt?<eos> - I didn't.
An unbelievable fighting force.<eos> We actually managed to complete that course in nine hours and 48 minutes.<eos> And that's only nine-and-a-half hours slower than the actual soldiers.<eos> Can I just ask, how many times were you shot?<eos> - What, on the run in?<eos> - On the way to the embassy.<eos> Er... 17 to the torso, two to the... plum set.<eos> And you lived?<eos> Well, obviously, James, yes, look, I lived.<eos> He did.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> And welcome to The Grand Tour, which, once again, is in Whitby.<eos> There is actually a very good reason for that.<eos> It is because these two last week blew up my house, and I literally have nowhere else to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Plus-<eos> - Plus, James May lost the tent bag.<eos> - Soz.<eos> - Yeah, he did.<eos> He did do that.
It's undriveable.<eos> You know, it's a very good point, because a racing car on the road is a bit like trying to play tennis with a cricket bat.<eos> It's technically possible...<eos> Two totally different disciplines.<eos> The only trouble is, that looks so good, I do find myself going...<eos> Mm. You erm...<eos> You bought the last GT, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.
Every country.<eos> Right.<eos> We should adopt that.<eos> - Speeding is good for you.<eos> - It's your social duty.<eos> - A bit more conversation for you.<eos> - Oh, good!<eos> I think, with the exception of Rolls-Royce,<eos> Volvo now make the best car interiors of anybody.<eos> They do.
- See, I can't...<eos> - Don't bite it!<eos> Well, I can't open the thing, can I?<eos> No, there's one of those little tear things.<eos> - Hold on, love.<eos> - I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> - No, it's...<eos> -You're not gonna be here to help me when I'm using it!<eos> - You don't know!<eos> - I bloody do!
He's ruined it!<eos> Anyway, erm...<eos> This year marks the 50th anniversary of the greatest battle in motorsport history.<eos> The story begins in the 1960s, when Ford realised that they could sell a lot more cars if they were a lot more successful on the racetrack.<eos> So they formulated a brilliant plan, but unfortunately... it went disastrously wrong, didn't it, Bob?<eos> Ford knew that if you wanted to rule in motorsport, there was only one race that mattered.<eos> The toughest and most dangerous of them all - the 24 Hours of Le Mans.<eos> Levegh's Mercedes collides and blows up.<eos> The problem was, for all its might, Ford didn't have a clue how to win at Le Mans.<eos> However, over in Italy, someone did.
This is James May.<eos> Just so you know, this is stupid.<eos> What's stupid?<eos> How would you recognise a poacher when you saw one?<eos> - And when you find one, what are you gonna do?<eos> - Shoot him.<eos> All we're doing on our journey is driving three beach buggies to the Angolan border.<eos> - Which doesn't further the cause of humanity.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And this does, does it?
Why?<eos> Because I've been dreading this date.<eos> Because I knew that you would eat that and I would eat this.<eos> And because ever since you stopped dieting, I have felt weak.<eos> Oh, no, I was weak.<eos> The other night I stuffed my face full of powdered donuts, and then I cried myself to sleep.<eos> Yup.<eos> And, listen, if you don't want to lose weight, that's fine because that's your choice.<eos> I told you that when I met you, that I couldn't fall for a fat person.<eos> But you did.
See you.<eos> I'll see you soon, William.<eos> I will go get you some cider.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> So, I, uh... I know that you and Thanksgiving have a... somewhat of a spotty past, but, um... I wanted you to know that no matter what happens this year, you're gonna make it to the pie.<eos> - Hey, Kevin.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> I was just kind of wondering if... maybe this year, I could wear the hat?<eos> - Oh, you want to wear the hat?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
And then whoever's turn it is, is going to pull on this yarn and then throw it to the next person.<eos> Okay.<eos> I am thankful... for my family.<eos> I'm thankful that we're all safe.<eos> And... there's no one in the world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> I am thankful for my family.<eos> I am thankful that everyone's safe.<eos> And there is no one in the whole world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> Grandma always says the same thing.<eos> Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
Didn't know you were so good with numbers.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Come here.<eos> What about this wall right here?<eos> How many... how many do I need for that?<eos> I don't know that one.<eos> You knew how do it a second ago, now you don't?<eos> I don't know it, dad.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I don't.
You broke her heart.<eos> And for that I am eternally sorry.<eos> You really want to help her?<eos> There is nothing I want more in this world than to find her killer.<eos> You and me both.<eos> Look, no promises, but I'll try to focus on Sarah and not talk about Oscar as much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you know you could track down the origins of an envelope if it's stamped with a Pitney Bowes postage meter?<eos> - I did not.
I have a daughter.<eos> Lucy.<eos> She's 9 years old.<eos> They just want to know about the drives.<eos> Please don't let me die in here.<eos> Don't let me miss the rest of my daughter's life.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But you believe me?<eos> You do.
You've got all your lady friends, and...<eos> Actually, I'm single now.<eos> What? !<eos> When did that happen?<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's by choice.<eos> Well, their choice, and it's not okay.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Nobody does.
He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.<eos> Yeah, he deserves to be alone.<eos> So you're back out on the dating scene now?<eos> Yeah, yeah, a little.<eos> Oh, that must be fun.<eos> How's that going?<eos> I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.<eos> Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> - But you did!
Secret informant.<eos> "Follow the money"? Deep Throat?<eos> - I know the porn one.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> He was Associate Director of the FBI, and Deep Throat was his cover name.<eos> He tips off two reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, about Watergate, breaks open the entire case.<eos> If anybody knows about this document, it'll be him.<eos> If he's such a secret informant, what makes you think he's gonna talk to us?<eos> Because except for Woodward and Bernstein, nobody knows his identity for 30 years.<eos> But we do.
Tell me it's all gonna be okay.<eos> Welcome back, Rufus.<eos> Eventful trip, was it?<eos> I've been wanting to ask you a question for 44 years.<eos> What happened that day?<eos> - 44 years?<eos> - I believe he's asking how on Earth Garcia Flynn managed to ambush Rittenhouse security back in 1972.<eos> He may suspect you had something to do with it.<eos> Why did Flynn show up at that house?<eos> Why does Flynn do anything he does?
Right now!<eos> - I'm ope-opening.<eos> Don't be stupid!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Now!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Calm down, okay.<eos> Come on! Hurry up!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Do it!
He's a solo practitioner in mostly personal injury stuff.<eos> Against the full force of the DA's office.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And she doesn't know that.<eos> But you do.<eos> Know what?<eos> That given the players, the game is rigged.<eos> A little, but that's not my problem.<eos> - You want her to have a fair trial?<eos> - Of course I do.
I-I can't imagine what it must have been like to be there when he pulled that trigger.<eos> I can't stop thinking about it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Gilford's in the lobby.<eos> I'll be right down.<eos> Gilford.<eos> As in the D.A.?<eos> - It's just lunch, Jake. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You want him on the show, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
Has he really been ruled out as a suspect?<eos> I've never seen this video before.<eos> But I certainly look forward to reviewing an unedited version.<eos> And when you do, we hope you'll come back on the show and share your thoughts.<eos> We'll be back after a short break.<eos> And we're clear.<eos> Incoming.<eos> And he looks angry.<eos> I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah.<eos> He didn't.
Never got over it.<eos> Sold my practice, you know, went into emergency psychiatry.<eos> Swore I would never get that involved in anyone's life again.<eos> Look, Sarah, it was wrong of me to dismiss your feelings for Danny.<eos> You know, my issues are my issues, not yours.<eos> Look, I really need you to trust me.<eos> Seeing him outside a clinical setting is a terrible idea, especially given the people he's involved with.<eos> But...<eos> But if you insist on...<eos> I do.
This is my first time, too.<eos> I got three of you and I'm trying.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should've been there.<eos> And I'm gonna be there, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I have a hug?<eos> Can I get a "dad, I love you"?<eos> Do you have the name of a barber?<eos> I do.
You know, I couldn't say it out loud because I loved my father.<eos> My white father.<eos> And my white mother.<eos> I'm a strong, successful, black man.<eos> My wife and i give a lot of thought to how we raise our girls, believe that.<eos> The fact that my daughter doesn't find anything unusual about her playing snow white?<eos> That's the whole idea. (Chuckles)<eos> Right?<eos> Look, i-i don't know everything, William.<eos> I don't.
5:30 a.m.<eos> Manhattan.<eos> BMT Nassau Street Line.<eos> Delancey Street and Bowery.<eos> Of course.<eos> That station's been abandoned for years.<eos> I'll call FBI S.W.A.T. New York.<eos> I'll be handling Kirk on my own, Harold.<eos> If you expect us to stand down...<eos> I do.
Oh, God, you don't do that with Harriet in the car, do you?<eos> No, never.<eos> I would never.<eos> Oh, and you can't honk.<eos> I mean, that just makes crazy people crazier.<eos> No, no honking, not ever.<eos> And when I flip someone off, I always do it below the dash, where they can't even see it.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Or maybe you don't do anything.
She's not listening.<eos> They're saying... that without the treatments, the cancer will kill you before the baby's even born.<eos> In a month, two months, you'll both be dead.<eos> I went to court to fight a traffic ticket so I could save $360 so we could buy an organic crib mattress.<eos> This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.

Hey, Tabs, I'm looking at you.<eos> - I don't want to see that.<eos> Lock that up. - Sorry.<eos> Who else wishes Max was straight?<eos> Back off, bitch.<eos> Get your own gay husband.<eos> Oh, wait, you're marrying him next month.<eos> Okay, ladies, everybody say,<eos> "I tell my boyfriend he's normal-sized!"<eos> - I do!
- We need to get the upper hand.<eos> - How?<eos> Figure out why they're keeping us.<eos> As León said, we're here for a reason, but what?<eos> How are we all connected?<eos> They could be listening to us right now.<eos> We know they pose among us.<eos> So, maybe as we speak, we'll expose them.<eos> - Why should we trust you?<eos> - Because Alex and Ryan do.
I just don't have it here.<eos> It has to be unanimous, doesn't it?<eos> If you're not feeling it, then I'm not, either.<eos> Look, unlike the rest of them, we're actual agents, aren't we?<eos> Well, I'm an officer.<eos> But the point is if a fellow officer said to me she felt her instincts were saying this was the wrong call, I would trust her on that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What?<eos> I change my vote, too.<eos> - Don't do it for me.
We're on our way to L.A., and sloppy took Randy's voucher as payment.<eos> And then rolled a nice, fat joint with it.<eos> You bet I did.<eos> - Whoa! - Ride the lightning!<eos> Yee-haw! Do it back.<eos> Let me hear you say, "Yee-haw!"<eos> I'm just glad you found me.<eos> I was about to build a hut for the night.<eos> I thought you said you didn't pick up strange men.<eos> I didn't.
But I... I don't have magic.<eos> Well, that's precisely why it has to be you.<eos> My magic can't save him.<eos> Hurry!<eos> There's not much time.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> I'm going to need it.<eos> I... I know I should be relieved...<eos> Well, no one's gonna blame you for still worrying.<eos> Gold did the right thing today.
You can't crash here.<eos> Go home.<eos> It was my room before it was yours.<eos> Go home and fix your crap.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You're freaking out because you got some sword hanging over your head?<eos> Me, too, and I can't do a damn thing about it except wait.<eos> You can fix your stupid sword.<eos> Go home and get the freaking execution over with.<eos> I did.
Transplant's the only way to save this patient.<eos> I'm removing his liver.<eos> It's only making him worse.<eos> - Scissors.<eos> - Do not make that cut!<eos> Basin.<eos> Clips, please.<eos> Boki.<eos> We decided not to list him.<eos> No, you did.
Thank you, Edwards.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry for things that I said.<eos> Ah, it's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was tired, but I have to learn to push past it.<eos> And you did.
Home.<eos> You got someone who can verify that?<eos> Am I being charged?<eos> You'll be charged soon enough.<eos> You willing to take a lie detector test?<eos> I don't got to take a lie detector test.<eos> Course not, 'cause you know it's gonna tell us you're lying.<eos> Did Diaz tell you to kill Miranda Gibbs?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you do.
We have the friends and family plan.<eos> It's peanuts to call Albany.<eos> The governor has the power to fire you. You know that, right?<eos> I read the fine print when I took the job.<eos> You want to do your job?<eos> I am doing my job.<eos> How's that?<eos> Letting him be him.<eos> As if you had a choice.<eos> He does.
What's it about then?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, growing up,<eos> I used to watch the steelers with my dad.<eos> Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...<eos> It wasn't until the 2006 afc championship when they played the broncos.<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Anyway, I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> And I did.
That hallway is crazy, man.<eos> Hi again.<eos> - Right here?<eos> - Yeah, that's great.<eos> Cool.<eos> Damn.<eos> That's a lot.<eos> You saw the wall.<eos> Well, congrats on all the changes, man, and, uh... if you ever need anything again, you have my number.<eos> - I do.
You know?<eos> Not with Kyle.<eos> I think she might be a little broken.<eos> You know, i-i think the babies might have broken my wife.<eos> You can fix her, right? Or you can tell me how to fix her?<eos> I was... I was hoping you could tell me how to fix her.<eos> Sit down, Jack.<eos> She lost a baby, Jack.<eos> You can't just dismiss that.<eos> So did I. Yeah.
How'd it go?<eos> It's bad.<eos> Nothing to be done, really.<eos> Some experimental treatments that'll give him a few more months.<eos> He's upstairs resting.<eos> Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.<eos> I have no idea how I came from that man.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I expected.<eos> Yes, I do.
What?<eos> Yeah, Kate, you're fired.<eos> Why?<eos> You're the personal assistant to your brother, all right?<eos> A brother who locks himself in his master bedroom closet.<eos> A master bedroom closet that happens to have a mini-bar in it.<eos> Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know? Just for a little while to see what happens.<eos> You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.<eos> I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.<eos> I do.
Got a dead body on a destroyer.<eos> Quinn and I are in a helo out of Andrews.<eos> QUINN:<eos> You know, I spent a year as an agent afloat early in my career.<eos> It was amazing, but would any one of you rather go?<eos> 24 hours of seasickness?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> You know, they make medication for that.<eos> Do they ever.
GIBBS:<eos> Petty Officer Brown, you're in navigation?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I worked under Lieutenant Mills.<eos> Strict.<eos> Hard worker.<eos> But she just joined the ship, sir.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I didn't know her personally, sir.<eos> None of us did.
(sighs)<eos> My brother says he doesn't know who signed on the ship as him.<eos> But he was headed up to meet me and my mom in Norfolk, so getting to NCIS headquarters won't be a problem.<eos> He's gonna keep his phone on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if he doesn't answer all of their questions, you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> Mm.<eos> It'll be a mercy killing.<eos> Not like this job wasn't hard enough before, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Yes!<eos> (panting)<eos> QUINN:<eos> Freeze!<eos> NCIS!<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> So, why don't you tell us why you boarded the ship as Stewart Baxter and filmed classified areas.<eos> I didn't.
I talked her into this.<eos> It shouldn't go on her record.<eos> Think we're gonna let this one slide.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Knowing that this was our last time together, I don't have any regrets.<eos> Well, except one.<eos> (clears throat)<eos> That I gave her a necklace instead of a ring.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.
I just can't let you embarrass yourself.<eos> I told Jake everything.<eos> He threatened to replace me, and I freaked out hard. - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I knew you would betray me.<eos> That's why I fed you fake Intel.<eos> What?<eos> The plaque was never in "Cold Cases 1972."<eos> As if I'd just put it in a box, unattended.<eos> Uh, but you did.

Polar bears are kind of overrated.<eos> Do they really need our help?<eos> I went to a zoo once, and they seemed fine.<eos> The polar bears are dying because of man's endless thirst for oil.<eos> Yeah, but if you're on a long road trip and you need a place to go inside and pee, where are you gonna go if you don't have a gas station?<eos> So thank you, oil.<eos> [Megaphone screeches]<eos> Big corporations are pillaging Mother Earth.<eos> But don't big corporations always have our best interests at heart?<eos> No, they don't.
- Yes!<eos> So I'm insulting someone's mother, animals are on the loose causing chaos in society, and the zoo is somehow charging people to leave.<eos> I'm sorry, there's just so much wrong with this, Dad.<eos> Thank you, but when it comes to talking to teenage football players, I'll take my chances with Charlie Rose.<eos> [Door opens]<eos> [Clears throat]<eos> [Humming]<eos> Boop.<eos> You didn't return them, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
- He is to us.<eos> Your prisoner's in the end stages of aplastic anemia.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> An average person has between 150 to 400,000 platelets per microliter of blood.<eos> Mr. Kirk's is under 10,000.<eos> I'd expect to see intracranial bleeding within hours.<eos> Treatment?<eos> He's been receiving transfusions for many years.<eos> If I give him another at this point, he's liable to suffer autoimmune shock.<eos> - And if you don't?
Your DNA is going to come back IDing you as Giza Barerra.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Well, I bet you know who Alejandro Medina is.<eos> See, we know that you killed his father when you took over his cartel.<eos> I wonder what kind of a tattoo he's gonna give you when he finds out that you're alive.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> You were 14 years old when your father married you to a man 40 years older than you.<eos> I can't imagine what that was like.<eos> Fathers are supposed to protect their daughters.<eos> Yours didn't.
So, I think I'm gonna need to loosen the reins a little bit.<eos> What does that mean, loosen the reins?<eos> That means... I'm done dieting, Kate.<eos> But I still support you 100%.<eos> Um... how?<eos> Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight<eos> - for me.<eos> And...<eos> - And I did.
But, you know, the only thing I did that day was nudge a man in a direction he already wanted to go.<eos> If at some point in your life, you find a way to show somebody else the same kindness that your parents showed you, that's, uh, well, that's all the present I'll need.<eos> But I sure do like this snow globe.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You know, I'll bet you that's just what my Montana cabin looks like, right this minute.<eos> It lights up.<eos> It does?<eos> Come show me.<eos> Well, would you look at that.<eos> So it does.
Okay.<eos> - Hey. - Do you know how anything works? I know you whipped and you buttonholed and you swing-setted your tail off to get all these votes.<eos> - Who did I swing-set? - Once I got the votes, I panicked.<eos> Because I realized that now I have to ask her, and what if she says no?<eos> Or worse, what if she says yes, moves in with me, and then regrets it? I wish we'd had this conversation at the beginning of the day, but yeah, I mean, I get it, it's scary.<eos> Well, tell me I'm wrong to be scared.<eos> - You know, tell me I should vote yay. - Nick, I whipped everyone's votes.<eos> I'm not gonna whip yours.<eos> But whatever you decide, I support you.<eos> We all do.
Hey! Wanna tell me why you parked there, staring at my family?<eos> I didn't mean to scare 'em.<eos> I just felt weird going in.<eos> James...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You surprised me with that text.<eos> Figured I'd do one better.<eos> Surprise you back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Did you tell them you have it for four years?<eos> Did you mention the big envelope?<eos> Did you tell them how poor we are?<eos> I even showed them a picture of our family room I had saved on my phone, but it didn't help.<eos> I made a mistake, and I missed the deadline, and I didn't renew it, and then it's all gone!<eos> It's all gone!<eos> What?<eos> No! They can't do that!<eos> Well, they did!
The middle of Fallujah would be an amazing result right now.<eos> Needless to say, it is very complicated, and we need Jiya and Mason to help us land.<eos> That is, provided they got my note.<eos> Let's say they didn't.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> Somewhere between one in a billion and impossible.<eos> How do they help us land?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Well, I do.
The Devil in My Daughter, which she says is the true story of a time several years ago when young Regan was possessed by a demon.<eos> Now, Regan, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may.<eos> Although your mother has warned me that you're a little shy.<eos> I'm quiet.<eos> Not shy.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?<eos> Since most of our viewers don't believe in demon possession, can you help me... help us... understand what you went through?<eos> I-I don't really remember it.<eos> You do.

She kept playing with it, and I told her she really should stop, but, you know, I-I was...<eos> I was the lead in the film and we-we were doing five scenes a day and I just couldn't be there every hour, so...<eos> And she... she didn't listen.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It kind of sounds like you're blaming the victim.<eos> I mean, she was just a kid.<eos> She didn't do anything wrong.<eos> She didn't ask for any of this.<eos> No, I...<eos> Of course she didn't.
I was angry.<eos> I called my dad, told him everything.<eos> Said I could solve the whole thing with a pair of scissors and a trip to Bennett's storage shed.<eos> I'm guessing that's why he tried to take the blame.<eos> He realized I'd really done it.<eos> The night of the jump, something changed.<eos> I didn't want Bennett to die.<eos> I tried to get him to call off the jump.<eos> But he wouldn't listen.<eos> He never did.
Nah. I'm a terrible dancer.<eos> You don't have to be good, you just have to be fun.<eos> I'm gonna have another drink instead.<eos> Lindsey's husband said he met you for dinner, but that Lindsey didn't show up.<eos> That's right.<eos> Can I ask you how Stuart seemed that night?<eos> He was concerned.<eos> It wasn't like her to just not show up.<eos> He called her a bunch of times.<eos> We all did.
Wrong, Frank.<eos> There's a third.<eos> He is always standing with us.<eos> Yes, our most merciful God...<eos> Whose seal of the confessional is a duty I'm charged with protecting.<eos> And that boy I am charged with protecting.<eos> Then find him.<eos> That's the duty you're charged with.<eos> Then help me.<eos> I just did.
Okay.<eos> That was fast.<eos> He said order lunch.<eos> Are you sure your friend isn't just having some fun pulling your leg?<eos> Order lunch.<eos> Appears Big Brother was watching.<eos> And look what he saw.<eos> Took a taxi.<eos> We can blow that up, get his medallion number.<eos> Already done.
All right, my stubbly friend, you and your team win.<eos> Could do without the smugness, though.<eos> It's just nice to know that people don't change.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been thinking about what you asked for, about turning Roman.<eos> I'm afraid it's a risk that we just can't afford to take.<eos> He can change.<eos> I understand where you're coming from...<eos> I do.
The one that would make me more human if it didn't kill me first.<eos> And you, it made you more human too.<eos> It made both of you more human and less me.<eos> So what you're saying is it's worse being me than being dead.<eos> Is that it?<eos> You would rather not exist than be part of my world? !<eos> As if there's something wrong with me!<eos> Is there something wrong with me?<eos> Because if there is, it's because of you.<eos> You did this to me!
Listen, Raimes, I appreciate the help, but just... why don't you just let your parents be the parents, all right?<eos> I got to handle it.<eos> Hey, I got to go.<eos> Talk later.<eos> Come in.<eos> 'Sup?<eos> What's up?<eos> Roommate not home?<eos> Look, you don't got to worry about Miracella anymore, all right?<eos> But you do.
Need to make a call?<eos> I can do that.<eos> But, uh, I'll need to supervise, okay?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Raim?<eos> Raimy!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought I told you to put your clothes away?<eos> - And I did.
No!<eos> Seriously?<eos> Emma?<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> You...<eos> You're the Evil Queen.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> I know exactly who you are.<eos> My parents banished you.<eos> Uh, no, they didn't.
We defeated the Evil Queen once.<eos> We'll do it again.<eos> Let's just focus on Henry's big day.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you two.<eos> Presenting his Royal Highness,<eos> Prince Henry!<eos> Look at him.<eos> He looks so grown-up.<eos> Do you, Prince Henry, undertake to accept the accolade of knighthood?<eos> I do.
Oh, I know.<eos> That's why I'm not gonna wish for anything to do with Emma or Snow or anyone I actually care about.<eos> No, Aladdin.<eos> The only one that's gonna pay the price is her.<eos> Genie...<eos> I wish... that the Evil Queen gets exactly... what she deserves.<eos> Aladdin, what's going on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I granted your wish.<eos> No, you didn't.
Reade and I will go west.<eos> Zapata, take Beta team east.<eos> And I want Jane, Roman, and Shepherd alive.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Weller, something's wrong.<eos> I can't reach the team.<eos> Neither can I. All right, they used Allie as a decoy to lure me away.<eos> We have to abort this mission.<eos> You don't think Jane might have...<eos> No, I don't!
What report?<eos> I gave Scorsese Miranda's accident report.<eos> So please tell him.<eos> Sorry, Riggs.<eos> There wasn't anything to indicate it wasn't an accident.<eos> What about the tox report?<eos> The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> There was nothing there.<eos> Hey, look, I know how hard this can be.<eos> No, you don't.
What's left for me now?<eos> You really feel that way, then you need to go ahead and turn that thing on yourself.<eos> Look, Riggs... we don't know yet if Flores had anything to do with Miranda.<eos> The best way to find out is to arrest him for the murders of two women we know he killed.<eos> Once we have him, we can find out the rest.<eos> What if he pleads down, or walks?<eos> If we get him the right way, and he walks, I will help you find him.<eos> I'm not asking for your help, Roger.<eos> I know.<eos> You never do.
We scheduled the first stop at this corner here.<eos> His Holiness can get out of the car, take a few minutes with the crowd...<eos> Bless a few strategically placed babies.<eos> How many undercover assets do you have on the roof?<eos> How many uniformed police officers?<eos> Do you have access to the rooftops?<eos> Have you checked the windows?<eos> Where's the intelligence officer? Why am I talking to this guy?<eos> Father Bennett, I don't tell you how to say mass... don't tell me<eos> - how to do my job.
It isn't.<eos> Or at least it isn't for me.<eos> It's work.<eos> Can we talk about something else?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good, because I had an idea.<eos> I'd like to spend some time with you in person.<eos> It's been weeks.<eos> You want me to come to Philadelphia?<eos> I don't.
Walker knocked over a rack of Cruz's fragrances.<eos> They shattered all over the sidewalk.<eos> There was still glass on the ground when I arrived at the scene.<eos> And given the fact that the, uh, murder weapon reeked of Eu De Toilette when it was recovered a day later, stood to reason.<eos> It can't stand to reason.<eos> Mr. Cruz being a witness-- that's part of the State's case.<eos> I'm confused as to why they would introduce him.<eos> Leon Walker's DNA and fingerprints were found at the scene, there was a ballistics match on his weapon, and the money was recovered in his apartment.<eos> So what Cruz saw or didn't see doesn't bloody matter.<eos> It does now.
I wasn't about to try my experiment on the fangs of a live one.<eos> But now I know.<eos> I've seen these exact same markings before.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> H-How did you even get a warrant?<eos> We looked through the trash you put out on the curb last night, Mr. Lima.<eos> We found pet store receipts that show you purchased the supplies needed to house and feed a coastal taipan.<eos> The venom from that species poisoned seven people at Arrondissement 21 and killed your friend Brian Beale.<eos> I don't even know who that is.<eos> Sure you do.
You have a very sexy... somethin'-somethin' going on, believe me.<eos> But there's a thing about you that bugged me.<eos> You walk around like you own the place.<eos> It's annoying.<eos> Mm. It's charming.<eos> Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See? That.<eos> That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
I am not scared.<eos> Maggie!<eos> Look, I appreciate it.<eos> But, um... I'm not sure this is a fight I can win.<eos> I'll fight with you.<eos> I'm touched that you want to.<eos> I really am.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look, I know a lot of you guys didn't come up in this program.<eos> But I did.
A Mr. Roper, but with class.<eos> Wait.<eos> So this place is available?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> - Oh, it's very reasonable, but, uh, there is one catch.<eos> Uh... fish don't, uh, travel well across the pond.<eos> Oh, I will be the best fish mom.<eos> Uh, really, Abby?<eos> Because growing up, they called me "The Fish Whisperer""<eos> They did not.

Come on, come on.<eos> Just get to the sexy part.<eos> That's when it got crazy.<eos> Give me an update.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Uh, our missing liquor store attendant is Victor Medina, 32 years old.<eos> Yeah, he used to be a Marine.<eos> And will always be.<eos> Medina received a Silver Star for his actions during an ambush in Afghanistan.<eos> He also did a tour in Iraq.
I can't even look at you right now.<eos> Senior, I trust you to make the right choice.<eos> McGee!<eos> You've seen my apartment!<eos> It's so tiny I barely have room for my dog collars!<eos> Apartment thing's a minefield.<eos> How you gonna decide who gets it?<eos> I was hoping you would have some words of wisdom.<eos> Nope.<eos> Abby did what?
All right, got it.<eos> You know, um, Tim, until we come to a group decision, I don't know if it's right for you to be in here.<eos> I'm just getting some specs for Delilah and I in case we're lucky enough to get the place.<eos> We've got to get this group meeting on the books.<eos> You know, Mr. DiNozzo, I was gonna tell you, I don't think anyone is gonna willingly give this place up.<eos> Think you're gonna have to make a decision.<eos> Which reminds me, there's something I wanted to tell you about.<eos> Oh. What is it?<eos> I finally proposed to Delilah.<eos> Oh. You did?

He was invited to address the United Nations.<eos> He spent almost two hours explaining his Third International Theory.<eos> And also demanding an investigation into the shootings of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King.<eos> When he was in New York, Gaddafi was offered a tent, just like the one he had at home, in the gardens of a grand mansion.<eos> The man who made the offer was Donald Trump.<eos> TRUMP:'I've dealt with everybody.<eos> 'And by the way, I can tell you something else!<eos> ' What?<eos> 'I've dealt with Gaddafi.'<eos> What did you do?
_<eos> Remember when I had the stomach flu a few weeks ago?<eos> To clarify, Xo didn't have a stomach flu a few weeks ago.<eos> She had a medication abortion, which caused cramps, which she told her mother was a stomach flu.<eos> Oh, yeah, didn't I tell you I went to the doctor?<eos> No.<eos> Whoa, wallpaper.<eos> _<eos> Yes.<eos> Done.
Yes.<eos> Done.<eos> Used to it.<eos> Any tantrums today?<eos> So many tantrums today.<eos> I, uh... It's my fault.<eos> I know I'm supposed to ignore him, but... he just throws down at the worst times.<eos> I know.<eos> He does it to me, too, but listen, I called the pediatrician.<eos> You did?
To take us back?<eos> Only if you want us to.<eos> I just want to make sure that... that everyone is okay, and that being out here is what everyone really wants, that's all.<eos> But I'm going to need your help... to find them.<eos> I know who you're looking for, but I don't know where he is.<eos> You mean Logan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Logan.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> None of us do.
- No, we don't know that.<eos> - He fucked us over.<eos> We don't know that. He just told us not to contact each other and lay low for a while.<eos> That does not mean that we can't be there...<eos> - ... for each other.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Garrett, shut up! Just shut up.<eos> You son of fucking bitch.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. You smoked our shit, didn't you?<eos> Yes, you did.
Wait...<eos> Wait, where are you from again?<eos> Washington, just outside of Olympia.<eos> And you don't know who Rihanna is?<eos> Do you have the same number for Garrett that I have?<eos> I have to let you know, I don't have his number.<eos> I don't even know Garrett.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't know who Garrett is?<eos> I don't.
Don't you want to be worshipped?<eos> Don't you want to surrender again?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> Yeah, I understand that man, but... half the people on that bus had no idea what you were doing.<eos> There's people on there that thought they were going to a fucking supermarket, and we all ended up on a beach... - Everybody on that bus had been warned.<eos> You knew what was happening.<eos> You knew what was happening,<eos> Garrett knew what was happening, all of them knew what was happening.<eos> But they didn't.
What do you want?<eos> I was looking for someone.<eos> The door was open.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> My girlfriend's gone missing.<eos> She left. I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you know where she went?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I'm her friend.<eos> Jessica.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm on the show with Kylie.<eos> We just wrapped season two.<eos> "Show"?<eos> What show?<eos> You guys are on a show together or...<eos> You didn't know Kylie stars on a show?<eos> Actually, no, I actually do. Um...
Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry!<eos> I can't believe I Googled the wrong Spencer Davis!<eos> Yeah, I mean, you know, anyone could have done it.<eos> Do you think he'll forgive me?<eos> It's... it's just how you went on about his wife.<eos> - Don't remind me.<eos> - Who had died...<eos> The other Spencer Davis had a very contentious divorce.<eos> You called her a bitch.<eos> No, he did.
I got to say, you put on one hell of an act.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Did you really think you could go on national television and no one would dig into your story?<eos> I know about you and Miguel Ortiz.<eos> Your daughter worked?<eos> She made the money so you wouldn't have to?<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> I swear, I don't know what happened to her.<eos> - I don't know who took her.<eos> - I do.
Oh, that was rough.<eos> Anyway, what's your poison?<eos> I got a full bar.<eos> Oh, I'm easy.<eos> Whatever you're having.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Now, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Listen, I am not here trying to cause any problems.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how you knew Sarah Keaton.<eos> I don't.
- Go.<eos> - See you.<eos> Hey, kiddo!<eos> Come here, you.<eos> God, you were so good.<eos> Did you see my double?<eos> You had a hit?<eos> I had three hits.<eos> I'm just kidding you.<eos> Of course you did.
Just let the guy keep my name.<eos> You need to fix that.<eos> Eh. Actually improved my credit.<eos> Look, if you really want to avoid drama at a family event, there's only one play.<eos> Hide out in the kitchen.<eos> But my mom's in there.<eos> It's the epicenter of drama.<eos> Which is why you and I will be taking over the cooking.<eos> Oh. Likey.<eos> Don't do that.
We got to find markings or indentations or anything to reveal a w...<eos> Riggs, What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> What?<eos> I found the weak spot.<eos> What are you do...?<eos> Don't-don't you dare.<eos> - What, don't do what?<eos> Don't do...<eos> - Riggs.<eos> - Don't do...
Those dealers then send the money to the Hongs in U.S. dollars.<eos> The Hongs use that money to make... bunnies.<eos> Which they then ship to...<eos> I am a souvenir vendor in Baja.<eos> The bunnies are sold for pesos which are then sent back to Juarez to make more drugs.<eos> So, you were never after the drugs.<eos> It's always been about money laundering.<eos> Which the Hongs are the key to.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry... they were... until you guys scared them off.<eos> Except they didn't.
That alarm just sent every guard on this floor to this room.<eos> We're not the ones stealing the item.<eos> We're the distraction.<eos> - Just throw the knife out.<eos> - I can't!<eos> Someone saw me at the precinct.<eos> An old coworker.<eos> At any moment, the lab is going to realize that the knife is missing, and when that happens, I will be screwed.<eos> You should have thought about that before you decided to steal evidence.<eos> I did!
it's my shift, so... Wow.<eos> These are really good.<eos> - She made these? - Right?<eos> - Mmm.<eos> - Just watch out for eggshells. Oh.<eos> I didn't mean it when I said that I didn't care.<eos> I want you to be here.<eos> So take shifts as much as you can.<eos> Well, it's... it's okay. You know, I get it.<eos> No, I actually do.
All right, now that's soothing.<eos> Look, I-I get it, this is still my room;<eos> we haven't really made it yours. Thank you.<eos> Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger.<eos> Put it anywhere you like.<eos> Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.<eos> I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here.<eos> Decorate it any way that makes you happy.<eos> Do you really mean that?<eos> I really do.
- A few partials.<eos> - Maybe we'll get lucky.<eos> Closest neighbor's a mile off.<eos> - Nobody noticed anything.<eos> - 'Bout local PD?<eos> They know everything about who owes who money.<eos> There's a manager of the water department who's cheating on his wife.<eos> But as far as a blue truck or any strangers lurking around or suspicious activity, we got nothing.<eos> None of our vics have any connection to this area.<eos> - Maybe the Nightingale does.
How'd you get in the attic?<eos> I installed their security system last Fall.<eos> And while you were at it, you just thought you'd slap up a couple of your own... personal cameras?<eos> So what really happened?<eos> Did Johnny figure out that you were filming, threatened to call the cops, so you killed him?<eos> No. Nobody knew what I was doing.<eos> Oh.<eos> Why did you send that sex video to "Louise Herrick Live"?<eos> Why?<eos> I did the security installation at that house, for cost.
Fights between the roommates, unwanted guests, drugs...<eos> Anything that might point the finger away from Maya and towards another suspect.<eos> This is gonna take days.<eos> I suggest you grab yourself a paralegal.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> Jake, uh, Johnny Weston's father is here?<eos> He says you called him.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, he knows we represent Maya, right?<eos> He does.
I did.<eos> I offered him to wait in here, but he claimed to prefer the stoop.<eos> I don't think he likes me.<eos> I have a feeling it has more to do with the... pervert family tree.<eos> So, did you get everything you needed at TrueRomantix?<eos> Almost.<eos> There's no record of Damien Novak having been a customer there.<eos> Perhaps our predator- predator lured him on a different dating site.<eos> So we still don't know who this guy is.<eos> We do not.
Obviously, I didn't know.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that man.<eos> We believe you.<eos> Whoever killed him knew what he was.<eos> They laid in wait.<eos> You'd have to be an idiot to rent a room in your own name and then blow a guy away outside of it.<eos> That said... you kept things from us.<eos> It makes us wonder what else you kept from us.<eos> Maybe you saw or heard something.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Thanks, Jake.<eos> Jake, you done good, kid.<eos> Glad I took you along for the ride.<eos> Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! All right, give it up for Charles.<eos> Yeah!<eos> No, give it up for the devil sticks.<eos> - They're the real heroes here.<eos> - No, they are not.<eos> No one thinks that. All right, I'm not sure how much time we have, but anybody know a joke?<eos> Oh, I do!
I-I get it. I'm... I'm better in clothes.<eos> Not what I meant.<eos> But it occurs to me... I did see you nude, and it was rude of me not to comment.<eos> Yeah, well, the silence was deafening.<eos> A long-overdue kudos.<eos> Here, have a cupcake.<eos> They say "Kenneth."<eos> And I say Kenneth is great.<eos> - Got a "K."<eos> - It does, yeah.
Great idea, right?<eos> I mean, I'm the only person who doesn't have a tattoo, so then I thought...<eos> My spawn.<eos> So, she...<eos> Andrew Barton, right there. I...<eos> I didn't even think to check, you know?<eos> By the time I realized something, I was in a spider web.<eos> Yep.<eos> I told you to look in the ledger.<eos> No, you didn't.
Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists.<eos> And, here, it does so in abundance.
Well, I call me that.<eos> I'm hoping it catches on.<eos> I was wondering what you thought about one of my cases...<eos> First Essex Bank Heist.<eos> Yes, I read that one.<eos> They got robbed the day before their grand opening.<eos> I never solved that one.<eos> That bothered me for 20 years.<eos> But I see that you wrote a note here that says,<eos> "Contractor did it, so obvious."
Yep.<eos> We realized we never checked the daughter's alibi.<eos> She wasn't at the softball trip, she had access to the plans, and then she just confessed.<eos> That's right. We arrested a woman today because we are feminists.<eos> So, does this mean you like each other now?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Jury's still out.<eos> - Uh-oh. - Doesn't matter.<eos> It only matters what Amy thinks, and apparently she loves you.<eos> I do.
You'll keep searching.<eos> In the meantime, I must leave for council in repton.<eos> I cannot ignore my duties just because one man has illegally entered my kingdom.<eos> He is not just one man!<eos> He is the history of his race, father.<eos> He is the face of the enemy we must always fight, always overcome.<eos> And if we are the lambs of god, then he...<eos> He is the eternal wolf.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> You didn't.
Check him out.<eos> You know people,<eos> Angus.<eos> Find out who he is, where he comes from.<eos> Please.<eos> All right.<eos> I can see you're upside-down about this.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> Got something for me?<eos> I do.
Getting anything wrong, just correct us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I promised.<eos> Who?<eos> What'd you promise?<eos> Donald can never, ever know!<eos> Know what? !<eos> That his mother and I were lovers.<eos> Did he just say what I think he said?<eos> Yes, he did.
Did he just say what I think he said?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Go on.<eos> We became an item in the '90s.<eos> But Bubbles made me swear to never, ever say anything to Donnie.<eos> Bubbles?<eos> I was 25 years her junior and not English, and for Victoria, that was scandalous.<eos> If you and Ducky's mother were such a hot item, why did she take out an ad in the paper looking for an old fiancé?<eos> She didn't.<eos> I did.
But... thank you for not complaining.<eos> I know it's not the same without your dad.<eos> Just... I can't believe he's gone.<eos> You might not ever.<eos> I still wake up every morning, and I think the same thing about my dad.<eos> Hello, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Do you have news about my father's case?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unfortunately, I do.
Thanks for all the good times.<eos> Godspeed, Mr. Madison.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> This is really hard.<eos> Oscar, it's okay.<eos> Take your time.<eos> Dad, I'm really gonna miss you.<eos> I hope that wherever you are, the New York Mets are on and it's always the '86 World Series.<eos> I loved being your son.<eos> I still do.
Is that really true?<eos> So, do I just wash my hands of him?<eos> Like Pontius Pilate?<eos> Well, I have no doubt Aelle will enjoy the sight of your death.<eos> I'm sure he'll make it a big spectacle.<eos> So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.
- What are you doing here? - I need to speak to him.<eos> Privately, if you don't mind. Connor, this is her apartment.<eos> Chivalry.<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> I won't take long.<eos> - Are you drunk?<eos> Yes.<eos> I ever tell you my mother used to... clean houses?<eos> I'd watch her wrestle that octopus of a vacuum cleaner of hers and I just wanted to help her. I just... I thought I could invent a better one than that.<eos> - And so I did.
And who are you people?<eos> George, John, Robbie.<eos> We're Ellie's brothers.<eos> You guys must be Tim and Alex.<eos> Yes, yes. How you doing?<eos> Good to meet you guys.<eos> Bishop's talked so much about you.<eos> It's good to put faces to the names.<eos> So, work with our sister?<eos> I do.
Who altered them?<eos> I did.<eos> Well, congratulations, you just got downgraded to a flea on a gutter rat.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I was ordered to do it.<eos> By who?<eos> The defense firm I worked for.<eos> We were told to help prolong the confinement of detainees who refused to produce Intel vital to the War on Terror.<eos> And how do you sleep at night?<eos> I didn't.
No.<eos> Armed Forces Interfaith Association.<eos> We pulled the same records and found over $250,000 in withdrawals earmarked for local charities.<eos> Yeah, and we checked with the charities, and none of them have received the donations.<eos> Who made the withdrawals?<eos> The primary account holder:<eos> Gareth Bainbridge.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Agent Quinn, did we have an appointment?<eos> We didn't, no.
The network would have understood.<eos> The father was Ronald Teller.<eos> The chairman of the network.<eos> That's why I couldn't say anything.<eos> Because what you're thinking, everyone else would have believed...<eos> That the first female to solo anchor the news slept her way to the top.<eos> Well...<eos> Ronald had been harassing me for years.<eos> - You know his reputation.<eos> - I do.
There are dozens of people who saw me there.<eos> Not from 8:05 to 8:57.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about their electronic scoring system.<eos> You sat out a full round of bowling.<eos> You left the bowling alley for 54 minutes.<eos> That's plenty of time to drive back to the house, kill Johnny, and return to the bowling alley.<eos> That is insane!<eos> Tell her that I did not kill Johnny.<eos> He didn't.
But you weren't thinking straight, Dana.<eos> You... You were upset... clearly. The...<eos> The pressure of being back on air, you know? The...<eos> The pills you may have taken to calm your nerves.<eos> You're not my lawyer, Jake.<eos> You represent my daughter.<eos> You know, given what you just admitted to, you are the one that needs the lawyer.<eos> Now, look, Dana, I-I get it.<eos> You confessed because you want to help Maya.<eos> So do I.
I wasn't sure how we would...<eos> You know, sin...<eos> I'm sorry, this is a little awkward.<eos> Awkward?<eos> No, it is goo... d.<eos> Good as gold.<eos> The gold medal of friendship... - goes to us. - Oh!<eos> I don't know where to look.<eos> Okay, well, have to get back to work.<eos> You do that.
Where you been?<eos> At home.<eos> Playing cornhole.<eos> Melissa, you've been gone for two days now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't leave, I'm in the elevator!<eos> Where's my bullets?<eos> Where'd I put 'em?<eos> Well, why were you shooting off your gun?<eos> I didn't.
♪ Blue Bloods 7x10 ♪ Unbearable Loss Original Air Date on December 9, 2<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Reverend.<eos> Commissioner.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> I'm still waiting for it to sink in.<eos> I'm not sure what I'll do when it does.<eos> You'll try to deal, help the others to deal.<eos> Not sure I have it in me.<eos> Did you?
You look nice, too."<eos> Oh, confident!<eos> Ah, so she has to be right next to you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Stay in character.<eos> And you're watching the movie.<eos> You had me at hello.<eos> Claire is eating her olives.<eos> I don't like olives.<eos> Claire does.
Well, actually I got a little sick.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I'm sorry to hear that, man.<eos> Yeah, "Bullets over Broadway" was on TV.<eos> And I came down with a big ol' Dianne Wiest infection.<eos> Like "yeast."<eos> So I'll coordinate with the transit cops while you follow up with the DA's off...<eos> Uh, can I help you,<eos> - Oh, hey, uh, did you guys see a black backpack sitting around anywhere?<eos> - I did not.
Why?<eos> What's in the backpack?<eos> Uh, just some evidence.<eos> Do you guys know - a drug dealer named Flaco?<eos> - Oh, yeah, he's a big-time supplier, consolidated half the territory in Brooklyn.<eos> Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine...<eos> I'm not good with sizes...<eos> and a cell phone.<eos> And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now.
I'm Charles, from being on hold, and I want my package.<eos> Yeah, I already told you, that package isn't here.<eos> Well, I made a sacred promise to my son, and you're not gonna make a liar out of me, so why don't you take another look?<eos> We'll wait.<eos> 'Cause we've got all... Night... Long.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but... I'm a cop.<eos> So maybe this time, don't lie to me.<eos> Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.<eos> Well, now you do, genius.
You're closer!<eos> Open the door!<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Teddy.<eos> Hi, Oscar.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Teddy, this has gone far enough.<eos> I want you to come home.<eos> You do?
There is one thing I would like.<eos> Yeah, take whatever you want.<eos> I would like to keep... the official flag of our apartment.<eos> But you don't even like flags.<eos> Yeah, I like this one.<eos> But I designed it.<eos> But you made me order it because you were "too well-known"<eos> in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.<eos> But you don't even understand its symbolism.<eos> Oh, I do.
You fell, you fell asleep.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> I know that Benson Durant did not maintain his security cameras outside his meat shop.<eos> They were all down.<eos> But I noticed there were shops on either side that had working cameras, so I called them and asked them to send me footage.<eos> And you checked for albinos?<eos> Well, until I fell asleep.<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> I did.
Sherlock says he knows a little something about genius, and that...<eos> "No truly exceptional intellect would knowingly submit flawed work."<eos> Now, the FDA has consistently ruled that if two products are genetically identical, then they're legally the same thing.<eos> Even if one's natural and one's grown in a lab.<eos> Now, Pereya obviously knew that.<eos> So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.<eos> You think someone doctored Pereya's work?<eos> Sherlock does.
That's right, in math we use symbology and formulas to get to derivatives and absolutes.<eos> - It's the exact same thing as magic.<eos> - How is that even...<eos> It is different!<eos> It is dangerous.<eos> You know what people thought was dangerous?<eos> Fire, technology, chemistry.<eos> Yeah, they thought they were all magic until they learned how to use them properly.<eos> You don't know how to use magic.<eos> You don't, all right?
Olafsson!<eos> Olafsson!<eos> Okay. Hey! Hey!<eos> I've known Finklestein for 10,000 years.<eos> I know him better than anybody else here.<eos> So if you're him, you need to convince me.<eos> First question, how come I didn't know you had a sister?<eos> Olafsson, come on.<eos> You knew I had a sister.<eos> - No I didn't.
Olafsson!<eos> Okay. Hey! Hey!<eos> I've known Finklestein for 10,000 years.<eos> I know him better than anybody else here.<eos> So if you're him, you need to convince me.<eos> First question, how come I didn't know you had a sister?<eos> Olafsson, come on.<eos> You knew I had a sister.<eos> - No I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
We've been friends so long I don't have to ask these stupid questions.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, what were we doing last time we saw each other?<eos> God, who can remember that?<eos> It was 150 years ago, which would have been the cholera outbreak in London!<eos> You wouldn't have missed that.<eos> You love plagues!<eos> Who doesn't?
We've been friends forever.<eos> Since we were kids... little frost giants just causing trouble.<eos> Olafsson and Finklestein.<eos> Finklestein and Olafsson.<eos> Uh, we were never friends!<eos> You were always jealous of me.<eos> The Viking warriors always paid more fealty to me because they liked me better, and that made you crazy.<eos> Well, you bribed them!<eos> You said they'd cross oceans if they prayed to you.<eos> - They did!
It wasn't real.<eos> I mean, the things he said to me, just... he just wanted to get me out of the way.<eos> I could tell.<eos> Perhaps he wanted you out of the way so he could take out a rival.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't do this.<eos> But how do you know that?<eos> I just...<eos> I just do.
I remember seeing this guy once... in Dr. Krieg's waiting room.<eos> It was a couple of weeks ago.<eos> He was older than me. 20s, maybe.<eos> He was in real bad shape.<eos> Shaking, sweating.<eos> Hunched over, like he had a stomachache.<eos> I just thought he was sick.<eos> So now you're wondering if this was an addict who was in withdrawal?<eos> Well, Dr. Krieg told him to leave.<eos> And he did.
And they are trapped by circumstance... or by things that have happened in the past.<eos> And then there are people without the privilege that we have and they feel threatened because they love a person who the world has decided that they shouldn't love.<eos> It's wrong.<eos> Terrible.<eos> Kala, Kala...<eos> I think I know what's going on.<eos> You do?<eos> I, uh... talked to your mother.<eos> You did not tell her that we haven't had sex yet.<eos> I did.
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?<eos> You want to help me... Milton?<eos> Just tell me where you are.<eos> Well, I'm right here, Will.<eos> Same place we are.<eos> Nowhere.<eos> There are standard procedures for bringing in a new sensate.<eos> You're a cop, Will.<eos> You understand procedure.<eos> I do.
- No?<eos> You have something good... and beautiful hidden inside of you.<eos> Just as I have something dark and wicked inside of me.<eos> We're perfect for each other.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
A token of my respect and gratitude.<eos> You did this city a huge service and it was high time someone said thank you.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What...?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.

Where is she?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I only slept there each night.<eos> It wasn't my real home.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She isn't here.<eos> She isn't here.<eos> Hey.<eos> You see me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Go around!<eos> We'll attack them behind the portal!<eos> Take care of him.<eos> We should leave.<eos> We save as many of our people as we can.<eos> It's the loneliness that makes us weak.<eos> Khadgar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to save us all.<eos> I always did.
Oh, baby!<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> Hi, Mommy.<eos> Hi, Daddy.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> It's okay, Mommy.<eos> Griffin saved me.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Better.<eos> Come on.<eos> The house is clean.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She's gonna freak.<eos> "This house is clean."<eos> It isn't though.<eos> Of course it is, sweetheart.<eos> You helped the spirits go into the light.<eos> But they didn't.
I didn't know that.<eos> Shut up and keep flexing your crazy fingers!<eos> - I told you he would be a disaster!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> And one more thing, Mr. Three-Day Beard Boy.<eos> Stay away from Allison Ng!<eos> We've got six and a half years invested in her.<eos> She's part of Hillary Clinton's Star Guard.<eos> Know what that is?<eos> Well, neither do I!
Room clear!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Do you live here, sir?<eos> - Do you live here?<eos> - This is my studio.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Linus Harp.<eos> Do you know who occupies the opposite studio?<eos> No...<eos> No one does.
I don't know the model.<eos> T-1000.<eos> Liquid metal.<eos> Shape-changer. It just needs to touch something to mimic it.<eos> You know about terminators?<eos> And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You can do this.<eos> A straight line.<eos> You just go, and you don't look back.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> In a past I shouldn't remember.<eos> But I do.
understand.<eos> I'm sorry, John.<eos> That thing won't hold him for long.<eos> Come on!<eos> Reese!<eos> Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.<eos> We need to get him back!<eos> He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.
That part was actually a lie, - obviously.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> So what did they want to know about Stevie and I?<eos> If I'd seen you commit any crimes.<eos> And drugs.<eos> They think you're selling a lotta drugs.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And what did you tell them?<eos> That you didn't.
Sol know him,<eos> I know that he knows that it would be crazy for him to get mixed up in anything that Jimmy does.<eos> It's, you know, too brazen.<eos> I'll ask you again.<eos> How come no one has done Whitey Bulger?<eos> He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones, that kinda stuff, and, uh...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
I'm telling you we can't taint one of the most successful. RICO prosecutions in the history of the Bureau just to get Whitey Bulger, psychopath or not.<eos> But we have no objection to your going after the agents handling him.<eos> Can't you see what's happening?<eos> The vise is closing on us.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Did you know it was Hampton and Dawson that hit that National Bank on Exeter?<eos> No.<eos> And neither did I, until Whitey Bulger told us.<eos> - Whitey didn't tell us that.<eos> - Yes, he did.
What happened?<eos> You did this.<eos> What happened to my man?<eos> What happened here?<eos> I was just playing with his gun and it just went off.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. - You did this.<eos> - You did this. - Relax, relax, relax, relax!<eos> You did this!

Come.<eos> Push it.<eos> - Push it. - Do it.<eos> Come, Agu, come.<eos> Put it here.<eos> Here!<eos> A-ha!<eos> A-ha!<eos> Wanna kill Commandant?<eos> Do it, Agu.
But an ill-married couple can also bring down a ship.<eos> Are you married, Mr. Melville?<eos> - I am.<eos> - God have mercy on you.<eos> First child on the way, too.<eos> So, does your good wife know that you've brought all you have in the world here tonight and given it to a stranger?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You're full of surprises, aren't you?<eos> So, the Essex did not return to port.<eos> She did not.
And you've never told anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Not even your wife?<eos> Do you think she could ever love me if she knew the abominations I had committed?<eos> Yes.<eos> She would.<eos> And if you had told me the story when we met, I would still wear your ring today.<eos> The strength of that boy still lives in you.<eos> I see that.<eos> Even if you don't.
What happened?<eos> Did we abort?<eos> Uh, I don't think that we went anywhere.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Johnny?<eos> Guys, can you hear me?<eos> I made it.<eos> Ben. Look at this place.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> We did it.
I'm not your friend.<eos> You turned me into something else.<eos> Nice work, Ben.<eos> Hey, Reed.<eos> Look I'm sorry but I didn't have a choice.<eos> We need your help to finish the gate.<eos> It's the only chance we have to figure out what happened to us and reverse it.<eos> You really think that they care about us?<eos> You know how they've used Ben.<eos> Yeah. I do.
When your world is destroyed and I'm all that's left then, it will be enough.<eos> Always so smug, thinking you were smarter than me.<eos> I am smarter than you.<eos> Now!<eos> Hey!<eos> It's clobberin' time!<eos> This better work.<eos> Let's get the hell outta here!<eos> While the world may not know what you did to save it, the men and the women in this room do.<eos> And so does the president.
- Hey, don't hit your old man.<eos> - I don't wanna be a part of this.<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> - This is how accidents happen.<eos> Dad, let go of me.<eos> Stop. Why did you do that?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Come on. I was just fooling around.<eos> - That wasn't fun.<eos> - Like we always do.
- I don't wanna be a part of this.<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> - This is how accidents happen.<eos> Dad, let go of me.<eos> Stop. Why did you do that?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Come on. I was just fooling around.<eos> - That wasn't fun.<eos> - Like we always do.<eos> We never do that.
I don't wanna die!"<eos> Sorry, hang on a second.<eos> I'm getting a call from my fiancée here.<eos> Just got engaged two weeks ago, so I think I'm gonna take this... or the river's not gonna be the only hot water I'm in today.<eos> River's actually very cold.<eos> Hey, boo.<eos> - Wow, this is awesome.<eos> We're about to set sail through one of America's greatest aquatic treasures.<eos> - Kevin, don't hit your brother.<eos> - I didn't.
We got to be safe around here.<eos> Half-pipe?<eos> I know it's taking up a lot of the yard, but it's gonna make your house the coolest place in the neighborhood.<eos> I got a sound system, we got a couple Go-Pros. That's Corey from Red Bull over there.<eos> Hey, Corey!<eos> You got a sponsor for my backyard?<eos> Hey, Mr. Mayron!<eos> You want next?<eos> Nicholas, please, it's Dusty!<eos> And, yes, I do.
He did. I saw it.<eos> He said they taught him to hit girls. No, no.<eos> We thought your daughter was a boy.<eos> - What? - No, what he means is that Dylan told us that a fourth grader was picking on him, but he didn't tell us it was a girl.<eos> Yeah, and if you had, we'd have told you it's never okay to hit a girl.<eos> And that she's probably only bugging you because she likes you, buddy.<eos> I do not like him.<eos> I think she likes him.<eos> Gross, whatever.<eos> She totally does.
No, I'm just evaluating right now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for coming in.<eos> Bye, Jared.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> He's playing us.<eos> He's playing us. He's got too much skin in the game and he's dumping his position.<eos> What if he's right?<eos> You want him to be right.<eos> Yes, I do.
Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble.<eos> Actually, no one can see a bubble.<eos> That's what makes it a bubble.<eos> That's dumb, Lawrence.<eos> There's always markers.<eos> Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring.<eos> That means the homes are debt, not assets.<eos> So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.<eos> Well...<eos> Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying<eos> "Ben Rickert" and "dirty bomb" in the same sent...<eos> - Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> - I'm sorry, dude.<eos> Ben Rickert.<eos> Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?<eos> It's Charlie.<eos> I'm here, too.<eos> Hi, Charlie.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.<eos> Please explain that to me.<eos> There's no way that makes sense.<eos> There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.<eos> Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?<eos> Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless?<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did.

But they're all taking the ratings at face value.<eos> So they're charging pennies on the dollar a bet against the AA's.<eos> Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns...<eos> No one on the planet's betting against AA's.<eos> The banks will think we're either high or having a stroke.<eos> They'll take every dime we have to offer.<eos> Kinda brilliant.<eos> This is what we did that no one else thought of.<eos> Not even Baum or Burry thought to short the AA's.<eos> But we did.
- Charlie.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop.<eos> What?<eos> Do you have any idea what you just did?<eos> Come on.<eos> We just made the deal of our lifetimes!<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> You just bet against the American economy.<eos> Fuck, yeah, we did!
Mark, can we sell now?<eos> The fund will make almost $1 billion.<eos> You'll clear $200 mil, Mark.<eos> You know, once we sell, we'll be just like the rest of them.<eos> You know that.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> We're not the bad guys here.<eos> We didn't defraud the American people and prey on their dreams of owning a home.<eos> All right?<eos> They did.
They tried to put him down, but he was under my command so I took the blame.<eos> Two scars across my back as a reward.<eos> You both have marks on your neck, but they're slightly different.<eos> The brand of the Splicer.<eos> Marcellian Cahun was her name.<eos> She loved bees.<eos> My father would be freaking out right now.<eos> Do you know what this will do to people when they find out the truth?<eos> I don't think that most people would want to know the truth.<eos> I do.
There are various levels of usefulness and quality, but this is the most pure and most valuable solution made by the House of Abrasax.<eos> Kalique came out of a bath...<eos> Naturally, my sister didn't explain what it is or where it comes from.<eos> It comes from people.<eos> Each unit is refined from approximately a hundred human beings.<eos> What?<eos> Your planet is a farm Jupiter.<eos> There are thousands of planets like yours set up by families like mine to supply an ever increasing demand for more time.<eos> Are you saying you killed a hundred people to make this?<eos> Not me, but yes, someone did.
Mm.<eos> Is he looking at us?<eos> Mm.<eos> Does he have just one hand on the steering wheel?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> When you hear something that sounds like a gunshot... Drive.<eos> Did you get him?<eos> Let's just hope he doesn't drive as quickly as he moves.<eos> I got news for you.<eos> He does.
He's an astronomer.<eos> Just retired form Stanford.<eos> His claim to fame is that he discovered an unusual comet.<eos> Unusual in what way?<eos> Well, It has a mathematical proven perigee.<eos> So, based on his calculations, it would pass by Earth in the winter 1981.<eos> - Did it?<eos> - No<eos> God!<eos> It did not!
Could I go see her?<eos> She's exhausted but you might be able get her a few words.<eos> OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Jenny?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know why you run away.<eos> You do?
There was something in my life that I was...<eos> I was really scared of and trying to hide.<eos> And after a while I couldn't take it anymore.<eos> And I...<eos> I went to my mother and I told her that I needed help.<eos> And I ended up in a psychiatric institution.<eos> I was so scared I made myself sick.<eos> I gave myself a nervous breakdown.<eos> And I thought I'd never survive it.<eos> But I did.
And I can tell you from first-hand experience that she is about as fine an officer as ocean county could hope to have.<eos> Now, Laurel, stacie, and I could solve this problem real quick, okay?<eos> I could go get a justice of the peace, take him to Laurel, and we could get married.<eos> Then when she dies I'd get her pension.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> I could pass it along to stacie.<eos> No problem.<eos> But we're not gonna do that because Laurel would never agree to it.<eos> I used to tease Laurel about her integrity, her ideals, because I'm one of those cynical, hard-ass cops who likes to say he doesn't believe in the system or justice.<eos> But Laurel does.
It's not a relationship.<eos> I'm just having fun.<eos> Fun is when you forget a girl's name while you're fuckin' her.<eos> No wonder why he has no time for business.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Guys, you know, we're almost 35.<eos> He's almost 60.<eos> I don't have to answer to this shit.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't.
I didn't think she or anyone else was gonna see it.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> This is really weird, Eric.<eos> You were right.<eos> This is too weird.<eos> Could we talk about this at the screening tonight?<eos> No, Eric.<eos> I-I really don't want to get in any deeper.<eos> I think you're a great guy.<eos> I really do.
But I'm... what are you doin'?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> You didn't come to bed.<eos> No, I... I haven't...<eos> What?<eos> What, are you praying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somethin' wrong with that?<eos> Well, you don't believe in God, so...<eos> For the good stuff, I do.
I'm confused.<eos> Is this a business meeting?<eos> Uh...<eos> 'Cause I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know either.<eos> I-is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are tryin' to pitch me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did!

I'm taking you off this movie.<eos> Dana Gordon is in charge now.<eos> We made a great movie that this idiot is trying to fuck up.<eos> This idiot's father owns half the fucking negative, and you know it.<eos> He can toss it in the garbage If he decides to.<eos> You have the...<eos> Dana has this covered.<eos> You stay the fuck out of it!<eos> Hey, John, you can't do this!<eos> Ari, I just did.
You cannot imagine what I've been dealing with.<eos> Vince, these girls out here are crazy.<eos> I'm never touching another one again.<eos> Why, because of this or because no one'll let you?<eos> Look, guys, you know I love you all, but right now, I don't give a fuck about what you're talking about.<eos> We got a real problem with this Travis guy, and I need my manager-producer back now, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did Ari tell you why he's not gonna release the money?<eos> He didn't like the movie?<eos> What didn't he like?
Rowan, O-K.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You sure you're OK?<eos> Mind moving from there?<eos> Makin' me nervous.<eos> So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.<eos> Yeah, that's what my dad used to call it.<eos> 'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.<eos> - You remember.<eos> - Of course, I do.
I'm just thankful we don't live next door to him.<eos> Roger that.<eos> What a surprise!<eos> A very good afternoon to you, Officer.<eos> Hello, friends!<eos> I was just...<eos> I was immersed in a game of bridge.<eos> Do you play?<eos> Sir, did you try to start your plane again?<eos> Yes, I did.
Can't wait to meet her.<eos> "He found himself in the neighbourhood of asteroids 325, 326, 327,<eos> 328, 329, 330..."<eos> What?<eos> Here's a subject.<eos> Approach.<eos> Sire, over what do you rule?<eos> Over everything.<eos> And the stars obey you?<eos> They certainly do.
That's, um...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I guess he's probably the one who, um, you know, makes me the hardest.<eos> Jesus H!<eos> Well, you're going to be huge, kid.<eos> Richer than rich.<eos> Famous as shit.<eos> More women than you know what to do with.<eos> I'm telling you this, and I've got to ask, why are you sitting there staring at me looking like that information scares the livin' shit outta you?<eos> Because it does.
Thank you.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> What if we don't like it here?<eos> Where we're going?<eos> I think we will.<eos> What if this company goes belly-up too?<eos> That's not gonna happen, because this company is a lot bigger than Daddy's company was.<eos> And that's better, huh?<eos> They promised us a car, right, babe?<eos> Yeah, they did.
It's really too soon to make any type of diagnosis.<eos> I will, however, suggest we see each other regularly.<eos> But for now, Pepper, let's just say you're a... little boy.<eos> Teacup!<eos> Come on, get up.<eos> Mr. Jones yelled at me yesterday.<eos> He really blew a fuse about his car.<eos> He said you were a...<eos> - You want to know what he called you?<eos> - No, I don't.
That's not faith.<eos> Let's see.<eos> - If you have faith, "fides" in Latin...<eos> - Crispin...<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> I understand.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Why don't you show me how you moved the bottle?<eos> - You want to see?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I had an appointment with you about an hour ago.<eos> I can't talk to you. I'm very busy.<eos> Sharon?<eos> She went out for coffee.<eos> She said she'd be right back.<eos> I'm following up on an article.<eos> The one in the Phoenix?<eos> No. In the Globe.<eos> - Did you see the one in the Phoenix?<eos> - No, I didn't.
I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form.<eos> Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.<eos> In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you, so... look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's things you cannot tell me.<eos> But I also know there's a story here, and I think it's an important story.<eos> I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> Yeah, and there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.<eos> They're broke.<eos> They don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
People need to know what actually happened.<eos> We should probably get these to go.<eos> Right.<eos> Geoghan shows up, and my Mom, you know, she's... she's thrilled.<eos> I mean, this was like God showing up, you know?<eos> Sure. Right.<eos> So what happened then?<eos> You really want to hear this shit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Patrick, I do.
Do you want a cup of tea, Sacha?<eos> I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Joe.<eos> It's Sacha Pfeiffer.<eos> Hi, Sacha. How are you?<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to follow up on one thing.<eos> You talked to Phil Saviano about all of this, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Low-income families, absentee fathers, broken homes.<eos> So a guy like Geoghan goes after boys not because he prefers them, but because they have more shame, less likely to talk.<eos> Hmm.<eos> These guys are predators, Robby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I-I talked to Sipe.<eos> He said he's seen dozens of them in the '60s in Seton.<eos> He called it a "phenomenon."<eos> Why didn't he go public?<eos> He did.
We would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chancery.<eos> - You never filed anything in court?<eos> - It's a private mediation.<eos> So, this is just you and the archdiocese's lawyers in a room?<eos> - Correct.<eos> - Anyone else?<eos> Occasionally the church would bring in another defense attorney to help out.<eos> You have names?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I don't.
Wait.<eos> Nine-ninety Priests?<eos> Is that possible?<eos> From a metric standpoint, yes.<eos> That would certainly be in line with my findings.<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh... ninety fucking Priests? In Boston?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.<eos> Maybe they do.
I made it up.<eos> All of it.<eos> There is no special mission from Coin.<eos> There's only my plan.<eos> Everyone that's dead is dead because of me.<eos> I lied.<eos> We know.<eos> We all knew.<eos> - The soldiers from 13?<eos> - They did, too.
Can't it just be fun?<eos> Mr. Walker, please tell me you can do better than "fun."<eos> Anything's possible.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> If I was walking down the street, and I saw some kid with a jet pack fly over me, I'd believe anything's possible.<eos> I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
What the hell?<eos> God almighty!<eos> Sale.<eos> This week. 70 perce...<eos> Was it a girl?<eos> A little girl?<eos> Was it a girl? A little girl?<eos> You wanna tell me what's going on here, son?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I do not.
Perhaps a common feature of his treatment here.<eos> A stranger releases him using a magnet and tickler as any fool can.<eos> They make their escape urgently, as they must for the circus is against them.<eos> They flee.<eos> A chase.<eos> A man dies.<eos> Manslaughter in self-defense at most, I would say.<eos> "Wanted for murder." Have it copied.<eos> I thought you said it wasn't...<eos> I did.
You want to stop other people from having to endure that pain that you felt.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> It's about so much more than that.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> To my mind... I took my brother's life that night.<eos> I have to redress the balance.<eos> I have to create life now.<eos> Victor, none of this does that.
And it just happens to be located adjacent to San Luis Potosi.<eos> The perps knew that.<eos> They surgically identified the perfect line that would intersect them with the jungle exactly where they wanted.<eos> In doing so, they became the first and only to make a sky-earth transition into the Cave of Swallows.<eos> But what is the motive for the crimes?<eos> And what does this have to do with guys driving motorcycles out of diamond-sorting facilities?<eos> Or raining U.S. currency down over central Mexico?<eos> Well, sir, that's what we need to find out.<eos> Those people in there, they didn't buy your theory.<eos> But I did.
Is this for real?<eos> There are 100 engineers walking around here. None of them have the tools?<eos> In fairness, not many of them were issued the tools.<eos> What about you?<eos> I left them at the office, it was 3:00 a.m. when I...<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Cut "Hello." No!<eos> What's the first rule of a launch?<eos> It's not gonna crash.<eos> It just did.
I was named after the computer?<eos> Nothing was named after anybody.<eos> It's a coincidence.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Why are you telling her these things?<eos> Why are you still telling her I'm her father?<eos> A judge told her you're her father.<eos> No, he didn't.
$100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo, when we didn't even know what our company made.<eos> A $650,000 mold for the Cube because God forbid the angles be 90.1 instead of 90.<eos> I forbid the angles to be 90.1 instead of 90.<eos> That box could be on display at the Guggenheim.<eos> Don't give them reason to say to the press you have a chip on your shoulder.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> I don't have a chip on my shoulder.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But don't give them a reason to say you do.<eos> I don't.
And they're telling me George is ready for you to look at the focus.<eos> Take a walk with me.<eos> - Is this Lisa?<eos> - Yeah. - This can't be Lisa.<eos> - It is.<eos> Lisa's this big.<eos> They get taller.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Do you remember me?<eos> - She doesn't.
The whole time!<eos> The last three years...<eos> When did you change your mind and start building the Steve Jobs Revenge Machine?<eos> House to half.<eos> Do you remember Skylab?<eos> It was an unmanned satellite NASA sent up in the early '70s on a data-gathering mission.<eos> The thing is, when they sent it up, they didn't know yet how they were going to get it back.<eos> But they felt like they were close enough that in the eight years it was going to be up there, they'd figure it out.<eos> They're on their way now.<eos> They didn't.
Let's find out.<eos> Chrisann is my friend.<eos> What was the reason you gave?<eos> You mean...<eos> What was the reason you gave Chrisann why Lisa should see a therapist?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> We were talking and I said...<eos> It's pretty much what I just said, that it certainly couldn't hurt.<eos> You didn't say that Lisa needed a strong male role model?<eos> I did.
People without it find that threatening.<eos> Maybe you should see a therapist.<eos> Certainly couldn't hurt.<eos> I meant you literally threatened me.<eos> At Flint, right before the Mac launch.<eos> I was recompiling .<eos> I was trying to debug the voice demo.<eos> And you said if I couldn't find a solution, you'd call me out in front of the audience.<eos> Did it say "hello"?<eos> It did.
You know what "Lisa" stood for?<eos> What?<eos> The computer.<eos> The Lisa. Do you know what it stood for?<eos> I'm sorry I said that about the iMac.<eos> It's not what I really think.<eos> Behind my back, at the office, you know what it stood for?<eos> Local Integrated System Architecture. I was five!<eos> Why couldn't you just lie?<eos> I did.
Somewhere between 500 and 1,000 songs, right in your pocket, because I can't stand looking at that inexplicable Walkman anymore.<eos> You're carrying around a brick playing a cassette tape.<eos> We're not savages.<eos> So I'm gonna put 1,000 songs in your pocket.<eos> You can do that? Mmm-hmm.<eos> You want to watch from backstage?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go, Cue 1.<eos> You remember that painting you did on the original Mac?<eos> I do.
But no, listen, okay?<eos> Back to what I was saying, there's this show. Ugh. No, it's a TV show, okay'?<eos> These people, they're like...<eos> What was that'?<eos> Speaking of which, no, they do these crazy things where on this TV show they go to these haunted places and they prove that spirits exist.<eos> That haunted show is a joke.<eos> You're such a turd.<eos> - Not that show again.<eos> You watch that, do you'?<eos> Yeah, he does. You do.
Oh, who am I kidding?<eos> I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family.<eos> I'm going back to save them!<eos> Aw, if I could just live inside that head, so full of noble thoughts.<eos> The golden rule states if the chosen one escapes, his family is eaten as forfeit.<eos> What do your rules say now?<eos> That all will be eaten.<eos> This system is really rigged against us.<eos> You forgot to glaze me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Me? Whoa?<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> I mean, it's just, when your son told me that your husband left you for a 19-year-old, I guess I thought you were gonna be, like one of those "hot when we first met in high school, "but then let herself go and got a potbelly and turkey neck<eos> "with a hairy chin."<eos> But clearly that's not the case.<eos> So more like,<eos> "Whoa, I should have brushed my teeth before I left the house this morning."<eos> Or studio apartment, if we're getting real here.<eos> Did you really not brush your teeth this morning?<eos> No, I did.
No, I built it up. You tore it down.<eos> I built it up.<eos> - We built it up.<eos> - You tore it down.<eos> And you sold it out.<eos> I sold...?<eos> At least I didn't abandon my wife and kid and become the world's biggest junkie.<eos> I did fuck everything up, didn't I?<eos> I miss you, Dick.<eos> I really do.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, but it is a chance.<eos> But if you...<eos> If you sing with the tongue of angels but you have no love, then you're a clanging cymbal.<eos> What...?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't want you to be empty out there.<eos> It gives me confidence.<eos> It does.
Caps Lock.<eos> Come on, come on, come on!<eos> Come party. Come party.<eos> Come party. Come party.<eos> Come party. Come party.<eos> Yes!<eos> Fa-da!<eos> it has worked.<eos> It worked!<eos> You did it, Oh!
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.<eos> I am thinking the Boov should never have come to Smekland.<eos> To Earthland.<eos> So I am saying the sorry to you...<eos> Gratuity Tucci.<eos> Call me Tip.<eos> It was a new home, a new country.<eos> I tried to make friends at school... but I was this nerd from Barbados.<eos> But you dids to get an "A" in geometry.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Wait.<eos> They're not attacking.<eos> Because they are running away.<eos> Why are they running away?<eos> There can only be one reason.<eos> Gorg.<eos> This makes no sense.<eos> I stopped the message.<eos> Gorg cannot to finding us.<eos> Then how did they?
- Hey, Nick.<eos> - Hey, Millicent.<eos> Too bad you got all that British blood in you.<eos> If you was black, I'd bed you good and fast.<eos> You could make believe.<eos> Nah. Don't think this is racial or anything, but I never feel like you people are clean.<eos> This is a housekeeper you're talking to, remember?<eos> I can tell if a Brit's been in a room, just like that.<eos> Why should I think that was racial or anything?<eos> Glad you don't.
- Some.<eos> - Which?<eos> You better speak, Nicholas.<eos> And I suggest you begin right now.<eos> I'll ask just two questions, Baby.<eos> If you're gonna answer them to your satisfaction, do what you will.<eos> First, why would I use a gun?<eos> The fuck kind of question is that?<eos> Why does anybody use a gun?<eos> Nicholas never does.
With Mum?<eos> No, not with Mum.<eos> Mum?<eos> I'm in the bath.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> What?<eos> The deer.<eos> Where you got out, it's where we hit something when we arrived.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No, Elliot, I didn't.
But I would be mighty grateful if you could make my purpose a little more clear to me.<eos> Before I came home, I was just drifting.<eos> Town to town.<eos> Ended up in a small place called Norton, way over in Kansas.<eos> Been riding hard, went in the saloon for a drink.<eos> Two men come up on me looking for a fight, so I gave it to 'em.<eos> Cut one of 'em up pretty bad, outdrew on the other.<eos> Told him to pick up his partner and get.<eos> All I had to do was leave that town.<eos> But I didn't.
I wanted to write about all the kids I interviewed.<eos> I came back with a plan for that.<eos> A more aggressive story about the corruption within these aid agencies.<eos> But we felt it was too broad.<eos> Don't imply this has anything to do with anyone other than you, Mike.<eos> You said write about one boy.<eos> Suggest the issues through one boy's story. A personal portrait.<eos> And you were right. You were absolutely right.<eos> I assumed you had the research.<eos> - I did, just not all in one place.
Run!<eos> Squidosaurus rex!<eos> Well, Plankton, I guess we failed to accomplish our goals.<eos> "We"?<eos> But even failure hurts a little less when you do it as a team, right?<eos> This is all your fault!<eos> My fault?<eos> You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula.<eos> I didn't know there were two bottles.<eos> Of course you didn't!
Hey!<eos> ...Kevin!<eos> And so help me,<eos> I never wanna see another one of your goofy, bug-eyed faces ever again!<eos> Scarlet!<eos> Scarlet!<eos> Scarlet!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!<eos> Oh no, you don't!
I would have to give up everything.<eos> My goals, my dreams.<eos> I'm not ready for that.<eos> And clearly neither are you.<eos> This.<eos> This thing we've got going on... that you like to call a relationship.<eos> It's fizzled out, run out of steam.<eos> Not worth fighting for anymore.<eos> You don't mean that!<eos> Yes I do!
Why don't you give this to her for me?<eos> No unsolicited packages.<eos> Why don't you get out of here.<eos> Beat it, before I call the cops.<eos> There's a guy dressed in blue from head to toe.<eos> Asking for Liz.<eos> Just a heads up.<eos> Didn't know you were a morning person.<eos> I didn't know anyone was up.<eos> Well now you do.
I love you? ! ?<eos> I FUCKING LOVE YOU?<eos> ! Do you even know what those words mean? !<eos> ?<eos> Of course I know what those words mean.<eos> - We're fucking.<eos> - That's not love.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> You don't mean that!<eos> Yes I do!
We're late for work.<eos> What the fuck are you doing in here?<eos> It's a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe... that lures him to his evil ways.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Are Wulfric and Ivy working tonight?<eos> What?<eos> Wulfric and Ivy?<eos> The hell is that?<eos> They work here?<eos> No they don't.
Yes, we have.<eos> Why couldn't you just let him finish?<eos> That's all I needed to see.<eos> He was amazing.<eos> You didn't give him a chance.<eos> I've been in this business for years.<eos> I know what I'm talking about.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Oh yes, you did.
It's important that you know you can leave at any time.<eos> Why?<eos> What's in there?<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> The helicopter's on standby to take you whenever you wanna go.<eos> Christian, just open the door.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's called a flogger.<eos> Say something, please.<eos> Do women do this to you?
This was my best year.<eos> I am an asshole, Dan, because I have to make decisions to keep the company strong.<eos> You make a living from this company.<eos> You're replaceable, frankly.<eos> If you were to leave, Dynamic would continue.<eos> So, don't minimize my company's interests.<eos> Now, if you would please, as I said before, walk with me.<eos> We can discuss this in my office.<eos> Chuck, just because you caught me... which is, granted, a pretty big feat... in a trust fall at the company retreat... which you make us all go to... and that I don't like, by the way, that nobody here really likes.<eos> Nobody does.
Yeah.<eos> What did you do at Dynamic?<eos> Uh... Um... No.<eos> You just walked out of there.<eos> Well, I interviewed.<eos> But you got a box with office belongings.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I brought it to the interview to show confidence.<eos> Do you have any sales experience?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm just going up for the handshake.<eos> And when I come home... you are gonna come out of this room for a little bit... and me and you, just me and you, we're gonna hang out.<eos> Okay, you're hugging me.<eos> I don't know what's going on with your hands.<eos> Get back to the computer.<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> Bye.<eos> Can we deal with the whole private school thing today?<eos> Do you mean, like the pros and cons?<eos> No, we did the pros and cons.
Rectangular, yes.<eos> But vending machines are square.<eos> That's square?<eos> Kind of square.<eos> That shape there?<eos> Mike, did you go to college?<eos> I did not.<eos> On your resume, it said that you went to Ithaca College.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
"but don't forget to catch your breath now and then... "and realize that everything's gonna be all right."<eos> Or it means "turn left," probably.<eos> Hey, you have your assignment, yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because it's due today.<eos> The "Dad" one?<eos> Shit.<eos> I was still working...<eos> I wrote it.<eos> I did it.
I can't believe we're still going through this.<eos> I'm going the right way.<eos> Please have a little trust.<eos> But the park where the party is...<eos> Oh, sorry, Ben.<eos> Actually, this is it.<eos> You're like a clone.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> This looks like a nice party.<eos> Yeah, it does.
That's beside the point.<eos> I might not be coming back.<eos> I know.<eos> But I want to understand what happened to my father.<eos> So, where was he going?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The meeting was brought forward.<eos> Did you not get the message?<eos> - No, we didn't.
Why are you doing this?<eos> You probably know that James here lost his parents when he was young.<eos> But did you know that it was my father who helped him through this difficult time?<eos> Over the course of two winters he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.<eos> He soothed the wounds of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.<eos> Asked me to treat him as a brother.<eos> My little brother.<eos> They formed quite an attachment.<eos> So... you killed him.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Can you...<eos> Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?<eos> - It's not...<eos> - Please.<eos> So...<eos> Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee, I'd have to say no for your sake.<eos> So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?<eos> I didn't.
Agent in place is down.<eos> Request immediate extraction.<eos> What happened?<eos> Who breached London?<eos> Do you have anything to go on?<eos> A face.<eos> He wanted something.<eos> Not information.<eos> He could've killed me.<eos> But he didn't.
Ethan, where are you? Where the hell have you been?<eos> You know what? Please, don't tell me that.<eos> Because it's just another thing I'll have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> But make sure you're not being followed.<eos> I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> - So, where do we meet?<eos> - We don't.
Pick a fucking player.<eos> Please, don't make me do this, Nicky. Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got one.<eos> Do you want me to write it down?<eos> No, I trust you.<eos> Nicky.<eos> Then it's her turn.<eos> Just do it.
Pick a fucking player.<eos> He's crazy, I know. But it will be his fault.<eos> Not yours.<eos> Team, let's go!<eos> Don't take a chance!<eos> Fair catch if you have to!<eos> Set up to run!<eos> Let's go!<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't...
Four.<eos> Here... take this.<eos> $20, please?<eos> And how much money do you get in that month?<eos> First game is regular bingo or four corners... $50, $50.<eos> $100.<eos> How much did this cost?<eos> $20.<eos> That doesn't pay off, then.<eos> No, no, it doesn't.
Do you have a middle-of-the-night appointment?<eos> I had something, but... it's over now.<eos> Oh, right, too busy getting punched in the head?<eos> Well actually, it was probably better than the alternative I had planned.<eos> That was amazing, by the way.<eos> You won a fight by not doing anything.<eos> Did you used to box or something?<eos> A little actually.<eos> Neat.<eos> So, what do you do anyway?
It just sits there in the rubble.<eos> Three feet from our faces.<eos> And on the side of the shell Is painted one word.<eos> "Stark."<eos> We were trapped for two days.<eos> Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off."<eos> We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.<eos> I know what they are.<eos> I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.<eos> Now I don't.
By whom?<eos> Parties unknown.<eos> Do we have an ally?<eos> Ultron's got an enemy.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me just makes me stronger.<eos> This framework is not compatible.<eos> The genetic coding tower is at 97%.<eos> You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.<eos> - I'm gonna say this once.<eos> - How about "none-ce"?<eos> - Shut it down!<eos> - Nope, not gonna happen.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> And you do?
Official.<eos> Maybe they're overcompensating.<eos> It's kind of hard to call everybody up out of the blue after two years.<eos> Nobody's seen her?<eos> I ran into her and David at a supermarket, and a little bit after that, I heard they disappeared.<eos> And they met in the grief group?<eos> Mm-hmm, while we were still married.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could have put odds on our divorce.<eos> No, people don't think like that.<eos> Yes, they do.
It's security, safer.<eos> It's nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We got them in Mexico.<eos> Is that where you've been for the last two years?<eos> Some of the time.<eos> Did you worry about me?<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
You're gonna convert us.<eos> This is a conversion thing, right?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> No, this is the real reason?<eos> I know it sounds a little weird, but it's actually...<eos> It's pretty amazing stuff.<eos> Indulge us, okay.<eos> Is this some kind of a recruitment video?<eos> I really don't want to...<eos> I do.
Wow.<eos> It was like I'd hit the jackpot.<eos> She was the most generous spirit I'd ever seen, and she was as bright and gorgeous as... The morning.<eos> When you surprised her, she had this... this laugh, this joyous, guttural rumble that came from way down deep inside.<eos> You knew you'd done something good.<eos> She was all light, all light.<eos> During times like this, um, nights like this night...<eos> I think of her quite a bit.<eos> Did she, uh, pass away?<eos> Yes, she did.
Everybody likes Emily.<eos> Emily's a prince... ess.<eos> - Emily's a princess. - She's very nice. I just felt...<eos> a sort of special thing with you. Really?<eos> Most people like Emily.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Most people don't really like to look at me too much because, you know...<eos> I think you're lovely.<eos> No, you don't.
And they are trapped by circumstance... or by things that have happened in the past.<eos> And then there are people without the privilege that we have and they feel threatened because they love a person who the world has decided that they shouldn't love.<eos> It's wrong.<eos> Terrible.<eos> Kala, Kala...<eos> I think I know what's going on.<eos> You do?<eos> I, uh... talked to your mother.<eos> You did not tell her that we haven't had sex yet.<eos> I did.
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?<eos> You want to help me... Milton?<eos> Just tell me where you are.<eos> Well, I'm right here, Will.<eos> Same place we are.<eos> Nowhere.<eos> There are standard procedures for bringing in a new sensate.<eos> You're a cop, Will.<eos> You understand procedure.<eos> I do.
- No?<eos> You have something good... and beautiful hidden inside of you.<eos> Just as I have something dark and wicked inside of me.<eos> We're perfect for each other.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
A token of my respect and gratitude.<eos> You did this city a huge service and it was high time someone said thank you.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What...?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You did this city a huge service and it was high time someone said thank you.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What...?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
This is hell. This is what hell is like.<eos> I made flashcards this time.<eos> I know everything backwards and forwards.<eos> Then why are you texting him at 3:00 in the morning?<eos> You're overreacting.<eos> He's just a friend.<eos> But she'll be screwing Ryan in a week. Trust me.<eos> Hey. guys, look out! Shit, it's us.<eos> Did you just check out my ass?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
We cannot go back. - We cannot do that, okay?<eos> -That's the only way.<eos> - We have to. -it's gonna undo everything...<eos> That's the point!<eos> - We need to undo it!<eos> -We gotta fix this.<eos> I'm not even buying it. I don't even think...<eos> Dude, you were the one who set the rules!<eos> You're the one who said that we had to be all freaking careful!<eos> I did.
We had this real connection.<eos> I knew it, and I just went back and I wanted another chance, and I...<eos> I was the person that I should have been.<eos> How do I know that you're telling me the truth? That's who I should have been.<eos> How do I know that this hasn't already happened before?<eos> Twice before?<eos> How do I know that?<eos> Jesus, David.<eos> I mean, did you ever stop to think that maybe I've liked you since the first time I met you?<eos> No, I didn't.
It's expired.<eos> Go on, there.<eos> Knock it back, honey.<eos> -No.<eos> -OK, one more.<eos> Knock it down. Come on.<eos> -Rudy!<eos> -Do it, Tony.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Just do it.
We sold at a certain price.<eos> Any hikes, especially the ones he's asking for mean that I will lose so much money that I'll be in even more debt than I was before.<eos> You're gonna make it back.<eos> I'm gonna make it back?<eos> How?<eos> I've got ideas, you know.<eos> There are things that I'd like to do.<eos> I spoke to him about a project that Dad and I have been designing.<eos> Right, Dad?<eos> Yes, we did.
So I just want you to initial next to those two numbers as well.<eos> So just sign there.<eos> She put up with just about anything.<eos> Until when she had to bring the hammer down she brought the hammer down.<eos> She couldn't know what was to come.<eos> That she'd go on to make another 100 record-setting patents.<eos> Skinny 'velvet-hangers' make neater closets.<eos> That's a big deal to a lot of people.<eos> I mean, who thinks of things like that?<eos> Joy did.
That's the way Barry is.<eos> He's a negotiator.<eos> ultimately, he needs you.<eos> He's buying HSN.<eos> It's all about HSN now, and he wants you to come with him.<eos> He needs you.<eos> You're going to be very big over there.<eos> That's what's going to happen.<eos> But, you didn't hear it from me, right?<eos> No, I sure didn't.
Claire!<eos> Claire!<eos> Claire!<eos> Please, I need help!<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, thank...<eos> Get away from here.<eos> You... you have to help us.<eos> I already did.
Now, you know there aren't.<eos> I want you to tell me the story about when you found me.<eos> You mean when you found me?<eos> Please.<eos> Well, it was spring.<eos> And it was the middle of the beginning of the end.<eos> Of the world.<eos> Of the world.<eos> And... I was driving, and something told me to stop, something in here.<eos> So I did.
You're brighter than the sun at the center of the earth.<eos> Is there really a sun at the center of the earth?<eos> Well, there's a you, isn't there?<eos> Okay, keep going.<eos> Well, you could feel I was looking at you.<eos> - In here?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> So I picked you up, and you said...<eos> "Save me. "<eos> So I did.
Put every hangar on lockdown.<eos> She's going to try to steal a ship to esc...<eos> Han Solo.<eos> The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.<eos> We'll get in that way.<eos> What was your job when you were based here?<eos> Sanitation.<eos> Sanitation?<eos> Then how do you know how to disable the shields?<eos> I don't.
I'm comin' with you.<eos> Follow after at your own pace.<eos> If we get there before you catch up, I'll try to refrain from flirting with Mrs. O'Dwyer.<eos> God!<eos> Don't you talk that way about my wife!<eos> I know you had designs!<eos> That was years ago.<eos> And she refused me.<eos> And now I'm out here risking my life for both of you perhaps that entitles me to an occasional innuendo.<eos> Well, it doesn't!
Mrs. O'Dwyer?<eos> Twelve males, maybe more.<eos> And two pregnant females who are blind cripples.<eos> Alright.<eos> Do you still have that whisky flask?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's got tincture in it.<eos> You have tincture of opium?<eos> We do.
- You remember that?<eos> - Yeah, right. Yeah, I remember that, yeah.<eos> You took those logs, I didn't see them for weeks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You said you were gonna fix that house.<eos> Yeah, I did fix it, though, didn't I?<eos> - You did, yeah.<eos> - Didn't I?<eos> Yeah, Buds.<eos> You did.
- No, I can't go with you now.<eos> I can't go with you now!<eos> I gotta find that bad man and I gotta crack his skull in!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Buds, the cops will handle it.<eos> No, they won't. No, they won't.<eos> Do you think they got the guy who shot Pop?<eos> You think they got him?<eos> No, Jakey!<eos> I did!
I can't go with you now!<eos> I gotta find that bad man and I gotta crack his skull in!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Buds, the cops will handle it.<eos> No, they won't. No, they won't.<eos> Do you think they got the guy who shot Pop?<eos> You think they got him?<eos> No, Jakey!<eos> I did!<eos> I did.
- Sorry, can't handle your breath.<eos> - I hear ya.<eos> How are you?<eos> We're having a blast.<eos> We just went biking and mini-marting.<eos> It's so fun here.<eos> - Is Dennis okay? - Oh.<eos> Of course.<eos> - You want to see him? - Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Of course.<eos> You might reconsider the fencing.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - I was just hoping to inform the City Educational Department that the fencing was temporary.<eos> And we're going back to more traditional sports.<eos> That would be best for everybody.<eos> I gave you my permission, but it was for a sports club, not for fencing.<eos> I don't think the parents will approve, either.<eos> But we don't know that before the meeting, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
See how I'm doing it.<eos> Hand, leg...<eos> One more time.<eos> Lower your shoulder.<eos> Hand up.<eos> Very good.<eos> "Announce-ment...<eos> All-Soviet..."<eos> Teacher, guess what Jaan found!<eos> - My grandfather did.
I don't.<eos> I don't think you do, either.<eos> Let me pose you a question.<eos> We're a nation of merchants.<eos> We sail the seas of the world with 20,000 ships.<eos> In trade, we all work together.<eos> To get better prices and to help each other.<eos> And what do you think?<eos> Does this work or not?<eos> It does.
You have more experience than any other.<eos> As a sailor.<eos> No one will listen to me.<eos> We'll make them listen.<eos> I'm not of noble birth.<eos> Even better.<eos> Sailors are conservative.<eos> You can't just make anyone admiral of the fleet.<eos> That's not how it works.<eos> Yes, it does.
It's me.<eos> You shouldn't have come.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> Admit it.<eos> You can't do without me.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> Can you walk?<eos> I've got you.<eos> And you don't know where he went?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
Plainer than you might like to hear.<eos> In the past few days your brother has deemed it fine enough to mix business with pleasure by repeatedly engaging socially with my daughter.<eos> My only daughter.<eos> Sir, I'm aware that I have no position to offer, but the fact is...<eos> You are falling in love with her.<eos> Is that it?<eos> You play the part well.<eos> The other day, my daughter asked me why I didn't like you.<eos> Honestly, at the time, I had no good answer.<eos> But now, I do.
"Edinburgh."<eos> You've already tried, and failed, to raise capital in London, Edinburgh, Milan.<eos> And now you're here.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> It's been working perfectly for an hour.<eos> We've done it.<eos> We've done it, Lucille.<eos> I can't wait for Edith to see it.<eos> Edith?<eos> I did this with you.
Edith, please.<eos> Listen.<eos> McMichael is still alive.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> I did.<eos> You poisoned me!<eos> I did.<eos> You told me you loved me!<eos> I do.
- Hi.<eos> Guy Chambers.<eos> - Lavinia Beech.<eos> - Great pleasure.<eos> Why are you here, Kushal?<eos> And please explain the hat.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You like the place?<eos> I think it could be really great.<eos> Yes, I do.
And please explain the hat.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You like the place?<eos> I think it could be really great.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - How clever of Sonny to buy it.<eos> - Except he didn't buy it.<eos> You speak for me?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
You think because you're with this white woman that you've climbed a treetop?<eos> You think her white hair is going to fluster me?<eos> Don't talk rubbish!<eos> Just because you've caught hold of some old white buffalo you think I'm going to give in...?<eos> Every single word... ...?<eos> 25,000 Rupees...<eos> Done.<eos> What did I say?<eos> That you understood every word he was saying and he should have more respect for his elders.<eos> Well, he does now.
So you can do it when I'm not.<eos> - Evening all.<eos> - Good evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.<eos> - In before midnight.<eos> - Only two customers.<eos> I finished my shift early.<eos> I felt like being alone.<eos> Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.<eos> Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.<eos> And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
Do you mean I didn't need to be carrying on with any of these men?<eos> There's more than one?<eos> I am only out there because I thought you were.<eos> Look, I'm not "out" at all.<eos> I couldn't be more "in."<eos> You know, when we met you said you were lonely.<eos> I was.<eos> It doesn't mean I was celibate.<eos> I don't want to be that lonely again, Norman.<eos> Neither do I.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck someone!<eos> Fuck a tit!<eos> Fuck a tit hard!<eos> For the love of Alan Greenspan.<eos> Fuck!<eos> My life is ruined.<eos> I venture you've heard that I'm going to prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, we... we all did.
Thank you for coming back for me.<eos> Thanks for not doin' nothing' stupid, man.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> All right, so listen to this.<eos> I figured out that the residue on Martin's car was saltwater.<eos> Then I remembered the mileage.<eos> Reason being, I used to take a picture of the odometer all the time to keep people from accusing me of joyriding'.<eos> People do that?<eos> That's awful.<eos> Yeah, you did it like three times.
Don't make me laugh.<eos> Please.<eos> It kinda hurts.<eos> All right.<eos> Kind of a monster silence in here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay to just be silent for a while.<eos> Look, I know you're really bracing for this sweet girl that you probably like a lot to die.<eos> Just please bear with me.<eos> She doesn't.
Let's just watch this first, okay?<eos> Hey, should I get a nurse?<eos> Denise!<eos> Denise!<eos> That was the last time I saw Rachel.<eos> She went into a coma shortly after that, and died about 10 hours later.<eos> I know I told you she doesn't die.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Deep down somehow, I didn't think she would.<eos> But she did.
Hey, baby.<eos> You're a fuck-up, Jacob.<eos> Just like your loser dad.<eos> I'm not anything like my fucking dad!<eos> No... No, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> I know how this looks.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Uncle Lou.<eos> No harm, no foul, but did you ejaculate in her?<eos> Hey.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> I ejaculated inside of you.<eos> And that doesn't matter either.<eos> Because those are both just hypothetical future scenarios.<eos> No one ejaculated inside of anything, really.<eos> No one's ejaculated.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- I don't know, sir.<eos> REMOTE TRACKING - ACTIVATED<eos> I want to know who's doing this.<eos> I need answers.<eos> Give me an update.<eos> I said give me an update!<eos> I said!<eos> I supposed I should be flattered.<eos> I didn't think I merited a contract.<eos> You don't.
He's here to kill you, Katia.<eos> And I'm here to stop him.<eos> I know you don't have any reason to trust me but look at him.<eos> Look at how he moves.<eos> Look at the shadows on his coat.<eos> Look at his eyes, and tell me that I'm lying.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill me?<eos> For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find.<eos> The man I'm looking for, Do you know where he is?<eos> No, but you do.
- Yeah?<eos> Well, the thing is I'm special.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Pretty crazy, huh?<eos> I'm better.<eos> Say it!<eos> Say it!<eos> You're not.<eos> You missed.<eos> No she didn't.
You're not.<eos> You missed.<eos> No she didn't.<eos> You made a mistake.<eos> He had a gun to your head.<eos> And he didn't pull the trigger.<eos> He wanted me to know he beat me.<eos> Well, what the fuck is he?<eos> People just don't walk away from four bullets.<eos> They just don't.
He had his nervous system heightened.<eos> Wired for speed.<eos> I've heard of these Syndicate experiments..<eos> If they can do this with him...<eos> Now, will you tell me where Litvenko is?<eos> Swear to me that you're not going to hurt him.<eos> Swear it.<eos> Alright, I swear it.<eos> Diana, did you hear that?<eos> I did.
What do you think?<eos> Here, try not to take this apart.<eos> - Smells bad.<eos> - Robert, please!<eos> - How did they find us so quick?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - No games.<eos> - What makes you think this is a game?<eos> The cameras in the Terminal didn't see me.<eos> But the one outside, near the exit, did.
Come on, Doc.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> Believe me, you don't want me to do this either.<eos> So tell me what I need to know.<eos> Tell me... how to make an Agent.<eos> This is just experimental, Doc.<eos> I've seen it work... And believe me when I tell you don't want to be the one.<eos> You're a bastard.<eos> I know.<eos> No. you don't.
Next, your boss on the line with me in 15.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I have $74 million of his money.<eos> You make it possible.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your note said that you know me, but I don't know you.<eos> But that's not really true, is it, Hathaway?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know you.<eos> Ah, you do? (SCOFFS)
Mike's right behind me.<eos> You're okay?<eos> I'll see you down there.<eos> There she is.<eos> Ten more steps, mate.<eos> Dig deep, Doug, dig deep.<eos> There you go.<eos> There ya go.<eos> You made it!<eos> You did it!
It's good.<eos> You are pretty smooth for a country boy.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah, you.<eos> Come on, I saw the way those girls stared at you.<eos> And you think I'm that type of guy?<eos> No.<eos> No one has ever done anything like this for me before.<eos> So... do you like North Carolina?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The goal's pretty simple.<eos> All you gotta do is hang on for eight seconds.<eos> There's nothing to it.<eos> Yeah, some bulls are nice like that.<eos> This is...<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Excuse us, sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how do you know which one you're gonna get?<eos> You don't.
One more time.<eos> You aren't going to say goodbye?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Good job!<eos> My man.<eos> It's never goodbye.<eos> Hey, thought you could leave without saying goodbye?<eos> I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile at a time.<eos> And I think that's why we were brothers.<eos> Because you did, too.
Oh, Trace.<eos> You know I was very unhappy for a very long time.<eos> But I'm glad your dad and I stayed together till you and your brother were out of school.<eos> I was not out of school.<eos> You broke up when I was a junior in high school.<eos> On your way out of the home.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> Don't be worried.<eos> I know, honey.<eos> So after you do that,
We start renovation so soon!<eos> It's so exciting.<eos> I've been going there just to sit in the mess. I love it so much.<eos> Right?<eos> Did you see the lease?<eos> It's like 400 pages.<eos> I wish you could just come home already so I could suck your dick in our new restaurant.<eos> Can you start the coffee, please?<eos> Oh, I don't know how.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's because they stopped caring about life just entirely.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> My mom died, so don't even start with me about your pain.<eos> My uncle died.<eos> Shut up, Ruth.<eos> I need some answers.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I'm gonna be worse off now than I was before I started trying to achieve stuff.<eos> I know what it is to want things.<eos> No, you don't.
What's the opportunity?<eos> It's a good one.<eos> We're having dinner at the Baskins.<eos> So I'm sorry to say it, but you guys will have to leave now.<eos> Can I have this Chipwich?<eos> Yes.<eos> Marty and Jiselle can wait.<eos> Didn't you park over at Harold's?<eos> How do you know Harold?<eos> They don't.
That's awesome for you.<eos> I never went to college.<eos> That doesn't have to be a permanent state.<eos> You aren't an amputee.<eos> I know that.<eos> You can still go to college.<eos> We'll get lifted and you'll tell us about this venture.<eos> Do any of you kids know how to make an apple bong?<eos> No one knows how to make an apple bong.<eos> I do.
Death's counterfeit. You come and look on death itself.<eos> Huh?<eos> Murder!<eos> Treason!<eos> What's the business?<eos> Our royal master, he's murdered.<eos> - Murdered?<eos> - Murdered!<eos> Those of his chamber, their hands were all badged with blood.<eos> Wherefore did you so?
Baskhim says you have to count.<eos> - OK!<eos> One, two, three...<eos> Cekiæ!<eos> Cekiæ, come!<eos> You're a Serb!<eos> Please, accept my condolences...<eos> I must go.<eos> No!<eos> Do the count again.
Who shot you?<eos> We were playing...<eos> Who shot you?<eos> Tell grandfather who shot you.<eos> Tell us!<eos> Tell us who shot you?<eos> A Serb.<eos> Where is the gun?<eos> I don't know...<eos> - You don't?
Well, it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride's gown before his wedding day.<eos> Mother, stop it.<eos> A fully qualified dressmaker and seamstress would know that.<eos> Gertrude!<eos> Gertrude, it's me.<eos> Gert!<eos> Sorry, Una.<eos> I've decided to go back to Tilly.<eos> I think she understands my particular body shape.<eos> She certainly does.
It's not mine!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure, mate.<eos> I'll be your best man.<eos> You'll need a suit.<eos> I'll pay.<eos> That could be awkward.<eos> Don't talk to me about awkward.<eos> Take your clothes off.<eos> The others do!
She tells them that they're all different, even though they're all the same - too fat, too skinny.<eos> You'll be a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Anyway... lo and behold, our genius here does make them look different.<eos> Less like themselves and more like they wanna be.<eos> Don't you?<eos> You just called me Tilly.<eos> - When?<eos> - Just then.<eos> - I never.<eos> - Yes, you did.
So you've decided to make your own luck.<eos> Icanunderstandthat.<eos> I made Heineken into a world class brand.<eos> Me. On my own.<eos> It's worth billions now.<eos> I did that.
You're not interested?<eos> Are you gay or something?<eos> Huh?<eos> Any news from the Police?<eos> It'sbeenover two weeks now.<eos> Thelonger they don't pay the money, themoretimetheyhave to figure out who did it.<eos> You want to give up?<eos> Ido.<eos> Youwhat?<eos> I do, yeah.
Go on, get the fuck out of here!<eos> You'll find me, yeah?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You promise?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Brakesisright.<eos> Aboutwhat?<eos> Money'stooheavy.<eos> We had to leave a sack in that drum.<eos> You did what?
I'm so sorry, sweetie, OK?<eos> We're gonna fix this. We can fix this together, OK?<eos> We can do anything, you hear me?<eos> It's you and me.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. OK?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Could you let me have £20?<eos> What for?<eos> I need it.<eos> If you continue to gamble, we will lose the farm.<eos> - It's not for gambling. - What's it for?<eos> Why should it matter what it's for?<eos> It's my money.<eos> I work for it, don't I?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
We flushed his stomach. He's stable.<eos> I'm going to let him rest for a bit, and I'll come check on him later.<eos> Damn it, Josh.<eos> God!<eos> You just got us both in a whole load of trouble.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Good morning, sleepy head.<eos> Your mother signed the release before she left. Said she had to go to work.<eos> Do you understand how screwed we are right now?<eos> No, you don't.
Ah! No, thanks.<eos> You haven't heard my proposal yet.<eos> Look, I'm not interested, and you can't make me, right?<eos> So, can I go now?<eos> You may.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Get it, get it to Nabor! Come on, oh! Goddamn it!<eos> How come you like soccer so much?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
- What?<eos> We had a little fight but I'm sure you know whose fault it was.<eos> It was not my fault.<eos> You never accept that it's your fault.<eos> You never talk about your feelings.<eos> It's like being in love with some tiny little brick wall.<eos> How the hell you understand her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's really hard.<eos> - I don't.
You were supposed to go to Riva's... write in your little notebook, and leave.<eos> But you just had to show up early.<eos> You're working for a drug lord.<eos> You're killing people.<eos> See, that's your problem.<eos> You're too by-the-book.<eos> There are cops that understand the gray area... and cops who have to be eliminated.<eos> And not everybody wants to die... a poor, happy Boy Scout like your father.<eos> - That make you feel better?<eos> - No, but this does!
- Well, gentlemen?<eos> We're signing? - We're signing.<eos> That's a standard agreement.<eos> You sign and it becomes lawfully binding.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll say it once. You impressed me.<eos> You start recording in an hour, concerts begin in a week.<eos> Each concert should last 90 minutes.<eos> You do have that much material?<eos> We do.
You're hereto borrow eggs?<eos> No.<eos> You don't have proper security.<eos> Thank you. I can manage.<eos> I'll be frank.<eos> You have two options.<eos> Concert or complex.<eos> In our world disasters don't go hand in hand. We suggest buying both.<eos> - Do you know who I fucking just played for'?<eos> - We do.
Are you pleased?<eos> The assistant director said it did.<eos> What made you think of a film about people losing their jobs!<eos> Mom, it's not a sad film, it's full of energy, hope.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Good.<eos> - Really!<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - No, you don't!

You don't know how you hurt the ones you love.<eos> Then they get boring and you sweep them from your life.<eos> That's not true!<eos> Margherita, you're always defensive, you just see the bad side, you make me feel ridiculous for wanting to be with you.<eos> Why treat me like this?<eos> Giorgio, we've already broken up.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't you have the slightest...<eos> - It's me, you know, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
Cut it out, Mrs. Capponi is excellent.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - Livia, you don't study, that's it.<eos> But I did lots of quizzes for my license.<eos> - License?<eos> - For the scooter.<eos> The scooter is far off.<eos> But you promised!<eos> - We didn't promise a thing.<eos> - Dad did.
What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Would you come here, please?<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> Look what I found in the drawers.<eos> Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.<eos> - Take it off, it bothers me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - It just does...
Did you see the moon last night?<eos> Yes!<eos> There were many other people, they'd all come out because of the heat.<eos> It was... beautiful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you bring the translations?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Let's see.<eos> Do you like living in Grandma's house?<eos> Do you?
How do you think this makes me feel, man?<eos> I dunno, sir.<eos> Dash it all, I am resolved.<eos> If it is money we need, then it is money we shall have.<eos> Jock?<eos> That's me.<eos> Tomorrow we shall sell off the Rolls to that vulgar American, Milton Krampf, and we will find that painting if it is the last thing we do.<eos> Right-y-oh.<eos> I'll call Spinoza in the morning.<eos> - Yes, do.
- Run, sir!<eos> - Again?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Run, I shall, like a bloody gazelle!<eos> The Mortdecai men have always been in tip-top shape, don't you know?<eos> Fit as a fiddle!<eos> Oh, it's burning...<eos> I... I can't go on...<eos> Want to die...<eos> No, I don't.
Bye.<eos> - He thought we hadn't met up.<eos> - As if.<eos> - Shall we switch these things off?<eos> - Yeah. OK, good.<eos> Right.<eos> So, Jessica.<eos> So...<eos> - Tom says that you work in the City.<eos> - I do, yeah.
- Because it's a fact, Jack.<eos> - It's a fact.<eos> Is it a fact?<eos> Like the fact that you're a triathlete.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Here's a good idea.<eos> Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the bar and we'll see who gets there first?<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what a triathlon is.<eos> - Yes, I do.

It's not that bad.<eos> "It's not that bad."<eos> I ought to knock you out myself.<eos> You know how many times I had to carry your father up these stairs<eos> - because he couldn't walk? - Yes.<eos> How many times I had to wipe his ass because he couldn't use his hands?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No.<eos> You want brain damage.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.<eos> Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.<eos> I think he'd rather be here, talking with you.<eos> There is a resemblance.<eos> I'm usually here all the time, so if you're ever in the neighborhood, come by, if you need something.<eos> I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.<eos> I don't go there.<eos> I haven't been there in a long time.<eos> Since we're pretty much like family who won the third fight?<eos> He did.
Look at me.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> - If I told you-<eos> - Do you really think anyone listens to girls like you?<eos> That anyone cares? They dont.<eos> Youre nothing in the world.<eos> I grew up with girls like you.<eos> People who sacrificed life for revenge and a cause.<eos> I know you.<eos> And so do they.
Passersby looked at me with sad eyes,<eos> This is cool.<eos> It's kinda like a rap.<eos> Iwasmarginalized.<eos> Neighborswhoonce bakedmetreats nowcrossedthestreet toavoidthefreak.<eos> I like it.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Yousee,<eos> I know what it's like to live on the outskirts of a society that would rather have me vanish.<eos> ButI didn't.
That was ten.<eos> Sorry that didn't work for you, Billie.<eos> I'm sleepy.<eos> Alright, who's up now?<eos> I think I know who's up next!<eos> Billie do you know who's up next?<eos> You're up next!<eos> It's Billie's butt.<eos> She doesn't want to play.<eos> Of course she does.
Says she's a scream.<eos> Ya, well I'm doing pretty good too, Jeff.<eos> Alright?<eos> I'mdoin'it withthis hot,nakedchick.<eos> Here,hereI'llshowityou.<eos> Oh!<eos> She's topless.<eos> I can see her breasts!<eos> WheredidYOUcomefrom ?<eos> WhatdidYOURmom do?
Did Jennifer really say those things about me?<eos> No. We were just upset that you were rubbing our faces in it.<eos> She would never say anything like that.<eos> She's an angel.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, Jeff.<eos> Dick, no dick, it doesn't matter.<eos> She doesn't want us.<eos> She doesn't want any of us.<eos> She never did.
Are you calling us idiots?<eos> I'm not calling anybody idiots, all right?<eos> All I'm saying is this... if there is a God, is this something... does this seem like he Would allow this?<eos> Is this something he Would do?<eos> You fuckers are gonna kill me because You're afraid I'm right?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're fucking cowards, huh?<eos> Wait, please.<eos> I didn't even say anything wrong.<eos> He did.
- This isn't a game.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> But you decided to make it a game when you chose sides.<eos> Well, we chose.<eos> We just chose the side that said everyone in here is equal.<eos> No one's special.<eos> You of all people should understand that.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Don't you love your wife?<eos> Of course, I do.
When's his birthday?<eos> - Uh, April.<eos> - April?<eos> 9th April 9th.<eos> What's his name?<eos> What?<eos> What is your husband's name?<eos> He already said his name.<eos> That's right.<eos> He did.
What is your husband's name?<eos> He already said his name.<eos> That's right.<eos> He did.<eos> When?<eos> The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.

Yes, you did.<eos> You said you were married.<eos> Iam married.<eos> Just not to him, and I do have a daughter, Emily.<eos> I didn't lie about that.<eos> How many people in here do you think were married?<eos> Had husbands, wives, kids?<eos> You had no problem with killing any of them.<eos> - I didn't kill them.<eos> - Yes, you did.

What do we do?<eos> It's... it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Okay, There's, uh, seven of us left.<eos> All we need is four.<eos> One, two, three...<eos> Is it a boy or a girl?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> Yes, of course, I do.
- Trust me.<eos> - I don't know about this.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got you this far.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Just do it!
I can't walk because the ass fucking that you have given me has ripped me in two, you fucking piece of shit!<eos> Feel better.<eos> I love you.<eos> Is everything...<eos> - Probably not.<eos> - No.<eos> The fucking caterer has the flu, except I know it's fucking bullshit because we share a client and he told me that he took a higher-paying job.<eos> The cock-sucking douche bag, the day before the motherfucking shindig!<eos> El Pollo Loco?<eos> Hey, do your friends like...
You could pay in installments.<eos> - Right.<eos> But you don't want that, do you?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, thanks a lot.<eos> Great, thank you. - Bye.<eos> Let me see!<eos> Why are you looking at that?<eos> You said you didn't like him.<eos> - Well, I don't.
Yeah, so?<eos> It's just - I know what you mean.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you want some?<eos> Listen to me! It feels what I feel!<eos> Open up, I need to piss!<eos> You're not the only ones here!<eos> - Dude, chill out!<eos> Think I'm fucking with you, right?<eos> No, I don't.
Masuo Umezaki.<eos> Maya...<eos> Umezaki.<eos> Ann.<eos> And who is that one for?<eos> Me.<eos> You.<eos> Well, not yet awhile, surely?<eos> Did you finish what you had to do?<eos> Yes, I did.
- that Alice...<eos> - "Lately".<eos> lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.<eos> There's seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door...<eos> Ma...<eos> Hey Jack, do you remember mouse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> I do.
Hold on.<eos> Let's turn over.<eos> Turn. Just turn.<eos> Okay.<eos> See?<eos> See, slower.<eos> Come on, fat ass.<eos> Are we gonna go to your place?<eos> I thought you wanted to look at boats with me.<eos> Well, yeah, I do.
I don't even know why you brought me here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't get nervous in the service, okay?<eos> We're just gonna look at this boat real quick.<eos> You look nice today.<eos> What?<eos> You look pretty.<eos> And you're not fat.<eos> You know, you have a great body.<eos> I do not.
Just because your mother and I no longer share a marital bed...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Gross.<eos> You have to understand, it's difficult to go from raising you and your sister to barely having a say in any of your decisions.<eos> Whose choice was that?<eos> Well, if you must know, it was your mother's.<eos> And that is not to say I was without fault, but she became increasingly frightening to me in some sense.<eos> She does not live life according to rules I understand.<eos> Pascal, do you really want to help?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I'm starving.<eos> So, where'd Monroe go this morning?<eos> EST.<eos> It's this personal growth workshop thing he's doing in Sacramento.<eos> That's hilarious.<eos> He's trying to better himself.<eos> I think it's noble.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> - Minnie...<eos> You don't.
Why do you think he would say something like that?<eos> Because he doesn't want you to be happy.<eos> He can't deal with the fact that you've moved on, and he hasn't.<eos> You are so full of shit, Monroe!<eos> I've seen you staring at her tits!<eos> My God, are you...<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Good.<eos> I think we're safe.<eos> Why is this happening?<eos> I need you, Minnie.<eos> I need you to take care of me now.<eos> I love you.<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't love me?<eos> I do.
I...<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, you don't love me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
But use caution-- there are eyes everywhere.<eos> Sooner or later, the casino will catch on.<eos> And that is when you must flash the "get the hell out" signal.<eos> What a haul.<eos> One more night like this, and we'll be able to fix the church in style.<eos> What a rush-- it got my blood pumping in a way I thought only quiet reflection could.<eos> Fizzy water for everyone.<eos> I think we can do something a little harder than that.<eos> Now, that's a marshmallow-y s'more-garita.<eos> Homer, Homer, we did it.

Make sure it's actually in there.<eos> To the right?<eos> Okay, I'm changing the subject.<eos> Um, how long will your uncle be in the hospital?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> It's all about the transplant taking.<eos> Well, until he's better, you can come over for dinner here anytime, okay?<eos> I don't want you eating by yourself.<eos> I mean it. Thanks, but I don't wanna impose.<eos> Oh, I do.
What's up?<eos> Hey, man, you're back.<eos> How was the trip?<eos> Hey, Dad, this is, uh, Noah.<eos> Remember, I've been talking about him a lot? Hey, nice to meet you!<eos> I feel like I know you, he talks about you so much.<eos> Told me about the alternator you put in the truck.<eos> Oh, actually, Kevin helped out, too, so...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I did.
My behavior?<eos> And I'm not going to stand for it.<eos> Just let me go.<eos> So, what, your shit-head husband comes crawling back and you're just done with me?<eos> Suddenly, I'm nothing to you?<eos> Like what we had never even happened.<eos> It was one night, and it was a mistake!<eos> We had nothing!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Yes, we did.
When you see this face, it means I'm about to whoop ass.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Come on.<eos> "You gave me life when I was dying.<eos> And when I was leaving this world..."<eos> - Quinn!<eos> - Jesus, you scared me!<eos> I need to rely on you to get him up and going.<eos> - He's lying around like a corpse.<eos> - No, I did.
Bad if you operate, bad if you don't.<eos> Well, is there anything I can do for you?<eos> No!<eos> No, it's cancer.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You want to do something?<eos> Make sure this plan works.<eos> I'm out of options.<eos> We were so young. We thought we knew everything.<eos> We did.
Well, look at us. Just a couple of jailbirds.<eos> Except you actually committed a crime.<eos> Yet in all this,<eos> I know I'm the luckiest unlucky man ever to live, because you and the children warm, feed, clothe, pacify, and rejuvenate me by never leaving my heart.<eos> Love, Prisoner Number 7551.<eos> We're not gonna take that hill from the Japs with bullets, bombs or fists.<eos> Yeah! We're gonna take it with blood.<eos> Whoever spills more, loses.<eos> And we don't lose.<eos> Do we? No!

Proud?<eos> Who the hell gets to be proud?<eos> You.<eos> You do.<eos> You with your fake names and your fronts. You've got all the work you want.<eos> I gotta go out in the world every day. This is my work.<eos> I've got nobody else to be.<eos> I did what I had to.<eos> You did what you wanted, Eddie.<eos> And you did it for more.
God damn it!<eos> Fuck!<eos> No, Ella!<eos> Help, Ella!<eos> Ella!<eos> Help!<eos> You're too late.<eos> I already called the police.<eos> They know where I am!<eos> No, you didn't.
~ We need to stick to what we agreed.<eos> ~ Promise me I'm safe, Alec.<eos> ~ I've told you.<eos> Everything's OK.<eos> ~ So, you're staying?<eos> ~ No, I've got things I need to do.<eos> ~ I don't like being here by myself.<eos> ~ Stop worrying.<eos> ~ You don't know what he's capable of.<eos> I do.
Hi. ~ He's got bad news.<eos> Who has?<eos> Oh, hi, Ben.<eos> Mark, Jocelyn's here with Ben.<eos> You're taking our case, then?<eos> ~ This trial is gonna put more demands on you.<eos> I'll put more demands on you. ~ We want the truth to come out.<eos> ~ Knowing the truth and getting justice isn't the same thing.<eos> ~ We understand that.<eos> No, you really don't.
Ah!<eos> Your coachman made a leisurely ride of it, I see.<eos> ~ Where's Drawlight?<eos> ~ Yes. Strange gave Drawlight a message.<eos> What does it say?<eos> He says that he is coming.<eos> That is all.<eos> Strange is coming to England?<eos> ~ To you, sir.<eos> ~ To do what?
I don't care what you think you got!<eos> If I want your help, I will ask for it.<eos> Otherwise, you stay in that hotel room.<eos> Hey, Alex!<eos> Larry!<eos> Don't try to leave, Mr. Burke.<eos> That's rule number one.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, who gave you permission to be back there?<eos> I did.
Theresa, I can't...<eos> You can't disclose any details.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I heard it a million times from Ethan to the point where we barely talked.<eos> Theresa.<eos> I need to know if Ethan is in Boise.<eos> I can't believe you went to the hospital.<eos> Maybe you do have brain damage.<eos> I thought I saw my wife and kid.<eos> Maybe you did.
It was acutely averse to all things related to religion.<eos> Even more than it was to electroshock.<eos> And that poor priest... he was just a pawn.<eos> We were very much against involving the Church.<eos> We didn't want to turn this into a sideshow.<eos> At the same time, we had to gain control somehow.<eos> This one, too.<eos> Thumbprint on that one as well.<eos> - Do you understand everything?<eos> - I do, yes.
I walk away.<eos> I always walk away.<eos> But, uh I can't walk away from you.<eos> So...if that's okay... You're my daughter.<eos> A-and I would like to walk you down the aisle.<eos> - Living in a moment I would die for.<eos> These words best describe every minute of everyday of the last five years.<eos> That's why I'm standing in front of our family and our friends but most importantly, in front of you and in the presence of God to vow to be your faithfully committed ...lifetime companion.<eos> -Do you know what I mean about the grass, Aaron?<eos> -Yes, I do.
We have two days. We have to recruit more members and put together some sort of performance that doesn't totally humiliate us as a team.<eos> Uh, I have an idea that you are not gonna like, but you need to consider.<eos> We need to recruit Kitty.<eos> - No, Kurt!<eos> No!<eos> - Rachel, come on.<eos> She's talented. She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.

Yes, I am, actually. I am calling you a wussy.<eos> You don't think I've noticed you skulking around the glee club or I haven't seen you coincidentally reading a book just outside the choir room during rehearsal?<eos> I'm walking a tightrope, man.<eos> I've got no wiggle room.<eos> I got to be tougher, stronger and more manly than everyone else on the team because if they smell even a little bit of gay on me, I'm not their teammate anymore.<eos> I'm just another homo.<eos> Dude, that's not true, okay?<eos> Times have changed. If I join the glee club, everything I worked so hard for, it's ruined.<eos> But you want to join.<eos> Of course I do.
You'll probably have an easier experience at this school if you do.<eos> But if you don't want to, then we'll just stay here and-and we'll work super hard and put our noses to the grindstone and we might even have to pull an all-nighter.<eos> An all-nighter?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> Yeah, and we can order pizza and root beer and have, like, a party.<eos> I'm s... Are-are you joining us?<eos> You want to win, don't you?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, we do!
Give me your hands.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> There's blood.<eos> What were those things on the other side of the wall?<eos> Wolves.<eos> This is wolf country.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this.<eos> That man almost killed us, Ethan.<eos> Well, he didn't.
What do you know about my experience?<eos> More than most.<eos> It's my job as Mayor.<eos> And it's the kind of power that your new position affords, as well.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, Mr. Mayor, as the new Sheriff, I really look forward to working with you in the future.<eos> Best of luck on your first day.<eos> This is just for a few days until your dad finishes his case, all right?<eos> Try not to draw too much attention.<eos> I never do.
You know, it wasn't like that...<eos> Don't joke about these things, Fred.<eos> The prostate is serious.<eos> You are always fall for my jokes, Mick.<eos> You've been believing my every word for sixty years.<eos> I invent stories, Fred.<eos> I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.<eos> Do you remember the other day? When you told me you don't remember your parents any more?<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Of course you do.
- That's enough!<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> I just do not understand.<eos> What exactly is the problem?<eos> The problem is that I composed the "Simple Songs" for my wife.<eos> And only she has ever performed them. And only she has recorded them.<eos> And as long as I live, she will be the only one to sing them.<eos> The problem is, dear sir... my wife can't sing any more.<eos> Now do you understand?<eos> Do you?
In fact, to tell the truth, it's also the present.<eos> Look, let's be frank. Because nobody ever speaks frankly in this fucking film world.<eos> You're going on eighty And like most of your colleagues, you're getting worse with age.<eos> You know, the last three films you made were shit, Mick.<eos> I'm telling you, according to me, according to everybody,<eos> - They were real shit!<eos> - How dare you?<eos> How dare you?<eos> So you want to be frank?<eos> Do you?
Just so...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Um, I hit him with a spoon and his lungs exploded.<eos> -It wasn't his lungs.<eos> -No, that's what happened.<eos> 'Cause he couldn't breathe, 'cause I got him in the neck.<eos> Your lungs aren't in your neck, they're in your chest.<eos> I know that, Phoebe.<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Hey Roy.<eos> - A ritual?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's a great story.<eos> - Does it surprise you?<eos> My father worships the devil?<eos> What would you think?<eos> Good girl.<eos> - Why don't you ask him.<eos> - I did.
The first two we can't trace. The third was to you. Your ex-service emergency voicemail.<eos> I haven't checked that in months. You must know that.<eos> - Why call you?<eos> Last time I spoke to him was the night he decommissioned me from MI5 three years ago. Well, he wants to chat now. That makes you useful.<eos> Will you help us find him?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You and Harry ever talk much about Berlin?<eos> The night your father died?<eos> Yeah, he told me what happened.<eos> Did he?
There's no need to cut this man's body.<eos> Why does an apparently healthy favourite son of this city... become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?<eos> Cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why.<eos> - Prepare the body, please.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just...<eos> You're asked to leave it alone.<eos> But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.
My bar.<eos> Thank you anyway.<eos> I confess, I knew it was your bar.<eos> Just a gesture for a pretty lady.<eos> You must be new here.<eos> I am, in fact.<eos> How could you tell?<eos> I don't fuck customers.<eos> Everybody here knows it.<eos> Now you do, too.
Twice.<eos> Shipwrecked.<eos> And you see something like that and you think to yourself,<eos> "Oh, worth it."<eos> Are you an orphan?<eos> My ma left me.<eos> That count?<eos> Well, do you remember her?<eos> I'm not wasting tears missing someone who never missed me.<eos> Maybe she does.
Then that's your decision.<eos> Not mine.<eos> Well, kid.<eos> Looks like the old gang's back together.<eos> Let's get this ship in the air.<eos> Let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm not the chosen one, and the prophecy wasn't about me if it was ever real at all.<eos> But I am my mother's son.<eos> And if Blackbeard is going to destroy everything my parents died for, I'll stand against him to the last.<eos> Just like they did.
Yo, I told you she was hairy, B.<eos> - What are you doing here waking my family up?<eos> Chuy, keep it down or I'm gonna come out there and shut you up.<eos> Come on, let's talk outside.<eos> Okay, what's up?<eos> He)', 9W8. What's going on?<eos> So my dad's MIA right now.<eos> He left a really weird message and disappeared.<eos> - You call the cops?<eos> - My mom did.
Not exactly the best way to send you off.<eos> Well, so, you're sending me off, huh?<eos> I've been thinking about what you said, about us both deserving to have our lives just be a little easier, a little less burdened, and it really hit home with me tonight.<eos> And not because I have feelings for the chef or anything, but I couldn't help but think, what if I did?<eos> It wouldn't be hard to tell the girls.<eos> There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past.<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do. You deserve that.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> We both do.
Just never found God.<eos> I looked, but, um...<eos> I even went to the chapel once.<eos> But yeah, he wasn't there.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Was anybody there for you?<eos> At the chapel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did that person help you?<eos> Yeah, he did.
We shouldn't joke about that.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - How many times?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Okay.<eos> (Whispering) This is ridiculous.<eos> I feel like I'm back in high school.<eos> Doesn't your mom assume that we're sleeping together?<eos> - You're 24.<eos> - (Whispering) Well, she does.
You, seriously?<eos> Wow, you really did have some fun in New York after the Mets game.<eos> That was just a lucky guess.<eos> Nice haircut, by the way.<eos> What is that?<eos> Your lame attempt to go undercover and stalk me more?<eos> We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No one does.
- that you weren't going to college?<eos> - They were fine with it.<eos> They're into "whatever makes you happy."<eos> God, I am so jealous.<eos> Okay, now you're just showing off.<eos> So you seem good.<eos> I mean, it's been a while since I've seen you, but...<eos> But last time you did, I was crazy.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Actually, you did.
- Who knows when that'll be.<eos> So, along with our trip, I'll also be missing everything at work, Thanksgiving, our families annual drive to Amherst to see the leaves change... Brenna's 17th birthday.<eos> Well, leaves are stupid anyway.<eos> - What?<eos> - I just had this...<eos> Dumb thought that... I might never have my own wedding.<eos> April, you...<eos> You can't think like that.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't, really.
- No no no, um...<eos> I just wanna do something first.<eos> Well, why can't we just go together?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Umm, I'm so sorry for not calling or anything.<eos> Brenna told me, but I just...<eos> After the other night, I didn't know what to say.<eos> I still don't.
She'll wait for a chance to ambush.<eos> Evasion's your only tactic until you've made a plan of Surprizal.<eos> What do you think I showed you that Viking attack for?<eos> To teach me the Surprizal tactic.<eos> Why?<eos> To win the fight with the dog!<eos> So?<eos> So, It was all about killing<eos> I don't want to kill him!<eos> You don't?
Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> Say what?<eos> What?<eos> You said half?<eos> Half your money's gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> You made it sound like he took everything.<eos> - Didn't you think?<eos> - I did, yeah.
Half?<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you know what, there's still no excuse.<eos> You don't show up for work like this.<eos> I have been in this business for almost fourt... forever.<eos> And I have never seen this kind of behavior.<eos> I'll tell you, if an actor showed up like this on Kelly Girl...<eos> On what?<eos> Does no one remember my fucking show?<eos> I do.
What do you know about his brother?<eos> I wasn't aware he had one.<eos> Guillermo.<eos> His brother's name is Guillermo.<eos> Do you know anything about his cousin?<eos> I didn't know he had one of those either.<eos> None of that is in his file.<eos> His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> No one does.
Ah.<eos> I don't even know if I'd watch it all the time, but it would be on all the time.<eos> - Right.<eos> I'd occasionally get sucked into. Right.<eos> What, did you watch a lot of TV when you were a kid?<eos> - Yeah, a lot.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You'?<eos> I, uh... Me?<eos> Um, yeah, no, I did.
Here, turn this on.<eos> This is on, right?<eos> - It is.<eos> Why? -Go ahead.<eos> - Do you wanna...<eos> I'll do it. -Yeah?<eos> - Julie wrote me a fan letter.<eos> -Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Mmm-hmm. I really did.
-I may have to buy your book and read it.<eos> - Yeah, sorry about that.<eos> - Oh. No!<eos> - Wasn't he wonderful?<eos> -He was wonderful.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> So, you have the rest of the day free.<eos> Where would you like to go?<eos> Do you know where the Mall of America is?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Horrible.<eos> - Pretty good, huh?<eos> - You have got to be kidding me. - That was a waste of two hours.<eos> And when Travolta got impaled by the thing.<eos> - Yeah. You liked that, huh?<eos> -The worst movie I've ever seen.<eos> - He saved humanity, Betsy.<eos> -No, he did not.
-The worst movie I've ever seen.<eos> - He saved humanity, Betsy.<eos> -No, he did not.<eos> - Have a heart.<eos> -He made it worse.<eos> - You've changed. -He made it worse.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> - Do you have a TV?<eos> -Uh-huh.<eos> I do.
I gotta go.<eos> - David?<eos> - Good morning!<eos> And how are we this morning?<eos> I think I'll sit up front.<eos> Oh, okay, let me just, um, get my stuff.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think to write down where we parked the car?<eos> No, I didn't, okay?
The worst thing about getting a lot of attention paid to you is that you're afraid of bad attention.<eos> And if bad attention hurts you, the caliber of the weapon pointed at you has gone way up, you know. Like, from a .22 to a .45.<eos> Look, there are parts of me that want a lot of attention and think I'm really great, and want other people to see it.<eos> I think that's one of the ways you and I are sort of alike, you know.<eos> All right. Hey.<eos> All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> -David.<eos> I'm not so sure you wanna be me.<eos> I don't.
I've been practicing, but you know, I can't do really big magic.<eos> Not like your mom with her wand.<eos> I mean, one swoosh from that thing and you could probably have whatever features you wanted.<eos> She doesn't use the wand anymore.<eos> She believes the real magic is in the books. And not the spell books, regular books with history and stuff.<eos> What a rip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, she used magic on Cinderella, who wasn't even her real daughter.<eos> Doesn't she love you?<eos> Well, of course she does.
I'm an only child.<eos> And I've only ever lived in one place.<eos> Me, too.<eos> That-we have so much in common already.<eos> No.<eos> Trust me, we do not.<eos> And now you're gonna be king.<eos> Yeah. - What?<eos> A crown doesn't make you a king.<eos> Well, it kind of does.
Fast.<eos> Ten years ago this place was a school.<eos> It's just me here now.<eos> I've lost my wife, I've lost the farm.<eos> I don't want to lose my son.<eos> - Bedwyr's asthmatic, isn't he?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Does he smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> - Somebody with him does.
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.<eos> Here, last piece.<eos> Does he know how famous you once was?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Black eye.<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward the confederacy put on the head of major marquis?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting, but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they?<eos> No they didn't.
What the fuck I tell you about talkin', huh?<eos> I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people, I don't give a fuck!<eos> You never gave your name, sir.<eos> John Ruth.<eos> - Are you a lawman?<eos> - I'm takin' her to the law.<eos> - You're a bounty hunter?<eos> - That's right, Buster.<eos> - Do you have a warrant?<eos> - 'Course I do.
What's your name, Buster?<eos> It certainly isn't Buster.<eos> It's oswaldo mobray.<eos> - Oswaldo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I got my warrant, oswaldo.<eos> - I take it you're Daisy domergue?<eos> - Yeah it's her.<eos> - It says here, dead or alive?<eos> - Yeah it does.
Minnie still serve food?<eos> - Do you consider stew food?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then we serve food.<eos> She still stinking' up the place with her "old quail" pipe tobacco?<eos> Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.<eos> She rolls her own.<eos> "Red apple tobacco"<eos> but mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.<eos> Yeah I do, senor Bob.
You want some stew, o.B.?<eos> Stew, later.<eos> That's nice.<eos> How you doin', black major?<eos> I ain't in the mood, Chris mannix. Leave me be from your horseshit.<eos> John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter?<eos> I tole' you jackass to hee-haw somewhere else.<eos> That's right, John.<eos> - You did say, didn't ya'?<eos> - Yeah I did.
Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall don't practice in poison need to think about that.<eos> Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor. And about the men standing' next ta' ya' would be responsible.<eos> And I know who I got my money on.<eos> Yeah that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you.<eos> Not so fast Chris.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> Let's slow it down.<eos> Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.

This is Robert, he stay in the room next to mine had a lisp<eos> Please to meet you, I stay in the room 101<eos> I'm on the same floor, 186<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Why not<eos> One of these days gonna be me on one of those yachts<eos> Why those yachts?<eos> The final ordeal before letting you go<eos> The hardest one 15 days of vacation just a couple alone, didn't you read the leaflet?<eos> I did
You should...<eos> Ok, if you think I should.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I mean, he said he signed the papers.<eos> Shouldn't he have to, like, stick to that?<eos> You'd think so, wouldn't ya?<eos> Well, he was clearly upset by the whole thing.<eos> I think... I hope, anyway, that with a little time and space from the drama of it all, he'll come to his senses.<eos> You really think that's gonna happen?<eos> I do, actually.
Listen...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What is that?<eos> A wall.<eos> To make sure you don't touch me tonight.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry about that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I was being all cranky on Saturday when you went to that fundraiser thingy.<eos> You totally gave me the silent treatment yesterday.<eos> I did not!
- Yeah.<eos> - That's so cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hungry.<eos> Two-thirds or sixth... that's not... I don't know, bud.<eos> You're going to have to talk to one of your siblings about this, 'cause back in my day, math did not look like that.<eos> Hey...<eos> So, I have got good news and I have some less good news.<eos> The good news is, I got my job back.<eos> You did?
But Moms don't know, and if you tell anyone, I will kill you.<eos> - OK.<eos> - I mean it, don't go tattling.<eos> I won't.<eos> But, um... how're you gonna go swimming?<eos> You're gonna hang ten on the pond?<eos> Mom, some of us don't want to get skin cancer, right?<eos> Yeah, but there is something called sunscreen, you know.<eos> Did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens that show up in people's livers?<eos> No, I didn't.
And Kaitlyn is like a bitch times a billion since you left.<eos> - [laughs] - She's so freaked out by your new team.<eos> Yeah, our team of two.<eos> You guys already have the best dancers at school.<eos> Well, there's two we don't have.<eos> What you guys did was pretty awesome.<eos> Putting Kaitlyn in her place.<eos> Nobody else had the guts to do it.<eos> I should've walked, too.<eos> Well, why don't you?
OK.<eos> You know, I don't get it.<eos> You took Jude and Callie in.<eos> And this baby, she's my sister.<eos> You know, I wonder if Ana's talked to Mike about this.<eos> He's gonna lose it.<eos> He's been working overtime trying to convince her that she can stay clean and do this.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She's probably just gonna change her mind anyway.<eos> Yeah, but what if she doesn't?
I know, I know.<eos> - Come on, what we had was real.<eos> - That's right.<eos> When I met you, I was lost.<eos> I was a fucking mess, all right?<eos> I was so insecure, and you saved me, all right?<eos> You rescued me.<eos> Now, I don't know what to do. I...<eos> - You know what to do.<eos> - No, I don't.
~ She's been shot?<eos> ~ That's right.<eos> This morning.<eos> For God's sake, Kenton, let them in.<eos> I'll sign for them.<eos> As you wish, Mr Stafford.<eos> Miss Pierce.<eos> Hilda.<eos> Of course I knew her.<eos> Everyone did.
Well, I'm just curious.<eos> You say someone was hurt, but Miles wouldn't hurt anyone.<eos> We've gone through a great deal, Mr Foyle, especially Miles.<eos> He's always been very sensitive and... when his father left us, that was bad enough.<eos> But Sophie was everything to him, and they were inseparable.<eos> My son was a pilot, too.<eos> ~ Fighters?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Then you'll know how hard it was for them when it was all over.<eos> I do.
You're a brute and a fool!<eos> Do you think I went and got captured by the English on purpose?<eos> Aye, I do think ye did it on purpose to get back at me for what happened at the glade.<eos> At the glade?<eos> With the British deserters?<eos> You think, to punish you, I went for a walk in the woods on... On the chance that some British soldiers would be going by?<eos> Christ, Jamie, I went for a walk!<eos> I ordered you to stay put.<eos> I don't have to do what you tell me to.<eos> Aye, you do.
Since then, I've learned a lot more about nukes.<eos> I pieced this one together from three duds.<eos> People here are scared shitless of it.<eos> That's a nuke?<eos> That's right.<eos> And the man... who first brought the nukes here, the man that murdered my wife and daughter, he came out of that building.<eos> So the question is, who is the man from the building?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who is the man from the building?<eos> I... I don't...
This is going to sound insane, but the entire office has been turned into--<eos> Vampires.<eos> Affirmative, sir.<eos> What?<eos> What, you know?<eos> Oh!<eos> Did I not mention that Frank was there?<eos> No, Tim.<eos> God damn it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Why do you think he hasn't turned you yet, Ted?<eos> He was going to turn me last.<eos> Make it special with candles.<eos> -Oh.<eos> -That makes sense.<eos> You were going to force me out?<eos> Hey, quick, while you still have time, Ted.<eos> Fire this- -Oh god!<eos> It actually works.<eos> He really did that.
God is our refuge and strength.<eos> A very present hope in times of trouble.<eos> Psalm 46.<eos> One of my favourites.<eos> But how are you doing?<eos> I..<eos> I'm scared, father.<eos> Cast thy burden unto the lord and he shall sustain thee.<eos> I have faith in God's strength, believe me.<eos> I do.
Take the wheel and start the engine.<eos> Wait wait wait, where are you?<eos> Just do what I say.<eos> Okay, just hang on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Diagonally across the square there is a dark blue sedan between a truck and a small car.<eos> See it?<eos> Okay just I...<eos> Okay yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Do you...<eos> Philippe?<eos> I knew it!<eos> Philippe Petit.<eos> Daredevil wire walker.<eos> I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes!<eos> -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
Hold on to your bag<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I'm hungry<eos> But you said you ate<eos> Sit here.<eos> I'll sit over there<eos> Give me some kachori with onions<eos> You eat onions?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But my family don't
I've just lived as a widow<eos> This is your time. You both should make the most of it<eos> No one is running in that race<eos> What's the use?<eos> Thinking of what's useful has done nothing for us<eos> Doesn't matter if you win or lose.<eos> Do it for yourselves<eos> Forcing never achieved anything<eos> He doesn't want to<eos> As if you do
Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight, but you should know that there are some serious doubts from people at the State Department.<eos> You mean Cathy.<eos> And some on her staff.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand<eos> - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't.<eos> No. - You don't.
- Yep.<eos> Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't.<eos> No. - You don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I don't.
Oh, cool, you know him.<eos> I-I know of him.<eos> I thought he died, like, years ago.<eos> Nah, he faked that. Yeah.<eos> He's been hiding in Argentina since, like, the '40s.<eos> I know he's got a weird rep, and people think he's sketchy or whatever, but in person, he's actually pretty cool.<eos> Like, this one time we did karaoke.<eos> What?<eos> He was hilarious.<eos> He did Tina Turner, Gladys Knight.
Interiors, exteriors, um, anything really.<eos> You did?<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Ben Crawford.<eos> Mr. Crawford, Andrea Cornell.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have some more questions.<eos> I'd like you to come down to the station.<eos> I'm not gonna let you do this to me.<eos> Do what?
Can I just, like, grab a sandwich or something?<eos> No.<eos> No talking.<eos> - Like a snack?<eos> - No more talking.<eos> Right now, you're gonna take a sip of that drink... and you're gonna go straight to the bedroom.<eos> I don't know what's happening right now.<eos> I feel like if you could just include me...<eos> Do you want me to make you?<eos> - Do I...
No, I know.<eos> I know, Frankie, I'm sorry.<eos> You're going to school, and I need to get your socks on.<eos> I don't wanna go to school!<eos> Do not kick me because--<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, Frankie, okay.<eos> Why are you so upset right now?<eos> I don't want to go to school.<eos> You don't?
I thought she was going to the bathroom.<eos> She's up to something.<eos> - Oh. - Damn, girl.<eos> - What?<eos> Where you been?<eos> You want some of this or what? - 'Cause I'm not waiting around.<eos> - Depends.<eos> On what?<eos> - You want some of me?<eos> Do you?
She's up to something.<eos> - Oh. - Damn, girl.<eos> - What?<eos> Where you been?<eos> You want some of this or what? - 'Cause I'm not waiting around.<eos> - Depends.<eos> On what?<eos> - You want some of me?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
I should've remembered that you guys come here.<eos> But Run-DMC, I got to see it! Finally.<eos> - You liked it?<eos> - It was awesome.<eos> This is what you guys missed.<eos> She did Miley Cyrus.<eos> She destroyed Wrecking Ball.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> - You still like that song.<eos> - Everybody does.
She wanted to move in... and you said you weren't in the right head place for her to move in.<eos> That's some straight-up bullshit.<eos> Give me some, Ma.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> What, are you guys ganging up on me now?<eos> You like this woman?<eos> Yeah, she's awesome... but there's a whole history here that he's brushing over.<eos> You want her back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Why past tense?<eos> Because he has escaped.<eos> You had no food yesterday.<eos> You have some today.<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> - How?<eos> The blacksmith left it for me, boss.<eos> When a man escapes, he takes as much food with him as he can.<eos> - He leaves nothing behind.<eos> - But he did, boss.
- Disperse!<eos> - Disperse, you've been told.<eos> Disperse!<eos> Now!<eos> Back to work!<eos> Company! - To your duties!<eos> - Hello, Katherine.<eos> - Hello, boss.<eos> We did not discuss the nights you would come.<eos> We did, boss.
Do you have children?<eos> Yes.<eos> What would you do for them?<eos> I would sacrifice my life for them.<eos> Of course.<eos> But would you sacrifice your reputation?<eos> Respect?<eos> Honour?<eos> I would.<eos> I did, boss.
He got it the day before we sailed.<eos> He's... he's never going to see her again anyway.<eos> It's...<eos> How was I to know he would one day learn to read?<eos> Will you hang Tommy Barrett?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you looking forward to it?<eos> No.<eos> No-one wants to see a man like that hang.<eos> Quite a few soldiers do.
Oh, I hope she takes that stupid bear, and she's like, "Oh, my baby daddy done did me wrong with Little Booboo."<eos> - She's not even black.<eos> - That's racist.<eos> You know something?<eos> That's gonna be super tough.<eos> Because she's very smart and guarded, and her last relationship, it was, uh, it was rough, right, Doc?<eos> Yeah, she does show some signs of, uh, PTSD, it's true.<eos> - And she also... - And that is why we cast her... for the crazy, all right?<eos> Besides, she knew what she was in for.<eos> They all do.
- No, just cut out. Just let go.<eos> Let go of the button.<eos> - I...<eos> - Let go!<eos> Never mind.<eos> We good?<eos> Okay, you know what? I don't...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to be doing this crap any more than you do.<eos> I don't.
Do not say, "some of my best friends were black."<eos> You know that's what racists say.<eos> I am not a racist.<eos> And that's the other thing they say.<eos> I did not come here to be disrespected!<eos> No.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Let's, uh, let's -- okay.<eos> Let's, um -- let's get you a drink over here.<eos> I didn't do anything.
Chet's screwing me.<eos> Sorry, Quinn, but I kind of feel like everybody knows that.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I mean... he's trying to say that I stalked him.<eos> Why the hell would he say that?<eos> - Because I'm suing him.<eos> - What are you suing him for?<eos> Because I created this... "Everlasting."<eos> - You did? - Yep.
Hey, I'm off the clock. I've got my cell but I'm just gonna go crash, okay?<eos> What, don't you mean hide, hard core?<eos> Aww.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> When the dragon's away, the mice will play.<eos> My girls are moving on up.<eos> Bam!<eos> Really?<eos> Adam said that?<eos> He did.
What do you even know about it?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that you can eat whatever you want.<eos> You have your... your Greek omelet for breakfast, your cheeseburger for lunch... you don't even exercise, so you're barfing, too?<eos> Or you just have some freak metabolism?<eos> "Barfing, too"?<eos> No.<eos> I would never.<eos> And how do you know what I eat, anyway?<eos> I-I just do.
[Laughs] Look, they just want to know where<eos> - the bodies are buried.<eos> - No, they are looking for a scapegoat.<eos> I'm in the cross hairs, and you know it.<eos> They came down hard on you.<eos> I get that.<eos> But Kirk's lawyers are gonna worse.<eos> Every crumb goes under the microscope.<eos> You got to tell them everything. You did, right?<eos> I did.
Well what was that about?<eos> You literally held me prisoner.<eos> You suck at poker, Shia, so I didn't want to put you in the position of having to bluff.<eos> Listen, the police... they ruled Mary's death a suicide, so there's not gonna be any more questions.<eos> Shia: Really?<eos> Is that all you care about?<eos> Getting away with it?<eos> Don't either of you feel guilty?<eos> - Those girls know what they signed on for.<eos> - No, they don't.
We're engaged.<eos> I caught you getting your knob polished by a teenager.<eos> Whatever.<eos> She's a mouth.<eos> Yes, maybe I could have been a little more prudent.<eos> Oh, good God, Chet.<eos> You want me begging every time I get a boner?<eos> I'd be mauling you five times a day.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
I promise.<eos> We have a wedding to plan in London.<eos> Yeah, no, absolutely.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Yeah, I'm... I'm in, I'm in, yeah.<eos> Okay, so I just want to assume that it's gonna be Anna.<eos> Uh, actually, um... Oh?<eos> I just had a candid conversation with Grace, I'm starting to think I might go with the other option.<eos> Yes, well, I called it, I just want to say, day one.<eos> No, you didn't.
Good news travels fast.<eos> Okay, Grace, listen, I know that you want to win the show, and I think... actually, it would actually be really great, but I-I'm just telling you this as a friend...<eos> Okay, the thing is that Adam is...<eos> Gonna propose to me and I'm gonna say yes.<eos> [Chuckles] Even though he's sleeping around?<eos> Not a problem.<eos> Well, even though he's sleeping with me?<eos> We had sex last night... dirty sex.<eos> He almost left the show for me.<eos> But he didn't.
- Thank you.<eos> Now, Adam, are you ready to pop the question?<eos> After much consideration, yes.<eos> Each of you are so remarkable, and I can imagine my life with most of you.<eos> Well, here goes nothing.<eos> Grace... you know the powerful connection that we shared.<eos> But I'm sorry, you're just not my wife.<eos> Anna... seeing you here today in my country with my family...<eos> I realize how beautifully you fit in here and how beautifully we fit, and I... only hope that you feel the same way, too.<eos> I do.
- Maybe.<eos> "Maybe," yeah. Go, then.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go.<eos> Do it.<eos> Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
This week, it is spa dates, all right?<eos> We've got four girls left...<eos> Anna, Faith, Grace, and Shamiqua.<eos> Let's heat things up.<eos> Let's keep America guessing.<eos> Come on, nobody is guessing.<eos> That boy is going for Grace.<eos> - You don't know that for sure.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, you don't...
I have no idea what she'll do from one moment to the next.<eos> She's completely unreliable.<eos> - Reckless?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's why I like her.<eos> Reminds me of myself at that age.<eos> You're not gonna ruin my little trip down nostalgia lane, are you?<eos> There's nothing nostalgic about you, sergeant.<eos> Do you wanna catch this guy?<eos> - Of course I do.
- Message?<eos> Would it be clearer if he cut off your fingertips?<eos> Oh, that's cute.<eos> Because I'm a writer?<eos> Because of my articles?<eos> Writing is a generous term.<eos> Saying bad things about bad people, it doesn't always end well.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't have written them.<eos> Well, I didn't write all of them.<eos> - Then, who did?
What are you doing here?<eos> What's going on?<eos> the,uh...<eos> Doctor here thinks my fiancée-- fiancée,really?<eos> Why is your fiancée getting a lumbar puncture?<eos> uh,neurosyphilis. Getting a lumbar puncture? uh,neurosyphilis.<eos> She certainly does get around,<eos> She certainly does get around, doesn't she? Doesn't she?<eos> yes.<eos> yes. Yes, she does. Yes, she does.
They're in the foreign service in Nigeria.<eos> This is friendly, okay?<eos> No lawyer in tow.<eos> Find something to jog his memory.<eos> This is all their social media, isn't it?<eos> All their texts, photos, posts.<eos> You're rebuilding the night from everything they posted on the Internet.<eos> This is what we do here.<eos> People have no idea the trail of information they expose to the world.<eos> Some of us do.
Okay, this is some kind of trick.<eos> I don't understand what you're saying to me, okay?<eos> Th... this is not happening.<eos> Okay, this can not be happening, okay?<eos> I... I know Amy put up a front, but she was a good person, okay?<eos> Why would somebody try to kill her?<eos> Max?<eos> Tell me what really happened last night.<eos> Look, I don't remember.<eos> I don't.
- We should go out.<eos> - George.<eos> That's four of us.<eos> Four definitely makes a party.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Lindy?<eos> - Yes, Lindy.<eos> - Yeah, sorry.<eos> George and I have some work that we really need to catch up on.<eos> - Do we?
What?<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> I'll take the floor.<eos> You can't sleep on the floor.<eos> Sure I can.<eos> I spent a month in the outback with nothing more than a blanket.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> They build us tough in Australia.<eos> You never told me why you moved there.<eos> No, I didn't.
Surprise!<eos> You're him.<eos> Him who?<eos> The killer.<eos> Hello, Eye Candy.<eos> Why? !<eos> Why what?<eos> You killed Ben.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Target."<eos> Hey, have you seen J.J.?<eos> Excuse me, do you know J.J.?<eos> - I'm looking for...<eos> - J.J., yeah.<eos> I got that.<eos> He told me to meet him here.<eos> Nobody ever really meets J.J.<eos> I talked to him online and he said to come here.<eos> Did he?
The killer led me down here, left me a phone to find.<eos> Can you trace it?<eos> Yeah, I... I guess, I... It's just gonna take some time.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Kent is out.<eos> It's not him we want to see.<eos> We spoke to Jennifer Marino.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
I leave that to Banana Boat triple-defense sunscreen for men.<eos> - What?<eos> - You didn't notice anything there?<eos> I don't know what we're looking for.<eos> Fucking Lawless!<eos> Oliver Lawless.<eos> - From high school?<eos> - Yes, from high school.<eos> On a national commercial.<eos> He did it.
When you're older, a lot of different factors come into play.<eos> I mean, a lot of it had to with...<eos> Dad, are you okay?<eos> It's okay. It'll be okay.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I really fucked up.<eos> Mom hates me.<eos> I don't think she hates you.<eos> I just think maybe...<eos> She does.
He wants to get to know you better.<eos> It's a perfectly reasonable request.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, it's just business, nothing more?<eos> Everything in regards to ballet is such a delicate balance, isn't it?<eos> Nothing has been explicitly stated.<eos> They call them "fuck-me shoes."<eos> - Beg your pardon?<eos> Who does?
Oh, just be yourself.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> I have a sneaking suspicion that you're gonna have a great day.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - 21.<eos> So, Jessica tells me that you hail from Pittsburgh.<eos> What part?<eos> Polish Hill.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> No, I... I don't.
That is very special, yummy, Thanksgiving cranberry sauce.<eos> Very yummy.<eos> It's smelly pig butt.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Let's talk about tomorrow, okay?<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th street.<eos> Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't. No, I don't.

No, I don't.<eos> - No, I don't!
Darling, I think we'll both know it when we see it.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Oh.<eos> Never sailed with a captain this particular before.<eos> We all have the same swords out there.<eos> We all have the same guns.<eos> But great art... has felled empires and therein lies all the difference.<eos> I don't understand what that means.<eos> No, but I do.
By opposing voices in his head, both arguing that they are right, but one has to be wrong.<eos> To know the difference in that moment, that is what makes an officer.<eos> What makes a man.<eos> Well, I see the difference here, sir.<eos> I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did.<eos> And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.
No one's getting any more than that.<eos> - The two of you should be in bed.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Barracks Duty.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - Gram, it's okay.<eos> - I don't mind.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> It's not up to you to decide, and you know that.<eos> - Gram, don't you want a victory?<eos> - Of course I do.
"I am Lieutenant Becker from the 170th infantry division."<eos> - Second Lieutenant Sand. - Das isn't Leutnant Sand.<eos> "You are in my charge and you will be escorted to the barracks."<eos> Ich hätte eine Frage.<eos> Warum um alles haben Sie so lange gekämpft? He wants to know why we kept fighting.<eos> I don't understand. What do you mean?<eos> It was an unnecessary waste of lives.<eos> Our government had already capitulated.<eos> Didn't you know that?<eos> No, I did not.
Alan is sitting on the world's biggest firecracker and they're about to light the match, so I really wouldn't... turn up my nose at a little human kindness right now.<eos> If you want to be kind... You'll respect my privacy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Party at my place?<eos> Are you sure you want to send them away?<eos> The last thing I need in my house is six giddy women and their deviled eggs.<eos> I'm assuming that's off the record.<eos> The gantry is moving away from the rocket as we anticipate the countdown at any moment now.<eos> - You don't smoke.<eos> - Today I do.
We wives are gonna need each other.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Look out your window.<eos> Is Trudy Cooper having some kind of a party?<eos> If she is, she didn't invite me.<eos> Should we pop by?<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> We couldn't sleep.<eos> We thought we heard music.<eos> - Oh, you did.
What do you mean?<eos> Well, officially.<eos> I was her next of kin.<eos> I'm sure I told you this before, Kate.<eos> I think I would remember my husband being another woman's next of kin.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why what?<eos> Well, why were you her next of kin?<eos> Because they thought we were married.<eos> - Who did?
It seemed a lot longer.<eos> We had a map, er, to start with.<eos> It was so bloody unreliable.<eos> I've still got it somewhere.<eos> Yeah, we were getting higher into the mountains and I decided it would be best if we found someone, you know, to help us get to the Italian border.<eos> - A guide?<eos> - Yeah, wasn't really a guide.<eos> This swarthy little bastard who thought he was Jack Kerouac.<eos> - You always did hate Kerouac.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Maybe you were jealous.<eos> - What, of Jack Kerouac?<eos> - Of the guide.<eos> Was he flirting with her?<eos> Well, they did have, er... the language.<eos> My German, it wasn't that great, what with its accent.<eos> They laughed a lot.<eos> He was forever making these jokes I didn't get.<eos> - Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Mm.<eos> Mm.<eos> And then what?<eos> That was it, really.<eos> When I got there, she'd gone.<eos> And Kerouac was looking down this hole.<eos> A fissure.<eos> Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it, like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.<eos> Do you remember that one in Scotland?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - Yeah.
Don't you think?<eos> Not really.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, what were you actually doing?<eos> You're just climbing up some bloody mountain.<eos> Well, I'm not saying what we did was out of bravery.<eos> I think you were just chasing a girl who wanted to be chased.<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- Oh, come on.<eos> And it's tainted everything.<eos> All our decisions, where we go on holiday, what books we read, what dog you want to choose, what music we want to listen to.<eos> And the big things, too.<eos> Especially the big things.<eos> She's had nothing to do with any of that.<eos> I'd like to be able to tell you everything I'm... thinking, and everything I know, but I can't.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
Put it down!<eos> You know what, don't.<eos> Seriously?<eos> He has a gun,<eos> - a pointed gun.<eos> - He's not a killer.<eos> Well, you know, he has... killed.<eos> So technically...<eos> Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> It sort of does.
No, I'll hang later. I haven't been home yet.<eos> All right, pussy. See you later.<eos> Hook that shit up, Stump.<eos> Here's your check.<eos> Be right back to take your order.<eos> We're gonna have your food right out.<eos> - Hey, Angela.<eos> - Hi, Fiona.<eos> - You know what you want?<eos> - I do.
I can hear your heart.<eos> Yeah, well, I'd hope so.<eos> Boom, boom. Boom. It's getting faster now.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah. It's just a headache.<eos> I'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I never really thought about it before, but... last night made me realize how... at any day, any point... we could just die.<eos> We didn't.
- You're in a safe place.<eos> As long as we're doing something together, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.<eos> Cheers, cheers, cheers.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> I just did Molly.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You didn't actually swallow it, did you?<eos> I did.
Which is a good thing for the world, I think.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I suppose now I guess I do... nothing.<eos> Nothing at all. [Chuckles]<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> [Exhales] [Laughs] No.<eos> No, no, no, don't do it.<eos> I promise, no more questions.<eos> I swear.<eos> What do you do?
- Yes!<eos> - All right.<eos> - Morning, boys.<eos> - [Chuckles] We were worried.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You so fucked that hot guy in the cap, didn't you?<eos> Well, I finally did it in the woods.<eos> Yes!<eos> Agustín made a new friend, too.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Where are you going?<eos> To answer a summons from the Cardinal.<eos> I should have nailed down the coffin lid myself.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Well, what is this message?<eos> You're looking at it, monsieur.<eos> I didn't know Adele was dead.<eos> The last I heard, she'd gone to the Cardinal's country estate. I...<eos> I thought she'd made her choice.<eos> She did, monsieur.
It's a bit wet.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - You must be Frances.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hello, Frances.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> Well, it's a bit premature, that, is it?<eos> - You don't have a beer that I could have?<eos> - Yeah, of course I do.
- Near Enugu.<eos> - Enugu.<eos> - Yes, Enugu.<eos> - Yes, Enugu.<eos> I told you, Enugu!<eos> Right?<eos> You don't know everything, do you, Payne?<eos> Did you know that "Enugu" is the African word for "utopia"?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, you did not.
There's fuck-all in it, apart from my brother's cock.<eos> You, all right, are a fucking disgrace, mate.<eos> You hit me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - No!<eos> No!<eos> - No, Ron.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I fucking did, you fucking cunt!
He knows too many things about us?<eos> Right.<eos> Albie, do you know things about us, mate?<eos> Do you know things?<eos> About Ron, about me, about the firm, right?<eos> You know about payments, right?<eos> You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?<eos> D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em look fucking favorably upon us, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Yes.<eos> You do.<eos> There's a fucking surprise.<eos> Jack!<eos> Mate, do you know anything about fraud?<eos> Anything at all?<eos> Take a punt.<eos> Do you know anything about how we pay off policemen every fucking final Thursday of the month?<eos> - Do you know that?<eos> - Of course I do.
No.<eos> No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right?<eos> He belongs with us.<eos> He belongs with you, me and his family, this is his home, all right?<eos> I've been looking after Ron since we were little boys, it's just the way it is.<eos> You can still look after him in prison.<eos> And he doesn't belong here and you know it.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.

Do you think whoever sent this was scared off as well?<eos> Let me see that.<eos> Smell.<eos> Smells like an envelope.<eos> I've a friend I met in the war.<eos> He works near here.<eos> He should see this.<eos> Whose imagination is running away with them, now?<eos> If it was a bomb, it would tick.<eos> It does.
Imprecise and untested, I'm afraid, but it's the best I've got.<eos> We've been driving for hours. Where are they?<eos> The signal is coming from that direction.<eos> There's no roads in that direction.<eos> The beeps are getting closer together.<eos> There's three beeps every 15 seconds.<eos> That's funny.<eos> What's funny?<eos> You did take it for that service?<eos> Yes, of course I did.
Yeah.<eos> Ryan, that man's grief was heartbreaking, but you can't blame yourself for his daughter's death.<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> I know.<eos> How many more people would Joe Carroll have killed if you hadn't stopped him?<eos> But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name--Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe Carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
Everyone said he was innocent.<eos> He wasn't.<eos> He left diaries.<eos> They proved a warped and corrupted mind.<eos> He believed his victims were full of filth and that he was cleansing the world of their stain.<eos> Taunting the police with... clues and misdirections excited him.<eos> As much as torture and sadism.<eos> He was guilty and you passed the right verdict.<eos> Why didn't you go and see him?<eos> I did.
It was just on your bed.<eos> It was just... on my bed.<eos> Well, how do I know you didn't plant it in there last night?<eos> If Philip had the gun before now, he would have taken it with you when you went after Armstrong, wouldn't he?<eos> You could have crept out of your room and planted it.<eos> There was no-one around here to hear you.<eos> I had my door locked in case Armstrong came back.<eos> Armstrong's disappeared.<eos> We split up when we went searching last night, didn't we?<eos> - Yes, we did.
Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.<eos> Oh. That's so sweet of you.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> Turns out, being sweet isn't enough to keep a girl these days.<eos> I blame Madonna.<eos> I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.<eos> Well, I'm sorry about Leonard.<eos> Thought I raised him better than that.<eos> You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.<eos> He does?
Ring mum!<eos> Oh, damn it, Jesus!<eos> Geez... You are so fucking smoked.<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> Have you gone mad?<eos> You can't put the kids in the car and then work for several hours.<eos> – I know. I'm sorry.<eos> – You don't even work there anymore.<eos> – I fucked up.<eos> – Yes, you did.
Eaten by a bear.<eos> Terrible bad luck, there.<eos> You'd think he would have been fully cognizant of the risks.<eos> Apparently, he liked a drink.<eos> Do you have any idea what he was looking for up here, Or what he might have found, even?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.<eos> Do you think their deaths are connected in any way?<eos> No, I don't.

Do you know something that we don't?<eos> Why did you attack him?<eos> Is your relationship With Dan Anderssen also sexual?<eos> You kept this fact secret from me.<eos> It's bad for frank and it's bad for me too.<eos> Frank was at home with Liam?<eos> Yes or no.<eos> DNA doesn't lie, does it?<eos> You're right.<eos> It never does.
It's New York.<eos> I can't go to New York.<eos> Why?<eos> You have a car.<eos> What is stopping you?<eos> Like, 1,200 miles.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> That's 1,200 miles between you and your love of your life.<eos> Because you love her, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's way safer.<eos> Just two days.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A great summer away. I hope you had a great summer.<eos> I still can't believe she hasn't called.<eos> They probably don't have phones in Agloe.<eos> She has a cell.<eos> How do we know that she's even still in Agloe?<eos> I just do.
I'm in love with you.<eos> You're in love with me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Quentin... come OH.<eos> I've loved you since we were kids.<eos> And I've never stopped loving you every single day since.<eos> You're not in love with me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person.<eos> Margo was not a miracle.<eos> She was not an adventurer.<eos> She was not some fine, precious thing.<eos> She was a girl.<eos> It took me a long time to realize how wrong I was.<eos> And not just about Margo.<eos> I was wrong about a lot of things.<eos> I used to believe everyone gets a miracle.<eos> And I still do.
I never asked for power.<eos> Power is only given to those who are prepared to lower themselves to pick it up.<eos> __<eos> Einar.<eos> Sit down, Kalf.<eos> Will you come with me to Wessex?<eos> No, Earl Ingstad.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't you want to win renown?<eos> Of course I do.
You went to Krupke's.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> You bring one for me?<eos> Nope.<eos> She's eating.<eos> Our child attempted suicide and you didn't tell me?<eos> I didn't... I didn't even find out till the day after, okay?<eos> And I was little more concerned with Julie than Ricki.<eos> - You should've called and told me.<eos> - I did.
- Hey, you guys are fighting.<eos> It's like the '80s all over again.<eos> Too bad Adam and Josh aren't here to relive the trauma.<eos> - Oh, good grief.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> Speaking of Josh and Adam...<eos> I let both the boys know that you came into town.<eos> Oh, g...<eos> - Do they wanna see me?<eos> - Josh does.
I've been coming here.<eos> Are you just gonna stand up here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> Come on.<eos> I've been traveling here.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
- Because this doesn't make sense.<eos> - Which part?<eos> You're always on rne about how I don't talk to Mom enough, how I don't respect the family.<eos> Now I tell you I wanna come home, and I wanna help out, and that doesn't make sense to you.<eos> You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'll head inland, take a look around.<eos> Do you know the way to San Jose?<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you know the way to San Jose?<eos> This what it was like when you came for me at Arctic Biosystems?<eos> They'd cleaned up most of the mess by the time we got there.<eos> No, not the mess.<eos> This... feeling.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
If she's losing blood at this rate, she's going to bleed out soon.<eos> Dr. Sommer, are you hurt?<eos> Your arm.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, my God...<eos> - Turn off your lights.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just do it!
Our membership has cut all ties with the outside world.<eos> Come on, now, you're talking to us.<eos> Doesn't hurt, does it?<eos> This is a sanctuary.<eos> The people who joined us they're... trying to get away - from people like you.<eos> - Sister Amy.<eos> Are we really that bad?<eos> You remind them of things they left behind, and many of those are painful.<eos> You're doctors, I'm sure you don't want to cause pain.<eos> No, we don't.
I just had the worst day of my life and my mouth tastes like vomit and... I don't want to ruin this.<eos> I was just grabbing some water.<eos> How long have you been out?<eos> I'm too embarrassed to talk right now.<eos> Can you just leave?<eos> Come on, don't be like that.<eos> This doesn't have to be awkward.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> Seriously, since when have you known?<eos> I don't.
Where am I?<eos> Bellevue, since Saturday night.<eos> - And today is...?<eos> - Monday.<eos> I have been in jail for four days?<eos> Jail two, here two.<eos> Why am I on naltrexone?<eos> You went through sedated detox.<eos> I never asked for that.<eos> You definitely did not, hence the sedated part.
I'm... uh, Jac...<eos> Jacqueline Peyton.<eos> Woman: Can you spell that for me?<eos> Yeah, J-A-C, uh, maybe Q?<eos> - Last name's fine.<eos> - ( without accent ) P-E-Y-T-O-N.<eos> Oh, I was spelling it with an A.<eos> ( with accent ) Ah, that always happens when I give my name to people.<eos> We have you down for 2:00 PM tomorrow.<eos> ( without accent ) You do?
Yes, but it turned out that Emma Wilson and Yussef Khalid are connected.<eos> How?<eos> I went into the apartment and he was there.<eos> - Looking for something.<eos> - What?<eos> We didn't exactly exchange niceties.<eos> He got the jump on me.<eos> Got me on my knees.<eos> Thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> Why didn't he?
Aren't you feeling well?<eos> Get lost!<eos> What?<eos> I'm not doing anything, am I?<eos> You're ruining everything.<eos> What am I ruining?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Because you never did anything.
It was a man...<eos> God!<eos> The kind of... the dominant race.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You are so beautiful.<eos> You live together, work together...<eos> You do everything together.<eos> How come you never fight?<eos> - Sometimes we do.
Take some of my Mole Fund money.<eos> I mean, a pop here is, like, $5.<eos> Also, I'm your Secret Santa.<eos> Adios.<eos> We're running!<eos> Outside!<eos> Ooh!<eos> Whee!<eos> I'm gonna go all the way around!<eos> Oh, my God, she did it!
She didn't want my protection.<eos> - Sansa still might.<eos> - Will you shut your mouth?<eos> I didn't ask for your advice.<eos> I don't want anyone following me.<eos> I'm not a leader.<eos> All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in.<eos> The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.<eos> You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.<eos> I did.
Just until the council find a permanent Matron.<eos> I think you're being compassionate, sensible, and bold in equal measures.<eos> There can be no better way to start any enterprise.<eos> And it will be nice having Sergeant Noakes to stay with us when he does his weeks of night shift.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Camilla. What are you trying to do with the clutch?<eos> I'm trying to get the biting point!<eos> But it's bally elusive when one's reversing out.<eos> ~ Do you need me to drive you there?<eos> ~ No, I don't!
When I'm at home, I'm at home all day.<eos> I'll take a statement from you at the station.<eos> I shall be stating that my water was cut off, which is why this place stinks the way it does.<eos> I'm on a list to be rehoused but the council have done nothing.<eos> Just like the doctor did nothing when I went to him<eos> ~ and asked to have my tubes tied.<eos> ~ You're under arrest, Mrs Teeman.<eos> You'll be allowed to speak to a solicitor in due course.<eos> ~ I didn't ask for any of this.<eos> ~ And neither did your children.
~ Three days.<eos> ~ Is he your first?<eos> Yes.<eos> I called him John.<eos> Can't resist a newborn, me.<eos> I've got a nipper meself, nearly 18 months old now.<eos> If you've finished your work here, can we get on with ours?<eos> Of course.<eos> Keep an eye on the kids, though.<eos> We do.
I think she's just making you say that there is.<eos> That's not the case at all.<eos> Baby may grow very large, develop abnormally, or even die.<eos> And I wish I could mince my words, Paulette, but I can't because your life will be in danger, too.<eos> You can at least let me do one thing for myself.<eos> Have you got children, Nurse Crane?<eos> No, Mrs Roland, I am a spinster.<eos> How dare you even come into my house.<eos> ~ I wanted to speak to you, Mrs Roland.<eos> ~ Oh, you do, do you?
Sergeant Noakes.<eos> This has to stop.<eos> This lady is in labour.<eos> In labour?<eos> Well, can't you take her to hospital?<eos> She wants to give birth in her own home, which is here!<eos> No evictions, and no transfers to hospital are going to take place until I give my permission.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, Sister.<eos> I do.
Trixie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've been avoiding you.<eos> If it would make things easier, I could speak to the Bishop.<eos> ~ Try to move parish sooner.<eos> You should be wherever you want, wherever you need to be, whether it's here or Newcastle or... even the moon.<eos> That's just it.<eos> You deserve a girl who won't let you go without her.<eos> I rather thought I'd found her.<eos> Yes, well... .. so did I, for a while.
Vaccines are on their way.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll do that.<eos> You go home and rest.<eos> You're the one who should be resting.<eos> ~ I left you in a terrible position.<eos> ~ No, you didn't.<eos> You were ill.<eos> ~ You may not understand that, but...<eos> ~ I do.
~ Do you want to hear my news?<eos> ~ You've given it quite the build-up, I'm rather afraid it's going to disappoint.<eos> ~ They're knocking down the nurses' home.<eos> ~ Really?<eos> ~ Well, half of it.<eos> Those of us who volunteered to move out and find private digs will be given a rent allowance.<eos> And I've put my name down.<eos> Oh, Delia, you don't want to end up in some filthy hole,<eos> ~ living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.<eos> ~ No, I don't.
Oh. Er...<eos> I could let you have a bit off the price on this one, cos...<eos> Fred?<eos> I don't want you going to Plymouth.<eos> Don't want you going anywhere unless it's with me.<eos> I don't care if I have to share you with Bert, or the memory of him.<eos> Violet... .. I wish we were a pair.<eos> I wish you'd marry me.<eos> Well, why don't you ask me, then?<eos> I just did.
The one thing that makes me feel better... is a glass of Scotch.<eos> I'm aware there are better times for me to be going off to do a fortnight's course at The London.<eos> Have you managed to prepare any food for Neil?<eos> ~ I can't face boiling milk. ~ SHE RETCHES<eos> Oh, this is more than morning sickness, Mrs Turner!<eos> The boiler has died from inattention.<eos> I may yet suffer the same fate.<eos> PATSY: Oh, Delia. You don't want to end up in some... filthy hole, living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.<eos> FRED: Did you get the letter about my lady friend?<eos> Yes, Dad, I did.
-2, 1.<eos> Activating the panel 41.<eos> Bridge seal holding.<eos> - What's the damage?<eos> - Worry about that later.<eos> What's the relative velocity?<eos> 12 meters per second.<eos> Copy.<eos> Hook me up.<eos> Done.
(Alarm beeps)<eos> TIM:<eos> Will I still be able to write?<eos> MAN:<eos> Shall we look at your scan?<eos> TIM:<eos> I've been looking at it.<eos> Toxoplasmosis, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - I did a theatre thing once.
Well, Ava, I figure what's mine is yours, what's yours is mine, so I...<eos> thought I'd just do it myself.<eos> Besides, all that's left is to paint.<eos> - I can get to that tomorrow.<eos> - Then what?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - I got to wake up.<eos> Do you want a coke or a coffee?<eos> - Well, you got a cold beer?<eos> - I do.
Your call.<eos> Let's go after Dewey.<eos> You know, he once told me he worked at Disney World dressed as Goofy ...<eos> - in a water-skiing show. - Well, some guys just peak too early.<eos> Shit, shit, shit, shit.<eos> Want to hang back, let KSP do their thing?<eos> Yeah. Why not?<eos> How you doing there?<eos> Do you mind stepping' out of your vehicle?<eos> - I do.
I knew I would shoot him.<eos> I'd had enough.<eos> And I just had to see it through.<eos> You made him dinner, a whole spread ...<eos> - his favorites, if I recall.<eos> - He was delighted.<eos> He had no sense of your intention.<eos> He never saw it coming... because he believed me... because I acted like everything was the way it always was.<eos> Because he had never suspected otherwise.<eos> No, he did not.
What can I get you guys to eat?<eos> How about a deluxe burger and your phone number?<eos> - I don't have a phone.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> We don't have to talk.<eos> You're gonna want to move that hand.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Does that feel good?<eos> - Sure does.
Those are nice.<eos> What are they, Glocks?<eos> Modified 17Cs.<eos> Cycle at 1,200 rounds per minute.<eos> Mmm, more of a Springfield girl myself.<eos> Different strokes.<eos> That's a great pie.<eos> They bake it here?<eos> I should know the answer to that.<eos> I don't.
Apparently nobody under 30 looks a day over 12 down there.<eos> I've got someone that can help you with that.<eos> I know this girl--well, technically she's a man now, But he's great.<eos> Oh, god, this is insane.<eos> So keep the bush.<eos> I mean, i hear it's coming back in style, anyways.<eos> No, i mean, insane thinking i can get away with this.<eos> Do i really want to trade My dignity, wisdom, and self-respect For another chance at my 20s?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Just cobra and stingray with antiqued gold hardware.<eos> Hematite, Austrian crystal, and onyx stone inlay.<eos> It's gorgeous, Diana.<eos> I just wish men appreciated bags as much as women.<eos> Men are visual.<eos> They respond to the whole picture, even if they don't know why.<eos> I'm telling you, men are gonna love that purse without even realizing they saw it.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Do you think I should change my profile photo?<eos> Maybe do one with the Leiber?
Some people from the Finnish consulate are getting pretty rowdy at the bar.<eos> The Finns are here? Mm.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Are there really Finns at the bar? No.<eos> I just got creative.<eos> Well, that certainly worked.<eos> Kelsey Peters.<eos> I'm an editor at Empirical.<eos> Sorry, I don't speak Swedish.<eos> - You don't? - No.
I could butter it up, sprinkle on a little cinnamon and sugar.<eos> It's like eating a hug.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> This came out good.<eos> Wow, it's really beautiful, Maggie.<eos> I won't be needing it anymore.<eos> I got dropped.<eos> I'm never gonna find another gallery at this age.<eos> I completely understand what you're going through.<eos> No, you don't...
Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I can't see out my window.<eos> That's right.<eos> You broke the bed.<eos> I...<eos> I did...
I loved Mantastic and Goldman Sex.<eos> Liza, just what are we gonna do about this party?<eos> I spent the last year like a little mouse in my little mouse house typing and typing, and now I just want to have a good time.<eos> Of course.<eos> That's what we're here for.<eos> I want this party to be epic.<eos> I want hot men and live peacocks and young people that no one would ever think to invite to something like this, because they're under the radar and much too interesting to bother.<eos> They're on the cusp.<eos> Do you know what I'm saying, Liza?<eos> Um, yes, yes, I do.
I wonder what we're gonna be like in our 40s.<eos> I think I'm gonna be a lot like I am now. Me too.<eos> Ow. CrossFit.<eos> The more you do it, the less it hurts.<eos> Sure.<eos> Did you see?<eos> Finally fixed the bimini top. I can't take the title, David.<eos> Sure you can.<eos> And you can use the boat whenever you want.<eos> They still do fireworks out here on the Fourth.
- You too.<eos> Be good.<eos> It's so difficult being married to a renowned author.<eos> Women literally throw themselves at anton.<eos> They think baiting a literary giant Will give meaning to their miserable little lives.<eos> Well, i suppose some of the--<eos> Those little groupies? They're disgusting.<eos> And you know the women i'm talking about, yes?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Yes, i do.
- I can't wait. - Me too.<eos> Big kiss.<eos> Hey, Caitlin, I hear you got a new roommate.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hold on one second, okay?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I wanted to tell you so many times.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> So why didn't you?
It does not matter what people think.<eos> You know what you did.<eos> Welcome home!<eos> What a trip!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I am fine.<eos> - Did you get the marmalade?<eos> - Yes, yes. Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
I'll see you at the Easter Egg Roll.<eos> - My friend, yes.<eos> - Lyle.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Where did HIV come from?<eos> I think some guy fucked a monkey.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Why didn't you warn me about that, Mike?<eos> Ma'am, I tried to, right when you came in.<eos> No, you didn't.
How dare you?<eos> How could you have the audacity to...<eos> Oh, these are not good.<eos> Okay, well, she's gonna have to be told.<eos> Gently, of course.<eos> But who's going to do that?<eos> - I believe I have the skills, ma'am.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Fine.<eos> You do it, Kent.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> See, we need bigger centerpieces for the state dinner tonight.<eos> I don't care about the cost.<eos> You got to get on that.<eos> Listen, please, please, please.<eos> If anybody doesn't know the difference between a valance and a jabot, I really need you to leave.<eos> - Did the president's stylist get my notes?<eos> - Yes, he did.
- When's Catherine's birthday?<eos> - June eighth.<eos> - Ninth.<eos> - Ninth.<eos> - Which senator's daughter is in rehab?<eos> - You're out of line, missy.<eos> - Geldray.<eos> - What are you wearing tomorrow?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I do.
- But I'm happy to do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Most of the time you don't even know that I exist, but I am fucking everything to you!<eos> Oh, I am so happy to get somebody else to give me my hand cream.<eos> - Okay, go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.
You okay, ma'am?<eos> You look a little flushed.<eos> - I mentioned the moment in the car. - ( gasps ) - And?<eos> - He had no idea what I was talking about.<eos> - No, you're kidding me.<eos> - Yeah, I don't want to talk about this, okay?<eos> - I'm so humiliated.<eos> - Okay, I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.

- Hello.<eos> How good to meet you.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - And I love your brooch.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's a honeybee.<eos> Bee for Beatrice.<eos> Fun fact about the honeybee.<eos> Do you know how much honey a honeybee produces in its lifetime?<eos> - I do not.
I've never had strong feelings for a plane, but right now I would cheat on Wendy with that thing.<eos> Jonah, we need to talk.<eos> We are just in the car with Leon West's mother.<eos> Do you need anything, ma'am?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Great.<eos> Jonah, I know something's happening at the VP's office.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, you do.
- PTSD. - Oh, my God!<eos> Calamity James.<eos> And that's just off the top of my head.<eos> - Well, what do I do?<eos> - Just get him off, you fucking mannequin.<eos> Jonah.<eos> Uh, get him to stop.<eos> Get him to stop talking.<eos> I'm not saying I don't condemn what happened.<eos> I do.
And let me repeat myself again and say to the American people that there is not one ounce of truth to these allegations.<eos> - Madam President...<eos> - Not one ounce of truth to these allegations.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> That's all the time I have for today.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Man: Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Yes, I do.

Yes.<eos> Well, we have many forms of communication.<eos> None of which you seem to be able to master at the present moment.<eos> Well, I wasn't responsible for the voice memos.<eos> - So who would know about...<eos> - Mike McLintock.<eos> Mr. McLintock, please rise and raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> So help me God.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> Man: Senator, do you think it's possible Gary Walsh was responsible for making payments to Mr. Egan and Ms. Brookheimer to lobby against the Families First Bill?<eos> Forgive me for laughing at the notion.<eos> Gary Walsh, you need to understand, is a 12-year-old boy trapped in the body of a 12-year-old girl.<eos> Did you contact Amy Brookheimer and Daniel Clifford Egan after they had left the White House with regard to the Families First Bill?<eos> I did.<eos> Did you agree to pay them to lobby against the bill on behalf of the president?<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope, nope, nope, nope.<eos> No, I did not.
A cuff link I get, but not a person.<eos> Okay.<eos> She said she's losing her voice.<eos> Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> She said you fucked up, Ben.<eos> And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit. You need to get him out.<eos> - She didn't say that, Gary.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Yeah, they are.<eos> But to be real with you, I didn't like you in that situation.<eos> So I'm glad you ended it.<eos> Pato, you...<eos> You got a little...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know why you let me order a burrito the size of a baby.<eos> Well, look at you in your place of power.<eos> So you managed to get off after all.<eos> Of course I did.
- I don't...<eos> Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You look like you might need one, and I give a good neck rub.<eos> Okay. Yes.<eos> Yes, you know what?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I would like one, actually.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I do...
- No, it was not.<eos> - What?<eos> Why do I remember it being so good?<eos> Yeah, maybe because you came all the time.<eos> I didn't come.<eos> - That wasn't good for you?<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> You know that I loved you so much.<eos> I loved you too.<eos> I still do. I do.

Believe me.<eos> It is too much.<eos> - We should go out tonight. - Mm.<eos> Do you want to visit anyone in your family before we see them at the funeral tomorrow?<eos> Fuck no, I want to go do something fun.<eos> Is there any chance there's a gay bar around here?<eos> Or at least a Pinkberry where I can get some gay toppings?<eos> Basically anything gay.<eos> - I know a place.<eos> - You do?

Did you and Doris finally get married?<eos> Uh, no, we...<eos> Actually, I'm gay.<eos> Oh, wow, cool.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I love that you're gay.<eos> That's great.<eos> - Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> - No, not anymore.<eos> I did.
I mean, unless there's some kind of special requirement.<eos> Yeah. High school diploma.<eos> The pay is shit-tay!<eos> Well, I'm not making any money right now, so even minimum wage would be great.<eos> It's minimum-minimum wage. Don't worry about that.<eos> Am I too much of a coral gables princess to work at a shelter?<eos> "A," I didn't know you were from coral gables.<eos> And "b," it's not the shelter, man, it's the kids.<eos> Yeah, they're trans children of the corn. I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
- Uh, most of it, yeah. Uh...<eos> - Hey! Guess who I am?<eos> Um, shot in the dark, I'm gonna say Carrie.<eos> See, bitch?<eos> I told her people would think she's an angry tampon, - and I stand by that. - Wow.<eos> I'm gonna make us drinks.<eos> Do you like whiskey?<eos> I like whiskey.<eos> I know you like whiskey.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Here, give me.<eos> - She's all yours.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Yum, yum. I smell drugs.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> By the way, your girl...<eos> She's a tough one.<eos> You know, when I fall for someone, I fall hard, and I think I might have scared her.<eos> Yeah, you did...
So, questions?<eos> Oh, uh, I have a question.<eos> My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<eos> - I'm sorry, her name is--<eos> - Cunty.<eos> And I was hoping I could call her Cunty while I'm here.<eos> Okay, that one's easy.<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> 'Cause, you know, I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch, and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty," then it's like, I'm not going to want to have Cunty over at all, which I feel like kind of violates my rights--<eos> Yeah, um, it does not-- as a woman.
I trust Erlich can be diplomatic and pull it off.<eos> A few days ago, I came in here, I did some things and said some things that I should not have.<eos> Also we would like to be open about the fact that Pied Piper is involved in a complicated legal matter that could affect our potential value.<eos> And that being said, we are open to renegotiating the funding terms to reflect that.<eos> But most of all, I want to thank you.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to come in here today and be vulnerable and to apologize.<eos> Mr. Bachman,<eos> I didn't have you come all the way back here today just to apologize to me.<eos> Uh, please, it's Erlich.<eos> And... you didn't?
She was smoking cigarettes.<eos> So sad.<eos> Oh.<eos> Jian Yang, what're you doing?<eos> This is Palo Alto.<eos> People are lunatics about smoking here.<eos> We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right? Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke. Except for special occasions.<eos> So, you do smoke?
I will not interact with Russ Hanneman in any way.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> It is, Laurie.<eos> I feel very strongly that you should have prevented this.<eos> - This exchange is now over.<eos> - Okay, but I...<eos> This exchange is now over, thank you.<eos> JARED: Well, Richard? Firstly, congratulations on finally being funded.<eos> I hope you took a little time out to enjoy this moment and celebrate.<eos> I certainly did.
There's a first time for everything.<eos> Here.<eos> These will help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May Freya lie with you tonight, and take care of you, my friend.<eos> I am so happy that my uncle is dead.<eos> But I still don't believe it.<eos> You saw him killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I did.
- And bleeding.<eos> So much blood upon him.<eos> So much blood everywhere.<eos> It was only a dream.<eos> Yes.<eos> Only a dream.<eos> _<eos> Halt!<eos> You know of Lord Burgred.<eos> Of course you do.
There is no more pain, Ivar.<eos> No. No more pain.<eos> That's right.<eos> Very sleepy, Ivar.<eos> You're getting very sleepy.<eos> There's no more pain.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am.<eos> - No, I don't.
I did not notice such things at the time.<eos> Well what do you say now?<eos> Now?<eos> I would say this city is impregnable.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> - Go away, Bjorn!<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want this child.<eos> I don't want this child! I don't want this child!<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> But I think you mean to hurt someone.<eos> Bjorn.<eos> I'm sorry I have disturbed you.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> I love my wife, Torvi.<eos> Floki.<eos> Priest.<eos> Lord, receive my soul.<eos> The things I do for you.
Don't be sorry.<eos> I love my wife, Torvi.<eos> Floki.<eos> Priest.<eos> Lord, receive my soul.<eos> The things I do for you.<eos> For such a little man, Athelstan, you are terribly heavy.<eos> This is as close to your God as I can get you.<eos> I never knew what a martyr was.<eos> I still don't.
and enjoy each other.<eos> You see?<eos> You should never have called me that.<eos> Called you what?<eos> Ironside.<eos> As if the gods are protecting me.<eos> Go.<eos> You're alive, aren't you?<eos> Today went badly.<eos> Yes, it did.
I gather week one went well.<eos> Would you say it went well?<eos> Oh, I'd say it went very well.<eos> Oh, I do declare.<eos> It is getting mighty toasty up here.<eos> - What?<eos> - She hates my voices.<eos> What's not to hate?<eos> Aw, I think they're fun. - You do?<eos> - You don't. I do.
He doesn't call you Yoko.<eos> Every time he sees me, he somehow manages to work the word "Ono" into the conversation.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> So I read through those notes from that Tim guy, and I ran them past legal.<eos> And?<eos> You have a legal problem.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> He wants to run the show with you.<eos> I thought you were gonna make this go away?<eos> So did I.
- Aw. - So she decides to kill her coworkers.<eos> - Ah. Did not see that coming.<eos> There's your twist.<eos> - She just feels like, "you don't notice me?<eos> You'll notice me." - And there's your motivation.<eos> Good, you'll need that.<eos> So... She kills them...<eos> - By poisoning them.<eos> - I see.<eos> - She does it slowly, little by little,
And you driving your car into a hole in the ground had nothing to do with that?<eos> Now I've seen it all.<eos> Oh, you're not hurt.<eos> Keep it down.<eos> Not hurt?<eos> You shot him in the fucking heart.<eos> I think<eos> I wanna go.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I do the work.
This time tomorrow, we'll be drinking beers by the Bay, man.<eos> I can't.<eos> Come on!<eos> All right!<eos> We made it!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Do it!
I can't.<eos> Come on!<eos> All right!<eos> We made it!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
- Well, we're as good as.<eos> The only reason we're not is because the Sheriff's busy.<eos> If he wasn't busy, he'd probably drag us right out onto Main Street, slit our throats, wouldn't he?<eos> Ethan is not Pope.<eos> He's not gonna do that.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> He'll probably just shoot us.<eos> Franklin!<eos> You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid, you think this guy's gonna let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I-I do.
~ Well done, Lucy, you found her.<eos> ~ Of course, Dad.<eos> ~ Zeta!<eos> ~ Mr Thomson.<eos> Elias, please.<eos> Tonight, you're a guest.<eos> Daniel?<eos> My, but you've grown into a fine young man.<eos> You know why you're here?<eos> ~ I do.
~ How are you?<eos> ~ Worried.<eos> ~ Oh?<eos> That you're undermanned since you lost Sergeant Best.<eos> Yes, but we're managing, sir.<eos> ~ Dwayne has stepped up to the plate, as it were.<eos> ~ I'm sure he has, but Elias Thomson was a prominent member of the town council.<eos> This investigation should have a full team assigned to it.<eos> Do you have anyone in mind, sir?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Any incidents?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Six kids in the Lost and Found, 28 down with heatstroke...<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Oh, this? I got it on eBay.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty amazing.<eos> I got it for $150, but the mint condition one goes for $300...<eos> Didn't occur to you maybe that's in poor taste?<eos> The shirt?<eos> Yeah, no, it did.
Only one way to be sure.<eos> If it is, the inside of this wolf will be stuffed with feathers.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> Maybe the obsidian blade.<eos> Then it would be...<eos> Both.<eos> Ah, well, that would work.<eos> Do you even know what you're doing?<eos> Of course I do.
-That was in the...<eos> -That was in the... Yeah.<eos> I mean, that was probably a foot and a half in the ground and that's on the hill, but check it out.<eos> I mean, the land is crazy.<eos> -That's beautiful, look at that.<eos> -That's pretty awesome, man.<eos> Tim, you want a peanut butter and boysenberry sandwich?<eos> Well, what do we...<eos> Let's go down there and let's dig this shit up.<eos> I did.
-Good, good, thank you.<eos> Want a drink?<eos> Do you need help?<eos> Oh, no, thank you.<eos> Um, I'll have a martini with a twist.<eos> Wait, I haven't seen this in so long, I eat here all the time.<eos> What are you gonna get?<eos> - I was thinking about... - uh...<eos> -Do you guys have burgers?<eos> -Yeah, we do.
Yes, sir!<eos> Right away, sir!<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm the magician.<eos> Are you indeed?<eos> Winespill!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> HENS CLUCK<eos> Do you, by any chance, know when Lord Wellington will come back?<eos> I do not.
What noise?<eos> You guys hearing some kind of high pitched beat?<eos> Like, eh-ehhhh-eh-eh.<eos> One short, one long, two short.<eos> It's Morse code.<eos> It's all for librarians.<eos> Hey, something's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Well, I did.
This was the meaningful act I was searching for.<eos> You can't just take it upon yourself to take someone's life.<eos> Well, I thought it was a very reasonable thing to do.<eos> She hoped he'd get cancer!<eos> But what the hell is hoping?<eos> Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
- He is I.<eos> - Hi, I'm Nate's brother, Steven.<eos> - My condolences.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - How's Nate doin'?<eos> - Not too well.<eos> I think he just needs time.<eos> - Totally understand.<eos> - I hope this doesn't inconvenience your business too much.<eos> - No, it does not.
You know what they say in Italy?<eos> "Il principe bisogna sceglierlo."<eos> ~ "You have to pick your prince." ~ Doing what?<eos> Whatever he wants.<eos> We have enough.<eos> I don't want to spend my life dealing in conveyances, Liz.<eos> Whether this man's fence should be here or here...<eos> You know what you're doing, I suppose.<eos> At least, you always look as if you do.<eos> Yeah, I do, don't I?
It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Go. Go now.<eos> Everybody said it was back.<eos> This... .. sweating sickness.<eos> I should have sent them to the country.<eos> Liz wouldn't have let them go.<eos> Anne cried every time you were away.<eos> Did she?<eos> Anne did?
And by me, you have had many children... .. although it pleased God to call them from this world - which was no fault of mine.<eos> And when you had me first - as God is my witness, I was a true maid, without touch of man.<eos> And whether this is true or no, I put to your conscience.<eos> On Prince Arthur's wedding night, myself and the Earl of Oxford took the prince to Queen Katherine's chambers and we were there when he climbed into bed beside her.<eos> Next morning, he comes out again, says he's thirsty and asks for some ale, because, he said...<eos> "Last night I was in Spain!"<eos> The Queen was Spanish, you see?<eos> It would be a poor sort of bridegroom who'd come out in the morning and say,<eos> "Good day, masters.<eos> Nothing done!"
About there being worse threats.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe. Catherine, come on, if what they said was true, we would've known about it by now, right?<eos> Besides, we've sacrificed enough, okay?<eos> We don't have to sacrifice anything more.<eos> We got each other, we got our future.<eos> A normal future, okay?<eos> And I do not want to risk losing that ever again.<eos> Neither do I.
Excuse me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Don't we have a case?<eos> Yeah, but those DHS agents think they actually might have something.<eos> All right, you know what, you keep saying you don't want to get involved, yet you keep getting involved.<eos> You almost act like you, uh, miss fighting beasts sometimes.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Oh?<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I do.
She just wants to see what we've got before they get involved.<eos> If we decide to get involved.<eos> Lady, you're already involved.<eos> You think we saved your friend's ass because we're nice?<eos> Whatever you did to save JT, you did before you asked us to help you.<eos> And Vincent and I, we only agreed to think about it.<eos> People are dying, Detective, innocent people, all over the city.<eos> And someone or something's responsible for it.<eos> And you want to think about it?<eos> Yes, I do.
You want something out of the way, that's where you put it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Isn't Miss Baird just trying to protect us?<eos> You, yes.<eos> Math girl, not so much.<eos> Who's math girl?<eos> That would be me...<eos> The one who could break at any second, the one who betrays her friends.<eos> You would never betray anybody.<eos> Except I did...
We killed a lot of people... some for the money...<eos> But mostly for the fun.<eos> People caught on.<eos> We were runnin' real desperate.<eos> And then... Like magic...<eos> Boom!<eos> A fine, little house in the middle of nowhere.<eos> My family never knew how special it was.<eos> Not one of them heard this house whispering.<eos> But I did.
This kind of thing can seriously<eos> Make us late.<eos> Our employer is aware.<eos> And that's boring.<eos> It should be more careful.<eos> I hope you're kidding.<eos> I'm just extra careful.<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> My job is to pay attention.<eos> Do more attention.
And the not-so-single.<eos> And they all talk to one another just like that.<eos> What if someone is using Flirtual to stalk and maybe kill people?<eos> Okay... a serial killer.<eos> You're gonna need more than a hunch.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> I'm staying with you.<eos> - You really don't have to.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, me, too.<eos> What else is happening in our relationship together, I can't do it anymore.<eos> You're talking about the intimacy.<eos> Yes, I'm talking about the intimacy.<eos> I can't do it anymore, Desi.<eos> It's not working for me.<eos> I'm not supposed to be someone's mistress.<eos> Nobody thinks of you as a mistress, Marn.<eos> But because nobody thinks about me at all, like, in relation to you.<eos> I do.
I had sympathy because I knew you had a problem, but you're sober and you're still pulling this shit.<eos> What are you trying to provoke?<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't even want to-<eos> - I don't want to know.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I don't need any more friends.<eos> Oh, so none is enough for you?<eos> Adam, I do.
Please, I need to talk to you.<eos> You're trying to judge me, trying to blind me to my path.<eos> - Please, just hear me out.<eos> - I used to know people like you, people who thought they were better than me.<eos> But Michael's opened my eyes so I can be free of your judgment.<eos> I just thought you deserved to know the truth.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's Soren's bear.<eos> You said he took it with him.<eos> He did.
Alan, don't leave me here!<eos> Alan!<eos> I just wanted to check your temperature.<eos> - Am I okay?<eos> - You're fine.<eos> Better than that.<eos> You almost look as healthy as you did when you landed.<eos> You mean right before you clubbed me?<eos> - I already apologized for that.<eos> - No you didn't.
Let's put it to a vote.<eos> Those in favour?<eos> Opposed?<eos> The motion carries.<eos> Next item, executive compensation.<eos> She collapsed.<eos> I did everything I could.<eos> I tried to help her.<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Of course you did.
I've... known quite a few immortals, Ann.<eos> - At the beginning, there were 500.<eos> We thought he was a god.<eos> Never aging, healing so quickly.<eos> He told us he was the only one and we never questioned it.<eos> We trusted him.<eos> But when Agnes saw Dr. Jordan's eyes, she knew.<eos> We were such fools!<eos> You had no reason not to believe him.<eos> But now, I do.
You're a funny one.<eos> Lucky Caddy didn't catch you first.<eos> Sometimes... He lets the rabbits run, just so he can have a good chase.<eos> Says it tenderizes the meat.<eos> Only trouble is, when he catches 'em...<eos> He eats the eyes all to himself.<eos> We will definitely be sharing yours.<eos> Blue is my favorite color, tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Course we do.
You tell me or I'll give you something to bleed about.<eos> - Who did that?<eos> - No, no.<eos> No, Carol will get angry.<eos> Ah... Carol.<eos> She knows better.<eos> She said she wanted 'em all to herself.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> She wanted to take my eyes, but I wouldn't let her!<eos> - She did what?
It's about restoring balance for the future.<eos> - The board believes that...<eos> - The board!<eos> Julia, do you hear yourself?<eos> I'm doing everything in my power to change this, Sarah.<eos> Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization?<eos> Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate,<eos> - just until resources are replenished.<eos> - You think you know better, but you don't have the right to make that choice.<eos> No one does.
Why?<eos> They're afraid that you'll discover the truth.<eos> That no matter what they've done, you still decide what happens next.<eos> Don't make the mistake I did.<eos> Don't hold on to the past, become the thing you hate.<eos> Show them they have no power.<eos> All right?<eos> Walk away.<eos> How do I know they won't follow me?<eos> You don't.
Don't ever do that again.<eos> Don't ever do that either.<eos> About time someone did that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Landry, stop.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Home.<eos> Come on, Julia, where are you?<eos> Before I show you something... do you know the way to San Jose?<eos> Yes, I do.
Is that it?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> A civil war?<eos> - You've gone crazy, asshole.<eos> - We have to fight, brother.<eos> Let's put our hearts into this.<eos> And if we all must die, so be it.<eos> Well, yes...<eos> The thing is, I don't want to die yet, Pablo.<eos> Nor do I.
It means, my love...<eos> that now I have a jail.<eos> And for you, visiting days will be... every day.<eos> - I'm serious, Pablo.<eos> - So am I.<eos> The problem, Pablo, is that... now that you have admitted to trafficking in narcotics, my image as a journalist cannot be associated with yours.<eos> So then... now you think I am going to damage your credibility as a journalist... is that it?<eos> You understand what I'm saying.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Of course I do.
He's not going to be happy to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.<eos> I'm sorry, but those were my orders.<eos> I turned myself in to that punk...<eos> the vice minister of justice.<eos> But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing.<eos> This is good.<eos> Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.<eos> This is very good.<eos> General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.<eos> - But I do.
Oh. So, that couple got the last adjoining rooms, hmm?<eos> - Dre, Dre.<eos> - What?<eos> Sweetie, it's okay. don't do this. It's okay.<eos> - Bow, I'm not doing anything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm being done to, all right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Junior. Junior.<eos> You see what's going on here?<eos> I do.
I need to check out "Scandal."<eos> Oh, and I also need to fix things with Bow.<eos> I knew just what I had to do.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> What are we doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Please tell me you are not gonna buy me another fake purse.<eos> I've never bought you a fake purse.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> You know that "Chanel" has one "N," right?<eos> - I do now. - Mm-hmm.
- Do what?<eos> Let's get married and be together and have fun with Olive or add an "R" for Oliver and show whomever's in your belly how great life can be.<eos> I think about breaking up with you ten times a day just so that I don't have to think about you.<eos> I know... [Chuckles]<eos> I know, but you haven't.<eos> But I should.<eos> I really should.<eos> You're the most beautiful man I ever met, but...<eos> I just don't want this.<eos> I don't.
Then what is it, love?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why are you being so cautious?<eos> Because it's my last chance?<eos> What, to have a kid?<eos> Well, it's only gonna get harder, but no.<eos> No, it's not your last chance.<eos> Well, listen to me.<eos> I don't know how to be a mom.<eos> Anouk, nobody does.
You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I just have something to say.<eos> Well, come in.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's just...<eos> I was awful.<eos> You were, but I was worse.<eos> I was saying you didn't know anything about...<eos> I don't.
The party<eos> - Andy running off.<eos> - You don't remember anything after that?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> You remember the alternate universe, though, right?<eos> I could use a précis.<eos> - "Précis"...?<eos> - It means 'recap'.<eos> I know what it means.<eos> Since when does Sam?
Meet back at my place!<eos> What did you put in that spell?<eos> You!<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> - What?<eos> - I know what you're capable of.<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - What's wrong with me?<eos> - As if you don't know.<eos> - Er, I don't. (Laughs)
I mean, Roland.<eos> Let's go now, before Roberts comes back.<eos> This is...<eos> Weird...?<eos> This is freakier than when I saw the alternate universe me.<eos> Why are you wearing that stupid hat?<eos> 'Cause it looks good.<eos> Everything we told you about magic and what we can do...<eos> - Are you gonna tell people?<eos> - Because if you do...
Where are you?<eos> - This place is massive.<eos> - Could be anywhere.<eos> How about it, Oscar?<eos> Got any more magical-altar vibes?<eos> I'm not getting anything.<eos> You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you?<eos> Based on recent experience?<eos> I know how badly you want to get Andy back.<eos> We all do.
Where are we sleeping tonight, honey?<eos> Truman...<eos> How did the Russians treat you? Badly, can't you see he's swollen, his breath stinks,<eos> I don't know what they gave him.<eos> You have breakfast here often?<eos> No, I'm with another candidate, she's in the restroom.<eos> She might adopt him. She phoned this morning, you were snoring.<eos> It's good to have more options.<eos> Since the Russian doesn't want him.<eos> - He doesn't?
Mmm.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Fridge needs some stocking.<eos> Oz?<eos> This isn't funny.<eos> Hello, Bobby.<eos> Weren't expecting me, were you?<eos> HOW'd you get in here?<eos> Your mother let me in.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Okay. - I will strike you down!<eos> - You're gonna strike me down?<eos> !<eos> - Hang on. See?<eos> That's a...<eos> - That's our thing.<eos> - They're doing a bit.<eos> - Sorry, that was just a joke. Do you guys want to do something a little fun?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - I do, I do.
- No.<eos> - What the hell does that...?<eos> Just... you can just go on your phone and do it on your phone.<eos> My phone is, it's so old!<eos> Oh, my God! That phone is preposterous!<eos> How long have you had that?<eos> - Nine... 90...<eos> - 90...? !<eos> - How do you get on the Internet?<eos> - I don't.
I don't know.<eos> We'll have to figure something out.<eos> We are, or you'll just decide?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, I just--<eos> You make these decisions and then come to us afterwards.<eos> - It'd be nice if you asked us first.<eos> - Mom wanted him home.<eos> - Dad didn't.
When you go, you have no idea.<eos> You don't see Mom and Dad.<eos> And we're the ones that have to deal with all the fallout.<eos> Do you ever wonder what I'm left dealing with?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm really happy you're here.<eos> I truly am.<eos> I'm so--<eos> - I think it's so good for Mom and Dad.<eos> - Oh, you do?
Even when we were little kids, I felt sorry for you because Dad hated me, but at least I got his attention.<eos> Now, I don't care if you're fucking around.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't judge you.<eos> I got your back, Mister.<eos> I just hope you got mine.<eos> Hey, I wanna tell you something.<eos> You don't have to marry Marco.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
But you just-- You can't.<eos> You never will.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Because you're not her.<eos> Maybe it was Meg's decision that started this whole thing.<eos> I tried to tell her, but she wouldn't listen to me.<eos> Still, I can't blame her for what she did.<eos> Whatever mistakes she made... her heart was in the right place.<eos> And in the end, she's my sister.<eos> What did you do?
Well, do you really think that moving away right now is the best idea, with everything that you're going through?<eos> I can't live with my mom, and I can't say no to both of them.<eos> - What if you could stay here?<eos> - Like, move in?<eos> Yeah. I mean, until graduation.<eos> You just shouldn't have to uproot your whole life for the last year and a half of high school because of this.<eos> I'm asking my mom if you can move in.<eos> Thank you...<eos> For caring so much.<eos> Oh, I don't.
You just--<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> - You're fucking on fire.<eos> I just wanna--<eos> What can I say?<eos> I know how to bring the heat.<eos> Yeah, I know I gotta tell them.<eos> I gotta tell them.<eos> I just--<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Dad!<eos> Dad, no!<eos> No!<eos> - Dad!<eos> No!<eos> Dad!<eos> - John.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Danny told me he asked to come home.<eos> He did?
It --<eos> Now.<eos> Looks like a burner.<eos> Phone you don't want to be traced.<eos> Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I-I-I don't know.<eos> I mean, I-I --<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I don't -
I'm with the FBI in Austin.<eos> Yes, uh, it's about Michelle.<eos> Is there any more coffee?<eos> Uh, actually, I think we're out. I'll -<eos> - I'll make some more tea. No.<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You don't believe in the afterlife at all, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
It's gonna be okay.<eos> What are they asking for?<eos> Food, a doctor for the wounded guy, a helicopter, and a pilot.<eos> They really are just making it up as they're going along, aren't they?<eos> Normally we should establish trust, try to humanize the hostages, but I don't know if that's gonna work.<eos> I don't think these guys have much compassion.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's a question of who they have compassion for.<eos> These guys killed Vega.<eos> Sellers did, not Ace.
What do you know about Benjamin Bennett?<eos> Judge Barnes ruled against him in a patent case a few months back.<eos> He was ticked off.<eos> There was a lot of money involved.<eos> That's how we know him.<eos> You know, through the paperwork.<eos> And the poker game?<eos> Isn't that a conflict of interest?<eos> I mean, I never discussed the case with him.<eos> But someone did?
I'm sorry.<eos> Um, yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your brothers don't hate you, you know.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Jimmy's right -- I left.<eos> After my mom died, I was the parent, and I left.<eos> Well, you felt trapped.<eos> Of course you did.
I hear it's big.<eos> Huge.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How's the tea?<eos> Hot.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
I get tired but I'm okay.<eos> There's something different about you from the last time we talked.<eos> You look lighter... less conflicted.<eos> Number three -- you saw it, found an answer, huh?<eos> The number three is incredibly common, Gabriel.<eos> We see it everywhere.<eos> Red clay -- a little rarer.<eos> But, uh, not much.<eos> I didn't want to be right.<eos> Of course you did.
Sorry, the door was open.<eos> When was this carpet changed?<eos> What?<eos> When was the carpet replaced?<eos> Why do you change a carpet?<eos> Because there is an immovable stain on it, right?<eos> Like red wine or something.<eos> But why do you change the floorboards underneath?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Yes, I can- - I was there; I witnessed it.<eos> I saw the whole thing.<eos> This is a car crash. Professor Stoddart<eos> Was hacked apart.<eos> If Dan had justification For suspecting frank Sutter did that, Then he had good reason to use<eos> Are you trying to persuade me, governor, Or are you rehearsing for a judge?<eos> Look, if your sheriff Is anywhere near those interviews, All the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible.<eos> You're a lawyer; you should know that.<eos> You want to conduct the interviews.<eos> Yes, I do.
Come and have a look.<eos> There.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Come on. Come on, get inside.<eos> You must have been young when You had Liam.<eos> I was 17...<eos> And he was so sweet to me. He completely convinced me to marry him and have the baby.<eos> My mum didn't approve. So didn't...<eos> You said you'd... Airlift Liam if he didn't get any better.<eos> Yes, I did.
Stabbed through the right eye.<eos> Cause of death-- scissors... Into the brain.<eos> Stabbed directly through the orbit of the right eye.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your fingerprints were on the scissors,<eos> As were the fingerprints of your lover.<eos> Yes.<eos> But nobody knows which one of you killed Ricardo Scelsi.<eos> Nobody.<eos> You do.
Elena.<eos> Elena, I got frozen Bolognese.<eos> We can have spaghetti.<eos> Elena?<eos> Elena?<eos> Elena?<eos> Elena?<eos> Elena, are you okay?<eos> Can I come in, please?<eos> Who did this to you?
You will make me an immortal mate.<eos> "No more let life divide what death can join together."<eos> There are such sins at my back it would kill me to turn around.<eos> Your daddy says, 'Come home,' so home you come.<eos> You can't run forever, Ethan.<eos> There's a moment, a moment you realize you are no longer the hunter, you are the prey.<eos> If you have been touched by the demon, it's like being touched by the back hand of God.<eos> Makes you sacred in a way.<eos> There are things within us all that can never be unleashed.<eos> What do those people do?
May I see Miss Angelique?<eos> But of course.<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> - I trust you shan't be disappointed.<eos> - I'm sure not.<eos> Be firm with her.<eos> She is wilful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
They were long summer afternoons and we were comrades in great adventures.<eos> Pirates on the Spanish Main or conquistadors exploring the New World.<eos> - They were happy days, our youth.<eos> - We were close?<eos> Very.<eos> When there were thunderstorms, you came to my bed.<eos> We never slept.<eos> We clung together until the storms passed.<eos> Did I admire fair-haired ladies?<eos> I did.
She needs my help.<eos> Then go find you a constable.<eos> Thee and me got nothing to talk about here.<eos> You want a salve for your heartache, I can give you that.<eos> You want herbs to ease the gout, I can give you that.<eos> You want to poison your baby brother, I can give you that, and laugh while I do it!<eos> But if you think you are touched by the demon then you best walk out that door.<eos> Because what I can give you for that is only knowledge you don't want, little girl!<eos> Who branded you?<eos> Who did that to you?
Lupus Dei.<eos> He shall be your challenge, daughter.<eos> I want to know who did this to you.<eos> Get better, Mr. Roper.<eos> We have much to talk about.<eos> My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Aren't you all dying to know?<eos> It's a story.<eos> A narrative that continues.<eos> Language to language.<eos> Greek to Latin to Sumerian to Arabic to 10 other obscure languages and pictographs, changing language from relic to relic.<eos> Is it the story of Lucifer, then?<eos> The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.

Good evening.<eos> Oh, it's fantastic, Malcolm.<eos> I wanted her to succeed here tonight.<eos> I...<eos> Be still your heart, Doctor.<eos> This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
You do that and you won't be able to stop.<eos> So stop now!<eos> I'll stop when his soul is burning, like hers was.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Do what you fucking want.<eos> I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> I see you for exactly what you are.<eos> LILY: Don't you want me to have friends?<eos> Of course I do.
- But you're not alone.<eos> Interestingly, I thought about putting Pandora and her wicked box in the exhibit.<eos> I mean, how could you show what the box contained?<eos> I could tell you.<eos> A mirror.<eos> Nothing but a mirror.<eos> What things you must do here.<eos> So much empty space to fill up with your... adventures.<eos> But you like adventures.<eos> Who doesn't?
Left to live freely.<eos> And my God?<eos> A better God at your side.<eos> And me?<eos> You will be who you are.<eos> End the torment, Vanessa.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> You offer me a normal life. Why do you think I want that anymore?<eos> I know what I am.<eos> Do you?
Walk with me.<eos> You recall the night I came to your room?<eos> I was so frightened.<eos> You were kind, and in the morning I was not so afraid.<eos> Stay with me tonight.<eos> And tomorrow?<eos> I promise you, we will be less afraid.<eos> I need to think.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do.
When you have seen that of which you are capable when you have stood in blood long enough what is there left but to wade to a desolate shore away from all others?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you?<eos> Where is your shore?<eos> There is no place far enough.<eos> I have lost the immortal part of myself, you see.<eos> No, I've thrown it away.<eos> No matter how far you have walked from God he is still waiting ahead.<eos> You don't believe in God.<eos> But you do.
Oh.<eos> I'd like to report a murder.<eos> Whose murder?<eos> A young lady.<eos> Set it down.<eos> Slowly.<eos> I...<eos> Take a step back.<eos> Keep-keep your hands where I can see 'em.<eos> I did it.
There have been whispers about Coca-Cola.<eos> No need to impress me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not here.<eos> This will just take a moment, Sarah.<eos> You can't be in here.<eos> Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy. You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just don't know what to do.<eos> Please tell me what to do.<eos> What do I do?<eos> It's not about trying to make your life perfect.<eos> Nobody's lives are perfect.<eos> You have kids because you and Andy are a team and you want to bring in some new team members.<eos> So you think we should?<eos> I don't know if you should have kids.<eos> I really don't.
I had to sell my pocket square collection.<eos> What are people's eyes gonna be drawn to?<eos> Look, you had a tough break.<eos> The stock market tanked, credit dried up.<eos> Who could have predicted that the country would run out of beef?<eos> You just got to move on.<eos> That's the problem, though.<eos> I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless.<eos> This time I was smart and careful, and I still went broke.<eos> What do I do now?
~ Stick with it.<eos> ~ Fuck off!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Now, if I might continue?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Character references, plus a reference of the applicant's bank.<eos> And we should interview them, if they're outsiders, ~ make sure they're Pagford people. ~ For an allotment?<eos> Remember the tomato blight dispute of '97?<eos> ~ Do you remember that?<eos> ~ Yes, I do.
Mother!<eos> Shaming me.<eos> Gaia, don't suck your teeth, yeah?<eos> Thanks!<eos> Love you, too!<eos> Oi, look, it's the deputy head.<eos> Oh, God! Look! Look at them.<eos> ~ Ignore them, Colin.<eos> ~ I've got no authority left.<eos> You do, natural authority.
Why would anyone need more than three lines?<eos> I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique.<eos> I forgot what I wrote.<eos> Can I hear it?<eos> Why don't you read it yourself?<eos> "Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist "whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."<eos> So far, so accurate.<eos> "If we were to work together, "she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."<eos> You forgot the last sentence.<eos> No, I didn't.
A hero named...<eos> Both: Tom Haverford.<eos> - Okay!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Oh, um, people grieve in different ways.<eos> Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out<eos> "Lucy, will you marry me?" then you have no business calling yourself a pet store.<eos> Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?<eos> I don't know, Tom.<eos> I really don't.

Oh. Weird couple of days for me too.<eos> Closed a bunch of deals, did a bunch of crunches...<eos> Yeah, I broke up with Conrad.<eos> Which was a long time coming, but still weird.<eos> So yeah, uh, do you want to talk about it?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet.<eos> But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTA awards.<eos> - Mm. He deserved it.<eos> - No. he didn't!
Why did I change my hairstyle?<eos> Well, I don't know, I just thought it would look better.<eos> Or my kids got gum in it.<eos> Are you trying to have it all?<eos> That question makes no sense.<eos> It's a stupid question.<eos> Stop asking it.<eos> Don't ask it.<eos> Do you miss your kids while you're at work?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Yesterday, you pretended you were gonna run.<eos> Today, you're gonna pretend like you're not gonna run.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Jen posted the campaign ad.<eos> It's everywhere.<eos> I'm running.<eos> How could she do this to--<eos> Oh, God, I'm remembering things.<eos> We called Jen last night, didn't we?<eos> - Yeah, we did. - Ugh.
You put me on the team, I find a way to win.<eos> Okay, copies are made.<eos> Um, everything has been collated and stapled.<eos> And all the research has been double-checked.<eos> I went through quite a few staples.<eos> I added a personal testimony vouching for April's brilliance.<eos> And this guy better appreciate it because I do not compare people to Mary J. Blige lightly.<eos> Uh, no one should.<eos> Do you want to go to dinner tonight?<eos> - I do not.
Oh!<eos> I see you've mastered the self-righteous air of all hypocrites.<eos> The truth is, you're worse than me, using Hayley's best intentions for your own self-serving power grab.<eos> You're wrong!<eos> You want her power so you can wage wars and win territories.<eos> After all, it's what wolves do.<eos> Gah!<eos> Uh!<eos> You don't know a damn thing about being a wolf.<eos> No. I don't.
I really am.<eos> Uh, yeah, that's 'cause you completely disappeared.<eos> No, I've just... I've been juggling a lot.<eos> Desi moved in, which is exciting, and we've had a lot of nibbles from this label, but, honestly, I think I've actually just been avoiding you because I have no idea how to say what I need to say to you.<eos> Great, are you, uh, breaking up with me, too?<eos> No, Hannah, I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Which is why I think you need to let Adam go.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
They're all anagrams.<eos> For Charles DiLaurentis.<eos> Some of those toys in Ali's room were hers but some of them were his.<eos> I feel like they grew up together.<eos> If I'm right, everything that matters most to Charles is in this vault.<eos> If we get in, we can use what's inside to bargain our way out.<eos> But Mona said we won't make it to the vault before the power comes on.<eos> Okay, if I'm right, this is as far as we need to go.<eos> I counted the steps to the vault from the prom room.<eos> - Of course you did.
It's you or the SHU.<eos> - You wanna be responsible for that?<eos> - Really?<eos> Suzanne, sit down.<eos> P... switch seats and don't talk to her!<eos> You wanna carry that grudge, be my guest, but I don't see how them scrawny chicken legs can stand the extra weight.<eos> My legs ain't scrawny... they're proportional.<eos> Hey, hey. - Nicky will be okay.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Gross.<eos> Hey, Daya, come on.<eos> A person only gets married once or twice in her life, so go big or go really big.<eos> Yeah, and it's not just about you.<eos> It's about all your family and friends. Mm-hmm.<eos> - Ay, I love a wedding party.<eos> - Hey, me, too.<eos> Yeah, what makes you think she wants you there?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.
Christina got some decent mommy skills.<eos> Maybe she can take care of the baby for a little while.<eos> She's in junior high.<eos> So what?<eos> Junior high will still be there!<eos> Plus, she's already done, what, two years?<eos> Yo, it's all good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I actually thought he loved me.<eos> And he probably did, Daya.
I think of shit and write it down.<eos> - Wow. - So pure.<eos> I got a question.<eos> If Edwina is really a robo-doll in the end... why doesn't she get rusty when Lily Sprinkle pees on her?<eos> She's made of pee-proof metal.<eos> Why does Sunflower have to be so mean?<eos> Oh, 'cause she's the one you love to hate.<eos> You should have her time hump with Lily Sprinkle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do it for the lesbians.
Anyway, when I started doing the Norma meetings... it finally felt like I belonged to something again, even if it was small, and I didn't want people to shit on it.<eos> So, when you came in acting like the rules were nothing, I got a little... carried away, maybe.<eos> Wait, your buggy...<eos> Do you mean you're, like...<eos> So, you, like, wore a bonnet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, it's, like, um...<eos> just, like, you in a... in a bonnet!<eos> Did you hear this?<eos> Did you...
It's like, "Help!<eos> I'm a skinny hot girl", but I need a little something extra to make me feel sexy."<eos> If you knew me, you would know I am definitely not the hot girl.<eos> "Help!<eos> The burden of my genetic perfection, it's so heavy and so unfair."<eos> Genes are genes and they do not take away from my God-given right to look in the mirror and feel shitty about my thighs.<eos> You're tall and blond, and your legs are up to your neck.<eos> Relax, enjoy it.<eos> I double majored in communications and comparative literature.<eos> Of course you did.
Peas are round and green.<eos> This is like a watery brown paste.<eos> - The bag said snow peas.<eos> I'm sure it tastes good.<eos> Don't forget, ladies, your usual meal is 1,500 calories.<eos> Beware of overeating.<eos> Well, this is disappointing.<eos> You've got the poulet a' la creme.<eos> I didn't know what that was.<eos> And I still don't.
Jesus Christ, Fahri.<eos> Wherever.<eos> I lost my appetite.<eos> Look, these kinds of things happen.<eos> It's the price of business.<eos> You don't know him like I do.<eos> I think I know him well enough... - Merci. - ...to say that he's not gonna murder us in our hotel room.<eos> Want to bet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
JWoww had a boyfriend.<eos> You got prison.<eos> Well, there's nowhere to go.<eos> It's like it's blue balls, but for my heart, Lorna.<eos> No, this is not happening.<eos> I... I was saving this for my vision board.<eos> But all vision, no action kills Hamlet, right?<eos> I guess.<eos> I don't really know.<eos> It did.
It doesn't always end badly.<eos> Oh, said the man whose wife sleeps in her mother's bed to the prisoner whose brand-new divorce certificate is her most prized possession.<eos> You gotta believe in something.<eos> Why not love?<eos> Because "happily ever after" was invented for the storybooks, so kids reach breeding age without killing themselves.<eos> So, love is the lie we tell ourselves so we don't go extinct?<eos> That's pretty bleak, Red, even for you.<eos> Oh, and you caught me on a glass-half-full day.<eos> So, you don't think there's someone out there you're meant to be with?<eos> Of course I do.
Peace out, Penn.<eos> I'm sorry about all that shit with Leanne.<eos> I always liked you anyway.<eos> Thanks, Ang.<eos> Hey, ain't your name Sara?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I call her "Ang" 'cause she reminds me of Angelina Jolie.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> - I don't see it.<eos> - I do.
And as for your one real resource, your partner, well, you're fucking around on her.<eos> So it's only a matter of time before that blows up in your face.<eos> Don't fuck where you eat, or shit where you fuck.<eos> It's bad business.<eos> Eight percent.<eos> You need to get money into their commissaries.<eos> And pay your girls a fair wage, huh?<eos> You know what Green Dot MoneyPak cards are?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, of course you don't.
Yeah, well, guess who else got experience growing' shit for other people to eat and gettin' none of it?<eos> - I know!<eos> - Watson?<eos> Is it our ancestors?<eos> - Ohhh, correct!<eos> - Whoo-hoo!<eos> And now, we takin' back a little thing called... reparations.<eos> You sure you want to get into the ring with me?<eos> - Oh, okay!<eos> - What if she do?
Look, this is never gonna work.<eos> The tuna thing is a dead giveaway.<eos> Give me this.<eos> Yeah, it's just all fish.<eos> There's no nuance.<eos> Well, sure.<eos> You should know.<eos> I mean... you do know what a vagina smells like.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Obviously, I do.
You're a champion.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wait.<eos> I... I think I have something to help.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> You think so?<eos> I mean, I-l hoped you'd think so.<eos> I just wasn't sure.<eos> I do.<eos> I re-- really do.
- Who will pick up the package?<eos> - Me.<eos> I'll come as well.<eos> Ella knows me.<eos> No.<eos> You must stay here.<eos> Take Saul then.<eos> She knows him.<eos> I don't know her.<eos> Of course you do.
That's correct. How long did it go on?<eos> Just the summer.<eos> I mean, I worried that something was going on, of course. I mean, he was her teacher.<eos> She was beautiful.<eos> But I didn't know anything for sure.<eos> And then when I told him what I'd done that I was gonna tell the truth about him one way or the other...<eos> That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut.<eos> And that's when I knew he was sleeping with her, that he'd... he'd probably hurt her, too.<eos> So, you're saying that you didn't recognize this photo when it became public.<eos> I did not.
And that's when you decided that he had fled, as opposed to staying with a pal somewhere?<eos> And then he was choking her, so... so we hit him. I...<eos> I hit him.<eos> I'd only just told him that I was gonna tell the world the truth about him. Wouldn't you run?<eos> You listen to me closely and do exactly as I tell you.<eos> Remove the body.<eos> He cannot stay here.<eos> Heads, we go back for the body.<eos> Your DNA is under his nails, on his skin, so the only way to get rid of it is to burn the body. We go back for the body and then what?<eos> We do what with it?
Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...<eos> A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta house.<eos> Arrest record on Rebecca Sutter shows a history of drug charges.<eos> What's that?<eos> A Christmas card for Rudy.<eos> Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?<eos> Why are you obsessing about Rudy?<eos> You said you didn't know him.<eos> Because I didn't.
"Or rather, s-straddled it... And I held on for dear life.<eos> "It was truly the best sex I've ever had.<eos> And get this...<eos> He was one of my patients."<eos> "I balanced myself on the tribal tattoo "he sported on his shoulder.<eos> "He winced in pain from his surgery, but I kept going."<eos> Chad initiated the sex.<eos> Continuing to lie to me only hurts your case.<eos> Have you seen me? In what world would anyone believe Chad would even look at me?<eos> But he did.
A sociopath.<eos> Is that about right?<eos> You said you'd protect us.<eos> - Aren't I?<eos> - How could we know?<eos> I mean, you...<eos> You only talk to us in code.<eos> You expect us to continue going to class and work your cases, even though nothing makes any sense anymore.<eos> I want to trust you.<eos> I do, but...
Hispanic.<eos> Burns.<eos> Everything's consistent with the other girl, except that this body's been in the water longer.<eos> So I'm gonna have to take a closer look.<eos> - Talk to you soon.<eos> - All right, guys.<eos> Be well.<eos> That's a second body.<eos> But we don't know if they were on the same boat.<eos> - Sure we do.
You know what I like about you and me, Danny, is that we can lay all our cards on the table.<eos> You know, there's no bullshit.<eos> What's going on, Pop'?<eos> Well...<eos> I want you to go.<eos> I want you to leave and not come back.<eos> It's never worked out with you being here, has it?<eos> - But why do you think that is? - I don't know.<eos> I don't know exactly.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Please, don't say I should write whatever I feel.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.<eos> It's not like he can hear me anyway.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> - Did you put gas in the car?<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - No, I did not.
Well, about you and Belle.<eos> I know.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I told you not to tell anybody.<eos> - He's my guy.<eos> He doesn't count.<eos> - Fuck it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I honestly-- I don't give a shit who knows.<eos> I don't.
- It was beautiful.<eos> You are so full of shit.<eos> That was disgusting.<eos> That was horrible, man.<eos> My father would've fucking hated it.<eos> It would've killed him.<eos> Hey, I danced with you one time.<eos> No!<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - No, no. We did.
- I can't get them to un-neon the neon.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I just... I don't understand why you would offer me money that wasn't actually yours to offer.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me right now?<eos> I knew this was a fucking bad idea.<eos> - Mmm. - Money always fucks things up.<eos> - Does it really?<eos> You know what?<eos> - Yeah, it does, always.
Neither do I.<eos> Good.<eos> It's just... it's just all the lying and the feeling guilty and shitty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's just so not what I want.<eos> - Good.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And you asked me if Jon knew about all the... the little things.<eos> Well, he didn't.
We do.<eos> You did the most generous thing that anyone's ever done for me and...<eos> But I really need to try this on my own, however I can.<eos> I still want to help you.<eos> So if I fall on my ass, then, come get hammered with me.<eos> And if it works out, then you have to be the first person at that window on opening day.<eos> But you need to start thinking about someone else first instead of me.<eos> He's a great fucking guy.<eos> And I really liked seeing you come out of his door with a big wreath on it.<eos> I kind of did too.
Get over here.<eos> Lucious, no!<eos> Lucious!<eos> Lucious!<eos> Take your pills.<eos> He's always loved them more than me.<eos> Even Jamal, who he hates.<eos> You know he's gonna leave it all to Hakeem, don't you?<eos> And Jamal won't object, because he's too passive.<eos> But what if he did?
Oh. And I have no idea where you got this, but it's totally my new profile pic.<eos> So. What do you want with me?<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> Because?<eos> Because I had a vision of you as a zombie, chasing a man through an alley.<eos> You were about to rip open his skull.<eos> He was killed in a DUI accident, wound up here.<eos> I ate his brain.<eos> Until the vision, I thought I was the only one.<eos> Yeah, until, like, three seconds ago, so did I.
- * All this time the sky was lying *<eos> - Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Daddy promises.<eos> - * They say that the moon *<eos> - You didn't have to do that.<eos> - * Don't shine *<eos> - I mean, everything you're giving up.<eos> None of it made me feel the way you do.<eos> - * It's just the light from a star *<eos> - Or did.
No, I only said that 'cause of me... 'Cause I was full of shit.<eos> But you're good at school.<eos> Look, Coke, I'm not taking you with me.<eos> But U.2.T.C.!<eos> - I know, Coke.<eos> - U.2.T.C.!<eos> Coke, this is taking care of you, okay.<eos> Didn't you get us a place?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Glory.<eos> What... What exactly are you doing?<eos> Kay, I'm helping.<eos> - You're helping?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, like you've been doing in my house with my daughter!<eos> - With my son!<eos> - Listen.<eos> - I know...<eos> - No, you don't!
What... What exactly are you doing?<eos> Kay, I'm helping.<eos> - You're helping?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, like you've been doing in my house with my daughter!<eos> - With my son!<eos> - Listen.<eos> - I know...<eos> - No, you don't!<eos> No, you don't!
Two blood trails lead out.<eos> One to the waitress, now deceased.<eos> The other to the road here, where he absconds, leaving a few dollars behind.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Why not take his own car?<eos> Unclear at this time.<eos> There's a shoe in that tree.<eos> There sure is.<eos> So, uh, this a local matter or do the State Police want it?<eos> - We do not. - [ Chuckles ]
Adam, I am over this, okay?<eos> What am I supposed to do, call ahead to every place you might possibly be?<eos> It's my girlfriend's art show.<eos> I'm gonna be here.<eos> I'm not gonna be anywhere else.<eos> You can hang out with your friends everywhere else.<eos> Why are you really here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hannah, you came.<eos> I did, Mimi-Rose.
Why don't you put those on?<eos> So you're Proctor's big bad watchdog.<eos> You don't look so tough from where I'm standing.<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> First, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Nola.<eos> - Let me die.<eos> - You already did.
- He knows you're lying.<eos> - He doesn't know shit.<eos> - He thinks I'm lying.<eos> - What's the difference?<eos> Come on, Agent Phillips, that's basic psy-ops protocol.<eos> The only way to overcome a physical advantage - is to establish a psychological one. - A psychological one.<eos> There you go.<eos> You remember.<eos> Yeah, I slept through that class at Quantico.<eos> No, you didn't.
It's not beating.<eos> It just needs to wake up.<eos> Give me the paddles.<eos> Clear.<eos> Come on, come on. Increase the joules to 20.<eos> Clear.<eos> Okay, sats are rising.<eos> Come on, take it to the rack, baby.<eos> All right.<eos> You did it, Scott.
- No. Our boys seem to love each other and we love making new friends.<eos> It's not an obligation. It's fun... - You know, yes.<eos> Yeah. - I...<eos> That actually sounds like a lot of fun, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure. And Alex was just talking this morning about wanting to make new friends.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Great. Well, why don't you come over at like 5:00, 5:30?<eos> We're at 1983, Cameron Court.<eos> - Done.
Most important job of all.<eos> I know exactly what you're talking about.<eos> Well, thank you, Alex.<eos> Thank you. What do you... What do you mean by that?<eos> I just...<eos> You know, I very much respect the mom job because I've been home with RJ and... Really?<eos> Yeah. I meant it as a compliment to all the moms out there. Yes, yes.<eos> It's beautiful that you're making those sacrifices so that Emily can pursue her career.<eos> - Thanks. But you need to find ways to nurture your soul at the same time.<eos> And how do you do that, babe?
What do you do?<eos> You're a salesman of water filters?<eos> And you can somehow afford this house doing that?<eos> Or do you make all this money selling these paintings?<eos> Which, Kurt, I've got to say, what are they?<eos> Are they supposed to be close-ups of assholes or what?<eos> That's so funny.<eos> Both you and your husband got that immediately.<eos> I feel like I need to clear some things up for you.<eos> Yes. Please do.
Oh, don't put the flowers there. That's where the wedding cake's going to go.<eos> A whole day's takings squandered.<eos> And all this is getting in the way of the Spring promotion.<eos> The peacocks have arrived!<eos> Peacocks?<eos> - Come on, Alfie.<eos> Pick 'em up. - No, it'll bite my 'and off.<eos> - Don't be so lily-livered.<eos> - Oh, bugger off.<eos> Just do it. One of you.
- You know.<eos> - Oh, don't listen to him.<eos> In the '90s, he was met with reverses.<eos> Mind your own business, Kippy.<eos> - (music playing) - Marnie: Look at this.<eos> - Hey, sweetie? - Yeah?<eos> I think we should, uh, maybe not tell anyone about our little secret yet.<eos> Oh, baby, don't worry about it.<eos> I am a very private person. You know that.<eos> I do.
I hate flutes.<eos> We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes.<eos> Then there's the food.<eos> The food is the most important thing, don't you agree?<eos> We're gonna need pigeon pies.<eos> That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?<eos> Don't they?<eos> Don't who?<eos> People eat pigeon pie in the capital.<eos> They certainly do, my dear.

- Doing cross-country training.<eos> I don't know how you managed it, but he's looking really good now.<eos> You have a chance in cross-country... but in dressage...<eos> I know, but it's so difficult...<eos> And I promised Windstorm, no more horse shows.<eos> The last horse show you rode was to help Windstorm.<eos> Don't you think he'd do the same for you?<eos> If you'd at least come along.<eos> You don't need me anymore.<eos> Just do it your way.
- Everywhere...<eos> Nowhere.<eos> We moved from one racing stable to another, my mother and I.<eos> She died when I was 15.<eos> First I was at a home, now I work here and there...<eos> Anywhere there's horses.<eos> It must seem odd to a sheltered girl like you...<eos> Who knows where she belongs.<eos> I never knew where I belong.<eos> I do, now, but... At our farm...
Anna writes for magazines and Tricia is dedicated to caring for children.<eos> We do not have to talk.<eos> List?<eos> We'll be back in an hour.<eos> He is making his second cycle of chemotherapy.<eos> It is very weak.<eos> Do you think it will get better?<eos> At the moment I do not think so.<eos> At first he said he did not want to study medicine.<eos> Well, I did but I did not.
Don't touch me.<eos> I'm not going to touch you.<eos> I'm going out in the forest with mum.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> - You like pornography?<eos> - Pornography?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You like it?<eos> - No.<eos> - I do.
I felt like I was a very lucky woman.<eos> Then he lost his job.<eos> And he started drinking.<eos> And then... beating me.<eos> I could guess how bad the beating would be by the hands of the clock.<eos> Time was a source of terror.<eos> But in here, every moment spent free of that man is a gift.<eos> But... why are you here?<eos> Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.
You're here with us now.<eos> You're here with family.<eos> Come on.<eos> Daryl.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thought you were going to that party over there.<eos> Oh, I was never going to go 'cause of Eric's ankle, thank god.<eos> Why the hell did you tell me to go, then?<eos> I said try.<eos> You did.
I don't get what takes her so long.<eos> I mean, we only have one copy and the point of book club is that we all read the book.<eos> I just keep hoping that a dentist shows up at our gates. - It's his teeth.<eos> - I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.<eos> I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.<eos> Sasha, honey, what's your favorite meal?<eos> I'd love to cook it for you sometime.<eos> I'm doing it for all the new arrivals.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.
Let's move. Let's be safe.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, let's move.<eos> - Tara. - Yeah?<eos> - You got it?<eos> - I got this aisle.<eos> Shh.<eos> They're stuck behind something.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Heard you lost your wife.<eos> You know...<eos> I'm sure it looks like we haven't lost much, but we have.<eos> We've lost things.<eos> Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through,<eos> I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.
You need us for that.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'll go get back to work on those field plans.<eos> - I'll be down in a minute.<eos> - Okay.<eos> After these are done, that's it.<eos> I'm not helping you again and you're not coming back. - You got it?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> I hope you're not expecting to leave with more than half of these.<eos> You barely did half the work.
Deanna: Stop it!<eos> Stop it right now.<eos> You touch them again and I'll kill you.<eos> Damn it, Rick!<eos> I said stop.<eos> Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, Rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
My mother saw Roger groping Celia in the back staircase hours before his death, forcing himself on a subservient employee...<eos> An employee who has mysteriously gone missing.<eos> If Celia is the killer, then what the hell are you lecturing us about?<eos> Shouldn't you be outside, trying to find her?<eos> No, because I know exactly where Celia is.<eos> Does anybody find it strange that Celia and Alice were never in the same room at the same time?<eos> And do any of you find it as interesting as I do that Celia is an anagram of Alice?<eos> [Scoffs] That doesn't prove anything.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.
A-are you all right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Good.<eos> [Chuckling] That's good.<eos> Do you remember our trip to Scottsdale?<eos> That's something I'll never forget.<eos> We had fun watching the cubbies.<eos> Didn't we, Danny boy?<eos> [Laughs] Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Dad, we sure did.
Hello, guilty.<eos> Hanging up now.<eos> This guy's... yeah, he's probably a target.<eos> Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas.<eos> You know, if Kettleman isn't careful with that money, I mean his whole family could be in danger.<eos> What do you mean, "danger"?<eos> Jimmy, why would you say that?<eos> What?<eos> You said the family might be in danger.<eos> I did? I... oh, I, uh...
Fine.<eos> Perfect end to a perfect day.<eos> Hey, guys, wait a second.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> - I'm sorry. What?<eos> - I don't want to press charges.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> You want to press charges.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
How about you?<eos> It was good, you know? Just took it easy, worked on the place.<eos> You should see dov's room.<eos> We totally redid it -- it looks awesome.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, i should -- gail's waiting for me, so i should...<eos> Yeah, it was -- it was nice to see you.<eos> Did you paint over our wall?<eos> The wall that we did together, mind map of our love, Complete with photographs and special, special notes?<eos> Yeah, i did.
Corey?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know traci nash?<eos> Extra-large redeyenonfatlatte.<eos> Of course i know her.<eos> I know everyone who comes in.<eos> Come on. Sit down.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Sam: Did you know that she's a police officer?<eos> Yes, i did.
Yes.<eos> Do you know traci nash?<eos> Extra-large redeyenonfatlatte.<eos> Of course i know her.<eos> I know everyone who comes in.<eos> Come on. Sit down.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Sam: Did you know that she's a police officer?<eos> Yes, i did.<eos> You did?
Oh, my god.<eos> Do you know who he's talking about?<eos> Just talked to corey's mom.<eos> His alibi checks out.<eos> But i was going through the system.<eos> Found this one from last week.<eos> Attempted be, balcony entrance around midnight, Woman came home and found a guy in her apartment.<eos> She screamed and he took off.<eos> You want to check it out?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, i do.
I don't know yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, um, i...<eos> I'll see you around, collins.<eos> Yeah, see you around, whatever your name is.<eos> Jamie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ¶ gravity gets us... ¶ You know i'm a cop, right?<eos> I do.
Okay, so our bomber didn't steal them.<eos> No, I don't think so. Frack hasn't reported a theft, and we're not exactly dealing with the best and the brightest, even as far as criminals go.<eos> Now, here is a list of everyone who was arrested that day.<eos> This is a list of all Frack employees and everyone who buys from Frack.<eos> Okay, so, either Ted McDonald or one of these other criminals illegally purchased explosives from...<eos> One of these names.<eos> Let's connect them.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Mary Chang went to book club, and what do you know?<eos> So did Aldo "icepick" Perez.
- They are worried about my soul.<eos> - So, Connor didn't hurt you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Now, can you please uncuff him so that we can get out of here?<eos> [Dog barking] I'm gonna go call your parents.<eos> Get that dog out of here.<eos> [Police radio chatter] Could've saved yourself a lot of trouble if you had just told the truth.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> We thought you'd let me go when you figured that out.<eos> But you didn't.
You were on the field when the shooter fired.<eos> Your boyfriend got caught up in a turf war.<eos> You think they're after Raj because he was connected to Kill Street.<eos> That silver S.U.V...<eos> you ever seen it before?<eos> Yeah...<eos> belongs to Boz Shepherd.<eos> Did you happen to see who was driving it today?<eos> You want me to say it was Boz.<eos> And what if I did?
- We got him.<eos> - What about Henry Kim?<eos> Well, if Kim knows Boz got I.D.'d, he just might change his story, right?<eos> You know, Boz is a talented guy, but he's not magic.<eos> He can't be in two places at the same time.<eos> Yeah, we've got him at the crime scene.<eos> An eyewitness I.D.'d him about an hour ago.<eos> Which means either our witness is lying or you may have been confused about this morning.<eos> Someone saw him at the baseball field?<eos> Yes, they did.
Yeah.<eos> Apparently, it went viral.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Don't know yet.<eos> Does Steve know you're here?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
Don't know yet.<eos> Does Steve know you're here?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> Do Boris and your brother get along?<eos> It's Winston, right? That's your brother.<eos> They do all right.
Get over here.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - It's actually tradition.<eos> It's a superstition.<eos> Look, I'm gonna take boo for a walk and then take him to the sitter's, okay?<eos> Uh, you have like 40 minutes to get ready and get out of here.<eos> Also, don't forget that Oliver's taking you, all right?<eos> Traci's gonna take me.<eos> Uh, do you have the music on your phone?<eos> I do. Okay.
How bad is it?<eos> Um... You want to take that off?<eos> 'Cause if I stitch you into there, you will not be able to get out.<eos> Uh, fine.<eos> Just do it. It's fine.<eos> - Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> All right.<eos> I mean, you know what you're doing, right?<eos> Of course I do.
Is that really necessary?<eos> It is...<eos> Necessary.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> After you, Rachel.<eos> Holy doodle, here we go.<eos> Oi, oi, Rachel.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Never gets old, does it?<eos> Yeah, it does.
Fuck.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I just do.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, my old man never gave a shit about me.<eos> All right?<eos> I mean...<eos> I guess you could call him honest.<eos> But I fucking hated him for it.<eos> I still do.
Hey, Ms. Rayburn, can I talk to you?<eos> Sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> I have a problem.<eos> Do you think you should talk to Gwen, or my mom?<eos> No, it's not really about work.<eos> It's for me.<eos> Well, for my cousin Carlos.<eos> You remember him?<eos> Yes, I do.
Why would we do that?<eos> He's been through enough.<eos> He doesn't need this.<eos> What do you mean "he's been through enough"?<eos> All of it.<eos> His whole fucking childhood.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - You know what I'm fucking talking about.<eos> - No, I don't.
I do get it.<eos> And I'm okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, uh...<eos> And I love you.<eos> And I'm always gonna love you, so... you know...<eos> That's the deal.<eos> - So...<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> I do.
Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter.<eos> What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?<eos> Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.<eos> Hmm, perhaps.<eos> But I'm not taking the cap off.<eos> It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.<eos> Now, I'm telling you for the last time-- take the cap off.<eos> Oh!<eos> Really?<eos> What if I don't?
You know, when you talk like that,<eos> I want to take you right here on this table.<eos> And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight.<eos> So, how's the detector going?<eos> Well, it's tricky working with superfluids.<eos> Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.<eos> Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.<eos> Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around, yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"<eos> Come on, this is boring-- you really want to talk about this?<eos> No, I do.
You could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one.<eos> And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry.<eos> You know I can't stand these scented markers.<eos> No one told you to taste them.<eos> Come on, is-is this good or not?<eos> It's good.<eos> Really?<eos> I like it.<eos> I think you're on to something.<eos> You do?
You're sure it's good?<eos> My name is right on there with yours.<eos> That is a surefire mark of quality.<eos> That might as well say "Directed by Joss Whedon".<eos> Okay, partner, let's do it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Click the mouse with me.<eos> One... two... three...<eos> Click.<eos> Well, we did it.

What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?<eos> Please don't.<eos> Yep, you're mad.<eos> Okay, let me see the damage.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Well, I think you broke the dowels.<eos> You're not gonna have time to glue it back on-- you'll have to nail it.<eos> With what?<eos> Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?<eos> She does.
Thank you.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.<eos> Why did he think you're the lead scientist?<eos> It was my idea!<eos> You know, for an extra four bucks,<eos> I can have this thing here tomorrow.<eos> Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is 'cause my name is on it.<eos> You know what?<eos> I did it.
You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert...<eos> Shut up!<eos> So glad you two are done fighting.<eos> Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Physics Today mentioned the paper.<eos> What'd they say?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Did they mention Leonard?<eos> They did.
I'd say...<eos> Knox over Ticonderoga 'cause it's got the gold.<eos> And McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count.<eos> Oh.<eos> 10:00.<eos> Date night's over.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> We haven't picked a winner.<eos> We both know this one's gonna win.<eos> Well, of course we do.
Thank you, Mummy, I love you!<eos> Helicopters for everybody!<eos> What's taking so long?<eos> I don't think this is gonna work.<eos> Just let me see.<eos> Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.<eos> A: surprised you know that.<eos> B:<eos> I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.<eos> Oh. Well, you do.
Subtle, mom, real subtle.<eos> Stuart.<eos> Morning.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> I don't mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules.<eos> And rule number one is pants.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> You must be very proud of your son. Oh, yes.<eos> He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.<eos> He did?
- You're a fucking looser.<eos> You can't do that dare and then pick truth.<eos> It's not the rules.<eos> I can do what I want.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you like Robyn?<eos> Nah, do a dare.<eos> Oh, why?<eos> 'Cause you do?
Huh?<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Ben.<eos> You're gonna leave little Ben here, all alone, with us?<eos> You know you're only making this worse, right?<eos> Let him go, man.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, I'll let him go.<eos> Just come out here.<eos> He didn't do anything.
It's all right.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I cannot be your husband any longer. And I will not be less to you.<eos> You did what was necessary to survive.<eos> - That's all.<eos> - No.<eos> No, he broke me.<eos> He broke me, Claire.<eos> He knew it.<eos> We both did.
That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not in her ear, right?<eos> Not in her ear, not in her ear. Hey...<eos> Bro, I never did catch your name.<eos> - Saul.<eos> - Saul?<eos> "S'all good, man."<eos> Get it?<eos> I do...
We gotta get out of here.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> You're right. You know what?<eos> I... sweeten the pot.<eos> I got, $5, $20, $40, $60, $80... 580 bucks.<eos> Add that to the $1,000...<eos> It's more than half.<eos> What do you know about that thing?<eos> I mean, is it worth more than $3,000?<eos> No, I don't...
I wouldn't--<eos> Wardeness of the North?<eos> You are the last surviving Stark.<eos> He needs you.<eos> And what if you're wrong?<eos> What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?<eos> Or he does and the Boltons defeat him?<eos> Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Of course you do.
Why Daenerys?<eos> Why is she worth all this?<eos> As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.<eos> Do you believe in anything?<eos> I believe in lots of things.<eos> In something greater than ourselves, I mean.<eos> The gods, destiny.<eos> Do you believe there's a plan for this world?<eos> No.<eos> Neither did I.
Neither did I.<eos> I was a cynic just like you.<eos> Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs.<eos> When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones.<eos> Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.<eos> Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?<eos> No.<eos> It's hard to be a cynic after that.<eos> Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.<eos> No, it doesn't.
These are warrior hands, not a serving girl's.<eos> 5, going once...<eos> How long before the King of Meereen comes to claim my pillow?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> My marriage to Hizdahr is political.<eos> I think he's smart enough to understand that.<eos> I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?<eos> I do.
We cannot give in to despair.<eos> I will speak with the High Sparrow.<eos> There must be something he--<eos> Let me talk to him on your behalf.<eos> The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.<eos> You will try to help her?<eos> I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.<eos> Your happiness is all I want in this world.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.<eos> I did what she said.<eos> I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> These are complicated matters.<eos> No, it's not complicated at all.<eos> It's simple.<eos> I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Of course you don't.
The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.<eos> Thank you, High Septon, for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.<eos> Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?<eos> I think I may have heard at one point.<eos> Baelor built his sept around it.<eos> But men worshipped here long before him.<eos> Who carved this altar?<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - I'm afraid I don't.<eos> No one does.
Where is Mance?<eos> - He died.<eos> - How?<eos> I put an arrow through his heart.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.<eos> Hey, none of you saw Mance die.<eos> I did.
I mean, what were the chances?<eos> You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry?<eos> My point is... we don't choose whom we love.<eos> It just, well-- it's beyond our control.<eos> - I sound like an idiot.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying and failing to say--<eos> I know what you're trying to say.<eos> No, I'm afraid you don't.<eos> I do.
Well, um, I'm the one in your left ear.<eos> - Oh, keep... yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah, could you turn down the music?<eos> It's just a little loud and we're trying to work.<eos> That would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, you did it.
You're gonna want to see this.<eos> Come on, gather round.<eos> Now, this... is a pig.<eos> And the pig wants what the pig wants.<eos> And I'm not gonna give it to him.<eos> And the pig is gonna whale on me.<eos> And all of you are gonna watch.<eos> So, piggy bank, you getting mad yet?<eos> You getting mad?<eos> Do your thing.
- Ow.<eos> - Yeah. Thing is, Leo, cops can lie, but we can't make deals.<eos> No, you promised.<eos> And wives can be a lot of things, but we don't get to beat them to death.<eos> Come on.<eos> - I'm gonna tell.<eos> - Where is that thing?<eos> All right? I'm gonna tell.<eos> I'm gonna tell my lawyers what you did.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
Hey, Howard.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You?<eos> Huh? Come on.<eos> She did?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Well, the ladies, huh?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Him I like.<eos> - And the baby does this.
Way out of my league.<eos> And he lives with me now.<eos> I lived with Karl, but he moved out, and Freddie got thrown out of India House, so he moved in.<eos> Just when I've got a chastity belt.<eos> I'm lickin' the walls.<eos> He looks nice, though, he looks really nice.<eos> Hashtag, get naked!<eos> Yeah, no-one says ' "hashtag'" out loud, not any more.<eos> They do.<eos> My friends do.
Could I?<eos> - I've got to go, she's been sick all down herself.<eos> Haven't you?<eos> Erm... yeah, OK.<eos> Look at you, all down your nice clean top.<eos> - Molly, would it kill you to help?<eos> - I sort of need it now. Oh...<eos> Look, Cleo... if there's something I need to know, then you should tell me.<eos> Now, tell your Uncle Henry, that tone doesn't work with me, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Then I'll leave you alone.<eos> - Does this mean you're a virgin?<eos> - I'm not talking about it.<eos> I am not talking about this.<eos> I'm really not talking about it, OK?<eos> I mean, we had all sorts of problems.<eos> Daft things.<eos> You know, like any couple.<eos> I promised I'd learn to swim.<eos> I never did.
Thank you.<eos> And Henry, I'm sure you'd, er...<eos> Yes, I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> I wish I'd spent more time with him.<eos> But, er... you know, things get busy and, er... I could have made more effort.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> I... apologise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He liked... football, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
That's nine years without... whatever.<eos> I had to invent all sorts of tricks.<eos> - You'll never know.<eos> Well, go on.<eos> Like what?<eos> Tell me!<eos> - I give a great blow job.<eos> - OK.<eos> In my opinion.<eos> So, what do you do?
- Who is it?<eos> Doesn't matter, does it?<eos> They're not gonna know who you are.<eos> - It's Dean.<eos> - Who's Dean?<eos> He's an idiot.<eos> Come on!<eos> Just get it off.<eos> Pull it.<eos> Do the other one.
No.<eos> - But you thought I was hot?<eos> - Yeah. - So when did you realise I wasn't?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> - Yeah, I want to know.<eos> - I dunno.<eos> Straightaway.<eos> Veronica said you're one of those men that flirts with anyone.<eos> Did you tell her about us at your house?<eos> Well, did you?
Sorry.<eos> He's fit.<eos> I can see why you chased after him.<eos> Except Lance ended up getting slaughtered.<eos> Right, I didn't... Um...<eos> I'm not sure that's fair.<eos> You make it sound like it was my fault.<eos> Well, you killed him.<eos> - I did not.<eos> - But... you did.
That's what he did with us, Mr B.<eos> - He came and he went.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You were never gonna have him.<eos> No.<eos> Funny thing is... that's what drove him away in the end.<eos> How d'you mean?<eos> Long story.<eos> But I liked him.<eos> I really did.
That turned to shit.<eos> So, what are you doing these days?<eos> Things.<eos> How are you doing there, Henry?<eos> Are we looking after you?<eos> - Yes, all good, thanks. Hello.<eos> - How's the project?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You had to do a project, you worked late, you had to get it finished by the weekend?<eos> Oh, the schedule, I did it, yes!
Not much in the way of intellect.<eos> But impressively brutal, when given the opportunity.<eos> I apologize for the prison Commissary, but I see you managed well enough.<eos> Good for you.<eos> So...<eos> You couldn't keep out of prison long enough to hear if your pardon had been granted or not.<eos> Your petition of complaint against me?<eos> Surely you haven't forgotten.<eos> You recognize this?<eos> 'Course you do.
I would expect that they would try him as an adult.<eos> Bitch!<eos> That's if he is connected to the crime.<eos> If not, then it's wide open.<eos> He can be incarcerated as a juvenile offender on a lesser charge.<eos> He could just get probation.<eos> What do...<eos> What do I have to do to get my son out of here?<eos> What do I...<eos> What do I do?
It doesn't matter now.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Was Matt on drugs?<eos> D-did... did he... Did he deal drugs? - What?<eos> - Did...<eos> I mean, 'cause...<eos> No, but they're saying things about Matt.<eos> They're saying things about him, and I need to know.<eos> He had some grass around.<eos> Everybody does.
Yeah, I ought to give him a raise.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jim, I saw you on the TV. That billboard thing?<eos> And I had me a pair of insights.<eos> Insight the first:<eos> You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second:<eos> You believe in the real America. Freedom. Self-sufficiency.<eos> I do.<eos> I... I really do.
But you can't go getting yourself in trouble, Stef.<eos> You want IA on your ass again?<eos> OK, thank you.<eos> Oh, have you talked to Timothy yet?<eos> Not yet, I just, uh, I haven't had a chance today.<eos> OK, let me know how it goes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, you know, I've been meaning to tell you,<eos> Mariana stopped by my office today.<eos> - She did? Why?
Why?<eos> She think Heaven's gonna be any nicer than that house?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> But for real.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> I think she...<eos> Sometimes it just gets to be too much, you know?<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> 'Course you do.
I think you're awesome.<eos> It's me I wonder about sometimes.<eos> Come on, nerd, walk me to band practice.<eos> So how'd it go?<eos> With Timothy?<eos> Not great.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought you said I had, autonomy, when it comes to academics here.<eos> - You do.
And I would recommend that you get Franz some psychiatric treatment.<eos> Thank you. But our family does not pay for psychologists.<eos> And there is still the case of the wrongful dismissal.<eos> I don't understand...<eos> Franz beat Carl with that stuffed fox.<eos> Yes, alright, we get it.<eos> But I think it's time to move on.<eos> And besides, I think it's irresponsible having a stuffed fox standing around in a kindergarten.<eos> You sound different from when we spoke on the phone.<eos> No, I don't.
- What?<eos> Because it's too polarizing, okay?<eos> And don't be misogynistic and please don't be gross, I mean...<eos> Guys, let's-let's be smart about this.<eos> Let's be right down the middle.<eos> Right down the middle sounds so boring.<eos> That's not what the audience wants to see.<eos> Thinking I'm gonna do a Jenny McCarthy thing, where I'm, like, super sexy, but I got a potty mouth.<eos> Ah-ah, no, no, Dee, you are never going to be sexy.<eos> And do not do a potty mouth thing, okay?
I mean, it represents infinite possibilities.<eos> It's endless. What if there's, like, a mutant living down there?<eos> We can get him up and he can live in the bar with us.<eos> We've already got one mutant hanging out with us in the bar all the time.<eos> Hey, Frank, did you hear what I said?<eos> I turned a frustrating conversation into a joke on you.<eos> - The, uh... thing. - Huh? Oh, y-yeah.<eos> Frank, what do you think about this hole?<eos> Pretty cool, huh? You want to do something with it? No.<eos> I don't.
I told you to look out for him.<eos> I heard from him last night.<eos> Said he had some business driving Ghost.<eos> Look, you talk to Shawn again, you tell him to call me, okay?<eos> I got you.<eos> I'll tell Shawn to call his mom soon as he hits me up.<eos> That's some cold shit, K.<eos> What you think she gonna do when she find out you the one that clipped him?<eos> She ain't gonna find out shit, right?<eos> If you did your job right, right?
Ever since father died...<eos> A small dark part of me has blamed you for his death.<eos> When they told me what happened at Fort William, that Randall flogged ye himself, and that seeing that is what killed father,<eos> I thought you must have done something to bring it upon yerself.<eos> Shot yer mouth off, or acted without thinking of the consequences, as ye have done all yer life.<eos> But then out at the mill pond, when I saw the scars on yer back, scars made by a lash laid down wi' such fury... you dinna fash yerself about it anymore.<eos> It was me.<eos> It's my fault that Randall beat ye so.<eos> You dinna ken what you're saying.<eos> But I do.
[Dance music plays] Hey, uh, we've talked to everybody who lives around here already.<eos> Why do we got to stay put when we know the dude's not coming back?<eos> We actually don't know that he's not coming back.<eos> So until we hear otherwise...<eos> Listen, I hear otherwise.<eos> - You hear that music?<eos> - No. Feel that beat?<eos> Mnh-mnh.<eos> Come on, Peck. I saw dancing lessons on your bucket list.<eos> - No, you didn't.

Wanting to get down a little more?<eos> - Hey. Hey, Peck.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> Moore, hey. Um...<eos> This isn't a date, but I have some warm beer in my locker, and I was wondering if you wanted to get it...<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I do.
I didn't...<eos> I didn't want to hurt anybody.<eos> I was gonna come cl... come clean after.<eos> But then... then I found out what Alonso did to Ted, and this just...<eos> Alonso killed Ted McDonald?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, you need to think this through.<eos> Think what through?<eos> You want to save Oliver, right?<eos> Of course I do.
That's my line!<eos> [ door closes ] So, the brain will create love Even when we don't have it, right?<eos> What's your point?<eos> Nothing, except for the fact That your idea of a perfect relationship Is nothing but a delusional fantasy.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's funny.<eos> No?<eos> Okay, what's up, dov?<eos> You don't talk to me for months, And now you want to be my friend?<eos> Actually, no, i don't.

You don't?
Yeah, well, me too.<eos> [ Rock music playing ] You thought about where you'd go if you had a choice?<eos> Yeah, back in time 9 1/2 months.<eos> You?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I kind of liked working intelligence with Marlo.<eos> Sorry to bring her up.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, I really don't.
I wanted to be part of the family.<eos> But I had a job to do.<eos> So, after everything that it cost you, you're okay with the choices you made?<eos> Here's what I do know... I can live with myself.<eos> I can look in the mirror and still see me.<eos> And sometimes that's all you can hope for.<eos> [ Footsteps depart ] [ Door opens ] Bill:<eos> Gail. They're ready for you.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?<eos> I do.
Thought I'd come by. You can take some more shots at me in case you didn't get your fill today.<eos> What time's your flight?<eos> - Don't have a flight.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Taking a train to Vancouver?<eos> - I'm not taking the train.<eos> Look, I only told you about the offer to give you an out.<eos> Giving me an out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> I never did, okay?
Julie: This is it.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - You made this?<eos> Brandt: You're gonna save so many lives.<eos> Julie Malarek.<eos> - Linus.<eos> - Checking.<eos> - They're taking it from me.<eos> - No, they can't.<eos> They did.
Okay, fine, wow.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Let's start with this morning.<eos> Did anything unusual happen?<eos> Did you see your brother before you left for school?<eos> Uh, he was gone before I got up, but I... I saw my mom.<eos> Did you talk about anything?<eos> She asked me what I wanted for breakfast, and... and I said cereal, so she made me oatmeal before she started getting ready for her clients.<eos> And when does your mom normally leave for work?<eos> She doesn't.
- Is Mom with you?<eos> - No, she's coming up later.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Look, I know it's no secret that your mom and I have been having problems.<eos> I just want you to know that no matter what happens with us, you will always be my daughter.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's a miracle that you survived us.<eos> You must be some superhuman kid.<eos> You know how much your mom and I love you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hi.<eos> Hey. Annabeth:...<eos> It's too much pressure.<eos> I need a cruller. I need a cruller.<eos> You expecting someone?<eos> No, I'm just enjoying my pancake and hoping there isn't a fire.<eos> Oh, very funny.<eos> Hey, look, Zoe, I'm here for you.<eos> I mean, I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
Like one of the... upside-down twisty-turny ones.<eos> And I guess it wasn't fair of me to get upset when you hesitated to get right back on.<eos> So if I were to ask you to dinner again, would you slam the door in my face?<eos> Try me.<eos> Zoe Hart, Mm-hmm. Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes! All right, well, we better get going 'cause, uh, got a reservation in, like, ten minutes.<eos> What?<eos> You made a reservation?<eos> Well, Wanda did.
You can do this.<eos> Now give us the cookies.<eos> Nuh-uh-uh.<eos> No.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Daddy, are you okay?<eos> Delilah said that Grandma Bettie summoned Shelby here.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
Okay. But I... loosened it for you.<eos> You did.<eos> Take care, A.B.<eos> Hey, this is fun.<eos> And thanks for the food.<eos> Oh, and I broke up with Davis 'cause I still love you.<eos> Good night.<eos> George, do you think what we had, that we'll... find it with other people?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
You only came so you had a place to rehearse.<eos> - And?<eos> - Enough Daniel!<eos> Go to your room!<eos> You too, Roman!<eos> Last month you had dreadlocks, now you're a punk!<eos> Stupid pest!<eos> Why do you always befriend weirdos?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Uh, if I may venture a guess, it was because you did it once before.<eos> The Christmas affair.<eos> You fractured in Santa's place and spread across space and time.<eos> So you were prepared to hold up under similar circumstances.<eos> That's a hell of a coincidence.<eos> Ah, but the storybook, Tesla device, the thread... all required to bring the library home.<eos> But almost...<eos> Well, almost as if these past months, your missions had been directed by fate itself.<eos> But the clipping book didn't send us to Santa.<eos> You did.
Hey, jackie, hey.<eos> Does jane take violin?<eos> I saw her with a violin.<eos> She does play violin.<eos> Where?<eos> After school?<eos> Actually, she's--<eos> Because checkers is gonna start playing the violin And maybe they could do it together?<eos> Music lessons are in the art room, right?<eos> Actually, she doesn't do it at school.
Where is he now?<eos> He just climbed into the helicopter.<eos> He knows you're here.<eos> Do you have a plan for getting in?<eos> I'm going with a nine-millimeter tucked under my arm.<eos> Buffie doesn't trust you.<eos> He believes you know what happened to Steiner.<eos> I've been trying to call my son since yesterday, but he doesn't respond.<eos> Do you know where Steiner is?<eos> I do.
It's me.<eos> Will...<eos> Are you real?<eos> Left.<eos> Go left.<eos> I'm not gonna be able to carry her out of here.<eos> - We have to wake her up.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
- I don't understand, sir.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> It seems he's not coming back.<eos> Van Damme always comes back.<eos> Daniella, I don't think you both were listening to me.<eos> What I'm saying is that he came to the set.<eos> - He came to the fucking set.<eos> - The director says he knows him.<eos> Yes, he did.
I took that sword of yours to the smithy.<eos> Had the nicks ground off the blade, And polished off the rust with a bit of whale oil.<eos> You needn't have troubled yerself.<eos> It was no trouble.<eos> Looks better than new.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> So, my stomach's rumbling like thunder.<eos> Jenny, how about you put some supper on the fire?<eos> You know yer way to the dining room, lads.<eos> I do indeed.
Aye, Jenny hides the good stuff away when we come,<eos> Along with Ian's fine tobacco.<eos> Do you blame me?<eos> You're a quiet one. Where are you from, MacTavish?<eos> Na h-innse gall.<eos> Aye, you don't sound like an islander.<eos> Well, Jamie spent time in France<eos> Fighting with the French army with Ian.<eos> Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.<eos> Did you, now?
Fire!<eos> Congratulations. Hmm.<eos> Your bonny little lass Just landed on her feet.<eos> A lass, ye say?<eos> Crivvens.<eos> Three days, And still no sign of Jamie or Ian.<eos> Every day I sat on the steps And stared at the road, as if I could will them to appear.<eos> She had us well fooled, didn't she?<eos> Little Margaret Ellen Murray.<eos> She certainly did.
The rents from quarter day...<eos> You might need it.<eos> You'll take it, and none of your nonsense.<eos> This...<eos> Belongs to Ian.<eos> He has another one.<eos> Put it in the top of your stocking. Hold it with your garter.<eos> Never take it off, even when you sleep.<eos> Do you ken how to use a knife?<eos> Yes, I do.
A song?<eos> Yes, something toe-tapping like... ♪ He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way ♪ ♪ He had a boogie style that no one else could play ♪<eos> ♪ He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B ♪<eos> What?<eos> It's a bonnie tune, but you need a Scottish song.<eos> Me?<eos> And a new look.<eos> That's jazzed you up a bit, eh?<eos> I look ridiculous.<eos> Aye, you do.
Not long.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> Wait...wait...<eos> Hey!<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, Murtagh.<eos> I need to have a word with the lady, alone.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> Claire, I understand that you're grieving.<eos> I do.
But Robert and I are very close.<eos> He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.<eos> So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?<eos> He told me the day he was diagnosed.<eos> I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And so does the leadership.
Oh, my God! (both laughing)<eos> Jesus!<eos> Come on, put your dick away.<eos> Let's go eat, 'cause we're not "this" anymore.<eos> This is not-- No.<eos> I love this place.<eos> I love, like, old, Italian-y places.<eos> If you, uh, go in the bathroom, there's a gun behind the toilet.<eos> Do you wanna have a sleepover tonight?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
That's hardcore, but this is really good.<eos> (flatly) Yeah, I have.<eos> Do you remember how much fun it was, like, a few seconds ago... and now that you said that, it's all tight in the chest and scary?<eos> So are you glad that you said that now, about moving in together?<eos> Okay, so what, are we supposed to never say anything scary?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Why?<eos> Because scary is fun-ruining, and I like fun.<eos> Do you like fun?<eos> No, I don't.
What about you hurting me?<eos> Huh, what about you hurting me?<eos> How did I hurt you?<eos> By what you're saying, it's hurting me right now.<eos> How do you think that makes me feel?<eos> How do you think it makes me feel for you to say that to me?<eos> How do you think it makes me feel for you to say, you're no good, Lenny.<eos> You're a piece of garbage and I hope you die, Lenny.<eos> I didn't say any of that.<eos> Yes, you did!
You're making this personal.<eos> You never liked me.<eos> That was always clear. Because guys like you, you're always looking for that climb.<eos> I was a good agent, Alex.<eos> But that wasn't good enough for you.<eos> Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?<eos> You knew how shaky things were at home for her.<eos> We all did.
Um, not really.<eos> I'm I'm kind of...<eos> It'll just take two seconds. I promise.<eos> All right.<eos> What's this?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> No.<eos> No joke.<eos> You... you passed the bar?<eos> Yeah. I did.
Hey. How you doing, man?<eos> Good, good.<eos> So, Howard's got you looking after Chuck, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a few extra bucks, you know?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Seems okay, like usual.<eos> I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're waiting on all that paperwork back at the office...<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Don't I, though?
Well, you should get some sleep.<eos> It's late over there.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hold off on the vote?<eos> Until we sit down.<eos> But we keep it in our back pocket.<eos> Michael Corrigan?<eos> They're going to release him when we visit.<eos> You made a miracle happen.<eos> We did.
Isn't that what marriage is about?<eos> Accepting your partner's selfishness?<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> You know nothing about marriage.<eos> You think it's about... sacrifice?<eos> I think it's about respect.<eos> And you're not respecting his pain.<eos> - His pain doesn't matter.<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> Because mine doesn't either.
I'm sure they loved you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's just, before the divorce, they were perfect, and then... afterwards, they were just human.<eos> And I hated them.<eos> Man, I really hated them.<eos> It took me years to realize that that doesn't make... them any less.<eos> It actually made them more, because we're human beings, and we all make mistakes.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Well, two suspects at breakfast.<eos> How many you think lunch will give us? Hmm?<eos> I've lived here my whole life, I've never once been in this place.<eos> Hey, Gary, how are you, man?<eos> Played here last weekend with Judge Walters.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> We were playing golf with him less than 45 minutes before he died.<eos> Uh, where's your fourth?<eos> Nobody plays golf in threesomes.<eos> We do.
- I'm pregnant.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Well, you're getting an abortion tomorrow.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I love him.<eos> - You don't.
Debbie.<eos> Debbie.<eos> Morning.<eos> Are you sure you're pregnant?<eos> Did you...? Did you take a pregnancy test?<eos> We'll go buy one today.<eos> I wanna have a baby.<eos> No. I know that you think that you do, but...<eos> - I know what I want and what I don't want.<eos> - No, you don't.
I just am looking...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> And... ♪ Oh... ♪<eos> ♪ Can you hear me now, can you hear me now?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ I'm singing out... ♪<eos> Oh, my God, Sam, you hear it, too?<eos> Yeah, is it like a high-pitched ringing but only in your left ear?<eos> Because yes, I do, all the time.

- What the hell you doing?<eos> - Hi, Luke.<eos> You lost your damn mind?<eos> What's got into you?<eos> Just couldn't leave her alone, could you?<eos> Always had to be right there, devil on her shoulder, judging her, making her doubt herself.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She called off the wedding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
You do realize those are $200 a bottle, right?<eos> Yep, and I'm putting 'em on your tab.<eos> I know. I saw that.<eos> I know I blindsided you this morning, and I am gonna be apologizing to you for that for a very long time.<eos> But I really do hope that we can try to deal with this privately between us.<eos> Privately? We... we can't do that.<eos> 'Cause we're Ruke or Layna or whatever the hell we are.<eos> And no offense, but I respect your right to call off the wedding.<eos> The least you could do is respect my right to be extremely pissed off about it.<eos> I do. I do.
Oh, my God!<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Why aren't you excited? Um...<eos> He's not interested in signing you.<eos> Layla, look, I tried hard, believe me.<eos> I'm the girl who can't open soup.<eos> He wants to make money, okay?<eos> He has zero desire to nurture talent.<eos> He doesn't care what you really have to say as a songwriter.<eos> Well, nobody does.
And I got it bad, all right?<eos> I got it real bad.<eos> Fact is, I got me a daughter who says she hates not seeing me, and she's about to get a whole lot of that.<eos> - No...<eos> - And I'm not gonna see her either, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna see her cut her first record or walk down the aisle.<eos> I might not even see her finish this school year, all right?<eos> - You don't know any of that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> - I do, Scarlett.
- So...<eos> Oh, your guest room's really comfortable.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> Not talking to my husband, that's what.<eos> No, I mean with the doilies.<eos> I'm getting rid of them.<eos> I really hope that Rayna is a better party host than she is a party planner, because these... these are disgusting.<eos> - Really?<eos> I think they're pretty.<eos> - Do you?
I mean, all that guy's seen is that damn video.<eos> - He's never even seen us play!<eos> - He's right.<eos> Okay, new plan.<eos> We put on a show featuring Triple Exes, and invite him to come hear us play live.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hey, after that interview, I'm happy to let the music do the talking.<eos> I gotta say, I'm still really disappointed about that Jade St. John concert. I wish we could go...<eos> Mom, I told you, I already had plans.<eos> Yes, you did.
I can't do it 24/7.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Will.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I'm sorry about yesterday.<eos> I listened to the song, like, a hundred times, and it's great.<eos> I don't know why I was such a... um, I don't know, maybe the stress of the album.<eos> Yeah, maybe that was it.<eos> Well, anyway, I just wanted to apologize.<eos> And I did.
Why are you so mad about this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Juliette, it's called being married!<eos> You know what, Avery?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I have a song to go finish.<eos> - Of all the boys in Nashville... - [laughs]<eos> I think he's a good kid, though,<eos> - and we know ours is.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
U... um, if there's anything I can do, well...<eos> I'm intending' to fight it and I'm gonna win, too.<eos> But it's been hard for Maddie, so it's meant a whole lot that she's had, you know, somewhere to go to.<eos> She's welcome anytime.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Deacon...<eos> Um...<eos> You beat this thing, brother.<eos> You got a lot to live for.<eos> - That I do. - [Cheers and applause]
I'm not much in the mood for socializing.<eos> Hey, if you'd rather be alone...<eos> Mmm, no, no, no, don't go.<eos> Uh, to be honest, that's the part I'm struggling with is, uh, you know, the songs are all written and done, but I guess I didn't want our time together to come to an end.<eos> You know, I didn't just come over this morning to apologize.<eos> I came over...<eos> [Sighs] I came over to ask you out.<eos> I don't... I don't know if you knew that I was...<eos> And... and... not that I want people to know<eos> - because I don't...
Thank you for caring, though.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm back from L.A. hello?<eos> Sandra?<eos> Hi.<eos> H... hi.<eos> What a lovely surprise.<eos> Shouldn't be.<eos> I told you when you were in L.A.<eos> You did.
Sure. Sure.<eos> Uh, will is a hell of a singer.<eos> You two get to know each other.<eos> Excuse me one second.<eos> Hey, listen, I know this is last-minute, but Rayna had to bow out unexpectedly, and I was hoping you might fill in.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Teddy, I, uh...<eos> I know about Deacon.<eos> - You do?
Well, then, the liver goes to the next recipient on the transplant list.<eos> Um, I'll be right back.<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> But we're gonna sort this out as fast as we can.<eos> If there's anything else I can do, let me know.<eos> Caleb.<eos> Is there something you can do, somebody you can talk to?<eos> Wha... that's not how this works.<eos> Um, that's the surgical team's decision, and I'm not on the surgical team.<eos> [Crying] Please do something.
- [Chuckles]<eos> He's not here.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> I couldn't wait for the night to be over.<eos> Unless, of course, it isn't.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's me.<eos> - Gunnar: How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.<eos> It was a miracle that they found that one.<eos> [Voice breaking] And the last time they measured his tumor, it was 4.7 centimeters.<eos> At 5 centimeters, he's off the list completely.<eos> And at the rate that this thing is growing, that's gonna happen way before they find another donor.<eos> - Why don't you do it?
Saw you were playin', thought I'd stop by.<eos> - Really?<eos> After all these years...<eos> - Who we got here?<eos> Oh, yeah, this is, uh, this is my father.<eos> Friends call me Bill.<eos> I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Wheeler.<eos> Oh, no, call me Luke.<eos> Uh, your son tell you he's the first artist I signed to my label?<eos> No, he did not.
You know, before this all got out,<eos> I was actually pretty excited.<eos> You know, a night to think about something other than bein' sick, but... now that everybody knows...<eos> They're talkin' about me like I'm already a ghost.<eos> You're not a ghost.<eos> Feel like one.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> I want so badly to believe there's gonna be some kind of hail mary pass here, you know?<eos> But...<eos> I don't.
Oh, wait, you're leaving?<eos> Yes, that's why I asked you to come.<eos> I have to go to the studio.<eos> ... Special night here at Bluebird...<eos> Emily?<eos> I just got here, and I don't think the baby's been fed or changed in hours.<eos> And Juliette just left for the studio.<eos> - What?<eos> She said she was gonna stay with the baby.<eos> - Well, she didn't.
Yeah, the Jason I thought I knew... he's gone.<eos> But you gave me back our history.<eos> You gave me us.<eos> We weren't a lie.<eos> What we had was real.<eos> What we had was good.<eos> Good night.<eos> Last couple days away with you were great.<eos> I don't want my dad showing' up to ruin all that.<eos> I don't either.
Good night.<eos> Last couple days away with you were great.<eos> I don't want my dad showing' up to ruin all that.<eos> I don't either.<eos> I'm just worried.<eos> Yeah, well, I... you gotta understand somethin'.<eos> My father told me he loved me tonight.<eos> Now, he never once said that when I was a kid.<eos> I always knew he did until...<eos> Well, he didn't.
Now, he never once said that when I was a kid.<eos> I always knew he did until...<eos> Well, he didn't.<eos> But to hear him say it out loud...<eos> It doesn't mean anything.<eos> How... how could you say that?<eos> He doesn't know the real you.<eos> He just knows the Will Lexington who's a rising country star, the Will Lexington who's straight now.<eos> - Nah, you don't understand.<eos> - No, I do.
This was recovered from your house.<eos> My best mate.<eos> I loved him.<eos> Your wife says you purchased it from an antiques fair in France.<eos> Your honeymoon?<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> It never worked.<eos> With modified ammunition it works perfectly well.<eos> Easy, if you know what you're doing.<eos> And you do, Carl, don't you?
- I'm not telling you anything.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - No!<eos> - You better tell me.<eos> - No!<eos> - Fine.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> - I won't.
She is, she is!<eos> Well, okay, relax, I'm an old man.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> This is the ugliest shirt I have ever seen.<eos> Grand.<eos> Well, let's also see what's here.<eos> You grow up quickly, "Kay".<eos> It grew two and a half centimeters In a month, my grandfather.<eos> Tell your mother. That her career It is not important to see her family.<eos> I will.
It's already winter there.<eos> Winter in June?<eos> Crazy old Maurice!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> The beast is real.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Will no one help me?<eos> I'll help, Maurice.<eos> What?<eos> You will?
Prostitution, embezzling money from the Rand pension fund into your Cayman accounts...<eos> Listen, I don't know what this is all about<eos> - or how this is even possible, but...<eos> - This is about legacy.<eos> Mine... and yours.<eos> What?<eos> If you thought it was possible to kick my children out the door and steal everything we, as a family, built over the years, then you're sadly mistaken.<eos> This is a blackmail scheme.<eos> Well, it won't work.<eos> No, it won't. No, it won't.
Danny!<eos> I hurt you.<eos> I get it.<eos> It was selfish and wrong of me to leave without telling you.<eos> But coming here has taught me that the Iron Fist isn't just for K'un-Lun.<eos> Others before me may have felt it was their destiny... but I am Danny Rand.<eos> And I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you could understand.<eos> I never will.
You know, when I first met you in Colleen's dojo, I couldn't help but notice that you had this... sweet innocence.<eos> But the more you continue to fight against something that happened 15 years ago, a fight you can't possibly win, the darker you become.<eos> I can win any fight!<eos> Danny, some shit you just can't punch.<eos> You know you weren't given this gift so that you could commit murder.<eos> And I know that you think that killing Harold is gonna make you feel better, that it's somehow gonna make everything okay, but it's not.<eos> She's right, Danny.<eos> You can't kill Harold.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
- Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck off, will ya?<eos> Hey, damn it!<eos> Hey, you fucking there?<eos> You can't shoot them.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You shoot, you give away your position.<eos> And they'll fucking find you.<eos> They will.
Fuck!<eos> We are aware that you have a certain... capacity for pain... which is why we've invited Dr. Ling.<eos> His unearthly potions... alter perceptions.<eos> The ducks will be flying.<eos> All the coaches to Bath and Southampton - are being searched, Your Highness. - For what?<eos> For whom?<eos> We have no idea who they are, who they pretend to be.<eos> It's been 12 hours!<eos> He will break.<eos> No, he won't.
Tip?<eos> Have you made your mind up?<eos> Tip.<eos> Have you decided what you want to do?<eos> You mean about waking up a girl?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is there something I can do?<eos> If there is, then please tell me.<eos> Do you want to turn around and go home?<eos> 'Cause we will.
How much is this worth'?<eos> 300 Euros.<eos> Damn.<eos> And the panties, well...<eos> I've got 5 Euros.<eos> Done, and I'll throw in a garter.<eos> We shouldn't allow this.<eos> I can't look, it makes me sick.<eos> Do you want me to say something?<eos> I will.
Clay Jensen.<eos> I'm in your fifth-period history class.<eos> Oh, yeah, quiet kid.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, uh, is he here?<eos> He's not.<eos> And he wasn't here yesterday.<eos> He'd better be here for this pep rally today.<eos> So, if you see him, tell him his ass gonna be running suicides until the lights go out.<eos> I will.
passed down through the generations.<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> It's the oral tradition.<eos> Except if we don't finish our part first, we could fail the whole assignment.<eos> Right?<eos> We could.<eos> But I doubt it.<eos> I would hate for us to have to face those repercussions.<eos> Maybe we won't.
Drive safe.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, why the fuck would Clay take Courtney to Hannah's grave?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But if he's doing this now, what happens when he gets to the stuff about my party?<eos> Nothing happens, okay?<eos> I'm ending this shit right now.<eos> He doesn't think that Hannah's lying.<eos> He could tell people the wrong things.<eos> He won't.
You can't love someone back to life.<eos> You can try.<eos> Clay... we don't know what was in her mind or in her heart.<eos> There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died...<eos> Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
Word in the halls is that you're all-in with things here.<eos> It may not seem like it now, but I assure you, you, too, made the correct select.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.<eos> I've been sitting here, trying to figure out how I could, with what happened, with our friends still out there, still being hurt by them.<eos> I don't know how I could've said that.<eos> And now... I am trapped.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I will.
What?<eos> They can use us here.<eos> Just once, we sit one out.<eos> Someone else -- It should be us.<eos> Maggie's gotta take care of Maggie.<eos> Have you, uh, changed your mind about taking that allergy medication?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.<eos> No, I won't.
I'm glad that you came.<eos> And now I need you to go.<eos> They say your ship is ready to depart.<eos> The launch awaits you at the jetty.<eos> I should be going.<eos> How long do you think to Port Royal?<eos> I'll make it.<eos> I promise you I will make it.<eos> Don't you dare let him catch you, don't you dare.<eos> I won't.
- The drinks were strong.<eos> That didn't help matters... you know, people getting half in the bag.<eos> You otter try one!<eos> We're currently reviewing our alcohol procedures in relation to school events.<eos> So, did you plan on telling me?<eos> Or was I just to discover you gone when I got back from Hawaii?<eos> The latter.<eos> I told you I would get help.<eos> Did you make an appointment?<eos> No, but I will.
A posse just departed for the wrecks under instructions from Captain Berringer to locate and arrest Long John Silver.<eos> Are you all right, ma'am?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Fuck, fuck, fuck.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> We should be running.<eos> There's nowhere to run.<eos> Then we have a serious problem, as Captain Berringer is going to demand she identify her connections to the resistance, which is us.<eos> She won't.
No, Kevin.<eos> That's Jesus.<eos> - Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.<eos> - I'm not saying you are, but, uh, the beard looks good on you.<eos> Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.
That's Jesus.<eos> - Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.<eos> - I'm not saying you are, but, uh, the beard looks good on you.<eos> Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> The fuck I won't, John!
She's winning the argument.<eos> She's a Gold Star mom.<eos> She's tough to argue with.<eos> At lea... for now she is.<eos> ...on the ground, so we're talking... Did you know Javadi's in town?<eos> I was alerted the minute he boarded the plane in Tehran.<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about it?<eos> He and Saul cannot meet.<eos> Otherwise, everything unravels.<eos> They won't.
Quickly!<eos> Careful.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When they took you...<eos> I saw the look I used to see in the eyes of my husband.<eos> He thought he could do what he wanted to me.<eos> They made the same mistake like him.<eos> They won't make it again.<eos> No, they won't.
I can't do... do that.<eos> - Of course you can. - I mean, maybe I could, but that site's encrypted with a 128-bit Blowfish cipher.<eos> And no brute-force attack has been extensive enough to crack it.<eos> There's...<eos> There's no way I can make a reasonable attempt and still - complete my other tasks.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Making sure this place is secure from cyberattack.<eos> - You've already done that.<eos> - But I have to oversee all our trading software, all our servers, my team.<eos> And you will.
Iris.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> - Look, I'm busy, so...<eos> Hey, I just wanted you to know that I spoke with Professor Marillo.<eos> She said that any time you experience anything racist, you need to report it immediately.<eos> Right.<eos> Like that'll do any good.<eos> No, it will.
Do you have any plans for the day?<eos> I have a few ideas.<eos> Or, we can use that energy to track down Jenna.<eos> She's out there.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I think that Grunwald is starting to rub off on me.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.
I mean, the codes on the doors change weekly, but...<eos> I can get them.<eos> My mom's office.<eos> - What if someone sees you?<eos> - What if Lucas sees you?<eos> Can we not go there right now?<eos> Tomorrow night is the weekly staff meeting.<eos> The entire Radley crew is held hostage in a room for an hour and told to smile more.<eos> Even if no one in the hotel sees her the security cameras will.<eos> No, they won't.
My mom manages the Radley.<eos> She offered Caleb a room and he upgraded the security system.<eos> Really?<eos> Well that system failed on Thursday between 9:14 and 9:24.<eos> Besides you who else has access?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd have to speak to Ashley Marin.<eos> I already did.<eos> We spoke last night.<eos> And we will again.
Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> How can we know if we're with you when we don't even really know what we're talking about?<eos> Ir enough.<eos> We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.
I gotta get back to it.<eos> How 'bout we call it a day?<eos> I'll buy you some dinner.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> You realize how far behind I am?<eos> Not to mention now I've got eight entire wills to finish up.<eos> Whaddya talking about?<eos> I'll do the wills.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> 'Course I will.
- I gotta stay here.<eos> If Maia told the rest of the wolves what that Sword is capable of, you're in serious danger.<eos> But, Luke...<eos> No time to argue.<eos> Word travels fast.<eos> I'll catch up... after I stop the Downworld from coming after you.<eos> I'll see you soon, kiddo.<eos> Hey.<eos> If anything happens to her...<eos> It won't.
Maybe we should go looking for Jace.<eos> No.<eos> If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie, we need to be here when he comes back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't. Okay?<eos> If I don't make it...<eos> Stop.<eos> You will.
I made sure to set aside a successful batch.<eos> This place gives me the creeps.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's concentrated.<eos> Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> OSWALD: Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> MOONEY: Oh, he will.
Iris didn't die.<eos> So that changes things, right?<eos> I mean, since Iris didn't die, future me never goes down that same dark path.<eos> I never create time remnants to fight Savitar.<eos> And if future you never creates these time remnants, then Savitar himself is never born.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Once the time paradox catches up with him, then... he'll be erased from existence.<eos> But I saw him. He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
He needs help.<eos> He... I want him to get that help.<eos> What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.<eos> He put an arrow in his chest.<eos> What kind of monster does that?<eos> Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.<eos> Innocent people are dying, and you might be our only chance to save them.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> I'm easily reachable if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
- Oh, good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You wanna try that new place I was telling you about?<eos> I gotta bolt, but I will catch up with you all later, though.<eos> So... wait a minute.<eos> You're not coming back to the office?<eos> No, I got an unofficial lunch with a potential big foreign donor for the Meyer Fund.<eos> That could get us into trouble down the line.<eos> Señor Ocampo is having trouble nudging his visas through, so I called our friends over at the State Department.<eos> That definitely will.
Why would I lie about that?<eos> He's your brother, right?<eos> Thanks for the pie.<eos> Friends don't pay.<eos> Can't believe I thought you were a boy.<eos> You're pretty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.<eos> Try not to get killed.<eos> Ah, I won't.
I made sure to set aside a successful batch.<eos> This place gives me the creeps.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's concentrated.<eos> Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> He will.
So what are we doing here?<eos> I thought you didn't want Dad to know we're going after this arms dealer.<eos> Yeah, no, I don't.<eos> But, um, actually, I need you to swipe his file on the case and photograph the pages and then put them back.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What?<eos> Iris.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Dad will kill us.<eos> No, no, Wally, he won't.
Come on, Barry, get up.<eos> All my days, this is quite the reversal of our fortune.<eos> Reversal...<eos> Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.<eos> Do it!<eos> He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!
Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> Same as you.<eos> The future.<eos> And my dad.<eos> What about him?<eos> I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.
Same as you.<eos> The future.<eos> And my dad.<eos> What about him?<eos> I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.<eos> - if he does...<eos> - He won't.
Maybe when you go back, you can find her and...<eos> I don't know, she can decipher it for you.<eos> I hope so.<eos> But if not... just make some good memories with Iris.<eos> Hold onto 'em as tight as you can.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.
Seat belt on.<eos> I drive fast.<eos> Long time since you've been in the field, huh?<eos> I mean, if you need to head back...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> All right, so we got what? An hour till dark?<eos> Which puts us at six hours till midnight?<eos> That sounds about right.<eos> Dean, we gotta talk about this.<eos> Okay, we will. All right?
Straight Shawshank this bitch.<eos> Goggles?<eos> Goggles.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We earned a break.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> No.<eos> No, we won't.
I was only gonna have a few peaches.<eos> The children lost their uncle today.<eos> I'm sure you can understand.<eos> Violet, Klaus, Sunny, why don't you wait upstairs.<eos> The adults will take care of it from here.<eos> But Mr. Poe...<eos> The adults will take care of it from here.<eos> Come on, Klaus.<eos> The adults won't take care of anything.<eos> But we will.
I can't believe you let me fucking apologize to you! And no one got sick from it!<eos> You'll get it back.<eos> After the criminal case, recovering in civil court will be...<eos> After he's convicted. After another four to seven years of dragging him through court, maybe.<eos> Until then?<eos> When I am governor...<eos> When you're governor?<eos> What the fuck happened to you?<eos> When this gets out...<eos> It won't.
'Cause I'm, big-hearted.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Nice.<eos> - You're sweet.<eos> Not a very good liar, but thanks.<eos> It's all about the light.<eos> The right light will hide a multitude of sins.<eos> Leave my card here on the table.<eos> If he shows.<eos> He won't.
The more handsome on the outside, the more rotten on the inside.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing, just that he's not really my type.<eos> This is Betty.<eos> Can I take it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hello?<eos> This story is bigger than we thought.<eos> I started asking around, to see if what happened to you happened to anyone else, and if anyone would go on record.<eos> - I will. 100%.
And Fred Andrews is escorting me to the drive-in, so all the pieces are in place.<eos> - The drive-in with Fred Andrews? - Yes.<eos> An attractive woman going with an old friend is less conspicuous than an old crone going alone.<eos> You're not an old crone, Ms. Hermione.<eos> Of course not. That was a joke.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is my daughter is hiding a gun in her bedroom, and that's just for starters.<eos> - I can explain...<eos> - Oh, you will.
I can help with that.<eos> I know Ms. Grundy was tutoring you.<eos> Understatement of the year.<eos> But there's this amazing songwriter from New York, who's an adjunct at Carson College?<eos> Incredible mentor.<eos> He does some coaching on the side and I told him about you.<eos> You wanna meet him?<eos> Yeah, yeah I'd love to, but football...<eos> No, Archie can.<eos> And he will.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.<eos> Don't think they're being nice or genuine.<eos> They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.<eos> But you're going to help with all that.<eos> I'll do whatever I can.<eos> Archibald, have a word?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.<eos> You did?<eos> You will?
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.<eos> You'll help us, won't you?<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?<eos> I think that's an excellent idea.<eos> Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?<eos> Just keep dancing.<eos> And smiling.<eos> Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.<eos> As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.<eos> Yes, she will...
Mom?<eos> Archie just called. He talked to Polly.<eos> She's safe.<eos> She's okay, Mom.<eos> She didn't choose the Blossoms over us, she's actually there to spy on them.<eos> You know, when I went after this story...<eos> I thought, in the back of my mind that,<eos> "What if this is it?<eos> What if this is finally the time that she doesn't come back?"<eos> She will, Mom.
I was going to ask you to come to Chicago with me.<eos> To stay.<eos> You could study music.<eos> I'm not even thinking about that right now, Mom.<eos> No, I know, I know.<eos> It's just, I want you with me.<eos> I don't think that this town is safe anymore.<eos> I feel like Riverdale is getting ready to slide off of a mountainside, and I don't want you anywhere around when that happens.<eos> Just promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- Huh?<eos> What? - What... ?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Ah, it's just...<eos> Rebecca seems like she's mad at me.<eos> And I wanted this weekend to bring us together, but it feels like she's pulling away.<eos> And you have no idea how much this relationship means to me.<eos> I told everyone about it.<eos> It can't fall apart now.<eos> Well, it won't.
- And...<eos> - I-I totally understand.<eos> - I'm ready to do the work.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I missed you.<eos> I've missed you, too.<eos> And that toilet upstairs has been running for three weeks, and it is driving me insane.<eos> So you are gonna have to... put your hand in that tank ASAP.<eos> Honey, I will put my hand in an unflushed toilet bowl for you.<eos> (exhales) Yeah, you will.
It's killing you, isn't it?<eos> Truth be told, I don't really miss it too much.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Except maybe... cases still hanging fire.<eos> I dwell on them a bit.<eos> Starting with right there...<eos> The City Park Rapist.<eos> Can't believe we didn't get him.<eos> Yeah. We will.
- You heard what happened.<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> They called Nolan.<eos> I want you to get Hudson and meet me.<eos> We'll get you underground.<eos> - What?<eos> - They're gonna come for you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They won't blame me for your bad choices.<eos> Of course they will.
Do you want to stop the interview, Michael?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> OK. We'll leave it there.<eos> - Is that all right, DS Flynn?<eos> - Yeah, of course, ma'am, no problem.<eos> Thanks, everyone.<eos> Did I do all right?<eos> In what way?<eos> You said if I did well, you'd... .. you'd tell them to look after me better.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Solomon put me on the chain.<eos> I learned.<eos> What else did he do to you?<eos> I came to take you home, Charlie.<eos> You're never going back to that place--<eos> Solomon told me I had to go back or he'll hurt me.<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> I won't let him.<eos> - He'll hurt my friends.<eos> - No, he won't.
Oh, yes.<eos> He was made up.<eos> He likes a lot of these groups, but The Wildwood was his favourite.<eos> Can you think of anyone who would wish him any ill?<eos> No-one had a bad word to say about him.<eos> He'd do anything for anyone.<eos> Why would any...?<eos> You find who hurt him.<eos> You find who hurt my baby.<eos> We will, Mrs Finch.
‐ Thanks, Felicia.<eos> ‐ I also asked Kodiak to take on a bigger role.<eos> We need someone with gifts to sit on the Council.<eos> ‐ Well, Sarah, he's‐‐ ‐ Controversial.<eos> ‐ And has been living in Siberia for the last 12 years.<eos> ‐ He's also a 10R who I can trust. ‐ He's also a 10R who I can trust.<eos> ‐ Decisions always went through Steve.<eos> We did what we thought was best.<eos> You'll see what it's like to have the weight of The Movement's future on your shoulders.<eos> ‐ Yes I will, Felicia.
You know?<eos> 'Cause you're like Walter White and I'm...<eos> I'm like Jesse.<eos> Man, you're in for such a treat.<eos> Okay, and... there.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> Whoa, hey, what... What are you doing?<eos> I'll do the honors.<eos> - No, no, you won't.
All except for bridget back there.<eos> She's a bit more partial to knives.<eos> If this is a suicide note, I'll be awfully disappointed.<eos> Names of potential cabinet appointees...<eos> I'd like wagner in state and bennett in treasury.<eos> The senate may favor miller for defense, but...<eos> Well, look at betty bossypants!<eos> Isn't she adorable?<eos> You have to allow me to do something.<eos> And I will.
- I'll hold off on pressing charges. But if you don't figure out who Maya is working for in the next 12 hours, she will rot down there, in her cell, for the rest of her life.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I think...<eos> Get out of here, Rosen.<eos> Go. Now.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> They'll find another assassin.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> We won't.
- Quickly now!<eos> Put your hand here.<eos> There you go.<eos> Go to him.<eos> You won't be able to get in his room!<eos> I need to see for myself!<eos> The bomb damage is mainly to the left wing.<eos> Mr. D'Abberville's room is gone.<eos> - What if someone finds out what we did?<eos> - They won't.
Memaw!<eos> Memaw!<eos> Open the door!<eos> I'm about to have a duck fit.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> What you gon' do?<eos> Something I shoulda done a long time ago.<eos> I just had coffee with king valentine.<eos> Do you want your friend to go to jail?<eos> Because he will.
What was He like?<eos> What did God look like?<eos> What was He doing here?<eos> Let me ask you a question, Preacher.<eos> What do you want from Him?<eos> We just have a few questions.<eos> "Questions." The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> - He might.<eos> - No, He won't.
And reinstate him into the department.<eos> And we give you an alibi that'll work for the night Rachel was killed.<eos> - You have an alibi in mind?<eos> - Adalind.<eos> - Little late for that.<eos> - Already tried.<eos> She turned me down.<eos> She didn't turn me down.<eos> Well, she'll have to testify.<eos> She will.
Hank, she's here!<eos> It's okay, honey.<eos> We're police.<eos> Not for long.<eos> How long do we have to stay here?<eos> I'm not sure, honey.<eos> We have to keep you safe.<eos> So he won't find me here?<eos> Hey... he's never gonna find you, okay?<eos> No, he won't.
- Oh, God.<eos> - He killed her.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - This can't be happening.<eos> - He let you live again?<eos> It's got to be the stick.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it.<eos> I-I tried to use it on her.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> This will.
Do not jest about it.<eos> He is my husband till death do us part.<eos> Amen, sister.<eos> I think it was a mistake to refuse Sir Francis.<eos> I never knew you had ambitions to be a political wife.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> But you, your influence is great -- there's much good you could do.<eos> And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?<eos> Yes, but he too uses his power for his own ends and he would use me if I would let him.<eos> But I will not.
At a terrible price.<eos> You're the one who taught me that Earth must come first.<eos> And Eros?<eos> A hundred thousand souls.<eos> Did I teach you that?<eos> If I had known what was going to happen on Eros, I would have stopped the project and Jules-Pierre Mao along with it and you know that!<eos> Eros nearly destroyed this planet.<eos> You will have to answer for your part in that.<eos> I know...<eos> And I will.
38 minutes to go.<eos> Gotta keep moving.<eos> Tell me.<eos> When I was about your son's age, my dad was lost at sea for six days.<eos> I thought I'd never see him again.<eos> So I prayed for a miracle.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Air Force Para Jumpers pulled him out of the ocean half-dead.<eos> Never forgotten those guys.<eos> Never will.
We give up?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> No, not Frost.<eos> Arthur.<eos> From the very beginning,<eos> Arthur's been trying to prevent humankind from reaching too far.<eos> All of the training has been for this.<eos> To ensure life and death remain separate.<eos> But if he crosses that bridge...<eos> He won't!
I thought they strung you up somewhere.<eos> To rot.<eos> It tore me apart.<eos> But I didn't give up like a coward.<eos> You think what you want.<eos> I think you're a liar.<eos> 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.<eos> You will find her.<eos> No.<eos> We will.
Michaela, I-I know you didn't mean to do anything wrong.<eos> My colleague... Ms. Sacker... she's got a very brass-tacks way of looking at this stuff.<eos> She doesn't see other factors... that good people can step wrong.<eos> I think I know how to help you.<eos> But won't she...<eos> No.<eos> I'm her superior.<eos> You give me your cooperation, I will give you my protection.<eos> And like Earl Anthony bagging the 7-10 split.<eos> You will?

I tried being a lawman.<eos> It didn't take.<eos> This is treason.<eos> And you're a dumpster fire.<eos> Don't sign anything.<eos> - They're liars.<eos> - What? Sign?<eos> Somebody has to pay, Moody!<eos> Soon.<eos> Someone will.
Isn't he dead?<eos> Is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you. - Oh?<eos> The Baudelaire children will be destroyed,<eos> - and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats!<eos> You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.
Or not.<eos> Cognitive Intrusion creates a brain link between two or more subjects.<eos> Captain Hunter considered it barbaric and supremely dangerous.<eos> You two think you can figure this Cognitive Intrusion thing out?<eos> With the professor as my assistant, yeah.<eos> You cannot be serious.<eos> Very serious.<eos> Get me a beer.<eos> So who's going in?<eos> I will.
Why?<eos> You know you can't stop me from leaving.<eos> And you know you can't stop me from chasing after you.<eos> And you know how fast I am.<eos> But if you spare him, if you do that much, maybe I'll wait to chase you until after he's in jail.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Just us girls next time.<eos> We can braid each other's hair.<eos> We can still catch her.<eos> I will.
She stays at the Chateau Guay Motel under a false name.<eos> You pay her, John, secret payments in cash.<eos> Money that you launder through Thunderbird Casino.<eos> You tipped off Corbett's people.<eos> As a result, an officer died.<eos> You pay Lidstrom to stay quiet about it.<eos> So why are you telling me?<eos> Why not just file your report?<eos> Because I want to understand.<eos> You won't.
Are you choking?<eos> Fuck! What is this?<eos> Herpes simplex one, guy?<eos> But you're choking?<eos> Oh, great. Are you gonna die?<eos> Fuck! What do I do?<eos> I choose life.<eos> I'm gonna give you mouth-to-mouth, guy.<eos> - Don't, actually.<eos> - I won't.
Something about her not being his wife but his accomplice.<eos> What?<eos> Bullshit.<eos> No.<eos> They said if she says no, they can arrest her.<eos> And you know if they do that, she gonna give us up, Tommy, to protect her kids.<eos> Nah.<eos> I wouldn't even blame her.<eos> I mean, what are we supposed to do if Tasha starts talking?<eos> She won't.
What?<eos> 'Police won't yet confirm if the body is that of either of the missing schoolgirls, Poppy Johnston or Abigail Toms.<eos> What they will say is that a body, believed to be that of a young white female, has been discovered in nearby woodland...<eos> Think of them poor parents.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Formal identification has not yet been completed... .. but Poppy was last seen on 6th April.<eos> Helen, it's me.<eos> They're taking me in for questioning.<eos> Would you come with me, please?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.
The tower is specifically excluded from the terms of our agreement.<eos> Right, well...<eos> Thank you.<eos> No tower. Got it.<eos> Right.<eos> Are you staying here tonight?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, he's not. I'm not sure.<eos> There's no reason to.<eos> I probably will.
- Oh, my God, that was the craziest night we've ever had.<eos> But also the most important.<eos> It cemented our friendship forever.<eos> Guys, I feel the exact same way.<eos> I know we made you do a few things - that made you uncomfortable.<eos> - But you suck it out.<eos> And the significance of that was not lost on us.<eos> Yeah, I feel like this conversation could probably happen some other time. Lucy, we love you.<eos> And because of that night and, like, how long you stayed...<eos> - we always will. Aw.
He wasn't making any sense.<eos> He looked like he was going to lash out.<eos> Lucy, you have to tell me everything.<eos> He said he didn't mean it.<eos> Jamie just fell.<eos> He told you he saw Jamie that night?<eos> He just kept saying it was an accident and Jamie just fell because he was drunk and...<eos> You need to find him.<eos> - Please, you need to find him.<eos> - We will.
What's wrong?<eos> Uh... The old bitch, she's overheating.<eos> Gotta pull over and check it out.<eos> Older cars, you know how it is.<eos> Hey, Ruiz! Get me my flashlight in the glove box?<eos> I used to work on my dad's car.<eos> If it's overheating, you're gonna have to...<eos> Tommy, what are you doing?<eos> - You're gonna regret this.<eos> - No, I won't.
Place looks like a got damn resort. 'Keisha.<eos> Auntie 'Keisha, they have really rigorous academics.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> My guidance counselor says they let a few kids transfer in over winter break.<eos> Or in the spring.<eos> But, baby, I just don't understand why would you want to go to a school away from your family all of a sudden?<eos> I just do.<eos> Will you think about it?<eos> Please?<eos> All right, sure, I will.
You think I fuckin' held on to 'em?<eos> I think it's a way to protect yourself.<eos> In case you get busted, sell us the fuck down the river to save you.<eos> If I was gonna do that, I'd have done it already.<eos> I'd be on the golf course right now in Arizona.<eos> James, there is nothing for them to find.<eos> No body, no recording, no murder weapon, no crime scene.<eos> They are just trying to scare me to get me to say something, anything.<eos> Which you won't do.<eos> Which I won't.
- Poussey.<eos> Your mama did not name you Pussy.<eos> Yo.<eos> For real?<eos> I mean, you all new and talking shit with a name like Taystee?<eos> That's fair.<eos> My bad.<eos> Look, you let me know if you need anything in here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
It goes with a festive line dance.<eos> Sort of like the Bielolitza.<eos> Disco is bullshit.<eos> - What do you mean, gone?<eos> - I've been looking all night.<eos> Her mother hasn't heard from her in three days.<eos> Dmitri says she'll be fired if she doesn't come to work tomorrow.<eos> Shit.<eos> - What if she tells them about us?<eos> - She won't.
They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.<eos> Not women.<eos> Women don't fear pain the way men do.<eos> They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
He looks...<eos> Is he here because of my husband?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> There was a man in the mist.<eos> He came out of nowhere.<eos> He shot Benedict, and then he shot himself.<eos> You can't see a thing outside, man.<eos> Right up against the front door.<eos> When is the police coming?<eos> They will.
Here's what we know.<eos> Three people are dead, at least.<eos> Something is clearly very, very wrong and we need to let the authorities know that we are here and alive.<eos> Now since it doesn't seem to be dangerous in itself, and since whatever it is is no longer in the hallway. I suggest we send someone to the radio to call for help.<eos> I'm not going in there.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Well someone has to.<eos> What about you?<eos> You're the leader here.<eos> I will.
And I wanted to talk to a few of your employees, who are also my clients.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why?<eos> Just to gauge their experience and overall satisfaction.<eos> So, you didn't want to see if they or you are being specifically targeted by Dan Wolfe's Mercy Squad?<eos> I am, right?<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'll call Wolfe, ask for some courtesy, have him back off.<eos> You will not.
A Cayenne Turbo is 120.<eos> A Cayenne Turbo is a proper car built by Porsche.<eos> This is two scrap cars glued together by a Muppet.<eos> It isn't designed for people like you.<eos> What, people with eyes?<eos> People who can dress themselves in the morning?<eos> I'll tell you exactly who will buy this car.<eos> People who use roundy-ended scissors.<eos> Footballers.<eos> - No, they won't.
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.<eos> Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.<eos> And in what reality would a corporation even bother - negotiating with a colony?<eos> - In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.<eos> Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.
You know, I...<eos> She's confused. I'm confused.<eos> - Hey, we are not going to let anything bad happen to Hawk.<eos> - But it's out of our hands.<eos> - All this praying and looking to The Light, it's not gonna help us.<eos> You are strong, okay.<eos> And we are going to get through this.<eos> - Cal.<eos> - I won't be blackmailed.<eos> - Yes, you will.
A truck hit a kid outside.<eos> Max, can you come here for a second?<eos> What's all the commotion?<eos> I can't eat my frickin' feelings if there's no food!<eos> Was the kid on a bike?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Look what you did to Jessica!<eos> Why are you so jealous of her, Caroline?<eos> You'll never be Jessica, okay?<eos> None of us will!
- I'm confused. - I'm so proud of you!<eos> Oh, my boy.<eos> You are growing up so fast.<eos> I was thinking about the times we used to come here.<eos> You and Dad would take me to the zoo.<eos> I feel bad that I killed him.<eos> Zack, no.<eos> That is your father talking.<eos> Don't let his way of thinking hold you back.<eos> I won't. I just...
I'll start with her, then.<eos> Now, what about the stuff you took from her room?<eos> It's all there.<eos> That's it?<eos> Her room strike you as being empty?<eos> Struck me more they were pretty broke as a family.<eos> - Hm. - How's her mam and dad?<eos> As you'd expect.<eos> Will you pass on my condolences?<eos> Aye, course I will.
- Clamp!<eos> Hey, Charlie, the legs can wait.<eos> Assist the kid with the bleeders.<eos> Charlie, come on, what are you doing?<eos> You heard the lady... get in there!<eos> He's crashing.<eos> Damn it, I need more volume.<eos> Oh, come on, I need more blood here!<eos> - He's not gonna make it.<eos> - Yes, he will.
A friend of mine at the D.O.D. owes me a favor.<eos> I'm gonna make a few calls.<eos> I'm sorry, are we actually considering helping a bloodthirsty biker gang steal lethal explosives in order to sell them to a terrorist group?<eos> We're not actually talking about giving them real explosives.<eos> The Kings will test it.<eos> They're gonna know if it's fake.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Nas, we can't use real explosives as bait.<eos> - Something could go wrong.<eos> - It won't.
And right now we have the entire FBI using every available resource to track it down.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> This...<eos> this is all my fault.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> We both made bad decisions today.<eos> I'll take full responsibility for the HMX.<eos> No, you won't.
Are you with a dude?<eos> No, I'm still at the office.<eos> Ah, that's Lauren's phone ringing right now.<eos> I got to go get it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Liar.<eos> I hope your friends back home appreciate the contraband.<eos> They will.
Oh, God, Dawn.<eos> I'm uncomfortable.<eos> What if people freak out?<eos> What if they put us on a watch list?<eos> What if Bill Cosby gets mad at us?<eos> Will you relax?<eos> They're not gonna know it's us.<eos> That's why they wore these things.<eos> What if they recognize our shoes?<eos> They won't.
There is much still to be done.<eos> Let no-one be in doubt about the task that lies ahead of us.<eos> But here today, at last, we have much to celebrate.<eos> My beloved Richard and Cathy Gordon are to be married!<eos> I suppose we should have guessed she would have something like this up her sleeve.<eos> Let's hope King James is better than his cousin, Lady Gordon, at spotting a peasant in silk.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Goodnight, my loves.<eos> Remember to say your prayers.<eos> I will.
- Yes!<eos> This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.<eos> I'm gonna need all your sizes. I have some costume ideas.<eos> "The House of Cedar and Pine."<eos> 1957.<eos> Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.
But in that bunker, we'll be safe.<eos> Every time we think that, something bad happens.<eos> So what then?<eos> Stay here and die?<eos> Spend your last days wasted?<eos> That seems to be a popular choice with the people I care about.<eos> - Monty, I... - It'll be light out soon.<eos> That bunker gives us a chance for a future.<eos> I hope you'll change your mind.<eos> I won't.
I feel so blessed.<eos> How can I thank you?<eos> Have you been to Cartagena before?<eos> No, it's our first time.<eos> Please, you must go to my favourite restaurant.<eos> La Garza.<eos> It's only a short walk.<eos> Best fried fish and coconut rice in the world.<eos> La Garza.<eos> We will.
Yeah... II was hoping... I know I should've said something in advance.<eos> No, no, hey.<eos> No, no, hey. What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I want to continue my climb.<eos> Here.<eos> In the city.<eos> What'd your mom say about it?<eos> She gets it.<eos> Oror she will.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> She can't remember who she is, where she came from, nothing before she crawled out of that bag in Times Square.<eos> Sandstorm is responsible for over a dozen domestic terror attacks in total.<eos> They're gonna blow up the power grid.<eos> Get out!<eos> It's a trap!<eos> No!<eos> Nooo!<eos> Got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
I'm gonna stop you before you say something you shouldn't.<eos> This my family we're talking about.<eos> No!<eos> In surgery, we call it<eos> - "a complication."<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh. - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.<eos> - It'll fit.<eos> - No, sir, it won't.
- What?<eos> I could use your help.<eos> Little busy.<eos> - Has he had a rhythm since he arrested?<eos> - Doesn't matter!<eos> It's irreversible brain damage after six minutes.<eos> It matters to this guy.<eos> If I come up there, I lose my guy!<eos> If you stay there, we lose two people!<eos> No, we won't, all right?
Listen.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> When she spoke, I would feel the word instead of the pain.<eos> Table.<eos> Orange.<eos> Pen.<eos> And I got through it.<eos> Pearl.<eos> Stoplight.<eos> So will you.
Where do you think he is?<eos> His heart is set on fulfilling his destiny.<eos> And he can't do that without the sword.<eos> What sword?<eos> The sword Emma shattered when he last faced her.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why does he think that... that killing Emma with this blade will make him the Savior?<eos> He's not the first one to think wielding that sword would make him a hero.<eos> We have to find him before he gets his hands on it, before he goes after Emma again.<eos> We will.
Because it was the only way to stop him from doing it himself.<eos> If he had...<eos> I fear he would already be lost to us.<eos> Once we stop him, I can return her magic.<eos> No one needs to be hurt.<eos> Gideon has the sword now.<eos> It's more powerful than ever.<eos> He'll go after the Savior once again.<eos> I just hope there's enough time that we can stop him before he does.<eos> We will.
- Owlsly?<eos> ! - Over there.<eos> At the corner.<eos> You hurt?<eos> Not bad, I don't think.<eos> All right, well...<eos> EMTs should be here shortly.<eos> They can take a look at you.<eos> You know I got to take you in, right?<eos> You won't.
Do not you find something that say to save your life?<eos> Do not you see that you are dying?<eos> Tell your bosses.<eos> Tell them what?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Tell them Paul Lefebvre is here.<eos> The agent?<eos> No, the French teacher.<eos> Are you going to tell him?<eos> I will.
Select destination.<eos> - No. No, no.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - Optimizing route to Arallon.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Wait. Are all these Peter Gregory's notebooks? Um...<eos> - Are they?<eos> Are they in this box?<eos> - Richard. Remember, you promised you were gonna get some sleep tonight.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Spoken like someone who's still in the honeymoon phase.<eos> Trust me, that ends.<eos> You should get out before it does.<eos> She knows you're FBI?<eos> Keen, we gotta pull you out.<eos> Margot's contact says Helldritch is in Hong Kong.<eos> We have no jurisdiction there.<eos> Our only shot at recovering the WITSEC list is to have The Harem steal it, and I've got to be there.<eos> - If Emma rolls on you?<eos> - She won't.
We haven't time.<eos> You have no choice.<eos> What?<eos> You think you can just walk away from me?<eos> You can kill me, if you want to...<eos> Oi!<eos> That's what I'm going to do.<eos> ..or you can join me in escaping.<eos> I'll show you the way.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Yeah, well, it happens to the best of us.<eos> No, I'm not talking about that.<eos> No, afterwards, he went crazy, begging me for the drink, begging to die.<eos> God, you're like a... a praying mantis.<eos> You have sex with them and then kill them.<eos> We need to make this right.<eos> So?<eos> So tomorrow, we end Joel's suffering.<eos> Okay.<eos> We will.
- Call a doctor.<eos> - Which way?<eos> Which way?<eos> Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson.<eos> Can you tell me what this is?<eos> It's a poem I wrote to Margaret on the morning she died.<eos> Would you mind reading it for us?<eos> "An angel sighs, an angel flies"... "an ang..."<eos> I can't finish.<eos> Oh, I will.
Thanks for coming.<eos> Wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world.<eos> Anyways... I'm meeting some people, so...<eos> I wouldn't want to hold you.<eos> One meal.<eos> My treat.<eos> If you're free tomorrow night, maybe we could eat.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> I'll see you at around 7:00?<eos> Yes, you will.
I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I have very good reason not to feel so angry with Lagertha.<eos> Then what kind of a son are you?<eos> What does it matter what your mother did to you?<eos> She was still your mother.<eos> You would say that, wouldn't you?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> You tell me.<eos> All right, I will, Mommy's boy.
And please take care of yourself.<eos> If you haven't noticed, you're the best cop I got.<eos> I did my best to keep him away from that life, I swear.<eos> Everybody makes their own decisions.<eos> Nothing you could do about that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's not cut out for prison, though.<eos> They're gonna eat him up in there.<eos> If he testifies against Angelo, I'll cut him a deal with the D.A.<eos> He will.
This is amazing.<eos> Yeah, well I was totally against it, but Amy felt bad because you seemed so pathetic.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - It worked!<eos> I mean, your little camp story. Was the saddest childhood memory I've ever heard, and I've listened to Amy talking about attending<eos> "the crossing guard's jamboree."<eos> That was fun! We were directing traffic in the hotel hallways.<eos> People were freaking out.<eos> Mm-hmm. Just don't make us regret this.<eos> I won't.
So, what's next for you, Doug Judy?<eos> I'm turning over a new leaf.<eos> Gonna live that honest life.<eos> Maybe open up a bakery, buy a little house, invest in my retirement.<eos> You're gonna go back to stealing cars immediately, - aren't you?<eos> - That's very much on the table.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And when you do...<eos> - I'll be there to stop you.<eos> - No, you won't.

I can't look at anything... ever again.<eos> I'm still blind.<eos> Death is an increasing problem.<eos> With over a billion intelligent species active in this galaxy alone, it is an ever-greater challenge to know how to kill all of them.<eos> On this planet, we are proud to serve as executioners to every living thing.<eos> The destruction of a Time Lord, however, is a particular honour.<eos> This technology is precisely calibrated.<eos> As you can see, it will stop both hearts, all three brain stems, and deliver a cellular shock wave that will permanently disable regenerative ability.<eos> I know how it works.<eos> You certainly will in a moment.
No, no, no, no!<eos> You don't understand!<eos> This creature is no threat!<eos> He may look like a monster to you...<eos> I wasn't talking to you.<eos> Are you all right, Friday?<eos> Sir.<eos> Who are you and what the devil are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> And I will!
Where have you taken me?<eos> If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.<eos> I don't want to change again.<eos> Never again!<eos> I can't keep on being somebody else!<eos> Wherever it is, I'm staying!<eos> No!<eos> I will not change.<eos> I will not change.<eos> I will not!
Alanis Morissette.<eos> - Alice loved that cat.<eos> - Okay, but why...<eos> I've always had a terrible fear of heights.<eos> One day, Alanis Morissette got stuck on the roof.<eos> Alice begged me to get her down, but I couldn't, and honestly, I...<eos> I yelled at her, because sometimes that is what one does when one is ashamed.<eos> And the cat... did not end well.<eos> I don't know if Alice ever forgave me for not being brave enough.<eos> Maybe she will now.
They're dead?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> The truth is better.<eos> You are right, we have to escape.<eos> All of us.<eos> We won't all make it.<eos> Isn't it better some of us live than all of us die?<eos> You'll remember me, Right?<eos> Of course, I will.
You went inside The Farm to stop a group of insurgents inside the CIA, and you failed.<eos> Someone noticed, and they contacted me.<eos> Ryan.<eos> Someone else.<eos> Someone who knew how ruinous this group could be to the very foundation of this country, to the world.<eos> They knew what it took to stop them.<eos> We knew lines had to be crossed.<eos> You have betrayed every oath that you have ever taken.<eos> Once all this is over, you're gonna pay for everything you've done.<eos> Everyone will, Alex.
I will tolerate the Jedi presence in our ancestral home if they surrender their weapons.<eos> (SIGHS) Well, that went better than I expected.<eos> That was better?<eos> I hope you're not really expecting us to hand over our lightsabers, are you?<eos> We need to do whatever it takes to make this work.<eos> They'll be safe, Ezra.<eos> All right.<eos> Your rebel friends are going to bring the Empire down on all of us.<eos> You believe the Darksaber will protect you?<eos> It won't.
- Commander, I found two more.<eos> - Droids?<eos> We were aboard the shuttle when it was stolen.<eos> Well, stay here and wait for processing.<eos> Oh, we can do that. We can do that just fine.<eos> Leave us.<eos> I'll interrogate him myself.<eos> Don't you realize how dangerous it is for you to be here?<eos> - If anyone recognizes you...<eos> - They won't.
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.<eos> And then where is that gonna leave you?<eos> What prospects?<eos> It's too late.<eos> - You need to take a fall.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.<eos> In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway, and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
You can remake reality however you see fit.<eos> You were always the better of us, Laurel.<eos> You were the strong one.<eos> I'm damaged.<eos> I know.<eos> The Gambit,<eos> Lian Yu,<eos> League of Assassins, you dying.<eos> I could take it all back.<eos> But you won't.
Gold's got her in the back of his shop.<eos> I-I'm not not proud of what I did, but I did what I thought was best for myself.<eos> We both did.<eos> What are you doing here? We're here to help you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Help me with what? Your little fairy problem which you don't seem able to solve.<eos> The blue fairy.<eos> We might be able to wake her.<eos> Unless you found a way.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
- Kathy.<eos> - We checked at area hospitals, and they haven't found a Kathy yet, but they're sending us a list of all of their Kathleens and Kathryns.<eos> If she isn't at any of the hospitals, is there a chance that...<eos> she didn't make it?<eos> Last our guy saw, she was alive.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When I was dancing with that girl... with Kathy... I was thinking, "I'm gonna remember this night."<eos> Now everyone will.
Okay, so... we're connected, Ryan.<eos> After everything that we've been through, there's no way for us not to be.<eos> But when I said that I needed more time, I didn't... I didn't...<eos> I wasn't expecting you to wait. I see.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> Look, I love you, Alex.<eos> I always will.
I came here to fight.<eos> You were the girl under the floor.<eos> Use that, just like mom taught us.<eos> Bellamy's right.<eos> You don't have to kill all 12 warriors.<eos> I just have to kill the last one.<eos> Ambassadors and advisors, to the tower.<eos> Champions, to your flags.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> Damn right we will.
What the hell you just say?<eos> I thought you might need this.<eos> Well, you thought wrong.<eos> You want to survive in here, newbie, mind your own damn business.<eos> Hey, you sleep okay?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> - Was it the radiator?<eos> I need to get that thing fixed.<eos> When are you gonna tell Weller about my memory... about Emma Shaw?<eos> I will, okay?
- Wait a minute, you liars!<eos> What's that nice couch doing here?<eos> - The old couch didn't make it.<eos> - The second the sunlight hit it, it turned to dust.<eos> - Sorry, guys, we're stuck with the nice, clean expensive sofa.<eos> But I guess we'll just have to make do.<eos> - Oh, we'll make do.<eos> - We'll make do all over it.<eos> - Well, I just mean we'll fix it.<eos> - Hells yeah, we will.
That's this morning!<eos> That's that cyclist!<eos> He must've been filming it.<eos> Oh, that's not fair.<eos> 'Being aggressive?<eos> Are you deliberately thick?<eos> 'Eh, what's all this about, eh?<eos> 'Aggressive? I'll show you aggressive when I undo this belt!<eos> 'Oh, will you now?<eos> Yeah, I will, yeah.'
- Samples-sss?<eos> From you and, if possible, the father?<eos> Regardless, this is the last time I make a cloak-and-dagger trip to the middle of nowhere.<eos> Next appointment is in my office with my equipment, where I can examine you properly.<eos> Is it Bring your own speculum?<eos> Hey. So how is she?<eos> Doctor-patient privilege ring a bell?<eos> Take it outside, cowboy.<eos> Now, who's driving me back?<eos> - I will.
Because you're the one who took my case, and then you backed out.<eos> - I told you, there was a conflict.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> Then listen to me right now.<eos> I know that you know my parents died in a car accident.<eos> But what you don't know is that after they did, a lawyer...came to my grandmother and made her an offer.<eos> She took it, instead of going to court.<eos> And I am telling you, she regretted that for the rest of her life.<eos> Oscar, there's no price that'll make the pain go away.<eos> Then what will?
-Please make them stop.<eos> You got the court order?<eos> Yes, but-- what did the court order say? We take 10%.<eos> You're taking everything!<eos> Why are you taking everything? Stop it!<eos> They took everything out the smokehouse.<eos> And that ain't tax.<eos> They just ate it. All that meal we ground.<eos> -We'll get you more cornmeal.<eos> -Of course we will.
Just imagine, he was a little boy with Scarlet fever in bed, reading history.<eos> King Arthur and the knights of the round table.<eos> That's what Camelot is about.<eos> Ordinary men banding together to fight for a better world.<eos> Don't misunderstand me.<eos> Jack wasn't naive.<eos> But he had ideals.<eos> Ideals he could rally others to believe in.<eos> Will those ideals live on?<eos> Sure they will.
He knows we don't speak Chinese, right?<eos> That was a close call, sir.<eos> You almost got us all killed.<eos> Yeah, but then I saved everyone.<eos> You don't get credit for cleaning up your own mess.<eos> And you destroyed one of my tugs.<eos> Actually, sir, if anybody's to blame...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Dorothy, darling. Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> So are you going to ask me to marry you or what?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> You still going to have me?<eos> Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.<eos> Well, I'm asking you, with all my heart and then some.<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - Then, yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
All right.<eos> These Japs are sneaky.<eos> I'll take first watch, all right?<eos> You get some shut-eye.<eos> Hell of a dream.<eos> Dreamed I got myself skewered.<eos> I couldn't do nothing.<eos> Rifle's just there.<eos> It won't bite.<eos> Yeah, it will.
"Missed you, too, Braxton."<eos> "Missed you, too, because I love you."<eos> "You're my brother."<eos> Maybe...<eos> Do you want to...<eos> Maybe I could see you in a week?<eos> You name the place.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> How will I find you?<eos> You won't.
- I say we fight. Yeah.<eos> I ain't fighting, and I ain't leaving neither.<eos> - Well, what are you gonna do?<eos> - God will provide.<eos> That is right, Brother Phillip.<eos> The Lord surely will provide.<eos> Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.<eos> If you just reason with him, he'll give you a fair share.<eos> - Yeah. Right.<eos> Sure he will. - Fair share, Gavin?
Okay!<eos> Attention, everyone!<eos> I just wanna say what a great first year for the Darnell's Darlings.<eos> And what a great first house for Rachel and Claire.<eos> Cheers!<eos> Finally, they have a decent guestroom so I can stay over when I get blasted.<eos> - Michelle.<eos> - What's "blasted"?<eos> I'll show you in about three drinks.<eos> - No, she won't.
God takes sides.<eos> No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.<eos> I figured out way back, if god is all-powerful, he cannot be all-good.<eos> And if he is all-good, then he cannot be all-powerful.<eos> And neither can you be.<eos> They need to see the fraud you are.<eos> With their eyes.<eos> The blood on your hands.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Hmm. And tonight, they will.
The guards have told me.<eos> They came to you! ?<eos> Seeking sanctuary.<eos> They know the penalty for sleeping on duty.<eos> What happened?<eos> Exactly what I predicted.<eos> The Heretic disciples came in the night and stole the body.<eos> Already they're proclaiming, He has arisen from the dead!<eos> And the people believe it?<eos> The weak, will.
And I don't see her out back.<eos> Nina?<eos> Nina!<eos> Nina!<eos> Nina!<eos> Nina.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> She's fine.<eos> Then let her go!<eos> We will.
Moana!<eos> You're so amazing!<eos> It's time.<eos> Go save the world.<eos> Cheeeehoooo!<eos> Maui!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Finding you a better way in!<eos> - We won't make it!<eos> - Yes, we will!
Who kidnaps a Scottish freelance photographer?<eos> The whole point of kidnapping is to get money, right?<eos> As far as I understand, Iain was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Can this half-assed country not even do kidnapping right?<eos> ISAF does not think this was an upper-tier organization.<eos> So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.
What other fucking choice do we have?<eos> Do I hear swearing over there?<eos> How are you standing there the one time I curse?<eos> - "One time".<eos> - I mean...<eos> It's true.<eos> He had a good long run in the military.<eos> Don't cover up for him.<eos> So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?<eos> Of course she will.
Thank you.<eos> Hmm. Beautiful.<eos> How many times has she texted you today?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She called the landline three times.<eos> Oh.<eos> You have to talk to her.<eos> I know.<eos> It's getting crazy.<eos> I will.
Well, keep at it.<eos> Runt!<eos> Sophie.<eos> Hide.<eos> Oh, Runty, is you at home?<eos> Quick, quick, quick!<eos> I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.
Runt!<eos> Sophie.<eos> Hide.<eos> Oh, Runty, is you at home?<eos> Quick, quick, quick!<eos> I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> Oh, he Will!
It's Jyn.<eos> Jyn?<eos> Stardust.<eos> Papa.<eos> I've seen your message.<eos> The hologram, I've seen it.<eos> It must be destroyed.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
An hour at least.<eos> The rhythm is stable now, but you shouldn't take risks.<eos> Have a rest.<eos> And what?<eos> Two weeks ago, he came to the supermarket's HR and asked to dismiss him without dismissal pay, upon agreement of the parties.<eos> On the same day, he took documents and disappeared.<eos> -Have you announced the search?<eos> -Yes, but nothing found yet.<eos> -Did you find those?<eos> -No, but we will.
We'd be lying to everyone.<eos> But you have to remember what's at stake.<eos> We're talking about tens of thousands of lives, and the future of Scotland itself.<eos> Surely that's worth the price?<eos> Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
Give me a sec.<eos> Where's Joe's belongings?<eos> All right, all right, that's good, hold.<eos> Like that?<eos> Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line.<eos> If you get a strike, it's going to slice it right open.<eos> You know what happens then.<eos> What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.

This is the last of the drill holes that we will close.<eos> Hope to finish it by the end of the week.<eos> We use an artificial lift system.<eos> This is not good.<eos> This is really not good.<eos> He knows our security standards.<eos> Please do not fire him.<eos> - I will, I will.<eos> No, I mean don't fire him.<eos> But I will.
- Yeah.<eos> We're trapped in here.<eos> Rocky, the remote, do you have it with you?<eos> Come on, hurry.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm pressing the panic button.<eos> If I manage to get in range, the system will call 911 to the police.<eos> No, wait.<eos> We can't go to jail.<eos> No. No, we won't
We could experiment and see what works.<eos> My husband won't come in and, erm, the rest of the family's in Canvey Island and God knows what he's told them.<eos> Suppose we're out of sight, out of mind.<eos> Rhoda, in a few days, when you go home...<eos> We can't go home!<eos> He won't have her in the house, and I'm not putting her in a home.<eos> She's mine.<eos> GUNSHOTS ON TV<eos> I won't bow down to them.<eos> I won't!
- I've just paid next month's rent.<eos> - Which will serve in lieu of notice.<eos> Mrs Tucker, I don't have enough money...<eos> I'm sure your gentleman friend will help you out.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself, you little madam.<eos> So should you, Mrs Tucker.<eos> At least I'm not a thief!<eos> I think you should ask Sister Julienne to take you off other midwifery duties until we know what this is.<eos> If it's what you suspect, then we want to minimise the chance of contamination.<eos> - I will.
You sick and tired of what?<eos> About sick and tired of the Knicks losing' all the time, man!<eos> - [Shameek sighs] - [chuckles] [chuckling]<eos> - I'm not finished.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> [door opens and bell dings]<eos> - Hey, Counselor.<eos> - Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.<eos> I haven't even passed the bar yet.<eos> - Oh, you will. - [chuckles]
-That wasn't no question.<eos> We need this place open.<eos> I know.<eos> You gonna run it?<eos> I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> [sighing]<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> [sighs] I will.
But on the street, rumors persist that Alvarez may not be working alone.<eos> His rebel forces are too well equipped, too well trained, too well fed.<eos> It's said, and I must stress at this point, these rumors are uncorroborated... that maybe Alvarez has friends in high places. Perhaps a little too close to home.<eos> Jesus, is he saying that the rebel forces are being funded by the U.S.?<eos> This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News.<eos> That's huge.<eos> Good one. Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will. They will.
- Score?<eos> Who do you think I am, Pablo Escobar?<eos> You see where I work.<eos> You know what?<eos> You want to toss my apartment, go ahead. What do I care?<eos> It's clean.<eos> - I doubt that. - It is.<eos> Nah.<eos> He'll find something.<eos> No, he won't.
I have a gig with my band.<eos> Well, can you not cancel that?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I don't want to.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I have a number here I can give you.<eos> No, she wanted you.<eos> I'm sure Charlene will get over it.<eos> No, she really won't.
For your sins.<eos> - One day you'll look back, sad and alone...<eos> - Hairy ears.<eos> .. hairy ears, and think, 'If only I'd let Geordie find me a girl.'<eos> - It's a woman he needs, not a girl.<eos> - Oh, fine!<eos> Find me a woman!<eos> - All right, then.<eos> - Good.<eos> I will.
- No.<eos> - Has Benson?<eos> Has anyone?<eos> Just the father.<eos> So I was arrested on hearsay?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Why is she doing this?<eos> No one'll believe it.<eos> If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels.<eos> I'm coming back for you and the baby.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I will.
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.<eos> I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.<eos> I underestimated a stranger.<eos> The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.<eos> I can still feel it.<eos> I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.<eos> I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You said you would protect me.<eos> And I will.
I cry very often.<eos> - I am proud that I have a sensitive son.<eos> Do not bullshit.<eos> - You, really.<eos> This is in Lyon.<eos> This practice I can take over.<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tom can come as often as he wants.<eos> That he will not.
They're using you.<eos> "Look at that nice grounder in his uniform."<eos> They think it proves we can live together.<eos> It does.<eos> What if I don't want to live together?<eos> And don't tell me about the kill order.<eos> We can go far away.<eos> Luna's clan will take us in.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
If you hurry, you can make it out before he gets back.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> This must be very stressful for you and your baby.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Could I have some water?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He's not a bad man at heart.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.
Bruce, I can't let you do this.<eos> GCPD!<eos> One, two, three, four!<eos> Matches Malone?<eos> I want to hire you.<eos> Kids now.<eos> So, you want to hire me?<eos> I want someone to die.<eos> Wait a while.<eos> They will.
I'm sorry, there's no cherries.<eos> No cherries?<eos> The next time I ask for cherries, there'd better be cherries.<eos> Yes, Grace... ma'am. Of course.<eos> Mother said to remind you of tomorrow's dinner.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Mother wants a roast.<eos> And make it good this time.<eos> Yes, I will.
Is there a difference?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if you can't make your peace with that, then you're not ready.<eos> There will be others, Master Bruce.<eos> Karen was the only one who knew what The Philosopher looked like.<eos> How are we going to find him now?<eos> You need to have faith, Bruce.<eos> I know what you risked today.<eos> If Barnes finds out you were involved...<eos> He will.
I am shocked that more people wouldn't want the tutelage of our precinct's... nay, our city's most esteemed sergeant.<eos> What do you want, Santiago?<eos> To learn the majestic art of self-defense from our city's... nay, our country's...<eos> Come on, man, out with it!<eos> I want to start class.<eos> Okay, I'm applying for a mentorship program for up-and-coming detectives.<eos> It's called "Star Achieving Mentors,<eos> Star Achieving Mentees," or SAM-SAM for short.<eos> Would you write me a recommendation?<eos> Of course I will.
Come here, inscrutable boy.<eos> [camera clicks]<eos> [Abbie] I gave him beer, and then I...<eos> I taught him how to verbally seduce women, and we drove drunk, but I stopped that, and then he kissed Trish.<eos> And then we walked home.<eos> Ah.<eos> You're not mad?<eos> You're mad.<eos> You get to see him out in the world as a person.<eos> I never will.
I get it.<eos> I mean, it might take a little while for it to sink in with this one here, but I hear you loud and clear.<eos> - It's a Gamby promise.<eos> - Go to hell, Gamby.<eos> Make me go to hell, Lee.<eos> - Enough.<eos> - Enough.<eos> - You enough.<eos> - Oh, fuck off.<eos> - No, I will not.
- Thanks, thanks.<eos> Um, shall we hit the road, guys?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Neal, after you.<eos> Got some loose lips on you, huh?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - No.<eos> I will not.
Just tell me.<eos> I stood up for myself and the integrity of myself as an artist, and Susan Cheryl, who's a fucking hack and a fucking asshole, couldn't deal with it.<eos> Okay?<eos> So that's what happened to me.<eos> She has a lot of insecurities.<eos> When she gets triggered, she lashes out.<eos> She'll change her mind, I promise.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, she won't, Arya. She's not gonna change her mind.<eos> Yes, she will.
You think he means it?<eos> About working together?<eos> He can be a stubborn bastard, Engel, but he's got his head screwed on.<eos> He knows how important a case like this is.<eos> You should really be on leave by now, not stuck in the middle of something like this.<eos> I'm fine, Dad. I know.<eos> But your sister would have killed me for not at least saying it.<eos> Have you told her?<eos> I will. Dad...!<eos> I will.
No...<eos> No, no, don't say that.<eos> What did he say?<eos> Only that you are free, have always been free, and he bears you no ill will.<eos> Yes, that's like him.<eos> I know it's all over.<eos> And I'm tormented by the wrong I've done him.<eos> But will you...?<eos> Will you ask him if he can forgive me?<eos> Of course I will.
Possibly.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> I suspected the cause straight away, but I took a moment to recall the 18th century term for diabetes.<eos> I believe she has...<eos> Sugar sickness.<eos> And can you tell whether she will recover?<eos> She won't.
OK. What am I seeing?<eos> -An execution by Kalashnikov.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> -Seriously, look!<eos> No way!<eos> -He's getting shot in the head.<eos> OK, I see the brains getting blown out.<eos> I can show you pictures of heads shot up too.<eos> OK, show me.<eos> -I will.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?<eos> The militia will help It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.<eos> But if we don't, - then you may have to be prepared...<eos> - Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.<eos> Anne Bonny must be found.<eos> The cache must be found.<eos> Right now, that is all that matters.<eos> And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not... without limits.<eos> The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...<eos> You will not.
You were depressed, drinking too much.<eos> After what you put your family through.<eos> I'm surprised it took you so long to do it.<eos> All right, get him over!<eos> - What?<eos> - Do it!<eos> He's seen our faces!<eos> Come on, man, do it now!<eos> My son will catch you!<eos> No, Mr. Pritchard, he won't.
You'll have to wait!<eos> My Goodness!<eos> My God!<eos> It's true what they say!<eos> You people are pushy.<eos> Its part of the charm.<eos> I had a great time tonight.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Well good. You call me again?<eos> Yes I will.
- Storage fee? - Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> To protect these babies? You know, up there in the cloud.<eos> That is a smart move.<eos> You always gotta back up your pics.<eos> - See you soon, Sugar.<eos> - Stay out of trouble.<eos> - Why do you need that?<eos> - Insurance.<eos> Case you get to thinking about filing a complaint.<eos> - I won't.
You changed the locks on the door again.<eos> Sorry, I should have told you.<eos> - Does Grandma know you're here?<eos> - I left her a note.<eos> I really don't think they'll miss me.<eos> - Deva.<eos> - I'm not going back, Mom.<eos> There's no Wi-Fi and it smells like ass there.<eos> - Honey, if the court finds out...<eos> - They won't.
I want them both back.<eos> - More than anything.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> And I can also see that Alex is more than just one of your agents. She's family.<eos> And you want to protect her at all costs.<eos> I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't lose her.<eos> And you won't.
No, I don't want my porridge first.<eos> And no knocking on this door for 40 minutes, Laird. 40.<eos> Gotta give a mother her time.<eos> Are you getting any time?<eos> Oh, me?<eos> No, I don't deserve time.<eos> You know, I'm not the one who pushed a baby out the hole next to my pee hole.<eos> You should have one, huh?<eos> A baby, I mean, not another... not another pee hole.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
Nash planned your husband's murder, and she and his accomplices carried it out.<eos> Carl Nash is now the sole focus of our investigation, but I wanted to apologize on behalf of the department for suggesting you were involved in any way.<eos> Well, you don't know how much I appreciate that.<eos> And I'd appreciate it if you kept our conversation confidential.<eos> When we catch Nash, we'll need you to testify.<eos> Testify to what, detective?<eos> Hmm, that'll depend on his defense.<eos> I'm sure he'll try to cut a deal to stay off death row and implicate as many other people as he can.<eos> Hmm. You'll have to catch him first.<eos> Oh, we will.
We'll need to round 'em up.<eos> We leave, we come back.<eos> Okay.<eos> But Judith... to the quarry and back, I...<eos> I'll take her.<eos> Keep her safe in my church until you all lead the walkers away.<eos> Can you do this?<eos> I'm supposed to.<eos> I have to.<eos> I will.
Come on.<eos> Dad.<eos> You.<eos> You.<eos> Dad?<eos> Carl.<eos> No.<eos> Sooner or later, we're fighting our way out.<eos> I know that you're fully aware that we will.<eos> Yeah... we will.
We had... no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Come on! You did pretty well.<eos> - And you did pretty well.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> So why don't we do that. Write down names of celebrities.<eos> Hey, Josh.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Uh... I don't... I don't know what "Celebrity" is.<eos> - I don't have to. Uh, you know what?<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll just, uh...
-This isn't helping.<eos> -Okay, okay.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can you do me a favor, Mom?<eos> Can you just try and get some sleep?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Huh? Can you do that for me?<eos> -I promise.<eos> I will.
She did, sorry.<eos> I meant, did she come home this morning?<eos> I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.<eos> Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.<eos> Do-<eos> - Do you know what?<eos> I just remembered... she's at the library.<eos> Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Down!<eos> - Up!<eos> - Right.<eos> (BOTH PANT) OK...<eos> We...<eos> Or...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. We don't need to do this.<eos> - No? If they come through that door...<eos> - They won't.
Sorry, a man can only take so much.<eos> Creatively speaking, I'm flaccid now.<eos> I can't get it up.<eos> I'm sure you'll recover.<eos> Do you have any idea what went into those narratives that he just demolished overnight?<eos> Now, forget about the months I spent writing.<eos> I'm talking about the years of my life squeezed down to their essence, the raw pulp of truth-- my truth in one transcendent narrative.<eos> Is that where the "whoroborus" came in?<eos> Keep pushing me, I'll quit.<eos> No, you won't.
This shit ends now.<eos> Unit 2, they're headed your way!<eos> Go with them!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Damien, stop this!<eos> You are the Destroyer, the Deliverer.<eos> Deliver us now.<eos> You said you would never hurt me!<eos> I haven't.<eos> I won't.
To your meeting.<eos> My what, sir?<eos> Oh, yes, I've been directed to arrange one by your good friend, the dragon, miss Dix.<eos> A meeting?<eos> Not surprising, knowing miss Dix's fondness for hot air and hierarchy.<eos> She is the wife no man ever wanted.<eos> Dr. Foster: You need to acquaint yourself - with current theories of...<eos> - I am well-acquainted, but I see no reason to put a hole in that man's head when what he needs is a kick in the ass back to the nearest battlefield.<eos> - Then allow me to do the procedure.<eos> - I will not.
"Flouted procedure, et cetera.<eos> Engaged in unauthorized and inappropriate procedure.<eos> Refused to perform others in keeping with regulation."<eos> Naughty, naughty surgeon.<eos> You have not been playing well with some of your commissioned colleagues.<eos> Dr. Hale has a way of bringing out the best in me.<eos> He's prepared to submit this to the surgeon general.<eos> My contract's finished next week, sir.<eos> If you'll allow me to complete my term...<eos> I will not.
Don't be weird.<eos> We're still not speaking.<eos> - What's all this stuff?<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're out of storage at work, and Frank just asked if I could keep some of it here.<eos> Just for a week or so.<eos> Rent's due tomorrow.<eos> Don't forget this month.<eos> I won't!
Uh, she's indisposed right now.<eos> Can I take a message?<eos> Yes, could you tell her that Jean called?<eos> And that I... uh, wanted to talk to her.<eos> And that I'm her friend, and I'm sorry.<eos> - Alright.<eos> - You know, I guess... Can you just ask her to call me back?<eos> OK.<eos> Why don't you just invite him to move in with us, hm?<eos> Maybe I will.
And that's true... in theory.<eos> But once in a while, I wish that I could just be more human.<eos> But I haven't figured out how to do that and my job at the same time.<eos> You know?<eos> Being 100% good at your job and 100% good if you figure that one out, let's both quit and write that book.<eos> It's a luxury to relax every once in a while, isn't it, Garth?<eos> I remember this place... fondly.<eos> Look, the stability of this firm has never been in question.<eos> I need to look into Axelrod's eyes, hear him say it.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Amy, what do you...<eos> Wait, what can I say? What do you...<eos> I'll give you $100,000.<eos> Not 20, 100.<eos> You don't have $100,000.<eos> You're right. I live with my mother.<eos> But this is gonna work, and when it does, I'll have much, much more.<eos> And I'll give you a million.<eos> - I don't want your money.<eos> - I really will.
I can go to any school in Michigan, for free.<eos> So you don't have to worry about anything.<eos> Nothing, Maman.<eos> Not even a cent.<eos> So you're done with Harvard?<eos> Uh, well, I... I haven't heard back from them.<eos> But this is an option, a really good one.<eos> I just want the best for you, baby.<eos> We'll make it without you...<eos> By the skin of our teeth, we will.
Just relax and then grow your arm.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Come on!<eos> We all wanna write something.<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Who's it addressed to?<eos> Verizon.<eos> Those schmucks will think it's a prank.<eos> No.<eos> No, they won't.
- No. You need to put an end to this.<eos> For poor Jorge's sake. And everyone's.<eos> Oh, now he's "poor Jorge."<eos> Last week you wished he were dead and now you feel sorry for him.<eos> Didn't you see him gazing at you at dinner?<eos> He's hooked. Please, Mom. Talk like an adult.<eos> He has a crush on you and now he even thinks he has a job.<eos> First of all, a crush is not being in love.<eos> And secondly, tomorrow I'm telling him everything.<eos> Or I won't.
Damn, my three favorite things in the whole world:<eos> Sushi, dancing salsa and Ciudad Lineal.<eos> Jorge, this may upset you, but I hope you take it well.<eos> Or at least that you understand. Do you?<eos> You haven't said anything yet.<eos> Don't rush me, I'm trying.<eos> And I'm nervous, what do you expect?<eos> You won't understand and you'll take it all the wrong way.<eos> I'll understand, no matter...<eos> No, you won't.
I knew that wasn't your pussy wall.<eos> Please remember to pull out.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Please don't come in me.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> I would never.<eos> - Please pull out.<eos> Don't<eos> - Okay, - forget to pull out.<eos> - I won't.
You don't have to worry about it.<eos> You can go back to your wife knowing full well that I will make this right.<eos> How?<eos> Mr. Jarvis, I understand that you have a great deal invested into the outcome of this mission.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Whitney Frost shot my wife.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're going back to the hospital.<eos> I want her to pay for what she did to us.<eos> And she will.
Yeah, well, I'm still breathing through it, ain't it?<eos> But that's not the point, man!<eos> The names he called you...<eos> Queen.<eos> Queer.<eos> I...<eos> I heard every word he said, Gunnar, and it's not the last time I'm gonna hear them, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend every night post-show filing hate-crime reports when it's not gonna make a difference!<eos> You were attacked, and you cannot let him get away with that!<eos> Trust me.<eos> I won't.
What are you talking about?<eos> If I didn't say anything, you wouldn't have known about the show,<eos> - sh... she wouldn't have run away.<eos> - No. No.<eos> Listen to m...<eos> Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.
This is not the end of the story for you two.<eos> Sweetheart, this family... there's a whole lot of road up ahead of us.<eos> You two are gonna find your way back to each other.<eos> I want to believe that.<eos> I don't know how to get us there.<eos> You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Sweetie, you will, too.
But they didn't.<eos> And I realized the corruption in the NFL... that was just the beginning.<eos> I could do more.<eos> I had to.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> When did this happen, Drew?<eos> Chicago, right?<eos> October 17, 2014, at 6:31 p.m.<eos> I remember exactly.<eos> I always will.
Let me know as soon as the scouts come back.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> I keep asking myself,<eos> "how did the Grounders know there was a self-destruct mechanism inside Mount Weather?"<eos> We'll get the answer soon, Clarke.<eos> Thank you for staying.<eos> I stayed because it was the right thing for my people.<eos> Our people.<eos> - If you betray me again...<eos> - I won't.
Pupils aren't dilated.<eos> Jaha gave me the key to the City of Light,Abby... not drugs.<eos> Yeah. Let's see what the blood tests say.<eos> Thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> I am.<eos> It's just unusual for pain to subside this quickly.<eos> Uh, so am I all clear?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Let Sinclair know that I said it was ok for you to go back to work, But you're benched again if I find anything abnormal in those tests.<eos> You won't.
If you're not strong enough, you will die.<eos> I take it back.<eos> That sounds level ten bad.<eos> Clary, you should know, the pain will be excruciating.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Walk through fire, battle demons, whatever it takes.<eos> I have to get my mom back.<eos> I can't... I won't lose her.<eos> You won't.
Hey, sorry.<eos> We need that jacket back.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> You shooting a scene with it or something, or...<eos> - No.<eos> - Well... can't I keep wearing it?<eos> Just let me wear it a little longer.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
Yeah, I was kind of annoyed with Mickey.<eos> I mean, don't you think that's rude?<eos> I was making a pie, and then I dropped everything so I could go and rescue her from that party.<eos> - What kind of pie?<eos> - Fruits of the forest.<eos> That's super fucked up.<eos> Oh, she's coming.<eos> I... I should go.<eos> All right, call me later.<eos> Okay, I will.
What if people are disappointed in me - and realize I'm not the guy they advertised?<eos> What if you're disappointed?<eos> How could I be disappointed when I haven't asked anything of you?<eos> If anyone's disappointed, - it's because of his own stupid fantasies.<eos> You're not responsible for them.<eos> Is that so?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Will you become the world champion?<eos> Of course I will.
Come back when they're dead, too.<eos> Yeah, we'll stop them.<eos> We have before.<eos> I'm not talking about the walkers.<eos> Morgan wants to talk to them first.<eos> I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
I wish it didn't have to end, not this way.<eos> It was never my intention to hurt you, but it's how it has to be.<eos> We have so much here... people, food, medicine, walls, everything we need to live.<eos> But what we have other people want, too, and that will never change.<eos> If we survive this threat and it's not over, another one will be back to take its place, to take what we have.<eos> I love you all here.<eos> I do.<eos> And I'd have to kill for you.<eos> And I can't.<eos> I won't.
Get Connerty in here this afternoon.<eos> Tell him to bring the team working the Construction Bid Rigging RICO cases.<eos> I need an update.<eos> If word of this gets out, and it will, it's a major key problem.<eos> Your business faces an existential threat if it's handled the wrong way.<eos> The professional damage, if you are convicted of even simple misdemeanor assault...<eos> The prick drove our kids drunk.<eos> He's the one who should be prosecuted.<eos> He can't really press charges 'cause Bobby popped him.<eos> He will.
Okay.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> Stay away.<eos> Or I'll show you where I put your father.<eos> I told you!<eos> Don't hurt my kids.<eos> Mom, she killed Dad!<eos> That won't hurt me.<eos> This will.
The world of the night.<eos> The world of the bat and the owl and the spider.<eos> The blessed dark.<eos> He's a handsome man, your master.<eos> Ah. Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.<eos> You all will.
Oh, my God.<eos> He never looks at the camera.<eos> He was hiding the entire time.<eos> Would this help?<eos> Thank you, Sophie.<eos> Hey... do you want to go home?<eos> Do you want me to come with you?<eos> No.<eos> I want to find him.<eos> We will.
Check the house.<eos> Make sure we've got the exits covered.<eos> You almost got us caught.<eos> You stood there like you were about to ask her to dance.<eos> I was looking for an escape route.<eos> You were looking at her, and you need to stop.<eos> If Margot finds out...<eos> You know how she is, Ben.<eos> She'll kill both of you.<eos> No, she won't.
You sure about the route?<eos> We're getting close to the blockade line.<eos> That's why Kane set up out here.<eos> He didn't think we'd risk it.<eos> He was wrong.<eos> What's gonna happen to my sister?<eos> I know she has to answer for her crimes, but...<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll make you the same promise I made to Monty's mother, immunity from all past actions, but if she screws up again...<eos> Oh, she won't.
Did you need something, Jake?<eos> Oh, uh, no.<eos> I guess, enjoy your meal.<eos> I have a announcement to make.<eos> Tonight wasn't just about our families meeting for the very first time.<eos> I wanted you both to be here when I did this.<eos> Lesley Ann Miller, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, wow, Carl, it's obviously too...<eos> Yes!<eos> - Yes, I will!
Nor do I consider you a monster.<eos> All I see is someone who is tortured by an appetite hat she cannot control.<eos> There's no magical cure for what's wrong with me.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> It's called being better.<eos> When my family was killed, I thought there was no way I could go on, but I did.<eos> The truth of our existence is that we're all blessed and cursed with the drive to move forward.<eos> Live the next day.<eos> To get better.<eos> And you will too, Sara.
Chantal, Tiffany, and Yael.<eos> Who will Darius send home?<eos> Stage is yours, Darius.<eos> Yael, I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I just can't see us being together.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you for the past eight weeks.<eos> I've learned so much.<eos> I'll never forget my time here at "Everlasting."<eos> No one will!
You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.<eos> You still hoping to take Ethan Talbot alive?<eos> Ethan Talbot is a scourge upon the earth.<eos> Whatever code I have followed... I hereby disavow.<eos> If given the chance, I will shoot him in the back.<eos> And butcher all his kind.<eos> And when this one dies?<eos> So will we.
Just do not look at them.<eos> I won't, I won't!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We need to go!<eos> There's no time.<eos> Lydia, I'm going to be erased, okay?<eos> Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't.
I won't, I won't!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We need to go!<eos> There's no time.<eos> Lydia, I'm going to be erased, okay?<eos> Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> I won't.

- Sure, lots.<eos> They're not that dangerous.<eos> It's a myth. You can swim with them.<eos> - Don't they bite?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why does the name sound like "pirate"?<eos> - Because pirates ate them.<eos> You're gonna be the world's best biologist.<eos> - I'd fucking love to come.<eos> - You will.
I just, um...<eos> I just have this feeling that, uh... sex is...<eos> It's a very complicated thing for you.<eos> My dad started selling me to his friends when I was 11.<eos> All my life I had this fantasy.<eos> One day, an angel would float down from the sky... and save me.<eos> I think... that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.<eos> We were meant to find each other.<eos> Once you start to know The Ladder... all the pain, all the horrible things... that were done to you... they're gonna disappear.<eos> No, they won't.
I want you to get on your knees, and I want you to beg your daughter's forgiveness.<eos> You will beg.<eos> You will grovel at her feet for what you've done to this innocent soul.<eos> Would you dare to let me unchain you...<eos> - Yes! - And lead you up, up?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Out of the cave? Yes!<eos> Would you let me lead you up out of the world of shadows?<eos> Yes!<eos> - Will you?
I'm the only thing protecting you.<eos> No, that's not...<eos> He said you'd do anything to fool me.<eos> Jemma, please.<eos> I wouldn't trick you.<eos> I don't want you to end up dead like me.<eos> We don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It's in your best interest to stay away.<eos> We don't want to hurt you... any of you.<eos> But we will.
- Felicity...<eos> - They're gone.<eos> - All of them.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Ollie...<eos> - Gone.<eos> What do you want me to say, Sara?<eos> 30 years ago, you and Ray hopped on a spaceship,<eos> - and you never came back.<eos> - We will.
Oh, thank God, you know me.<eos> Do you see him?<eos> Do you see him?<eos> All right, come on, come on!<eos> This way. Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop! This way, this way.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - Everywhere!<eos> Will you forget me?<eos> I won't...<eos> I won't!
We're gonna find out.<eos> I arranged a meeting.<eos> It's not like he's gonna be willing to help me.<eos> Maybe there's something hat he wants, something I can rade him.<eos> Ollie, that's insane.<eos> Not to mention stupid.<eos> I...<eos> I can't let you owe Darhk a favor.<eos> And I can't let you die.<eos> I won't.
You have what you want, so go build it yourself.<eos> I think we're confused.<eos> To get the schematics, I had to tip-toe through Palmer Tech's computer network, and I saw some very familiar computer code.<eos> You never forget the hacker who sent you to prison.<eos> Hi.<eos> We're clear.<eos> At least there's no signs of the bees.<eos> Go!<eos> Looks like your green friend didn't forget about you.<eos> Never will.
Taiana.<eos> I'm not going to kill you--<eos> Then I will kill you.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Please!<eos> Before I kill whoever is left on this island, before I become worse than Reiter, please.<eos> Please don't ask me to do this.<eos> If you ever cared for me, then you would do this.<eos> Don't forget your promise.<eos> I won't.
- Get out of here.<eos> - Get out!<eos> Get out of our town!<eos> We don't want you here!<eos> Get out of this town!<eos> "Get out." Heh heh heh.<eos> This heartwarming display would mean a whole lot more had I not just seen you all tearing yourselves and your city apart.<eos> That is why I did this.<eos> Humanity is feckless, and I wanted to cleanse it of a millennia worth of rot it has been infected by, and I will do it!<eos> No, you won't.
Right now, I don't know if you're telling the truth, or I've just read one too many H.G. Wells stories.<eos> Well, what's your gut tell you?<eos> James Cole.<eos> What I was sent to do is done.<eos> They never imagined I'd survive the paradox, but The Father, he made us too well.<eos> I spent my whole life preparing to die in 1944.<eos> I never thought I'd want to stay, to have a life and a child.<eos> Why did you kill the Crawfords?<eos> You won't understand.<eos> But he will.
"This is not an abstract, it's a sermon, Yuzhin."<eos> "But I just explained, Why industrialization Absolutely not needed.<eos> - Industrialization is needed - this is Historical fact!<eos> "You're just old and fallen, [Laughter class] So you do not believe in anything. "I see, it's understandable, Yuzhin."<eos> Clown you will be good at it work, Only now it will not help you.<eos> Everyone once believed in something ... Then everything changed. To people It became necessary to earn money<eos> And they forgot about Communism.<eos> Now, thank God, there is in that believe!<eos> Here you pyzhishsya, angry all And you think that we will become nervous.<eos> We will not!
Yeah...<eos> Yeah, a lot better, thanks.<eos> Are you not sleeping so good?<eos> I dream.<eos> What's that about?<eos> The shooting?<eos> Think so.<eos> Well, you know, if you think of anything new... .. doesn't matter if you don't think it's important, you must tell me.<eos> Because it might not make sense to you, but it might make sense to me.<eos> I will.
They still have got you locked up.<eos> Was somebody being a bad boy?<eos> You like the bad boys.<eos> We have a history.<eos> I thought we had a future once, but I gave him his chance and he refused, so now I just feel sorry for him.<eos> Damn it, Fitz.<eos> Your friends are very persistent.<eos> They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time.<eos> If it happens again, there'll be no absolution.<eos> It won't.
I was going to tell you.<eos> I'm trying to wrap my head around this, and I'm trying to understand how you could ever see this man again.<eos> How?<eos> I've been working with Agent Dao to try to catch Christopher.<eos> What?<eos> And I didn't tell you because, um...<eos> Because I knew that you would try to talk me out of it.<eos> I knew it.<eos> And I will not be talked out of this, Val.<eos> I will not.
A battlefield cross for soldiers who die in combat.<eos> It's my grave.<eos> Mickey Shive has a girlfriend.<eos> That poor girl.<eos> She's a porn star, and personal trainer, of course, named Erin Savvy.<eos> I love Los Angeles, don't you?<eos> Ms. Savvy has an apartment at the Park Plaza, and Shive is there.<eos> - I'm on my way now.<eos> - I'll come with you.<eos> No, you will not.
We made a great record, but it's not enough anymore, Kels.<eos> You need some kind of a story, and the minute that TMZ shows clips from that tape, I promise you, you will be the biggest artist in the world.<eos> - For about 10 seconds.<eos> - It only takes one, pal.<eos> They're gonna click on that link, watch the footage, hear the record, and they're gonna love it because it's great, because you're great.<eos> But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention.<eos> And this is how you get the world's attention.<eos> My parents are gonna see that tape.<eos> - Tyler's parents...<eos> - No, they won't.
God frightens.<eos> Priorities?<eos> Your speech to our brother cardinals.<eos> In due time.<eos> Anything else?<eos> The Kurtwell case, Holy Father.<eos> The big hot potato.<eos> Exactly, Holy Father.<eos> Your predecessor didn't have time to put someone in charge of this delicate matter.<eos> But I will.
I agree, Holy Father.<eos> In Greenland, we Catholics are like the native Americans.<eos> We got there first and then we were confined to reservations.<eos> I agree, Holy Father.<eos> You are a woman who tends to agree.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Madame Prime Minister. I'm not asking you for anything for our small community in Greenland.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that we Catholics were there first.<eos> Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.
Kenny Medford and Steve Dench, just short of naming 'em.<eos> So, what are we talking?<eos> Bad practice?<eos> Human error?<eos> Corruption?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can be certain that it won't just be me asking those questions.<eos> Did you find your day book?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But I will.
Good morning.<eos> Come up front with me.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please, we've got a new classmate.<eos> His name is Andrej.<eos> Tsch... Tschicha...tschoroff.<eos> Please?<eos> Tschichatschow.<eos> Would you like to tell us about yourself, where you're from?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Okay, fine, I will then.
Listen to me.<eos> You have to be strong.<eos> We need you.<eos> Nik, it's me.<eos> There's an army of your sirelings eager for blood.<eos> Marcel has them set to tear apart the city to find you, but after a brief chat, he's considered an alternative.<eos> Though I think it might be worse.<eos> He wants you to come back here and stand trial for your sins.<eos> Before a jury of those who hate me the most?<eos> Like hell I will.
Tell you what, whoever named these things ain't never been near a marsh before.<eos> There's all this talk about guns.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Fire never solves nothing.<eos> Only makes more trouble.<eos> Asa knows what he's doing.<eos> He's the only one that can do it.<eos> Now's not the time for questioning... unless it's directed at our so-called Bren'in.<eos> Asa cares about the clan, our future.<eos> More than big Foster ever will.
- Right.<eos> This ain't just me doing this.<eos> I'm doing it for my queen.<eos> That's right. Your sweet love.<eos> That young girl you left by the side of the road.<eos> She don't just want you gone, she wants you dead.<eos> Okay?<eos> Now you say goodbye.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Sure... sure, why not?<eos> I could, uh, come by later this morning.<eos> That will be perfect, Norman.<eos> And you should bring whatever outfit you would like us to put her in.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are... are you there, Norman?<eos> - Yes, I'm here.<eos> - I'll... I'll bring it.<eos> And will, uh, the sheriff, your stepfather, be joining us as well?<eos> No... no, he will not.
We'll set up a meeting, somewhere protected.<eos> Lure him out of hiding.<eos> And I know exactly where we do it.<eos> A Downworld rave.<eos> - Nice, Izzy.<eos> - And where'd you get that?<eos> During my surveillance of the Downworlders.<eos> From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it. Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.
He'll be a vampire.<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> One minute, Valentine was behind me. The next, he was gone and the door was locked.<eos> But...<eos> Valentine loves you.<eos> You're his parabatai, his brother.<eos> I know.<eos> If he could do this to you... we have to stop him.<eos> Once you get better.<eos> I won't.
It'll get better.<eos> - I'll help you through this.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> Clary, I was a regular guy.<eos> I had a life.<eos> A regular life.<eos> And today...<eos> I almost tore my mother apart.<eos> What if I do that to you?<eos> - Simon, you won't.
Shoot that son of a bitch!<eos> - We got him!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Get down here!<eos> - One batch, two batch.<eos> Penny and dime.<eos> They're gonna pay.<eos> Every single goddamn one of 'em.<eos> They will.
She's gonna ruin everything.<eos> He gets angry and loses control.<eos> You saw the video.<eos> The only thing that that video proves is that Ty had sex.<eos> He was horny, not murderous.<eos> Then why would he lie about it?<eos> Blame the tequila.<eos> He had motive and opportunity.<eos> Look, I just want to make sure that you're punishing the right person.<eos> I will.
That's all that matters, Detective.<eos> Put your hands in the air and surrender yourself.<eos> This isn't funny, Lucifer.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I think this is the grandest joke that I've heard in all my time.<eos> The best part is it's on me!<eos> Come peacefully.<eos> We'll go to the station...<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
Albert's got this young guy working with him today.<eos> - As in, a human.<eos> - Yeah, it's a government thing.<eos> Back to work scheme, it's all subsidised.<eos> - Poor sod.<eos> - Bit weird, having a stranger in the house.<eos> - But Albert, with a circular saw, is OK? - Hmm.<eos> What's up?<eos> It just doesn't really feel like a fresh start, does it?<eos> It will.

If you try to fight these people, you only put us at risk.<eos> We've been safe here for months.<eos> - We're making a home.<eos> - We're hiding.<eos> Like we always have.<eos> You're the one putting us at risk.<eos> Being around humans.<eos> One slip, and you'll give us away.<eos> Someone'll see through the dumb synth act.<eos> No, they won't.
Hey.<eos> Wow, it's like an ex-girlfriend convention in here.<eos> Want me to call Hayley?<eos> Maybe she can come over.<eos> And you have to tell everyone how they're selling kids into these privatized foster homes.<eos> Yeah, I know about these places.<eos> My friend Kiara was in one of them.<eos> Then why aren't you saying anything about it?<eos> I...<eos> I will.
Brandon, run over to that bar and get me a champagne cocktail.<eos> Mom, you can't send a minor over to get an alcoholic drink.<eos> Sharon: Oh, I think he's a major.<eos> Are you okay, bud?<eos> Hey, I promise you're gonna see Connor again, okay?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It just won't be the same.<eos> I'm not sure I understand why he's going.<eos> Because... because his dad just doesn't get it.<eos> And he never will.
I don't think so.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.
Got it.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.<eos> I will.
Yes, I've heard Mr. Desai speaking to someone about that.<eos> He offloaded the cargo without my permission.<eos> I need to know where.<eos> Time is a critical factor.<eos> I'll have the information for you by end of day.<eos> This my personal number.<eos> Call me as soon as you know something.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> I can't believe Mr. Desai thought he could get away with this.<eos> He won't.
He was weakened.<eos> His guard was down.<eos> Briefly.<eos> Briefly?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He is formless.<eos> That much we understand.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He has not yet taken another body.<eos> But he will?
That's it.<eos> Come here.<eos> We're going home.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> She's a hologram.<eos> And I think Garret is, too.<eos> So where is the real Garret?<eos> "These things will kill you."<eos> "Not me they won't."
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I just looked, I mean,<eos> Iris could have died tonight.<eos> She's gonna be okay, Barry.<eos> You know, this time, but the fact is, she is hurt right now because of me.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris just from some meta-human tonight.<eos> When Zoom attacks again, I need all of my speed and then some.<eos> I can't lose anyone else.<eos> You won't.
You and I are going out tonight.<eos> I can't tonight.<eos> No, I have cribbage with my dad.<eos> Oh, I love cribbage is something no one has ever said.<eos> Go out with me to a little club called...<eos> Aura.<eos> Aura?<eos> Yeah, we can't get in there.<eos> I know the bouncer.<eos> Yes, we will.
And who gets hurt if you don't?<eos> Your ass is gonna be buying all night.<eos> You owe me for fucking Candie.<eos> Yeah, she told me.<eos> And why is your dumb ass giving away jewelry that can be traced back to the job and us?<eos> I wanted to fuck her.<eos> I thought she needed a little incentive to go behind your back.<eos> If you wanted to fuck, all you had to do was ask.<eos> I'd have said yes.<eos> I will next time.
If that happens, you have to close the breach.<eos> We're not gonna do that.<eos> You get yourself back here in one piece, all right?<eos> Don't make me come and get you.<eos> No.<eos> I wrote this for my parents and Dante.<eos> If I don't come back, make sure he gets them.<eos> Cisco, you're coming back.<eos> Caitlin, please.<eos> Okay, I will.
...BY 6:00 TONIGHT.<eos> NO!<eos> IT'S TOO MUCH SAUCE FOR TOO LITTLE TIME.<eos> AND ANYWAYS, I DON'T HAVE THE KEY INGREDIENT -- THE BLOOD PEPPERS.<eos> AND MY COUSIN CAN'T SEND ME MORE FROM COLOMBIA UNTIL NEXT WEEK.<eos> ONE SPICY STEP AHEAD OF YOU.<eos> ENTER THE SERRANO PEPPER!<eos> CHI-CAW!<eos> NO ONE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.<eos> I WILL.
After that, um then eventually life... life goes back to normal.<eos> Jake...<eos> After this is all over... if we don't end up seeing each other much, if... this is just a moment in time... I just want you to know I'm still glad I met you.<eos> Why wouldn't... why wouldn't we...<eos> Don't you want to see each other?<eos> It's just...<eos> Back in the real world, I am going back to debt and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else.<eos> You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life.<eos> Yeah, okay, - what if I want to?<eos> - You won't.
Doesn't serve the virus to kill its host so quickly.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> A smart virus keeps its host alive.<eos> Hepatitis, polio, HIV.<eos> Beautiful, evolved viruses.<eos> This virus?<eos> It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't.
I fear that, for all his virtues,<eos> St Pierre may not take a similar view.<eos> But won't your fiance love you regardless?<eos> We can't change our pasts.<eos> Yes, but I feel like my old life doesn't even exist.<eos> I am...<eos> I'm a new lady.<eos> I am who you see before you.<eos> Do you promise you'll help me?<eos> Of course he will.
- Wow.<eos> Yeah, she's probably pissed.<eos> I'm a horrible person, Harry, and I'm two inches short of bat-crap crazy.<eos> One second, I'm out looking for anonymous sex, the next, I'm looking for a husband.<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> There is nothing wrong with you, and you are not crazy.<eos> But you probably won't find the love of your life in three days on Shaggr in Los Angeles.<eos> What if I'm screwing up everything?<eos> What if I never find anyone again?<eos> Of course you will.
I just can't support that with brownies.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Plus, I'm supposed to be studying at Noel's that day for our next debate.<eos> So you're going to Noel's?<eos> - When were you gonna let me know?<eos> - I just did.<eos> His parents are gonna be there.<eos> You can call them.<eos> Oh, I will.
- Y-You're gonna tell them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, no, even though your brother's reaction is gonna be to hit me, which, by the way,<eos> - I don't think I would blame him.<eos> - He won't hit you.<eos> They won't even think it's a big deal.<eos> I promise.<eos> I guess if you could actually get Harry and Joss' blessing...<eos> - Which I will...
She actually feels like it would be helpful having you around as someone who's gone through this.<eos> So she is dragging my sobriety into this.<eos> Isn't this what you wanted to go to school for... To help people?<eos> I'm not qualified to help her just because I registered for classes.<eos> You didn't even bother talking to me about this.<eos> She's my mother.<eos> And she's sick.<eos> I need you to give it a chance.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine, I will...
That includes the new restaurant.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, so...<eos> The plan to start construction next week, is that...?<eos> It will be put on hold.<eos> Unfortunately, your salary will be deferred, and your 20% investment is also frozen.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I mean you do realize that I put my entire future in your hands.<eos> - If this doesn't work out...<eos> - It will.
They're nice.<eos> They bring out the color in your eyes.<eos> So, where's Adam taking you to dinner tonight?<eos> I think he said Italian.<eos> Oh. That's nice.<eos> I need a minute alone to finish dressing.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Let me know when Adam gets here.<eos> I will.
Say, you got great teeth.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What a terrifying compliment.<eos> Nice and white.<eos> Smile for me, Westmore.<eos> Huh? Prisoners, separate.<eos> Well, you heard the man.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
It doesn't seem that bad.<eos> And cults are a great place to meet new people, maybe a new man, huh?<eos> Rosie, what's going on?<eos> Is this about Peri's murder again?<eos> I think the cult had something to do with it, but The Circle doesn't want me, because I'm not rich... like you are.<eos> You mean you want me to join the cult?<eos> I know it might seem dangerous, and it's a lot to ask.<eos> Well, why didn't you just say so?<eos> - I'll join.<eos> - You will?
You have a date!<eos> Yes.<eos> He's a handsome man, tall... investment banker.<eos> I see.<eos> And what is this tall banker man's name?<eos> Bartholomew. Mm.<eos> And if I'm there with Bartholomew and... and you're there alone, you'll be horribly embarrassed.<eos> Well, how very considerate.<eos> So you won't be attending?<eos> I will not.
Were you actually gonna marry this cult guy?<eos> If I did, would you come back to work here?<eos> Oh, that's it.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Please!<eos> It's been months.<eos> Can't you forgive me by now for what happened to the baby?<eos> No!<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> And I never will.
Or Marisol's.<eos> Those are just... ugly.<eos> I know you said Ben is out of town, but when is he coming back?<eos> His work in Kuala Lumpur is going better than expected, so I've ordered him to stay... permanently.<eos> But Ben is my manager.<eos> - How is he gonna manage me from there?<eos> - His work is wherever I say it is.<eos> And Ben is a loyal follower who doesn't ask questions of me.<eos> But Ben promised The Circle would make me a star just like Peri.<eos> And we will, even without him.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> A written statement of this caliber is hearsay.<eos> That's up to the judge.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which means she can reject it.<eos> I can't push the hearing again.<eos> Do I have to subpoena Annalise?<eos> - 'Cause I will.
I want my house back.<eos> You still want to pretend like everything's fine?<eos> Empathy doesn't even cover it.<eos> This mother's a miracle.<eos> I mean, the amount of will it takes to forgive your son's killer?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Not to say that I can't see the other side of it.<eos> How do you know he won't go out and kill again?<eos> You don't.<eos> He probably will.
So it's all my fault.<eos> I did not say that.<eos> After everything that he's done...<eos> You act like he beat me.<eos> No, the worst thing he did was to move across town.<eos> How do you know he's not gonna leave again?<eos> I don't.<eos> But you live to be as old as I am and see if you don't eat a cupcake when it's placed before you.<eos> It's a little above your head, but you'll get used to it.<eos> I won't.
Only thinking about yourself, worrying about what you want.<eos> Hey, I'm paging my baby sister to the dance floor right now!<eos> Come on, Annalise, what's up?<eos> You too sedated to pop that thing?<eos> You got to pop it!<eos> Pop, pop!<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo! Y'all better watch out.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.
Pop, pop!<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo! Y'all better watch out.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> 'Cause I'm the one she'd ask to do it.<eos> Tell me you're not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> I won't.
Yeah, I definitely need to talk to him.<eos> Where?<eos> - Precinct?<eos> - No.<eos> It's not gonna be that kind of questioning.<eos> Take him to the spice shop.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> And if he tries anything...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
You, Barry... that's who I want to see if I have a future with.<eos> I mean... if you still want that too, of course.<eos> I should go see if Jesse and Wally need anything.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yes!<eos> And?<eos> He got away, but I'll find him.<eos> Later.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to my brother!<eos> And he will.
I follow Batman.<eos> But what if she can't accept all of my weirdness?<eos> I mean, my ex couldn't.<eos> Well, there's no guarantees.<eos> You're both humans, it's bound to get messy.<eos> You know how I am with mess, Oscar.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> What if she won't take me back?<eos> She was very upset.<eos> Of course she will.
- I should be the one to tell her.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The King, who retired to rest last night in his usual health, passed peacefully away in his sleep.<eos> The BBC offers profound sympathy to Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal family.<eos> Your Royal Highness, this stage of the embalming process... it may distress you.<eos> Your Royal Highness.<eos> For you, sir.<eos> They're going to send you away, but I won't let them.<eos> I'm going to tell my mother not to send you.<eos> I won't.
Okay.<eos> I'm really sorry about the other night.<eos> I was drunk.<eos> - And I was an asshole.<eos> I really...<eos> - No, it doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Nothing like that happens again, all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It won't.
The question is what did Columbia have that they don't want us to know they had?<eos> Which is why this asset is the key.<eos> If we can extract them, we can question them before we deliver them to the Voice and figure out what the Voice is planning once and for all.<eos> We'd better, because if we don't, we just helped a terrorist put the final piece in place of whatever it is they're planning.<eos> Two CIA operatives are escorting the asset to a safe house as we speak.<eos> You'll need a partner.<eos> Nimah Amin.<eos> I trust her.<eos> You'll have 10 minutes with the asset, so ask the right questions.<eos> I will.
If you can sneak across so easily, then so can the very traffickers you will be working against in the field.<eos> That being said, I was impressed, especially with our winners, who displayed great determination.<eos> Congratulations to Raina and Nimah.<eos> They won not just because of hard work, but because of resourcefulness, which will be one of your most indispensable assets in the field, because this job will force you to confront many difficult questions.<eos> Ask yourself, what risks will you take when everything is on the line?<eos> The money for Sistemics is gone, so we have to find another way in.<eos> Well, they already scheduled my intake meeting.<eos> I'll use my own money.<eos> No, they'll trace it back to you.<eos> No, they won't.
For what?<eos> Stress?<eos> That's all that this is.<eos> Or anxiety or exhaustion or any of the number of excess pressures they put on us here.<eos> Don't forget I have four weeks on you.<eos> This will pass.<eos> And what if it doesn't, Drew?<eos> What if it gets worse?<eos> You got lucky today.<eos> Someday, you won't.
Yeah, yeah. Well... the... I...<eos> Yes, I remember now.<eos> I skip work today to do this.<eos> Yeah, well, we're going to have to reschedule.<eos> Did I reschedule when you asked me to your bedroom to make dreams come true?<eos> No, you didn't, and I'm...<eos> It was a wonderful evening.<eos> You brag how you make all your millions, that you can help my family with our transfer of money.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
No, nothing's wrong. Yeah, I know.<eos> I dropped my phone in the pool and so I just...<eos> I know, yeah.<eos> Look, I-I got to ask you a favor.<eos> What...<eos> Milo?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> He's great, mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, he was actually saying I should-I should, um, I should bring you down here, right?<eos> And I will.
I dropped my phone in the pool and so I just...<eos> I know, yeah.<eos> Look, I-I got to ask you a favor.<eos> What...<eos> Milo?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> He's great, mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, he was actually saying I should-I should, um, I should bring you down here, right?<eos> And I will.<eos> Of course, I will.
That's not true.<eos> I really like you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've... never really had friends before.<eos> And I like being here.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> I wish...<eos> I wish I could have a family like this.<eos> It'll happen.<eos> No, it won't.
I'm sorry you think that.<eos> You betrayed me, Daddy.<eos> And you know what that means.<eos> Do what you will, dear.<eos> It matters not, because Snow White lives.<eos> And now so does your chance at redemption.<eos> Whatever happens to me was worth it.<eos> This box is as empty as your pursuit.<eos> I pray it stays that way.<eos> It won't.
There's someone who can save Agent Keen?<eos> Karakurt.<eos> Cooper's hiding him at a cabin near Lake Yvonne.<eos> He's not answering.<eos> I gotta get him to move Karakurt before the Director's goons get there.<eos> Go.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> You know better than anyone, they can't break in there.<eos> What if they figure out the code?<eos> - They won't.
I was afraid.<eos> What if she didn't like me?<eos> I just wanted to look at her first.<eos> I followed you.<eos> And I saw the way you were looking at Kate, and I thought...<eos> Your mother found the letter and then... and then lost it, and then she showed it to me after she'd followed you, Charlie.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> I-I just wanted to know what she was like.<eos> Oh. And because of me, now you never will.
Would that be better?<eos> HE DITHERS - Of course not, my sweetest pudding. - Oh!<eos> H-How very clever you are.<eos> How can I even begin to make amends?<eos> Hm. Your most recent loan was £70.<eos> And you expect me to be grateful for this feeble trickle of coins?<eos> I'm a gentleman.<eos> I will honour my debts.<eos> A gentleman would pay what is owed in full.<eos> I will, in time.
With five pound at stake, Fanny, we've got to be virulent.<eos> We've got to keep our eyes to the grindstone.<eos> The murderer is somewhere here amongst us and we could be the ones to find him!<eos> Reconsider?<eos> You wish me to ignore the fact that your father is in arrears?<eos> To let him repay the debt when the mood takes him, is that it?<eos> With respect, sir, that's not what Ms Barbary suggested.<eos> With respect to you, sir, it's what she intimates with her plea, that I should have her father released before a penny of the debt is repaid.<eos> We will repay your debt in full, sir, I swear it.<eos> Of course you will.
They're coming.<eos> Make it stop, we have to wait!<eos> There's no stopping, there's no waiting!<eos> I'm scared, Frances, I'm scared, I'm scared I'm going to die,<eos> I'm scared I'm dying, I'm dying!<eos> No, look at me.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Now, listen.<eos> You are not going to die, I won't let it happen.<eos> I simply won't!
And Daniel Lee thought he'd have time to swap it out, but little did he know,<eos> you were gonna kill his patient.<eos> You actually listen to this person?<eos> He had a hard time convincing us, too, until Dr. Kinder gave you up.<eos> See, he had priors.<eos> And he wasn't too eager to take his chances in front of a jury again.<eos> Any evidence you have is circumstantial at best.<eos> That's okay by me.<eos> If we keep digging...<eos> And we will...
Keep it local. Don't let the Feds in on this one.<eos> Look, I'm out of here tonight, so I'm gonna have to dump this one on you guys.<eos> We got you.<eos> Hey, Nick, you be careful over there.<eos> What he said.<eos> Will do.<eos> You got to take care of Mommy while I'm gone.<eos> Here.<eos> You better come back.<eos> I will.
Actually...<eos> You can do something.<eos> If something bothers you having to do with Phenomene, you come to me.<eos> Tell me something's up.<eos> OK?<eos> Agreed.<eos> Even if we split up.<eos> Does that mean we're together?<eos> You will tell me.<eos> I will.
But you, Seth Gecko... you'll do just fine.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> It's the suit, right?<eos> Well, you can have it.<eos> Yeah, I think it'll look, uh, a lot nicer than that late-'90s trench coat you're wearing.<eos> I'm afraid your brother might not be joining us.<eos> I can see him through Zolo's eyes. Burning, burning in the desert sun.<eos> We might smell his ashes in the wind.<eos> It's too bad you won't be seeing Amaru's true beauty.<eos> But I will... through your eyes.
Is that what La Diosa teaches you?<eos> Defiance?<eos> Jesus, man.<eos> What the fuck are you?<eos> A messenger.<eos> To stop a plague like Santanico, you can't just destroy the source.<eos> You have to incinerate every single soul she's infected.<eos> Yo, man, how 'bout you suck my...<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
And when it's dead... you two will leave, and never come back.<eos> CULEBRA WOMAN: Nobody is safe any more.<eos> Araseli.<eos> That's a pretty name.<eos> So, the man who came here was after the culebra priest that runs this den?<eos> (breath trembling) First, they destroy our leaders.<eos> Now they're going after our faith.<eos> (sobbing) He said La Diosa was a plague.<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
That motherfucker said we're going back to work for him to pay him back.<eos> You want to get back to hustling?<eos> I have to.<eos> How exactly are you planning on pulling it off living with a fed?<eos> You're gonna have to wake up with her every morning... and lie to her, lie to her all God damn day, lie to her every night.<eos> It's never gonna fucking work.<eos> So you're saying I can't pull it off?<eos> No, she took you back because she thought that you was clean.<eos> As soon as she finds out that you got back in the game, she gonna turn you in.<eos> No, she won't.
- Nothing, nothing.<eos> Just be better another night, okay?<eos> Is this about Riggs?<eos> Can you...<eos> I'm not getting into it.<eos> Everything doesn't need to be talked about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> So another time you will call me, and we'll go out.<eos> But you won't, will you?
How does it work?<eos> It's quite complicated.<eos> Ahem. Erm...electromagnetic waves.<eos> When Marconi stumbled upon the radio, he reported hearing anomalous sounds and voices.<eos> And you believe those were spirits?<eos> If we can find the right frequency, I believe we can open the door to the other side.<eos> It was my understanding you had already made contact.<eos> I did. I did.<eos> However, I was unable to replicate my results.<eos> But I will.
You two were in a relationship, and when you found out that it was her that wrote that email, you went up to Cambridge and convinced her to go to Argentina for the duration of the trial.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> Am I?<eos> You flew to Boston three times in the last two weeks.<eos> You took two cabs to her house and another to within 100 feet of the admissions office.<eos> You have no proof of anything.<eos> I don't need proof.<eos> Because while she may be in Argentina now, she's not gonna stay there forever, which means when she gets back, I get you for witness tampering.<eos> Do me a favor and leave me the hell alone.<eos> I will.
They think I'm taking away your future.<eos> You are my future.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> I am not saying that I don't want to get married.<eos> I'm just saying that if for some reason I was responsible for taking away your dream...<eos> That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> Of course I will.
Thank you for the tip, Raymond.<eos> The families, theirs and ours, we're getting together tomorrow.<eos> It'd be nice to have a friendly face.<eos> I'd rather die than have an Eriksson touch my little girl.<eos> So would I.<eos> But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.
Code red!<eos> Code red!<eos> All units, please respond.<eos> We're under heavy fire.<eos> Bearcat, don't dismount there.<eos> Shut it down.<eos> - Wait, who the hell are these guys?<eos> - We can't be late.<eos> We gotta find them.<eos> Yeah, and we will, just not now.
It feels so good.<eos> Adam is right-handed.<eos> You have to remember that.<eos> You can't use your left hand for anything again.<eos> This isn't gonna work.<eos> It will, it will.<eos> We just...<eos> We have to practice and cover everything.<eos> Well, w-what if they don't believe me?<eos> They will.
Want to play?<eos> My name is Adam Warren!<eos> Help us!<eos> Help me!<eos> I tried that.<eos> No one can hear us.<eos> Someone saw him take me.<eos> You can be red this time.<eos> They're gonna find us.<eos> No, they won't.
My name is Adam Warren!<eos> Help us!<eos> Help me!<eos> I tried that.<eos> No one can hear us.<eos> Someone saw him take me.<eos> You can be red this time.<eos> They're gonna find us.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yes, they will.
Well, she's sick and she doesn't like you...<eos> For now.<eos> I'm Switzerland here.<eos> But you did call her out for telling everyone about Tony before you.<eos> - Not everyone-everyone.<eos> - No recap needed.<eos> I was there.<eos> Just try getting in touch, - see if she responds to you.<eos> - Uh, hello?<eos> Of course she will.
It's global thermonuclear war.<eos> What about Miranda and Ryan?<eos> We find the nuke, we find them.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> "Stay out of sight"?<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I got to fix this.<eos> And we will, Simon.
Okay.<eos> If you're ever in deep shit, all right, you take this notebook, and you take it to Don Epifanio, and you trade it for your life, all right?<eos> Don't trust Batman.<eos> Go to Don Epifanio.<eos> What's in it?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> All right, I mean it. Just... just... just don't read it, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> So he'll help you out.<eos> He will.
She's gonna be coming for me.<eos> I need to find some salt.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Am I in danger?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Witch.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> John, John, John... didn't I blow you up with a motorbike?<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't take.<eos> This one will.
Would you like to see that?<eos> W-Well...<eos> I would love that, but...<eos> I have responsibilities here.<eos> An ailing child.<eos> Husband.<eos> Ah, a husband.<eos> Well... it would appear a better man than I has won.<eos> But I am in port quite often... should that ever change.<eos> It... it won't.
I will see if my people have heard anything.<eos> Mommy?<eos> Sorry, babe.<eos> They're coming.<eos> - Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!<eos> - Get in the truck!<eos> Come on!<eos> You know what to do.<eos> S, they can't find anything.<eos> They won't.
I've never been this far north.<eos> It's amazing!<eos> Have you thought about how insane you are?<eos> Jumping in a chopper to a mad scientist's private island?<eos> Dude, we are mad scientists.<eos> Don't be a hater.<eos> Now you're really scaring me.<eos> Where's your sense of adventure, Scott?<eos> I just want you to find a cure.<eos> We will.
What if we created a blastocyst?<eos> We'd need fertilizable Leda eggs.<eos> and Castor sperm from Ira.<eos> Where are you gonna get the eggs from?<eos> The only problem is we don't have the resources to do it... alone.<eos> I want to work with Sarah Manning and the others to restore you as the head of Neolution.<eos> Are you sure you can work with Sarah?<eos> I look forward to it.<eos> I just want you to find a cure.<eos> We will.
Mary?<eos> - Any idea where?<eos> - I just know that house wouldn't sell because the town's economy is so crap.<eos> Tisdale?<eos> That would make sense.<eos> Kendra's from there.<eos> You got to find her before they do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> We will.
- I was outside taking a call from my agent.<eos> - Is that usual during a show?<eos> Not in my experience.<eos> - Did anyone see you outside?<eos> - I certainly heard her.<eos> Oh, that's brilliant!<eos> Well, I fly out of here tomorrow, so I can be there by Thursday.<eos> My agent's number.<eos> Call her and check.<eos> We will.
Please don't go.<eos> Just come with me.<eos> You can't make it -- I'm just gonna go home.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> You shouldn't go.<eos> But I can't stop you.<eos> They'll see you.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
I got my own shit to take care of, and I don't need you pushing me at these people as some saviour or destroyer or whatever.<eos> I ripped the throat out of my little girl as soon as I turned.<eos> She was five.<eos> And my wife tried to save the baby, but I reached in and I pulled his heart right out of his chest, right in her arms.<eos> But I didn't kill her.<eos> I left her there with them.<eos> Pieces of her children all around her.<eos> You're right.<eos> You deserve to die.<eos> And I will.
Yeah.<eos> These things down here...<eos> I need a minute.<eos> Susan, listen.<eos> If something happens, ok, if we get split up or whatever and you find Dylan before me, I just... I need you...<eos> I need you to tell her that I'm alive. Ok?<eos> And that I'm searching for her.<eos> And that I will find her.<eos> Ok?<eos> I will.
- Barry, listen to me.<eos> You waited for me for years.<eos> You let me get to a place where this was possible.<eos> So I am telling you I am gonna do the same thing for you.<eos> Wherever you need to go, whatever you need to do, do it.<eos> And when you get back, I'll be here.<eos> - okay.<eos> - I love you, Barry.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> And I always will.
We had an agreement, oh son of Israel. Yes.<eos> You were going to tell me everything.<eos> What are you talking about, Golda?<eos> Why did three men just kidnap Aleksandre Iosava?<eos> What?<eos> You did not tell me about that.<eos> The hell are you talking about, Golda?<eos> You have microphones, I'm sure, and I know better than to say anything incriminating.<eos> Instead, I will walk away.<eos> You will, too.
Jesus.<eos> That's a first.<eos> You always have this effect on people?<eos> Where's Travis?<eos> I need to see him.<eos> Connor's pretty serious about his procedures.<eos> - If I got caught--<eos> - We won't.<eos> We won't get caught.<eos> We won't.
- Oh, hey, Marjorie.<eos> - Hello, ma'am.<eos> If I lose, I lose.<eos> Teddy Roosevelt lost.<eos> John Adams lost.<eos> Winston Churchill lost.<eos> So plenty of presidents have lost and gone on to do great, great things.<eos> Are we done, sweetie?<eos> - I can't fucking lose this thing.<eos> - You won't.
- Hello, ma'am.<eos> If I lose, I lose.<eos> Teddy Roosevelt lost.<eos> John Adams lost.<eos> Winston Churchill lost.<eos> So plenty of presidents have lost and gone on to do great, great things.<eos> Are we done, sweetie?<eos> - I can't fucking lose this thing.<eos> - You won't.<eos> You won't.
You got a hammer?<eos> You cut the drug, you increase the inventory.<eos> Yeah, that's the idea.<eos> The high is more immediate when you crush the pills and shorter.<eos> - They'll know we have tampered.<eos> - Yeah, they won't care.<eos> All they'll know is that they're getting higher faster.<eos> And that's the magic.<eos> - But if they suspect--<eos> - They won't.
If she didn't take the truck, we'll find her here in some state.<eos> If she did, she had a destination.<eos> Or she ran scared and is alone.<eos> I made a promise to Daniel.<eos> You can forget that one.<eos> Focus on what's in the here and now.<eos> I am.<eos> Ofelia chose to go.<eos> She didn't think we were gonna make it.<eos> We will.
No, it doesn't really make sense.<eos> But, uh, why don't we skip the beach this time and do something different for a change, like go to the Getty in L.A.?<eos> It's a museum, let's see some art.<eos> Why?<eos> Nah, nah, let's stick to the beach.<eos> They have art there.<eos> They have that lady that paints bikinis on the girls.<eos> Yeah, I'm so stoked.<eos> And I promise this time I'm not gonna oversleep and miss it.<eos> You probably will.
I'm j-just gonna say that he passed away.<eos> Father Benedict asked if, uh, someone was gonna speak at the service.<eos> Well, that's up to you.<eos> Well, I'd... be too emotional, too sappy.<eos> Dad would hate that.<eos> I thought you might like to do it.<eos> I don't think that I'm the guy to get up and talk about Dad.<eos> Maybe Erin or Shane.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
Yes or no?<eos> That this is paradise.<eos> It ain't.<eos> _<eos> Who is your savior?<eos> Jesus is my savior.<eos> Who is your Lord?<eos> Jesus is Lord.<eos> Do you promise to live as follower of the Holy Spirit?<eos> I will.
Justice has finally come for your friend.<eos> Pray it hasn't come for you, too.<eos> Why don't you lose your mask?<eos> You're not as scary as you think.<eos> Twelve hours from the exact time the last alien was kidnapped to his time of death.<eos> Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> -We have to find her.<eos> -And we will.
Dean, stop. Mildred!<eos> Stop.<eos> Ohh.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> So...<eos> How do you feel?<eos> It felt like... Just another kill.<eos> It didn't bring my parents back.<eos> Nothing will.
Okay, here we go.<eos> - Hold him.<eos> - I got him.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's the first time I've ever done this.<eos> Well, how do we know if it works?<eos> Supposedly, the mask is just gonna come off and be released from the possessed and return to its natural form, I think.<eos> Well, what if it takes, like, hours?<eos> It won't.
- More detail.<eos> - So, we start with this.<eos> - Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - He's here!<eos> Don't rush, darling.<eos> It'll take him an hour to get to the front door.<eos> And then an hour to get through the bloody thing!<eos> Now, don't forget the two things we discussed.<eos> - I won't.
Silencio!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Este hombre es un...<eos> How do you say "pedophile" in Spanish?<eos> ...pedofilo!<eos> Cuff him.<eos> Now, I know the rest of you are all law-abiding citizens who don't violate children, Let's go, move.<eos> so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.<eos> This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.<eos> Of course it will.
Why stir up trouble?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry to be late. I went to the Russian bakery to get those little black-and-white cookies that you love.<eos> The lady in front of me bought the last ones.<eos> Oh, no. It worked out, 'cause, apparently, she was buying 'em for you.<eos> Who wants a cookie?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Ooh, I'll have a cookie.<eos> No, I won't.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I got nervous, and... I- - I apologize.<eos> No need to apologize.<eos> So the cognitive therapy--<eos> It's going well.<eos> I've been symptom-free.<eos> I just...got nervous, and it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Do you know what happens to obstinate daughters who disobey their fathers?<eos> Do you know what happens to vampires who strike down one of the brotherhood of the five?<eos> You are one of the five?<eos> If you kill him, you'll be afflicted with the hunter's curse.<eos> Plagued by madness and driven to take your own life.<eos> Well, that does create quite a conundrum.<eos> If I spare your life, then you'll never cease trying to end mine.<eos> Oh, I have another solution.<eos> I will not kill your father.<eos> You will.
Wow that's amazing.<eos> How daring.<eos> How could you just say anything?<eos> There's something that I couldn't say.<eos> Let's say something that we couldn't say.<eos> Be fair and alphabetically.<eos> You should go first since your name is Kang Mo Yeon.<eos> The person that wants to hear it should go first though.<eos> Nope. It's ladies first.<eos> If not then it will by age.
Mr. Smith, we came in here on good faith.<eos> You came in here because you assume you can work the system.<eos> Unlike Manhattan, Miss Reagan, we don't have a hierarchy here.<eos> In the Bronx, we decide indictments based on the merits of the case, not the last name of the defendants.<eos> Then let's let the merits of the case decide the outcome.<eos> Let's go, Nicky, we're done here.<eos> Wait, Mom...<eos> No.<eos> I'll make a statement.<eos> No, you won't.
I suggest focusing all your attention on sealing<eos> That door.<eos> Gareth... this is your last chance.<eos> No.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Out the way!<eos> This is it.<eos> We're going to die.<eos> Richard, stand behind me.<eos> I will not.
It's wrong.<eos> Look at it.<eos> - The dimensions are off.<eos> - You gave us the dimensions!<eos> It looks like a fucking IKEA schematic to build a credenza.<eos> I gave you an estimate.<eos> Use the original.<eos> Borns Tech has it.<eos> We haven't found it yet in the discovery,<eos> - but we will.
It's just this feeling I have, Flynn.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> Call it "Guardian's intuition."<eos> Well, I think that you are worrying for no reason... whatsoever.<eos> Ya think?<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> How did it just explode like that?<eos> It must have been trying to tell us something important.<eos> Now we'll never know.<eos> Sure we will.

- Seriously.<eos> Oh, I would rather keep playing birthday parties.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You're very good.<eos> I have a daughter of my own.<eos> Adopted from China last year.<eos> And she loves it.<eos> But, again, it's our song.<eos> And we have to warn you, Rowby, that, um, we'll be pulling your video off-line.<eos> No, you won't.
- Why not?<eos> You fired me.<eos> And I've never worked there.<eos> We want you back.<eos> And we want you to come with her.<eos> Diane does?<eos> Well, she understands the situation.<eos> Thank you, but I'm not interested.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Listen, um, I guess he told you I'm an attorney.<eos> We really need your help.<eos> You see, we're going to have to get Ned on the stand.<eos> And the other side, they're going to want to use this videotape.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> - They can do that?<eos> - Of course they can.<eos> And they will.
Yeah, I did, and apparently now she's not responding.<eos> - Mouse...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ping that phone right now.<eos> - I want a location.<eos> - Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> We need that ID.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you find them?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
You take a walk and get some fresh air.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm not asking you.<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> If anything occurs, you'll contact me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Type in your number.<eos> This is more than a job to me.<eos> If something happens to Carlos...<eos> Nothing will.
You just shot someone, Milly.<eos> We have to protect you now.<eos> You can't tell anyone about this.<eos> Here, take it.<eos> Take it.<eos> If nothing else, Daddy's killer got what she deserved.<eos> You must not tell the inspector this.<eos> Why not?<eos> At least if I confess to killing the woman, Mummy and Grandpa will be let go because Inspector Mallory will know who really murdered my father. - Yes.<eos> Yes, he will.
What did you do that for?<eos> Well, everything we needed was right before our eyes.<eos> What we saw in the woods, and at the funeral, it was all theatre.<eos> Alexander wasn't dead.<eos> We buried an empty coffin.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting Alexander's things for him.<eos> Stop it.<eos> He'll need them.<eos> He won't, Ian.
I think that's obvious.<eos> It fell down from my hair.<eos> Good thing you found it and not those TSA party poopers.<eos> My phone. Where?<eos> Where it it?<eos> Oh, I put it here in your front pocket.<eos> Oh, cool, there's never room there when I wear it.<eos> See, Max, I knew he'd call you.<eos> - Well, he said he would.<eos> - And he will.
- How's the bird?<eos> - Oh, he's a lot better.<eos> He's been flapping his wings a little bit.<eos> I think he's trying to tell me he's ready to fly again.<eos> Like us.<eos> Shall we take him on my balcony and set him free?<eos> I'd love that.<eos> You know, after this, it's just gonna be the two of us again.<eos> Maybe we'll finally get that happy ending after all.<eos> I will... we will.
Actually, once you're in prison, whatever you did to get there doesn't really matter.<eos> They use the carrot of the Honor Block to encourage good behavior.<eos> He's not capable of good behavior.<eos> He did make one show of good faith.<eos> He knows something about our girls?<eos> Siobhan Kelly, the patient at his urgent care center...<eos> He suggested you check truck stops outside of Gary.<eos> - I'll loop in Voight.<eos> - And he may know more, but he's not going to say anything until he's transferred.<eos> Of course he won't.
I'm gonna go download with the Academy Commissioner.<eos> You guys head over to Bardot's dorm room.<eos> There's got to be a clue here as to who his killer is.<eos> Hi, Deputy Commissioner Malone.<eos> I'm Captain Kate Beckett.<eos> Captain, nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're a bit of a legend around these parts.<eos> Recruits have been gunning for your records since I got here five years ago.<eos> So far, no one's gotten close.<eos> Yeah, well, they will.
Guide me.<eos> I feel quite... unanchored without you.<eos> Yes, but it's what we agreed to do, to help your sister.<eos> Then we shall be free.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> That's me off.<eos> See you when you're back from the tour in... 23 weeks.<eos> - Well, call me if you need anything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You won't, of course.
Well, look who it is.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Not here.<eos> Six fucking months.<eos> No explanation, no warning.<eos> You couldn't pick up a phone? You couldn't write a letter?<eos> Did you ever stop to think how that would feel to her?<eos> I...<eos> I have a lot to explain.<eos> And I will.
- Let's see.<eos> Unanswered calls and texts,<eos> - except for the odd cryptic emoji...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I've been<eos> - so crazy...<eos> - Saying things like "I have been so crazy."<eos> - I'll call you later?<eos> - Saying things like "I'll call you later."<eos> I really will.
- Saying things like "I'll call you later."<eos> I really will.<eos> I thought we liked each other.<eos> Even talked about me meeting your family, if I recall.<eos> We do like each other.<eos> Honestly, I just...<eos> I have to go.<eos> Right, well, I'll, uh... let you get on with it, then.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> No, I won't, will I?
I-i just...<eos> I just want to see you, care.<eos> I want to see you, too.<eos> But... It's kind of a war zone over here right now, and...<eos> Alaric really...<eos> He needs you.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I get it.<eos> Ah... Well, we'll-we'll figure it out once this huntress thing is over.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
It shows us the exact location of every device in the world connected to the Internet, including that camera you're staring into.<eos> And we can use the Shodan Map to find you, but I'm gonna need the make and model of that camera.<eos> The only person who can get me that information is you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Grace, we need you to try and reach the camera and give us the make and model.<eos> That information will help us find you.<eos> But, Avery, I would have to drop the switch.<eos> - I mean, wouldn't that kill me?<eos> - No.<eos> No, Grace, it won't.
_<eos> Agent Ramos recommends four weeks' psych leave.<eos> And you know I don't take his evaluations lightly.<eos> You were also there.<eos> I was in my room.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> You were smack in the middle.<eos> You owe yourself some time.<eos> I can't go away for a month.<eos> I won't.
I don't see Hector here, I walk.<eos> Yeah, you said that.<eos> I got this kid painting my house right now.<eos> Chico.<eos> Working hard, ten hours a day, saving every penny... you know why?<eos> To watch your brother's fight from his little shit box apartment in Boyle Heights.<eos> Hector means something to these people.<eos> He's an icon.<eos> Now, you think little Chico is going to be able to process all the things that you want to spout off about?<eos> He won't.
Sonia and I are the same size.<eos> - Similar cheekbones too. - Mm-hmm.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I put on her clothes, I do my hair, I get in her car, that dickbag follows me, and I'll take him somewhere quiet.<eos> And then what?<eos> You know what.<eos> You know, she actually does look a lot like her.<eos> What if he gets the drop on you?<eos> He won't.
Me, too.<eos> Except I'm in San Francisco right now.<eos> In case you're wondering, it's work stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> All good.<eos> I really ruined both our Valentine's.<eos> You know what? You really did.<eos> You have no idea how much.<eos> Well, maybe when I... get back to the Island in a couple days, you'll let me make it up to you.<eos> Maybe I will.
Looks like Chisel Chin, Jr.<eos> Will just have to go to bed without what I can imagine are terribly dull bedtime stories.<eos> Cruella, why are you doing this?<eos> Is this because I won't write you back to life?<eos> No, Henry darling.<eos> I'm not the one that ordered all the phones to be ripped out down here.<eos> Hades.<eos> Well, with all you heroes running around, the place he feels has a little too much hope bubbling up in his realm.<eos> Well, you can tell him it's gonna take a lot more than ripping out phones to discourage us.<eos> I will.
- Okay.<eos> Wolfie?<eos> Kansas.<eos> You left without saying anything.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I couldn't lose you to Zelena.<eos> Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.<eos> You didn't.<eos> You came back for me.<eos> I always will.
When you take her hand to kiss it, you must look deep into her eyes, as if you are going to drown in them, like this.<eos> You know, I will never be able to match your skill in this area, Ernst.<eos> Perhaps you should marry her, instead of me.<eos> Well, she is exactly my type: small and with...<eos> Every woman is your type, Ernst.<eos> But you will have to find someone else.<eos> It is Albert's destiny to marry Victoria.<eos> I'm not sure Victoria agrees.<eos> And she is the one who has to propose.<eos> And she will.
(SIGHS) It's times like this I miss old Lisbeth.<eos> (SCOFFS) "Shift"?<eos> There's so much work to be done with my brand and such, I need round-the-clock assistance.<eos> Mm. You're afraid to stay alone in this apartment, aren't you?<eos> - First, it's a condo!<eos> - Okay. Second, I have a gun in my purse, so no.<eos> Okay, just come to the Haunted Hester party with us tonight.<eos> We can all hang out. Thanks, but I'm live-tweeting my trick-or-treaters, so if you'll excuse me, I'm on the clock for sundown.<eos> Well, if you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
It could be a family friend.<eos> No, no one.<eos> It could even be your dad.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, you can tell me.<eos> There is something that he does.<eos> Really bothers me.<eos> I wish he didn't have to work so much.<eos> But don't tell him that.<eos> I won't.
Not when you see what Daesh does.<eos> Chama?<eos> Let me hold you.<eos> It'll take a long time to forget.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> Let me go.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I won't let you go!<eos> I won't!
I'm... I'm really sorry about the way things ended.<eos> Hey, don't be.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, I'd like to make it up to you.<eos> Really, it's okay.<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> I mean, when I said "I thought a lot about things," I thought a lot about things so, um...<eos> How about dinner?<eos> Okay, I'll call you.<eos> No, you won't.
Hey, don't be.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, I'd like to make it up to you.<eos> Really, it's okay.<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> I mean, when I said "I thought a lot about things," I thought a lot about things so, um...<eos> How about dinner?<eos> Okay, I'll call you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> No, you won't...
It does look bad, Chief.<eos> You know you want this.<eos> I mean, it's the same M.O. as Kristi.<eos> Same M.O. as the other victim we found, too.<eos> - The one who won't testify.<eos> - Kristi will testify.<eos> You sure you want to walk into a court with an online ranter as your only witness?<eos> I can talk to her again, See if she's up for it.<eos> You know what?<eos> We both will.
But he'll be okay.<eos> Must be nice.<eos> That wasn't...<eos> Corbin wasn't a killer.<eos> I know.<eos> He did it for me.<eos> Michelle, this is gonna be very hard.<eos> But you will be okay.<eos> And, eventually... eventually you'll get back to normal.<eos> No, I won't.
And I asked him about it the other day, but...<eos> - But what?<eos> - He said he lost it.<eos> - What does it matter anyway, though?<eos> - Actually, it doesn't matter.<eos> I'm just tying up loose ends.<eos> Boring cop shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, remind me not to become a boring cop.<eos> I will.
Dad, you called Speaker Thomas<eos> "dangerously ignorant."<eos> In what context is that not inflammatory?<eos> I thought you said it was "brave."<eos> I'd stick with brave.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And what I said was changing effective police policy without regard to the fallout is "dangerously ignorant."<eos> You didn't think the Speaker could read between the lines?<eos> I never attached a name to it.<eos> Well, I will.
Louis here is gonna walk you over to Momo's Tires and get you settled.<eos> - Wait, it's a tire store?<eos> - Buh-bye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What, Michel?<eos> At least you were nicer than you were to Anthony Bourdain.<eos> Bourdain parked in Sookie's spot.<eos> Now once again, we have an empty kitchen.<eos> We will find a full-time chef.<eos> - No, we won't.
- Wait, it's a tire store?<eos> - Buh-bye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What, Michel?<eos> At least you were nicer than you were to Anthony Bourdain.<eos> Bourdain parked in Sookie's spot.<eos> Now once again, we have an empty kitchen.<eos> We will find a full-time chef.<eos> - No, we won't.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- You're doing it.<eos> - We're thinking about it.<eos> Exciting!<eos> I just hope it works.<eos> A baby would really help everything.<eos> - We want cake!<eos> - Coming.<eos> Take it.<eos> Who's gonna help me light the candles?<eos> - I will, I will!
Same as always.<eos> I love that you have a friend named Didi.<eos> Makes you sound so Fridays on ABC.<eos> Have you spoken to Grandma lately?<eos> - Why?<eos> - It's been quiet regarding the blowup.<eos> - I've been busy.<eos> - You should call her.<eos> - De-ice this situation.<eos> - I will.
He did make it look cool though, right?<eos> - No.<eos> - What's the big deal?<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> No. You're in pain.<eos> This is uncharted territory.<eos> If it might help, what's the harm?<eos> - I'll think about it.<eos> - Okay. But really consider it.<eos> - I will.
Definitely.<eos> - So nice to meet you.<eos> - Here's my cell.<eos> The Talk piece was great.<eos> Really.<eos> - Thanks, Jim. Denise.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> - You, too.<eos> - Don't lose the card.<eos> - I won't.
- That hardly looks like dinner.<eos> - I agree.<eos> Rory, that's food you eat at the carnival or in a Turkish prison.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> - But...<eos> - Listen, just leave it up to me.<eos> You guys go back into the living room, and I'll call you when it's ready.<eos> Well, Damon, it's a very impressive résumé.<eos> And here are my references, in case you need them.<eos> Oh, we will.
Maybe you never will.<eos> You're off to a pretty bad start.<eos> - Mm. - Soon, no one, no one will want to play with you.<eos> I think this young lady might have something for you.<eos> La Fenice, midnight.<eos> Maestro, my hero.<eos> She's here.<eos> She appears to be happy. She's ready to rehearse.<eos> We will have a great concert, an historic event.<eos> Yes, Beppi, we will, we will.
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night.<eos> It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member.<eos> - It was her fault.<eos> - It was his fault.<eos> No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.<eos> Mr. Wood, please.<eos> Give me another chance.<eos> No, give me another chance.<eos> I will find Phillip's killer.<eos> She won't.
Hmm.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Yes, you've arranged payment with... with my stepfather.<eos> I understand and... and... and very much appreciate you doing that.<eos> Everyone here has been so very thoughtful and kind, uh, but I'm leaving, and so I will just go and prepare the necessary paperwork.<eos> - Norman.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Have you told Dr. Edwards your wishes?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I will.
It's a joke, dude.<eos> Lighten up.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry if you're homesick.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not homesick, Julian.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?<eos> He will.
Lighten up.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry if you're homesick.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not homesick, Julian.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?<eos> He will.<eos> No, he won't.
I think he's doing much better.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, I guess you just... you have to do what you have to do.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Romero still there?<eos> No.<eos> He moved out.<eos> You... you haven't told Norman about him yet.<eos> I will, honey.
I cannot apologize enough for what happened in St. Louis. The way Bill and I left you hanging with all those reporters.<eos> It was just, well...<eos> Don't make me relive it.<eos> Well, the good news is we're back on our feet, and we're days away from having this whole trial business behind us.<eos> A white wine, please, and for the lady...<eos> A white wine as well.<eos> Our lawyer, Bram Keller... He thinks that this trial could be as important as Scopes.<eos> Didn't Scopes lose?<eos> He did. Yes.<eos> But we won't.
I'm hoping you can say something to make sense of all this.<eos> Well, you have to know you're the last person I wanted to hurt.<eos> Just me you're worried about?<eos> What about Art?<eos> What about the people who trusted you enough to hire you?<eos> You know as well as I do the world of sexual therapy is exploding. It's changing by the minute.<eos> Bill and Virginia are trying to hold on to something that is already slipping from their grasp.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> And it won't work, what you're trying to do.<eos> Of course it will.
There's no way I can do this on my own.<eos> - Of course you can.<eos> - No, you haven't seen him do it.<eos> He's brilliant, okay, and so precise.<eos> I just needed more time.<eos> You can do this, Jackson.<eos> April, what if I can't?<eos> What if I make her worse?<eos> This woman's counting on me, and I promised that I could help.<eos> Then you will.
- Of course.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> Okay, so, now are you going to call David?<eos> You're a nag.<eos> I kicked your cancer.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I need another month.<eos> One more month, and I get my diploma.<eos> Also, one more round of chemo, and then they take my headphone jack out.<eos> And then I will.
Guns at the ready?<eos> Vercoe... would you mind?<eos> More light!<eos> Are you shivering, my precious?<eos> Perhaps we should go inside before you catch a chill.<eos> They let you go!<eos> Finally.<eos> Now I must go to Caroline.<eos> Pray God she'll understand.<eos> Of course she will.
Soldiers!<eos> So was he killed?<eos> Or did he do the job hisself?<eos> Reckon we'll never know.<eos> Mistress Poldark was reassured?<eos> I believe so.<eos> I wonder she does not remarry.<eos> A husband could offer her more protection.<eos> He could.<eos> And he will.
Okay.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> Doing all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Brody?<eos> Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing.<eos> And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
We've known each other since we were children.<eos> Well, you've not known me.<eos> Not any of you!<eos> There's no Gresham or Thorne who would call themselves a friend of Louis Scatcherd!<eos> Sir Louis, there is no man living who understands more clearly the pain you're feeling.<eos> No. No, no.<eos> No pity!<eos> I forbid it!<eos> I will not let you pity me!<eos> I will not!
I've already qualified for the free.<eos> Yes, YOU have.<eos> Martin's still got 0.2 to shave off and only a week to do it.<eos> Put out a bulletin, why don't you?<eos> We all know you can swim 53.04.<eos> You did it last year.<eos> It's your head that's the problem.<eos> You need the adrenaline of the race.<eos> You'll qualify for sure.<eos> Yeah, of course he will.
It's already causing problems.<eos> Julio was late last week because of your little home visit. what's next?<eos> Well, i'll tell you.<eos> He'll be running off to the school. He'll be going to the doctor's office In the middle of the day,<eos> Leaving us all here holding the bag.<eos> How many more kids are you going to dump on us?<eos> I thought you liked rusty.<eos> I do, but that's the problem.<eos> He is an enormous emotional distraction. You think julio's priorities will change?<eos> Well, of course they will,
I would be happy to do it.<eos> Oh, yes, I'm sure you would be.<eos> The fact is, if the doctor is on to something, this place that they told him about, this Storybrooke... could be the answer we're looking for.<eos> You mean it?<eos> You think this could be the place?<eos> I think that we have been trapped in this land for far too long.<eos> It's time that we found ourselves a home.<eos> And so... I shall allow the doctor to go through with his plan, but I'm going to make one small alteration.<eos> The doctor isn't the only one who will be going to this Storybrooke.<eos> We all will.
Yeah, but who cares now? It's stupid.<eos> I mean, I'm just gonna look like a copycat.<eos> Matt?<eos> What?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, this obviously didn't go the way that I planned, but nothing about us has.<eos> I love you.<eos> And that is one thing that has not changed.<eos> And it never will.
I'm sorry...<eos> I thought you were just leaving.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was in prison.<eos> The worst part about it was the loneliness.<eos> It sucked.<eos> Especially for a guy like you, who likes to talk so much.<eos> So, you can either tell me what you know... or I'll walk out of here, and I will not come back with wine.<eos> I just won't come back.<eos> Nobody will.
Well, he paid me six months in advance, and it's been seven now.<eos> Do you... do you know if he had any family?<eos> I never saw any personally, but he said he had a nephew in, um...<eos> Arizona?<eos> That sounds right.<eos> Well, uh, it was good to meet you, Bonnie.<eos> You too.<eos> Why don't you keep that plaque?<eos> Don't look like nobody else gonna want it.<eos> Maybe I will.
Ali's the one who needs help now.<eos> No, he's not gonna get away with this.<eos> Elliott will pay for what he did to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You've been in here a while.<eos> Yeah, I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what these medications do.<eos> I really think we need to talk about what happened this morning.<eos> We will.
Or did you forget that?<eos> Too busy leading your reverse "It's a Wonderful Life"?<eos> Reverse, huh?<eos> That's irony for you.<eos> So, uh, what should we call this, uh, brave new world that you've whipped up for us?<eos> I was thinking...<eos> Flashpoint.<eos> So you don't want this?<eos> You may have figured out a way to dampen my speed with this glass cage, but I will get out of here and I will destroy your life, Flash, one way or the other.<eos> No, you won't.
Michael, stop.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Just go.<eos> Seriously.<eos> We had one good night, and I was wasted.<eos> And our sober interactions have been pretty terrible.<eos> If you really mean that...<eos> If you really want me to walk away...<eos> Say the words...<eos> I will.
Too cute.<eos> Anyone want to help me with my bag?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, new girl.<eos> You coming?<eos> Here's the key to first days, amy. Fit in.<eos> You'll be happier.<eos> You always say that.<eos> I just want you to succeed this time.<eos> I will.
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.<eos> But it's clear whatever you and Strange did to her is making her sick.<eos> Her people are stealing drugs.<eos> But I don't think they're working.<eos> She's gonna come after you.<eos> Or her goons will.
No.<eos> It's not.<eos> Maurice is back on the bottle.<eos> So am I.<eos> Lisa...<eos> He took our money.<eos> All that money that's been coming in from you and Jack... he took it, ran off to Florida with some woman he met a month ago.<eos> Let's get to a meeting right now.<eos> I need to make things right.<eos> You will... we will.
She tried to kill me, Laurel.<eos> Shetellyouthat? Justtellherthis,okay ?<eos> We'reeven.<eos> Wait, don't say anything else.<eos> No need to send any more hit men my way.<eos> Just --<eos> Sorry.<eos> I saw you flirting, and I got jealous, so I told him...to back off.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it will.
And I-I hurt you, and I see that every single day.<eos> So for me to come here just because I'm, like, sad and depressed, that's... not fair.<eos> You can always come to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> Isn't that just selfish, though?<eos> No.<eos> 'Cause I miss you, too.<eos> ...She won't notice.<eos> It's Michaela.<eos> Of course she will.
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> I'm poz.<eos> Thomas isn't ready to date a poz guy.<eos> You can always come to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> She won't notice.<eos> It's Michaela.<eos> Of course she will.
Okay.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Six reports they've come in contact with the lead scientist.<eos> He remains confident in their probability for success.<eos> You're worried.<eos> Of course I'm worried.<eos> In the past, she's been almost invincible.<eos> I mean, I saw her come back from the dead that time she was blasted out the airlock, but that was because of her Nanites.<eos> And now instead of saving her, they're gonna kill her.<eos> No, they won't.
The rest of the crew will no doubt have a hard time believing this.<eos> The rest of the crew is not who I'm worried about.<eos> Are you done?<eos> If you want to run a scan, I can give you the coordinates.<eos> I have no interest in either proving or disproving your lunatic theory.<eos> I'm here for the Drive.<eos> I'm sure you have someone on board who'll be able to confirm it's genuine.<eos> I gave you the device.<eos> I held up my end of the deal.<eos> And so will I.
No, no, not-not that.<eos> Gideon, did you say 36 compartments?<eos> Correct.<eos> The entirety of the ship.<eos> Before Rip, you know, disappeared, he made me learn every inch of the Waverider, and of those inches,<eos> 35 compartments.<eos> So either I miscalculated or-- Captain Hunter had a secret compartment he failed to tell you about.<eos> Gideon, please pull up the schematics of the ship.<eos> No, we still have to fix the time drive.<eos> And we will.
You were glorious and powerful.<eos> My lord has special plans for you,<eos> Caitlin Snow.<eos> Or should I say...<eos> Killer Frost?<eos> Caitlin!<eos> Really?<eos> You brought your toys?<eos> I'm hoping it won't come to that.<eos> It won't.
But they've gone there, which makes me question if what I'm doing is actually effective.<eos> I'm trying to come at things differently.<eos> I'm trying to be more... optimistic for me.<eos> Nah, but it just feels like--<eos> It's one step forward, two steps back.<eos> That's it.<eos> I think that's what's called being in charge.<eos> Heh. The truth is, you're all this city has, so...however you go about your business, just keep doing it the right way.<eos> Even if it takes longer to get the job done, you'll know, and so will the city.<eos> Will they?
This a Homeland Security operation.<eos> - Mmm. - How come nobody notified us?<eos> I'm notifying you now.<eos> As well as your SAC.<eos> Agent Brody came to D.C. under our authority.<eos> She didn't mention it.<eos> Maybe because you didn't ask nicely.<eos> No need walking us out.<eos> You want to tell me what this is about?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I know.<eos> I just wanted to know if you need anything from me.<eos> If I do, I will tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So is that it?<eos> I just, uh...<eos> - I know you're Super Callie but this business with Kyle, this is not your problem.<eos> I know.<eos> I just want you to take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
- Come on!<eos> - Okay, here.<eos> I... I didn't read it all.<eos> I... I couldn't read it all.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Look at you!<eos> Can't believe he did it.<eos> You know? It's one of those things that you talk about for years and years and years, and then it finally happens, and... and...<eos> I have to find a way to pay for it.<eos> We will.
- I'm serious.<eos> Mariana, you can't go see him.<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> God.<eos> Well, then text him.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - No, I'll do it later.<eos> No, you won't.
Couldn't close, huh?<eos> Thank you. Thanks.<eos> Hi, are you interested in foster care reform?<eos> We just, uh, we need some signatures to get our bill on the ballot.<eos> - Uh, yeah, sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Would you also consider donating to help<eos> Kyle Snow get a fair trial?<eos> He was wrongly convicted of murder.<eos> No, I won't.
- So I will see you at work. - Oh!<eos> I have to get Meredith on my side.<eos> People will follow her lead.<eos> - Grey is going to take your side.<eos> - She might side with Arizona.<eos> - They were in a plane crash together.<eos> - You'll be fine.<eos> You're just saying that 'cause you like me.<eos> Today's the day I lose all my friends.<eos> - You won't.
No, you're still living in the same house, but you're not talking to each other, right?<eos> - I'm aware.<eos> - Counseling?<eos> Well, if we go to counseling, then we'll have to talk, and then we'll yell, so not talking is better.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> - Do?<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> - You can't just stay like this.<eos> - Oh, I can stay like this.<eos> And I will.
Too close to call.<eos> All I can say is may the best woman win.<eos> You get a chance to pick up that dry cleaning?<eos> Uh, bottom row. All the way to the left.<eos> Found it.<eos> How late do you think you'll be?<eos> Wish I knew.<eos> Uh, I made some chicken earlier.<eos> I'll... I'll leave it in the fridge for you.<eos> Oh, no you will not.
I'll just have Garrett schedule some sort of conflict to give us both some cover.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay, before we go over the facts of the case once more, I just want to thank you again for doing this.<eos> My grandmother says no good could come of this.<eos> Well, your grandmother loves you, and she's concerned about you, and we can understand...<eos> And we will respectfully disagree with her.<eos> A lot of good will come of this.<eos> Dontrell Tariq will go to prison because of this.<eos> Yeah, well, it won't bring my cousin back.<eos> No, it won't.
Frank?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Boss, you can't do this.<eos> I just did.<eos> It's a mistake.<eos> Says you.<eos> Boss, those cops look forward to this night all year.<eos> You take this away from them, it'll have lasting effects, bad ones.<eos> They'll get over it.<eos> No, they won't.
Hey, Fish.<eos> How you doing?<eos> - Not so good.<eos> - Sorry to hear that.<eos> You know, there's a lot of people out there looking for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need to find that bastard, Strange.<eos> Yeah, well, you know I can't help you with that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> And... you will.
- Yeah, I get it.<eos> The choice is simple, you see.<eos> It's kill one, and the other will go free.<eos> But if your answer to me is "no," a thousand watts into them will go.<eos> Sorry, Jervis.<eos> I'm not killing anyone.<eos> Yes, you will!<eos> Now pick up the pistol and fire!<eos> You want to show me who I really am, then show me.<eos> Oh, I will.
I'm starving.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Jim, I'm outside the scene.<eos> Forensics found tons of prints inside the bathroom where Symon was attacked.<eos> Barnes?<eos> That just means he was in there.<eos> It puts him at the scene.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking. You got to tell Barnes what Symon said.<eos> Give him the right to defend himself.<eos> I will.
He hasn't logged out.<eos> Call the police.<eos> Now.<eos> Jim, Jim.<eos> You're ahead of schedule.<eos> Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.<eos> But I'm not gonna kill you yet.<eos> I do that, you become the martyr, and she'll carry you in her heart forever.<eos> Before I kill you, she has to hate you.<eos> And she will.
You missed Tyler's funeral.<eos> Abandoning your friends in their time of need.<eos> That, my dear, is cold.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I'll still be here.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> Remember, it's not Damon.<eos> This is Damon under the control of a she-devil.<eos> And we have to find a way to break her control.<eos> And we will.
And I wanna do all those things with you!<eos> But I also wanna be a father and have a family.<eos> Come on.<eos> We can be the parents we always wanted.<eos> Open, accepting, theater-camp friendly.<eos> Please, Elliot?<eos> One week!<eos> We'll try it for one week!<eos> - But if she does anything...<eos> - She won't!
Oh, great.<eos> Much better.<eos> I did it to save your life.<eos> After the rebellion, your father was angry.<eos> Deeply angry.<eos> He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
I flew into a rage. Well, if that's the case,<eos> Eric Cooper, you're under arrest...<eos> It was me. It happened all like you said.<eos> Christi...<eos> I'm-I'm the one who did it, not Eric.<eos> I think he did it. You two realize that if you confess to this crime, there's a good chance you both will go to jail?<eos> Whatever we face, we face together.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The one of you who didn't do it, you'll lose everything.<eos> No, we won't.
Save me from what?<eos> Body's right there, Agents.<eos> I can get her prepped to your --<eos> - That's great, Carl.<eos> Uh... We'll take it from here.<eos> Oh?<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, but...it's a weird'un.<eos> If you guys need anything at all, I'm --<eos> We won't. We won't.
And I... [ Sighs ]<eos> Oh.<eos> It was your voice.<eos> And your hair.<eos> And your eyes.<eos> It was everything.<eos> You were everything.<eos> And even when people made fun of me -- younger girls at work, shredding on my Ladyheart tattoos and saying you're a joke --<eos> I never stopped loving you.<eos> And I never will.
But that is no reason for you to...<eos> There's no cure.<eos> There's no cure.<eos> What... What... What are you going...<eos> - What are we going to do?<eos> - We're not going to kill him.<eos> We're not going to kill our son.<eos> But they're going to make us.<eos> A man of your rank, and if we don't, then they are going to take my babies away from me.<eos> - No, they won't.
There's no cure.<eos> What... What... What are you going...<eos> - What are we going to do?<eos> - We're not going to kill him.<eos> We're not going to kill our son.<eos> But they're going to make us.<eos> A man of your rank, and if we don't, then they are going to take my babies away from me.<eos> - No, they won't.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Of course they will.
So, how did the shooter get Lukas's location unless it was a leak?<eos> We should... maybe get out hands on Kamilah's phone records.<eos> Kamilah?<eos> He's not a perp, Helen.<eos> He's a teenager who's in love and he's hurting.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> Is there any news on Lukas?<eos> Not yet.<eos> They're just waiting for him to wake up.<eos> He will.
It's a really big deal.<eos> My dad won't get it.<eos> Rose won't get it.<eos> Well, she already knows.<eos> You told her.<eos> No, she figured it out on her own.<eos> If she knows, she's going to tell everyone.<eos> - No, she said that she won't.<eos> - Yes, she will.<eos> She will.
Well, I've had nightmares before.<eos> This was different.<eos> When I woke up, I couldn't find my boots.<eos> Your boots?<eos> During week one of camp?<eos> Maybe you didn't even bring them.<eos> Look... my first night here, I thought I was seeing things, too.<eos> But the truth was it was in my head because I was upset about something else.<eos> And once I realized that, I stopped seeing them.<eos> You will, too.
One, two, three.<eos> Get out.<eos> Can you tell me your name, sir?<eos> Greg Allen.<eos> Can you tell me how this happened?<eos> Crossing the street.<eos> Wasn't looking.<eos> Will somebody please call my wife?<eos> - The number's in my wallet.<eos> - I will.
Thank you for saving my life.<eos> You are welcome.<eos> So you're gonna be okay?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll be up and at it in no time, you'll see.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey.<eos> This isn't gonna change anything between us, is it?<eos> You're not gonna go all soft and sweet on me?<eos> Oh, I won't.
Turn on the strobes and call it in.<eos> Raider One Three Actual, this is Raider One Three Bravo.<eos> We are at our FFP, over.<eos> Roger that, One Three Bravo.<eos> I see you.<eos> Stay frosty, we'll be there in 90 minutes.<eos> Actual out. Hey, you going?<eos> I'll stay here, keep an eye on things.<eos> Your man will do his job?<eos> Hell, yeah, he will.
I always have good ideas.<eos> I am by far the most creative person in the family!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Okay yourself, guy.<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> I'm... I'm truly sorry.<eos> Let's just forget about it.<eos> I feel like I undersold Bone Day.<eos> Thanks for not trying anything, Steve!<eos> And I never will!
He's a nervous kid.<eos> - But this looks...<eos> - I looked at it.<eos> I saw the labs.<eos> I did my job, now do yours.<eos> I'll keep you posted.<eos> Crap.<eos> You think DeLuca's gonna say anything?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
So this little guy is gonna get to meet his grandma after all.<eos> Take him to the NICU and page Karev.<eos> Um, Karev's in the clinic.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Uh, just take him to the NICU.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Know what?<eos> If Kara's mom would ever forgive her.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Of course she will.
- I'm not here to answer questions.<eos> Did you know that his brain has been eaten by bugs?<eos> Did you know that?<eos> There might be mental illness here.<eos> And we can't aggressively interrogate a subject with delusional disorder, with psychotic symptoms...<eos> In what way is she psychotic?<eos> She thinks her interrogators are bug creatures.<eos> All right, I'll get approval.<eos> You are gonna regret this.<eos> No, you will.

Are you showing off?<eos> I'm just pointing out how tricky it can be to pull off something like this and... yeah, I guess I am.<eos> Worst-case scenario, someone on the other side kills our clones or stops the transfer process midstream.<eos> Then at least we'd know.<eos> And we'd need to come up with another plan.<eos> This plan's fine.<eos> So who's going?<eos> Well, we've got three pods.<eos> - I'll take one.<eos> - No, you won't.
Oh, I love him.<eos> - He is so funny.<eos> - He's a physical comedian.<eos> You can watch him on mute.<eos> - Oh, my God,<eos> - I love Jim Carrey.<eos> He's so watchable.<eos> Yeah. Um...<eos> I'll see y'all at "Selma."<eos> Yes, you will.
I applaud the effort, but I smelled your beard sweat from a hundred yards out.<eos> So, what did you think?<eos> I was just gonna slip up and let you follow me to the stuff?<eos> No.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> But I'm not showing you Jimmy Jack Corn.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> We'll see, all right.<eos> Yeah, we totally will.
S-She's fine.<eos> She's safe thanks to you.<eos> Well, she was in danger thanks to me.<eos> Me, too.<eos> What about yours?<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Once you told me... you wanted me to feel whole.<eos> That you wanted that more than you wanted to be with me.<eos> I couldn't imagine what you meant or who I would be if that happened.<eos> And maybe it never will.
No.<eos> Elliot...<eos> I don't want to shoot you, but I will.<eos> Elliot, listen to him.<eos> He's not holding a gun.<eos> He's not even there.<eos> Elliot, you need to listen to him and step away from the computer!<eos> Touch that keyboard, and I will shoot you.<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
Why shouldn't I finish the job?<eos> Because that's not what April would do.<eos> Majesty, please.<eos> If you would only let me...<eos> You have no idea what I would do.<eos> You have no idea what I'm capable of!<eos> I know exactly what you're capable of.<eos> But you are April because you choose not to do it.<eos> You told me you wouldn't let him break you.<eos> And I won't.
Ah! I'm sorry. You were saying?<eos> Those aren't free, you know.<eos> Do you think I'm not protected in this school?<eos> - I'm dying to find out.<eos> - Enough!<eos> Alright?<eos> Corakinus is attacking us.<eos> Tanya's right.<eos> He won't stop.<eos> No... ..I will not.
Can you explain to us, please, why Dr. Crowley believes that he can get you to give him information?<eos> He was my psychiatrist some time ago.<eos> A psychiatrist knows things, every bit of a person's life. He's saying he'll use that.<eos> Has Dr. Crowley threatened to use something he knows about you?<eos> I came here because, um... What happened to Angela, I--<eos> I had to tell you even though I'm scared of what he might do.<eos> Tell us how Crowley is involved in this, Miss Cannonbury. I don't know.<eos> All I know is what I've told you.<eos> Talk to him. I'm asking you to find that out.<eos> We will.
- This is your fault!<eos> - Hey, hey! - Calm down!<eos> Calm down, calm down!<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I didn't mean for this to happen!<eos> Calm down.<eos> [sobbing] Why haven't you found her?<eos> We will, okay?
Walt?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> They're coming after my job.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> The mayor, the county commissioners.<eos> They're petitioning the governor to have me temporarily suspended.<eos> And then, uh, if I lose my case...<eos> - You won't.
So I'm a murderer now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do realize I'm being asked to testify at your civil trial.<eos> - Is that a threat?<eos> - It's advice.<eos> It's damn good advice.<eos> Unbe-freaking-lievable.<eos> You... You can't even prove the man is dead.<eos> - Have you found his body?<eos> - Not yet, but I will.
I didn't allow them to cremate him today.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Because we might want an autopsy.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Um, I'm...<eos> I'm not sure this is maybe the right place to discuss this.<eos> How about we, uh, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.
- You don't understand.<eos> - I understand plenty.<eos> - No, listen to me.<eos> - No, you listen to me.<eos> That guy was a murdering piece of shit who should've been put away for life, and now you're trying to get him out?<eos> He's in there with Mike Ross.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Well, I do, because like you just said, he is a murdering piece of shit.<eos> But what you don't know is, I made a deal with him, and I'm not gonna break it.<eos> - Then I will.
What were you talking about there?<eos> Did you eat someone out there?<eos> I was just trying to survive.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> All right.<eos> Pack, no one can ever know about this.<eos> They'll think you're a monster!<eos> You have to promise not to tell anyone.<eos> Please!<eos> I will.
Divorce has had a pretty magical effect on you, huh?<eos> You're just making big decisions all over the place now.<eos> Full of fuck-you's for the world.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> And Berkeley High is less than a mile that way.<eos> Uh, that way.<eos> Hey, how bad did Neil fuck up the house?<eos> It's not your problem, sweetie.<eos> It is if it falls down.<eos> It won't.
No, sir.<eos> You won't say a peep.<eos> Not a peep.<eos> I ain't forgot you led the police here and took away our babies.<eos> My babies.<eos> My babies!<eos> We gonna get the boys back, I promise.<eos> Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.
I have to see Flora.<eos> You can save your breath. I can't.<eos> In my pants, back pocket. There's a picture.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> My sweet, sweet baby.<eos> I want to talk to my Flora.<eos> Baby girl.<eos> If by chance you see this, the first thing you have to know, is I love you.<eos> I always will.
Mm-hmm, yes, anyone with fever, chills, headaches, or nausea gets a blood draw.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> How's it going?<eos> - You know, busy but good.<eos> Nice people in that department, right?<eos> - Yeah, they seem great. - Yeah.<eos> So you get my text?<eos> - When... when we having coffee?<eos> - We will, Dad.
- Dr. Halstead? - Yeah?<eos> Um, April is refusing to take her new medication.<eos> She won't listen to me. I...<eos> I just don't know what to do.<eos> You know I'm here to convince you to change your mind.<eos> I'm a nurse.<eos> I stopped listening to doctors a long time ago.<eos> I know it doesn't make sense, but there's another life inside of me now.<eos> How can I take a medicine that could endanger it?<eos> Hopefully it won't.
I want my aunt Addy!<eos> Well you're never gonna see her again because she's dead!<eos> It doesn't look too bad.<eos> Just don't get hit in the head again.<eos> You'll live.<eos> How did The Man find Lucy?<eos> She must be on his damn list.<eos> Or Murphy is.<eos> We got to go after her.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. We will.
You cut it for you because you are sick and tired of looking at the man in the mirror.<eos> But you forget...<eos> I always see you for who you are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, um... you may not think that you need me, Belle, but you will.<eos> You forget whose child it is you're carrying.<eos> He will have a mark on his head by virtue of who he is, and if you want what's best for him... you will come back to me.<eos> Threats won't make me love you again, Rumple.<eos> No.<eos> But necessity will.
I want to see her before she knows who I am.<eos> Nothing happened since, just so you know.<eos> It's just a memory of something beautiful.<eos> You never gave up something beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - You've already tried five different versions in mock court.<eos> I know, but none of them are right.<eos> None of them got us the win.<eos> They just haven't figured out that gender plays into Taylor's case.<eos> Incredibly, their mirror jurors still think she panicked.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think he has it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But he will.
No, no, Mr. Carsen.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> We don't know where the pendant is.<eos> It could be at the bottom of the sea.<eos> You could be beamed into solid stone.<eos> You cannot go through these doors.<eos> Is that the invisible Cloak of Perseus?<eos> No, no, I brought that upstairs to... oh.<eos> Well, I guess I'm going with him.<eos> - We all will.
So, I guess this is it.<eos> I want a boyfriend I'm not afraid of dropping in the toilet.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> So this is good-bye.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Why?<eos> Why me?<eos> - Should I go?<eos> - No, I will.
I'm glad.<eos> I want you to know that your baby is safe.<eos> This link is open day or night any time you want to see Agnes.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> What do you mean, you don't want to trace the link?<eos> You don't think he's thought of that?<eos> The second he discovers we traced it, he'll take it away, take her away.<eos> Liz, the only way we're gonna get her is by finding where that link is coming from.<eos> I don't think he'll hurt her.<eos> Of course he will.
Good to go?<eos> We got to get to the test site, fast.<eos> Welcome to the Sands, sir.<eos> See?<eos> Invisible.<eos> I think that's them.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Wyatt, what are you doing?<eos> He's gonna hit us!<eos> - No, he won't.
Give him the booster shot of the original vaccine.<eos> He's been pumped full of so many different vaccines.<eos> I'll do it myself!<eos> I need you to help me save my daughter.<eos> Whatever it is in your blood that makes you go and never stop, I need that now.<eos> Help me, Warren.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Addy!<eos> No one's coming for you, Lucy.<eos> Addy will.
But this year, as board president, I plan to introduce a haunted history tour of the building.<eos> And I'm here because I need some spooky helpers.<eos> We actually have plans.<eos> Yeah, we're going to eat popcorn, watch scary movies, and not pee on the couch.<eos> But you could do that any night!<eos> Please?<eos> It would really mean a lot to me.<eos> Aw, who could say no to this face?<eos> I could.<eos> But I won't.
text me your address.<eos> Yes!<eos> — And we'll be there in an hour.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm...<eos> You're coming.<eos> Let's go, baby.<eos> Do you really expect me to come?<eos> Yes, I really expect you to come.<eos> I will not. — Yes, you will.
Yes!<eos> — And we'll be there in an hour.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm...<eos> You're coming.<eos> Let's go, baby.<eos> Do you really expect me to come?<eos> Yes, I really expect you to come.<eos> I will not. — Yes, you will.<eos> No, I will not!
And the defense?<eos> Defense recommends two years probation, plus mandatory therapy.<eos> Approach the bench, both of you.<eos> Are you two serious?<eos> For child porn?<eos> I believe there are medical factors...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I heard you.<eos> Well, if necessary, will you hear the testimony of an expert witness to the same point on behalf of Ms. Duncan?<eos> Sure I will.
Well, then, I won't show.<eos> I... I-I'll... I'll get the books delivered to him.<eos> That's not gonna do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're a loose end.<eos> Look, here's the deal, Doc...<eos> You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were.<eos> You think he'll do that?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Good, because he won't, ever.
I might have gotten turned around.<eos> Oh, wait. There you are.<eos> (beep)<eos> Why are you in the alley?<eos> It took a while, but I found you.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Look, I didn't see anything.<eos> I swear I won't tell anybody.<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
Thank you, Jane.<eos> Guys, we're just going no shirts, pink bowties.<eos> Just really classic sexy.<eos> On to other orders of business.<eos> We're phasing out bussers in the afternoon, so shifts are gonna be 45 minutes longer.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Don't gripe.<eos> It's economical.<eos> You'll make more bank.<eos> No, we won't.
Paris?<eos> Rome?<eos> - Huh? Drink a little tea?<eos> - That's not sexy.<eos> Afric... nah, you don't want to...<eos> Outer space?<eos> You can do it in space?<eos> Oh, yes, Nick.<eos> You can.<eos> And you will.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, but my whole life is on that computer.<eos> If I don't get it back, I'm gonna get fired.<eos> Okay, calm down.<eos> We're gonna take a ride, we're gonna see if we can find this guy.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Wait.<eos> You really need to find a safe place to live.<eos> I know.<eos> I-I will.
Actually, I think it kind of did.<eos> Alex, this is the third time I've asked you.<eos> You were supposed to come to the media office and submit your statement.<eos> The press might ask where you are, and we need something to tell them.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just haven't gotten around to it.<eos> - Um, I'll do it right after class.<eos> - See that you do.<eos> Look, I know it sucks, but you really should get that done.<eos> I will.
Oh, I think you know...<eos> Mother.<eos> I'm here to warn you...<eos> Do not let him destroy us, like he did his last family.<eos> You will never even set eyes on this child.<eos> Let me remind you, dearie, that Rumplestiltskin takes children, not the other way 'round.<eos> There's nowhere to hide from me, dearie.<eos> Whatever you're doing, the Mother Superior won't let you get away with it.<eos> That wingless glowworm won't stop me.<eos> None of you will.
No.<eos> No, no.<eos> How did you...<eos> You really think dried squid ink can hold me?<eos> I'm far too powerful for that now.<eos> Look, I know you want me back, Rumple.<eos> It's... it's never gonna happen.<eos> I know.<eos> But I cannot lose another son, Belle.<eos> I won't.
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'll see you at Christmas.<eos> Did we overdo it?<eos> It's like a toy factory under there.<eos> I'm not really sure what kind of message that sends.<eos> That we have three kids and I work really hard.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Mom, are we going caroling?<eos> Yes, we will.
Ms. MacNeil, is Casey's condition related to what happened<eos> - The property line is behind the gate.<eos> Is Casey's condition related to what happened to your daughter, Reagan?<eos> My daughter's name is Angela.<eos> There's nothing wrong with Casey except she isn't here.<eos> Now, please, leave us be.<eos> _<eos> Scooped the Sun Times, did it?<eos> If they find out we've been hiding her...<eos> They won't.
Micah?<eos> That's what we heard... that for almost a year, he knew that there was earthquake damage, and he didn't do anything about it!<eos> What he did is criminal!<eos> It's negligence!<eos> No, no.<eos> Murder's what it is.<eos> I heard Rhonda Coley didn't even make it out of surgery.<eos> He can't get away with this!<eos> Harry. Harry.<eos> He won't!
Everybody, shh!<eos> This could be about my big Hawaii Five-O arc!<eos> Hi there.<eos> Can you believe it's me against Esteban for the part?<eos> !<eos> And they want me to audition!<eos> Is Esteban going to audition?<eos> - Ah.<eos> Well...<eos> - Then why won't you?
Okay. We good?<eos> - My bad. Okay.<eos> That's not how we do it here.<eos> Should we take them to the Compassion Corner?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Mateo's Mommy, you're upset because...?<eos> I'm upset because Mateo's Daddy didn't tell me something he should have.<eos> And I should've.<eos> And next time I will.
That would be a firm no.<eos> Aren't you a ray of sunshine!<eos> I wonder if those colorful beverages have anything to do with it?<eos> You leave my beverages out of this!<eos> I'm just saying, maybe you'd be a little less snippy if you were more hydrated.<eos> Look, this is my Zen area.<eos> Whatever I do up here is my business!<eos> Not if your business is the Big Tobacco and Alcohol trade!<eos> My God, give it a rest!<eos> I will not.
You know, just taking a little bit off the top, stealing from criminals.<eos> How is that even wrong?<eos> Then I got in deeper and deeper.<eos> I've spent years looking over my shoulder, waiting for this thing to come home.<eos> Now, it's over.<eos> So, in a way, you-- you did me a favor.<eos> So now, I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> So what, you're gonna talk to the police?<eos> No. No.<eos> I won't.
How could you bring the Grim Reaper... to the person who asked you to save her life?<eos> I'm curious. When will we hear her thank us...<eos> Quiet already!<eos> Why are you yelling at me?<eos> Why is there not a single car on this stupid road?<eos> Someone made sure there will be no cars on this road for two days.<eos> I said to stop talking.<eos> Why didn't you leave yet?<eos> You said you were leaving.<eos> I will soon.
Gorillas are gentle.<eos> Mangani are not.<eos> I never left a friend in trouble, or a partner in the lurch.<eos> I'm not about to start now.<eos> Stop calling me "doctor." My name's George.<eos> We'll keep your proof safe, George.<eos> I know.<eos> Meet us in Boma.<eos> If we don't make it back...<eos> We will.
I've been told that.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Three suspects at this time...<eos> This still gets you going?<eos> Spying on junkies?<eos> Come on.<eos> He's never gonna lead us to the shooters.<eos> Maybe his girl will.
I think that... we need...<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I can't pull up.<eos> Christ.<eos> Did the doctor tell you about the survival rate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> You know, we're gonna beat this.<eos> We're gonna beat this.<eos> We will.
You said you would help.<eos> GRADUATES<eos> I am.<eos> That's how they helped me!<eos> Mr Prince!<eos> It seems that you've finally done something...<eos> Let go.<eos> You'll tell the Businessman?<eos> How essential I've been?<eos> Yes, I most certainly will.
I remember all of it.<eos> She's not gone.<eos> She's still here?<eos> It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.<eos> He'll always be with me.<eos> I understand now.<eos> - Please tell the Aviator I remember him!<eos> - I will!<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I won't!
I just don't think the story's for us.<eos> Ben likes it.<eos> Yeah, it's not bad.<eos> It's just not Spotlight.<eos> What's just not Spotlight?<eos> The PD numbers.<eos> The numbers story. It feels thin.<eos> Oh. You got Cahill to talk?<eos> No.<eos> But I will.
What do you do out there?<eos> Are you trying to stop them from taking it down?<eos> That would make me a criminal.<eos> And a pretty terrible role model to impressionable youth such as yourself.<eos> But if someone else did it, I'd have to assume they believed even the teeniest of actions could change the future.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I know how things work.<eos> Why are they taking the platform down?<eos> Because it's hard to have ideas and easy to give up.<eos> But you won't.
So, after eight years, it came crashing down in a 1,000-mile swath across the Indian Ocean.<eos> A little to the left, a little to the right, somebody could have gotten hurt.<eos> I really wanted to build a computer for colleges.<eos> The technology just didn't catch up as fast as I needed it to.<eos> And you know we're out of money.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the program will be starting momentarily.<eos> But then, Apple stopped innovating, and I saw something better.<eos> Joanna, I know schools aren't going to buy a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.<eos> You know I know that.<eos> But Apple will.
I can't, Joy.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Riley needs you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> I want to get off!<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
Actually, people don't really shop at malls anymore.<eos> They shop online.<eos> What's online?<eos> Never mind, I made that up.<eos> Just keep going!<eos> Okay!<eos> I wanna shop online and I wanna start over.<eos> You know, I could be different in the Valley.<eos> What if I don't make it, Max?<eos> This time, you will.
Dad?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> Totally cool.<eos> No problem at all.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, then.<eos> Okay.<eos> And don't forget the bike key.<eos> I won't.
Here.<eos> Hold this, OK?<eos> And hold this.<eos> Alright.<eos> Have it back.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> What is that?<eos> This is extremely valuable, alright?<eos> This is a valve ring.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I--<eos> Poomp .<eos> Open the door, you lying, frog-faced squishy toy!<eos> Stop!<eos> I need your--<eos> You promised to help me find my mom!<eos> Then I un-promise!<eos> That's not how it works!<eos> You have to help me get to Paris.<eos> I will not!
It was nice meeting you River.<eos> You too.<eos> He's perfect.<eos> What's with the birds at night here?<eos> Its kind of eerie.<eos> Morning glories. You'll get used to them.<eos> What happened to the guy who used to live here?<eos> He disappeared. Took off one day without so much as a word.<eos> And what if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?<eos> I told you how I feel about actors.<eos> So let me change your mind.<eos> I'll cook for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Perfect.<eos> My place.<eos> Text me and I'll send you the address.<eos> Alright I will.
- That makes you almost likable.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I need 500 more. An advance.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I got to get my car out of the shop.<eos> It's been held hostage for the last six months.<eos> I'm going to need a car.<eos> All right.<eos> - You better play ball.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I will.
-My great-grandmother had things like this. -Yes, yes.<eos> Keep it going.<eos> I am so excited to have these.<eos> Keep it going. Yes. Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Get one for your mother.<eos> Get one for your sister.<eos> Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.<eos> -You will not regret owning this.<eos> -No, you will not.
- Your last shot was dead-on.<eos> - That was amazing.<eos> - You got him with one blast!<eos> - You set me up for it.<eos> - It was perfect.<eos> - That was pretty good.<eos> You're okay.<eos> He's with the Resistance.<eos> He's gonna get you home.<eos> We both will.
Brooder, compact your gear to the essentials.<eos> I shall.<eos> Sorry about Saucy.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> She was top quality.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll carry your stuff.<eos> Go on, get ahead of us.<eos> When you pack, don't forget her medical kit.<eos> We won't.
I'm not into politics.<eos> But that is an advantage, sailors have to trust their Admiral.<eos> De Ruyter, this is in our nations interest.<eos> I'm not setting sail again.<eos> In the last 15 years, I've spent six months at home.<eos> You have to find someone else.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Didn't I make myself clear?<eos> I won't find a better man than you.<eos> Of course you will.
Think of it as an act of a true statesman.<eos> I couldn't sleep either.<eos> Why, Michiel?<eos> Why did you accept that mission?<eos> You have nothing to prove.<eos> They can't force us.<eos> That's not it.<eos> So you want a state funeral?<eos> I don't want to cause a civil war.<eos> And you won't.
Okay, bye now.<eos> Bye.<eos> So they're looking at me, awaiting my wisdom and knowledge and I have none of either.<eos> How many times have you done that tour now?<eos> 63.<eos> And you still can't remember a word you said?<eos> You know how it is.<eos> First the knees, then the names.<eos> - I should have stern words with your assistant.<eos> - Oh, I will.
All good things.<eos> They're mutual.<eos> Actually, I've just asked if she'd like to join us officially.<eos> Have you?<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> - It would mean a lot of traveling.<eos> - Yes, I expect so.<eos> You'll love that.<eos> She hasn't said "yes" yet.<eos> Well, she will.

- What are you doing here?<eos> - Checking on my investment.<eos> You've come to the wrong place.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I couldn't find you at the party.<eos> How are you, Mrs. Donnelly?<eos> Why did you come here, really?<eos> To pay my respects to you.<eos> There's nothing I admire more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never get to sit.<eos> Others will.
Are you warm, my love?<eos> I might have a little frostbite.<eos> I'm looking forward to making it all better.<eos> I can't wait for you to come home.<eos> How's Sarah?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Sarah's good.<eos> Will you call her that for me?<eos> Yes, I will.
There's a good strong figure of a man.<eos> Join us, sir.<eos> Go on.<eos> You'd make a fine soldier.<eos> Always room in the ranks for a gentleman of your caliber.<eos> It's a roof over your head.<eos> Who wants a fine wage?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You might try Weatherbury. If you're looking for work, there's a farm there needs all the help it can get. Yes.<eos> I will.
- How are we getting on?<eos> - We are nailing it.<eos> - That's great.<eos> You can put about half those lagers back, Adam.<eos> What does Nancy want to drink?<eos> - I'm not sure if...<eos> - She wants vodka.<eos> The only spirit she can out-drink me on.<eos> We'll see about that later.<eos> No, we won't.
Do you ride? No.<eos> I had a Harley once but I fell off, so I decided to use my feet.<eos> Now, this kid, Sporino, he got something special.<eos> He's no pushover, so you're gonna have to work, you know what I mean?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Not bad at all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This'll get the job done.<eos> Really will.
Well, I guess we forgot.<eos> MUSIC<eos> What are you boys doing here?<eos> Have you gotten to ten?<eos> Don't tell me you've finished already.<eos> Not even close.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> Mother, we're going to kill you.<eos> You'll never find your dads in time.<eos> Yes we will.
The Brave One has been nominated for an Academy Award.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, really!<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I don't know. It's like Roman Holiday.<eos> Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Felix?<eos> Oh spider, oh spider, oh bring, oh bring me there!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come over here.<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> Cat Numilia is making me feel better!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That you've got pneumonia and that no one knows when you'll be back at school.<eos> I don't think that Mum's going to come back.<eos> Of course she will.
Go, kid.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Kill them all!<eos> Attack.<eos> Attack!<eos> No!<eos> Can I tell you something, Peter?<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Yes, I will find her.<eos> No, you really, really won't.
Can I tell you something, Peter?<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Yes, I will find her.<eos> No, you really, really won't.<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because I killed her.<eos> She died at my hand.<eos> By this very blade.<eos> As you will, too.
NO.<eos> NO, IT'S - - IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.<eos> IT'S ABOUT FULFILLING PEOPLE'S FANTASIES WHILE MINIMIZING THEIR GUILT.<eos> I'D SAY BEING A LAWYER IS PROBABLY BETTER TRAINING FOR LYING.<eos> BUT YOU DO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD.<eos> NOT FOR LYING.<eos> WOULD YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS ABOUT IT?<eos> IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS A STREET WALKER.<eos> YOU THINK THE JURY WOULD PERCEIVE THAT DISTINCTION?<eos> THE MEN WILL.
Did you just say bears?<eos> Well, yeah, honey.<eos> This is bear country.<eos> I think the campground website said something about a sighting just last week.<eos> So keep that in mind.<eos> - ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ - [all] Yes, she will!<eos> - ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ - [all] Yes, she will!<eos> ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain, she'll be comin' round the mountain ♪<eos> ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪<eos> - [all] Yes, she will!
There's a difference between understanding something in yer mind and really knowing it, deep down.<eos> I can tell ye from my own experience that a good hiding makes ye understand things in a more serious light.<eos> But as I said, if it was just me ye put in danger...<eos> But it wasn't.<eos> Such a thing is justice, Claire.<eos> Ye've done wrong to all the men, and ye must suffer for it.<eos> I'm yer husband.<eos> It's my duty to attend to it.<eos> I will not let you beat me!<eos> Ye won't?
You guys have a great day.<eos> Except for you.<eos> Hope yours is a horrible piece of shit.<eos> -Well, not if yours isn't first.<eos> -Right.<eos> Hey, I don't want to overstep my bounds, but what the fuck!<eos> Jesus!<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Okay, that was just really uncomfortable, that was like--<eos> I will.
Hold it!<eos> Hold it!<eos> Hold it!<eos> We have a problem.<eos> We will do everything we can to pull up the cable.<eos> It's only a few hours before daylight.<eos> We will do everything we can.<eos> Philippe, this is crazy.<eos> We're never going to finish at this rate.<eos> Yes, we will.
Thank you all very much.<eos> May I have a moment?<eos> It's about Claire.<eos> If your husband nominates you, I can't pull any punches.<eos> Lack of experience.<eos> Nepotism.<eos> That's right.<eos> - And you think I'm a dilettante.<eos> - No.<eos> But plenty of people will.
Who knew?<eos> Just me.<eos> A few days ago, I told Captain Collins.<eos> Did you laugh at me behind my back?<eos> No.<eos> I will shout "Turn".<eos> You have had rum.<eos> I have absolutely nothing to live for, so I promise you I will shout "Turn".<eos> Promise me in the morning when you're sober.<eos> I will.
Don't lift your head.<eos> You have no idea how happy it makes me to see you open your eyes.<eos> Your dad and I were so scared.<eos> Where's Amy?<eos> She's here in the hospital.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Yes, she's fine.<eos> She was asking about you.<eos> Can you go check?<eos> Yeah, sure. I will.
Did she really save your life?<eos> For her own reasons, but, yes.<eos> Athos!<eos> Come.<eos> Porthos, D'Artagnan, ride with the King to Paris.<eos> We'll hold them here as long as we can.<eos> ~ What just the two of you?<eos> ~ Three. I'm staying.<eos> Help them now and I will grant you clemency for your crimes.<eos> I will.
- Where is he?<eos> On Ormsby Street, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jump in, I'll give you a lift.<eos> Nah, you're all right.<eos> I'm gonna walk.<eos> It's a lovely day for it.<eos> Don't forget this lot.<eos> They're very important.<eos> I won't.
Can you arrest him?<eos> Find out if he's telling the truth?<eos> Because if he is, this thing needs protecting.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> When I get back, I'll pay him a visit, all right?<eos> So what do we do next?<eos> Let him stew for a while... mull it over.<eos> I'll go and see him again, tell him he's got 24 hours to make an offer... or the carcass get torched.<eos> I'll go this time, fuck with him.<eos> No, you won't, Ronnie.
Take the picture, now!<eos> Go!<eos> Watch this.<eos> What?<eos> Well, that was fun.<eos> He totally saw me.<eos> What?<eos> So?<eos> So, he could kick my ass.<eos> He won't.
What?<eos> Stop it.<eos> What?<eos> You promised me no breaking and entering.<eos> We're not breaking and entering.<eos> We're just entering.<eos> Very clever.<eos> I can't get arrested tonight.<eos> Or ever.<eos> You won't!
Come on.<eos> - Because this doesn't make sense.<eos> - Which part?<eos> You're always on rne about how I don't talk to Mom enough, how I don't respect the family.<eos> Now I tell you I wanna come home, and I wanna help out, and that doesn't make sense to you.<eos> You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.
You've earned your rest.<eos> I did not rest when I was young and I was ridden all the stronger by it.<eos> The young will not be tempered as we were.<eos> They have an electric carpet sweeper in the Mother House.<eos> I fear what we will find in the girl who comes to join us.<eos> Sister,<eos> I think perhaps you are confusing the new midwife with Nurse Miller.<eos> She has gone to Chichester as a postulant.<eos> But you said she would come back.<eos> And she will.
I've been on the telephone with the Bishop's secretary for the last half an hour.<eos> Well, go on.<eos> Don't be a tease.<eos> What did the Bishop want with a lowly curate?<eos> Apparently, he likes the work I've been doing, wants to meet me in person to tell me so.<eos> How marvellous.<eos> Are we supposed to go to him or is he coming here?<eos> Well, he'll want to meet me too, won't he?<eos> I didn't actually ask him.<eos> Well, of course he will.
Thank you.<eos> Thanks, Fred.<eos> Oh, I'll have a packet of those shirt buttons, while I'm here.<eos> Keep popping, for some reason.<eos> No-one tell you the war's over?<eos> Cold War isn't.<eos> CDC. Very Important.<eos> ~ I suppose it is.<eos> ~ You should stick one of these in your window.<eos> Maybe, I will.
His doorman is friends with my dog walker.<eos> That's why it's important to stay down with the people.<eos> Wow, divorce.<eos> That's rough.<eos> So is dating in your 40s and inheriting your grandmother's Welsh calves.<eos> Yeah, but a divorce and going through it alone.<eos> - I can't imagine.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> He's gonna need someone to be there for him.<eos> Yeah, he definitely will.
Oh, my God, it's gonna be huge.<eos> The gays and the housewives are going to love this.<eos> Bring in the Jews, and we'll have a three quadrant book.<eos> There is going to be an auction among all of the major publishing houses.<eos> Ellen has spoken to her agent, and he's going to let Empirical make the first bid.<eos> That is wonderful.<eos> I want all departments on this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I do not want to lose this book.<eos> And you won't.
- Ma'am...<eos> - Look, Kent, I'm sorry, but Chloe's got to go.<eos> - It's not Chloe, it's Lee.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And anyway, it's not Lee, it's Catherine. - What?<eos> She wants to work with an anti-bullying charity.<eos> What, is she nuts?<eos> I mean, it's gonna make it look like she thinks her mom bullied her.<eos> Well, I think she's calculating that this will make her more likable.<eos> Not with me, it fucking won't.
No, I'm not gonna drop it.<eos> Do you want to go to Hawaii at Thanksgiving?<eos> Are you interested in Memaw's sapphire earrings?<eos> Are you bullying me into dropping an anti-bullying charity?<eos> Gary, am I?<eos> -(CHUCKLES) You're parenting.<eos> - Yeah, well, too, I might add.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.<eos> - AMY: We'll explain later.<eos> No, we won't.
Let's kick Gavin Belson's teeth in at CES. And then when you're really worth something, I'm gonna take you back to those same spineless VCs who said no, and I'm gonna shove you right up their assholes.<eos> Um... That's a very enticing offer. And I wish I didn't have to do this Hooli thing, but I should probably at least...<eos> "Should"?<eos> Don't do what you should do. Do what you want.<eos> I mean, should I pay 800 bucks for that tiny piece of meat?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But I do it anyway. Because I want it.<eos> Simple question, Richard, "What do you want?"<eos> Gentlemen, what's the update on the apps?<eos> Or the app-date, if you will?

Yes, I love you.<eos> What will King Ecbert do to me?<eos> He will do nothing to you, so long as I protect you and Ragnar protects me.<eos> Ecbert must hide his power behind a legitimate heir to the throne of Mercia.<eos> Then he will not have me killed.<eos> No, he will not have you killed.<eos> Burgred, you and I will be joint rulers to the throne of Mercia.<eos> Does that not excite you, hmm?<eos> The Mercians may quarrel against us.<eos> No, they will not.
Yes, I will.<eos> -Love you guys.<eos> -We love you, Daddy.<eos> - Bye. -<eos> -Bye.<eos> Okay, bud, you're ready to go see Grandma and Pop-pop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't forget the taxes.<eos> Don't forget the taxes.<eos> I won't.
What?<eos> That I murdered a judge?<eos> I know.<eos> I'm going to stand behind you.<eos> - I will, as a friend.<eos> - No, it won't matter, you know?<eos> It's premeditated murder.<eos> I mean, I don't...<eos> They'll put me away for life.<eos> No, maybe they won't.
Pope Clement is preparing to sign a treaty with the Emperor.<eos> Oh...<eos> Your boy doesn't understand.<eos> The Emperor won't take kindly to the Pope helping to have his aunt cast off the throne.<eos> I don't think your papal envoy in there is likely to give the King what he wants, do you?<eos> And when he doesn't,<eos> Wolsey will be finished.<eos> And then I'll feel sorry for you.<eos> Except you won't.<eos> Except I won't.
When Your Majesty's ancestors fought in France, they held whole provinces.<eos> From there, they could supply, they could provision.<eos> Now we have only Calais, how can we support an army in the interior?<eos> So next time we go into France, we'll need a sea coast. Of course<eos> - Normandy, Brittany.<eos> Master Cromwell, your reputation is bad.<eos> You don't defend yourself?<eos> Your Majesty can form your own opinions.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
[ Inhales sharply ] Look, Jules.<eos> There's a good chance you're right about Trav and Laurie, but there's also a chance that they step up and surprise all of us.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> Where you ready to be a mom when you got pregnant?<eos> I took my pregnancy test in the bathroom at Wrestlemania.<eos> Right, but now you've moved on from your completely insane life, and, well, you've become the best mom I know.<eos> Okay?<eos> So whatever we have to do to make this work,<eos> I promise you...<eos> we will, Jules.
Morning.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is it him?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - How can you not tell?<eos> He was three weeks old.<eos> All right, we just keep moving on, OK, Lana?<eos> You'll know him when you see him.<eos> You will.
I know.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because I'm with you, and I know you're going to take care of me and everyone else here, because no matter what, you prevail.<eos> You understand?<eos> You... prevail.<eos> That is how we prevail.<eos> She's taken her final path.<eos> Yes, she has.<eos> We will prevail.<eos> We will.
Yes, no outsiders, just family.<eos> - I... I don't understand!<eos> - After the first purge, your sister Annabelle bore me 17 children.<eos> Alice gave me 22 after the second one.<eos> Oh, my dear, your life is about to be filled with glorious purpose.<eos> My sweet girl,<eos> You're going to be the mother to a whole new generation.<eos> No...<eos> I won't do it!<eos> Oh, of course you will.
You... you think it likes you?<eos> Let me show you how much.<eos> Cry really loud so all the sisters can hear you.<eos> Good baby.<eos> You have no friends.<eos> Julia.<eos> Alan is here.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> If we don't find...<eos> We will.
You know what that means to them?<eos> You can find someone else to sub for you at the clinic.<eos> Ugh, I hate that assumption, that I will just be the one to...<eos> Why don't you talk to your mother and tell her that no, Aisha can't take a trip right now?<eos> It's that easy, and you never do it.<eos> You don't have my back.<eos> You know, that tone you get, I wish you could hear yourself.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go to Greece without me.<eos> Maybe I will.
I thought that the governor handled that very well.<eos> Well, that's why she's the governor.<eos> You handled it pretty well, too.<eos> "casualty rate is one."<eos> Good point.<eos> Yes.<eos> Assuming that bill Pettigrew was what you said he was And not a casualty.<eos> Ask me any question you want.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will.
"Like vapors tossed..."<eos> "I long for scenes where man hath never trod.<eos> A place where woman never smiled or wept.<eos> There to abide with my Creator, God.<eos> And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept.<eos> Untroubling and untroubled where I lie."<eos> "The grass below, above, the vaulted sky."<eos> I wonder if he ever found it... his silent place with God.<eos> Oh, the poem tells me that he did.<eos> As you will one day.
Well, I know... I'm a monster.<eos> You don't need them.<eos> You have me.<eos> I know.<eos> Just please don't ever leave me, Marjorie.<eos> Those twins?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> They have to go.<eos> I know.<eos> They will.
I think we're ready.<eos> Please, all I want is to go home and be with my family.<eos> Yeah, well, you kind of limited your choices when you left a bag of drugs lying around with your ID in it.<eos> I'd say you're getting a pretty sweet deal.<eos> All you have to do is this one small thing, and it all goes away.<eos> "One small thing." You mean fuck over my friends?<eos> Your friends, the Rumspringa drug cartel.<eos> Aren't you helping them in the long run?<eos> Maybe when they go to prison, it'll turn them around... they'll find God, like you did.<eos> No, they won't.
- Ugh, how much longer?<eos> - We got about a half hour left.<eos> Crap!<eos> Crap!<eos> Crap!<eos> - Ow! - You cut yourself?<eos> No, but I broke that window.<eos> Somebody should go report this.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - I will!
There's been a mistake!<eos> Is that right?<eos> I'm Claire Fraser from... from Castle Leoch.<eos> I'm married to James Fraser, nephew of the Laird.<eos> And I'm King Arthur.<eos> Surely King Arthur was more appealing than that slimy puddock.<eos> We won't be here long.<eos> Dougal will come for us.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Yes, he will.
The New York call cost us more money than I first thought.<eos> Still, I think it got them off the scent for a few days.<eos> They have a lead on Sam.<eos> A police officer's wife called from upstate New York and said she thinks she saw him at a rest stop.<eos> Thank you for taking care of that for me.<eos> Anything else?<eos> I know you said not to worry, but she's snooping around everywhere.<eos> It's making the kids freak out a bit.<eos> Well, tell them not to do that.<eos> I will.
I'm the woman who came home to find her cheating husband dead on the floor. Who's the first person you think the cops are gonna look at?<eos> The only way they're gonna get through the interviews is if they know as little as possible about my involvement. That includes Rebecca.<eos> I haven't told her.<eos> Good.<eos> Look what happened the last time you told her one of our secrets.<eos> Look, look.<eos> Everything is gonna be fine, okay?<eos> We'll run the DNA test.<eos> It'll show that he was the father, and then hopefully, the laptop will prove that he was on the roof of the sorority house. - What if it doesn't?<eos> - It will.
You're not invited.<eos> - Everyone is invited, except you.<eos> - Fuck off, fatso.<eos> - You're not invited either.<eos> - I'm never invited.<eos> - Go away, you stink.<eos> - Okay, I'm going<eos> Benoit doesn't invite you nor Astrid.<eos> I wouldn't invite you.<eos> Nobody will.
- He's wanted for murder...<eos> - I think know that guy.<eos> - How?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> If he's still here in your city, we need to know, and we need to know now.<eos> Nomi?<eos> - You have to get out of here.<eos> - How-How did you get in here?<eos> If I try to explain it, you wouldn't believe me.<eos> But you will.
We're not ea.<eos> That's what you sai.<eos> You're not ea.<eos> I know you.<eos> We're ifferent.<eos> I can't let myself...<eos> But you...<eos> I know you.<eos> You have to let yourself feel it.<eos> You will.
Look at this.<eos> Sasha: Shoul have torn us apart.<eos> It in't.<eos> Sasha: Why are we here?<eos> Maggie: For this.<eos> I see it.<eos> Noah, that ki... he sai he in't know if he can make it.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Both of us, we will.
Jessie.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't want Ron and Sam to know about those.<eos> Well, your secret's safe.<eos> Noah was a sweet kid.<eos> But Tara, she's... she's in good hands with Pete.<eos> He's hitting you.<eos> He's hurting you.<eos> It has to stop.<eos> - It will. - How?
Why?<eos> Because these people are chilren an chilren like stories.<eos> What happens after all the nice wors an they still try to kick him out?<eos> They're guaring the armory now.<eos> We still have knives.<eos> That's all we'll nee against them.<eos> Well, tonight at the meeting... if it looks like it's going ba, I whistle.<eos> Carol grabs eanna, I take Spencer, you grab Reg, Glenn an Abraham cover us, watch the crow.<eos> - We can talk to them.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
We can cut up these seats.<eos> What the hell are you oing?<eos> You nee to check on Tara.<eos> You treate her.<eos> You're a surgeon.<eos> You nee to o that.<eos> Get out.<eos> I coul kill you right now.<eos> I coul.<eos> I will.
That's okay.<eos> I...<eos> I keep thinking about what you said.<eos> If i need to file a report, if that will help...<eos> You guys are -- you're doing all this.<eos> If i can help, i want to.<eos> Okay, pria, we -- we lost tonight.<eos> We lost our guy. We didn't find him.<eos> I know.<eos> But you will.
Perhaps, a two dollar reduction in my debt for every girl examined?<eos> A gunner's knot... is difficult to tie but impossible to undo.<eos> Drink.<eos> My father made me memorize every sailing knot before he let me set foot on one of his boats.<eos> Where are we?<eos> The Atlantic.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm cleaning up the mess you've created.<eos> - You untie me now.<eos> - I won't.
Gentlemen...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me.<eos> I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners.<eos> From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.<eos> So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you think that's going to help? Yes.<eos> Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.<eos> Oh, no, it will.
And burnt him to a crisp.<eos> Thus ending the dragon-slaying career of Ser Byron Swann.<eos> I made you something, Princess.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> He's beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're very welcome.<eos> Will you make me a doe, too?<eos> So that he can have company?<eos> Of course I will.
Move!<eos> This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.<eos> Cocksuckers.<eos> Boy fucker.<eos> You buggering filth!<eos> There's a special place in the seventh hell for your kind.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, I'll pay.<eos> I'll- - I'll pay all of you.<eos> Yes, you will.
I gave you nothing but weakness.<eos> And deformity.<eos> Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.<eos> My lady.<eos> Her father is the Lord's chosen king, and her father's blood runs through her veins.<eos> You march on Winterfell soon?<eos> We must to beat the snows.<eos> Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.<eos> I hope you won't make that mistake again.<eos> I won't.
The prize for the contest will be this remote control airplane.<eos> It may not be as large as a commercial aircraft,<eos> But it's the perfect size for our competitors, as this contest is for children 12 and under.<eos> Go on, Daniel.<eos> You'll certainly win.<eos> - But it's for kids.<eos> - Say that you're 12.<eos> But I'm 14 and a half.<eos> It's not going to work!<eos> Yes it will.
Congratulations, miss, you've won a...<eos> - What do we have for the lovely lady?<eos> - A notebook.<eos> Yeah, it's an adorable notebook.<eos> Do you like cats, Miss...? Irene.<eos> I love kitties.<eos> I have two Siamese cats, Oscar and Felix.<eos> Felix can wash himself.<eos> Oscar won't. He...<eos> He just won't.
It's probably Avi.<eos> He's in love with me.<eos> Oh, no, it's Hannah.<eos> Hannah, our daughter.<eos> I'm not telling her.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> I'm not ruining her childhood.<eos> I'm not telling her her whole life has been a lie.<eos> All right, I'll tell her.<eos> I will.
I'm gonna finish this album.<eos> If I have to go line by line and note by note, I'm gonna do it.<eos> Juliette, come here, come here.<eos> You know that's not gonna sound right, okay?<eos> It takes all the emotion out of everything.<eos> What's goin' on with you? Huh?<eos> I'm having a baby, and I just feel like nothing in my life is my life and I lose my voice, too, I'm gonna...<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't lose my voice.<eos> You won't, you won't.
I was just afraid that you would drop me.<eos> I definitely don't believe in that choice, but it is your choice, so...<eos> Yeah, thanks, um, I just...<eos> I think that he's really good.<eos> - I mean, look what he's done, you know?<eos> - I, um...<eos> I'm very aware of what he's capable of doing.<eos> Listen, if we're gonna be in this relationship, we're going to need to have an open line of communication - because I'm not su... - [Knock on door]<eos> We're ready for you, Layla.<eos> We will.
- Will you please just talk to me?<eos> Please?<eos> - [Sighs deeply] - Listen, there's a lot goin' on.<eos> There's a lot goin' on that you don't know about.<eos> No, trust me, I'm sure I know plenty.<eos> Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.
I'm sorry.<eos> You are half of the band and if... if you wanna keep taking meetings, I'm fine with that.<eos> No, you're right about Highway 65.<eos> We're not gonna get a better deal than that.<eos> Does that mean you... you do wanna sign?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I already signed there once.<eos> Rayna believe in me, she invested money in me, and I... blew it up.<eos> I'm not gonna do that to her again.<eos> I won't.
We haven't done this for a while, have we?<eos> The police have found another body.<eos> My contacts say they're linking it to the dead cop.<eos> I've made it hard for them to bring Dean back in but they'll try.<eos> Just keep him out of trouble.<eos> Not this time, I'm afraid.<eos> He's a liability, Terry.<eos> - He could ruin everything.<eos> - Look, I'll talk to him again.<eos> - No, we both will.
We protected you.<eos> We always do.<eos> Your father is going to set us up for life.<eos> What's he doing, Mum?<eos> - He's working.<eos> - He's killed people.<eos> Look... look... look at Chloe.<eos> They'll get him.<eos> He'll go away again.<eos> He won't!
Look, you barely know me.<eos> It's been a whirlwind romance but I've learnt so much about you.<eos> You're not always as strong as you pretend to be.<eos> When you're unhappy, you hide it.<eos> And if I knew you better, I'd know why.<eos> I need to show you how much you mean to me.<eos> Nancy, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
- I've tried to tell you for ages.<eos> - Gordon, no.<eos> You said Ma made you the person you are.<eos> Well, that's how I feel about Grace.<eos> She's my friend, but it's more than friendship.<eos> I love her.<eos> You can't have a relationship with Miss Calthorpe.<eos> You are her employer.<eos> - I don't care that she's staff.<eos> - Other people will.
- What will I do without you?<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> Muddle through, I suppose.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> Please leave my house.<eos> And shut the door on your way out.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I will not leave until we part friends.<eos> I will not.
Too busy with Violette Selfridge.<eos> Don't!<eos> We make Colleano's a gambling club.<eos> I will want to see results fast, because, if I don't, my boys will shut you down.<eos> You are Mr Selfridge's son.<eos> You have a responsibility.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's over.<eos> ~ Nancy, will you marry me?<eos> ~ Yes, I will.
You were right.<eos> I've... I've been a coward.<eos> ~ Oh, Gordon, please...<eos> ~ I'm here to fight for you, Grace.<eos> I want the whole world to know... how much I love you.<eos> ~ Just tell me you love me too, and I'll go on fighting.<eos> Of course I love you.<eos> But I can only be with you if you tell your father about us.<eos> I should have told him about us straightaway.<eos> I will, Grace. I will.
The past is dead.<eos> I am a different woman now.<eos> The past is never dead.<eos> But we are finished with each other.<eos> From now on, we will be strangers.<eos> You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.<eos> What truth?<eos> Whatever I am... .. you love me.<eos> And you always will.
Finding gold in the river, that's mine.<eos> And how much gold have you strained into your pan?<eos> So far? In the range of $12,000.<eos> That's a sardine in a fisherman's net.<eos> We here at Tammany, we prefer whales.<eos> But it's not a bad thing to hold on to a sardine now and then.<eos> So, from now on, 15% of your construction costs before your skim comes to us.<eos> That's a bit high, don't you think?<eos> My contractors will balk.<eos> No, they won't.
- Of course!<eos> George: Yes, thank you so much.<eos> But why couldn't you just tell us this last night?<eos> Well... because I have a favor to ask.<eos> Uh-huh. As both of you know, I've been stressing out about the reopening of Fancie's, particularly the menu.<eos> And I was hoping, as my closest friends, that you'd be willing to come over this evening for a sample meal.<eos> Hmm. I knew she wanted something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.<eos> All you had to do was ask.<eos> But of course I will.
Nobody makes a move until I say so.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Do I wait?<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Vehicle's approaching.<eos> Everyone stay alert. Stay alert.<eos> I'm gonna get a water.<eos> I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.

Because if they had their mother around them more...<eos> You have not once tried to change the custody arrangement in the last four years, because let's be honest now. It fits better with your life that I have the kids more of the week than you.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - I'm not judging you.<eos> I'm just saying what we both know is real.<eos> I never should've called you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin. We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.

But you don't.<eos> You're a horrible parent.<eos> How do you let that boy talk all that trash about Barack Obama and still let him perform?<eos> He's ungrateful and entitled, and you made him that way.<eos> Yeah, you'll make him a celebrity.<eos> But you'll make him a fool first. Oh, God, Cookie, I ain't trying to fight with you.<eos> I just want to say I'm sorry for letting Kidd Fo-Fo talk to you the way he did.<eos> And I dropped him because of it.<eos> What you need to do is drop this yella bitch.<eos> Yeah, he probably will.
_<eos> Sniper!<eos> Octavia, go.<eos> The spotter.<eos> He aimed the missile.<eos> He's alone.<eos> Clarke, just slow down.<eos> If he is a spotter, he's here to make sure we're dead.<eos> If he tells the mountain were alive...<eos> He won't.
What?<eos> We have to keep all of you safe until then.<eos> And don't tell me Finn finally got his peace talks.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Come on.<eos> We got a lot of work to do.<eos> So much for the element of surprise.<eos> I'll draw his fire.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
What a fucking thrill for you to humiliate me in front of Mom.<eos> Why would I wanna do that?<eos> No, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> You wanna keep it and hang it over my head until the next time you want something?<eos> ls that what it is?<eos> Fuck that, Danny.<eos> Go tell him.<eos> Or do you want me to do it?<eos> Because I fucking will.
- Your wife's designs.<eos> - And the Selfridge Estate.<eos> - They're really quite similar.<eos> - It's a good start.<eos> I'm off home now, Mr. Selfridge.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you, Miss Plunkett.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> You have tickets for the theater.<eos> - I won't.
There's us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Look, I know there's no way of avoiding this, of--of getting out of here, going some place where Ra's can't find us, but I...<eos> Felicity...<eos> Felicity.<eos> What did you--<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> I won't.
If they spot us, we cannot let them get away.<eos> Surprise is our only advantage.<eos> I'd say they've spotted us.<eos> What's your count?<eos> 6 on the south side, probably another 4 on the east.<eos> I don't want to go out like Butch and Sundance, so what's the plan?<eos> Shoot straighter than they do.<eos> Cover me.<eos> If he gets to the fortress before we do, we're dead.<eos> He won't.
I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> Do you want me to go to my father with this?<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> - You want him to ask you?<eos> - I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> You want him looking into your life, Ken?<eos> Because he will.
Do you want me to go to my father with this?<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> - You want him to ask you?<eos> - I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> You want him looking into your life, Ken?<eos> Because he will.<eos> I will go to him right now.<eos> - You will not.
I thought you'd want to know right away.<eos> - The fall didn't kill Dylan Blyer.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Actual cause of death was poisoning.<eos> No needle marks, so it's likely he ingested it.<eos> Any idea what it was?<eos> It's from the phenethylamine family.<eos> But I've never seen this exact combination.<eos> - We'll know soon, though.<eos> - Yes, we will!
This is where the Sheppards knew Archie from.<eos> We can learn a great deal about all three of them from here.<eos> Why are you suspicious?<eos> Because one of them said they found out about what happened from the morning's paper, ~ the other one said they couldn't sleep the previous night because of it. ~ Ha!<eos> Perhaps they had good reason to lie.<eos> Sullivan isn't treating this case as routine.<eos> Something else is going on here.<eos> I'll see what I can find.<eos> Assuming His Lordship lets us into his house in the first place.<eos> Oh, he will.
Yeah, I'm definitely interested.<eos> Why can't we see him?<eos> Because we've asked you not to, Janey, that's why.<eos> - But he's our uncle.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> What did he do?<eos> We can't explain all that to you right now, all right?<eos> You haven't explained any of it to us.<eos> Yeah, but, you know what?<eos> I will, eventually.
- No offense.<eos> - Oh, none taken.<eos> You're a nurse.<eos> It's different.<eos> You'll probably be devastated when this place closes.<eos> Well, All Saints'll be around forever.<eos> I don't think so, man.<eos> I love my job, but I also love my band, my foster cats.<eos> Well, Matt, this place'll be around long after you and I are both gone.<eos> Oh, no, it won't.
The bracelet worked.<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.<eos> Iris and Cee Cee are both dead.<eos> I tried.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> I should go talk to him.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
- We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> If there's nothing in that shed, then we have nothing to worry about.<eos> If we move anything in that shed... we are felons.<eos> We are dealers at that point.<eos> I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
I sat in their offices, and I begged those bastards.<eos> But no.<eos> She's not covered, they said.<eos> So I brought her home and I took care of her myself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I do.<eos> I watched my dad die.<eos> Then you would know that pity won't bring my mom back.<eos> Nothing will.
The whole week?<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> She has the flu.<eos> I mean, she sounded really healthy.<eos> You are the flu.<eos> I had no idea my lawyer would take it that far.<eos> I know, but he did.<eos> All right, I'm...<eos> yeah, I'm gonna call her.<eos> I will.
Yes, I think you saw.<eos> My eyes devour you.<eos> I always have that effect.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do that to guys.<eos> You noticed me two years ago.<eos> Two years, right?<eos> You can't forget me.<eos> You never will.
I don't know why they hate me like they do, just because I want them to lead decent lives and do the right thing.<eos> Can you blame me?<eos> But listen to me, for all the pain, and the trauma that this has caused me, you're the result, and I wouldn't wish it to be any different.<eos> You're here, and you're alive.<eos> You remind me so much of him.<eos> You're the son that I was meant to have, more or less.<eos> Oh, Bart.<eos> Promise me that you'll never leave me, like they did.<eos> Promise me?<eos> I never will, grandma.
See, I was with you... [Chuckles] Right up until the end there.<eos> Come on, I love helping people find work.<eos> It really turns me on.<eos> [Chuckles] No, my résumé's good.<eos> I'm just waiting to hear back on a few leads.<eos> I could reach out to my contacts, help you get a few meetings.<eos> Marisol, we agreed not to mix business with pleasure.<eos> All right? You have to trust me.<eos> I'll find a job eventually.<eos> Of course you will.
That's weird.<eos> I thought I made more cupcakes.<eos> Where are all the other ones?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You ate them.<eos> What?<eos> I had one cupcake.<eos> Hmm. Okay, three cupcakes.<eos> You better hope we have enough for Miguel's birthday.<eos> We will.
And she will get it from me about the signature.<eos> Uh, just a sec. Have you considered sending Lucy to this weekend's life skills camping trip at big bear?<eos> She didn't give you the pamphlet.<eos> Clearly, I have to start checking her backpack.<eos> It's a character-building program.<eos> I find that all kids, especially those going off track, can benefit from challenging outdoor activities.<eos> Lucy is not very outdoorsy.<eos> Oh, neither was my daughter. But when she hit a rough patch during high school, my wife and I sent her.<eos> It was helpful.<eos> Yeah, I'll...
It's weird.<eos> Uh, well, there are plenty of hotels in Seattle, if you guys would like that better.<eos> If this is about midterm break, it doesn't matter.<eos> I've already got plans.<eos> Oh. Since when?<eos> Since Peyton invited me to go skiing with her family.<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Because she just asked me.<eos> All right, well, we'll talk about it later.<eos> No, we won't.
He reads to Scotty every night, takes him to school every morning.<eos> Your brother has stepped up.<eos> Was he stepping up when he fell off the wagon two weeks ago?<eos> Previously on "Mistresses"...<eos> He doesn't know that I'm sick.<eos> - He won't forgive you for not telling him.<eos> - I will.
Well, Alec will insist.<eos> He doesn't know that I'm sick.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> He's receiving his physician of the year award from the American Society of Cardiology, and there is a black-tie gala tomorrow night.<eos> While he'd never admit it, this award means the world to him.<eos> Vivian... you know him.<eos> If I tell him now, he'll... Blow off the award and jump into savior mode.<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> He won't forgive you for not telling him. I will.<eos> I will.
And no one's gonna blame you For stabbing a burglar in your own home.<eos> Well, i can't take that risk.<eos> That's why we're not calling the police.<eos> But you can help them catch this guy.<eos> I mean, he's -- he's still out there.<eos> He was wearing a mask.<eos> I couldn't identify him even if i wanted to.<eos> I don't get it, mrs. Stappord.<eos> Aren't you afraid that he'll come back?<eos> He won't.
- Thanks.<eos> Oh, how nice.<eos> Well... let's see what's on your diploma.<eos> - "Ove Lind..."<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> I thought that if you'd like to, we...<eos> Speak calmly and clearly.<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!
Think about it.<eos> Why move the body, carry it outside in broad daylight to the victim's own car?<eos> Why take that risk?<eos> Unless they had to.<eos> We had it in the qualifiers earlier on this year.<eos> Shelly got a stomach bug, knocked her out of the match.<eos> I found a sub, but we only just managed to scrape through.<eos> So, wherever we stay, I supervise the catering and make sure the rooms are cleaned as soon as we leave for the training ground.<eos> ~ It's easy enough to check.<eos> ~ Oh, we will.
- I mean, it's like you got the child lock going.<eos> - I can't get out.<eos> - You poor thing.<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> I don't wanna go nowhere.<eos> That's the important thing.<eos> I don't even wanna go nowhere.<eos> Gwen, we got a code 3 for chest pain.<eos> But, yeah, we'll finish this later.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
Vodka and super-speed... not a good combination.<eos> Come on.<eos> So, are you gonna call her?<eos> Who?<eos> That girl.<eos> The one who gave you her number.<eos> I hadn't really thought about it.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> But I know you.<eos> You won't.
You know the memorial's today.<eos> Of course.<eos> If you'd spoken to the lawyer, he might have been able to arrange a short furlough.<eos> I'd never be welcome there.<eos> Maybe you could write something.<eos> Something I could read later.<eos> Then at least you'd be a part of the memorial.<eos> Perhaps it might help you make amends.<eos> I need to speak to Joe.<eos> And you will.
When we hitting the ladymarket in fishtown again?<eos> Really?<eos> You want to talk about picking up other girls in front of your girlfriend?<eos> W-what?<eos> No, man. I...<eos> He knows, Asher.<eos> You told him?<eos> No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students.<eos> But don't worry... I won't tell Annalise.<eos> Or maybe I will.
- I'll check the Treasury Department's FinCEN database, see if there's anyone in the area who's made any unusual cash transactions.<eos> Look, this guy figured out how to fool the FBI and then front-run Goldman-Sachs.<eos> I doubt he's stupid enough to make any cash transactions over ten grand.<eos> FinCEN monitors more than just those.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought that was the threshold.<eos> What else is reported?<eos> Uh, that's not something we share.<eos> But, you know, if I find anything relevant to this specific case...<eos> You won't.
You know that we can't help him.<eos> The only way we could get back with the food was to tell her we could.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm here.<eos> It's me.<eos> All right, it's -- it's gonna be over soon.<eos> And these people are gonna help us.<eos> And we're all grateful, Ben.<eos> But somebody's gonna have to tell that girl.<eos> I will.
How are you?<eos> I heard your suspect was killed.<eos> Came after Harvey and me with a gun.<eos> - Didn't have a choice.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> What about his son?<eos> Paramedics were able to stabilize him.<eos> I'm heading over to the hospital now, to check in on him.<eos> Well, let me know how he is.<eos> I will.
I am not a monster.<eos> I am an angel.<eos> I'm finally what I'm meant to be.<eos> I'm happy to hear you say that.<eos> Angels are guardians, Jiaying, but they're also heralds, sent to reveal the truth.<eos> And that is my purpose.<eos> I'm here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are.<eos> Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
Walk me through how you do this.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Maggie!<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> You were actually asleep in there, standing up, with your eyes open.<eos> I haven't been sleeping.<eos> It's this shift and studying for boards and...<eos> - It can't happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
You are, like, the queen of not helping.<eos> See? There's a reason I'm afraid of needles.<eos> We should've all spent the summer in Haiti.<eos> I'm gonna go get us another blanket.<eos> What are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin?<eos> - We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> - And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police from a burner phone.<eos> - We'll never pull this off.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- We'll never pull this off.<eos> - Yes, we will.<eos> I found a drill bit that can break the lock.<eos> And I already rented a van and a dolly.<eos> What are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin?<eos> - We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> - And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police from a burner phone.<eos> - We'll never pull this off.<eos> - Yes, we will...
There's one more.<eos> Stronger... different.<eos> Nobu.<eos> They're armed.<eos> MP7s with suppressors.<eos> Huh. Somebody wants things quiet.<eos> We'll be quieter.<eos> - You remember how to use these?<eos> - I won't need 'em.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Get it out there for everyone to see.<eos> Not that simple.<eos> Fisk killed his father, people need to know that.<eos> She's an old lady... confused... talking about things that...<eos> So you don't believe her?<eos> Okay... let's play this out.<eos> So I write up the story... get it on the front page.<eos> Then what happens?<eos> Well, everybody will see that he's been lying about his past.<eos> Yeah, sure, absolutely will.
We're in an election cycle.<eos> - Everything's about perception.<eos> - Seth--<eos> I want to integrate the policy and the press teams.<eos> I want to work with cabinet members and agency heads on gearing every public statement towards our platform.<eos> Mobilize our AmWorks allies in Congress.<eos> A commitment list for futures legislations, not just simple endorsements.<eos> This outlines in detail what I would like to do as your Chief of Staff.<eos> All I ask is that you consider it.<eos> Well, of course I will.
It's not the only reason.<eos> I just feel like this was my first parenting test and I failed.<eos> I made it about my needs, my own anxieties, not about the baby.<eos> You also gave up going to your own graduation without a thought.<eos> Look, Jane, there's no right or wrong answer.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But would you forgive me if something went wrong?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> And it won't.
Cold weather.<eos> That's all?<eos> - Yes, that's all.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> There are snakes.<eos> - Don't move!<eos> We're coming!<eos> The snake-repellent will work this time?<eos> Of course it will.
I can't do anything.<eos> It is his destiny to live.<eos> We must tell your father.<eos> Tie it tightly.<eos> Hide your belly.<eos> Another magazine?<eos> Ignacio gave it to me.<eos> Don't burn it before I finish looking at it.<eos> Will you tell him?<eos> Then I will.
She's like my nemesis.<eos> I've never had a nemesis before.<eos> I kind of like it.<eos> Okay, Cisco.<eos> Now what?<eos> Ray, get to the ocean.<eos> If the bots follow you into the water, their electronics will fry.<eos> Got it.<eos> Wait.<eos> But so will my suit.
I'll fix it.<eos> You know that I found a gun in his--<eos> One of his suitcases, huh?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> No, I know you didn't know that.<eos> But it's not-<eos> - It's not in his suitcase.<eos> It's in my fucking hand right now.<eos> - Listen to me, Kevin-- - lf you won't do something about this...<eos> I will.
~ No, I don't. One conversation - five minutes, here, now.<eos> Clear your name, everyone moves on.<eos> ~ Our readers would love to hear what you have to say.<eos> ~ You need to leave - now.<eos> I keep replaying my evidence over and over, thinking of all the things I should've said differently,<eos> ~ all the comebacks I should've thrown at her.<eos> ~ You did the best you could.<eos> There's an epitaph - "Ellie Miller, she did the best she could" (!<eos> ) ~ What if Joe gets off?<eos> ~ He won't.

There you are!<eos> Erica's at the bus station.<eos> She told Lainey she's buying a ticket to New York so she never has to live in your stupid house again.<eos> True to her word, my sister went to new stubborn heights by fleeing the state.<eos> We're blocked in by a bus? !<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> !<eos> It's a school!<eos> We're never gonna make it in time.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
Well, who else?<eos> Uh, well, right over there we have, uh...<eos> Jamal's got me drinking this green tea stuff.<eos> Here you go.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> How do you think I'm feeling?<eos> I'm feeling nervous, darling.<eos> I'm feeling nervous.<eos> I don't want to let you down.<eos> You won't.
But why did you kill my friends?<eos> They had nothing to do with this!<eos> To watch you suffer, Emma.<eos> Although they did help a lot.<eos> After all, what did your BFFs do?<eos> They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
Oh, my God.<eos> Where's Weiss?<eos> He must have run off.<eos> You all right?<eos> You let him escape?<eos> Nothing useful on her phone, Harold.<eos> Swept the BB. It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.
And I don't want you in this either.<eos> I can't protect you anymore.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Ruben.<eos> I only have until 8:00 p.m. to tie up loose ends.<eos> No!<eos> That was, uh, intense.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Whatever you say, boss.<eos> You know, you answer it, they'll stop calling.<eos> - No, she won't.
- Jessica, enough.<eos> I loved you.<eos> I gave you whatever you wanted.<eos> All you ever gave me was shame.<eos> And remorse.<eos> And pain.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm gonna hit the switch.<eos> She is going to kill him.<eos> No, she won't.
What are you doing?<eos> Step forward!<eos> Hope!<eos> Hope, why would you do this?<eos> You can kill him now.<eos> Hope.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell me!<eos> Tell me.<eos> I will.
I-I was...<eos> I was just doing what anybody would do, you know?<eos> Look, it's hard to meet a nice guy, uh, with my hours.<eos> Especially one who's not scared of letting down his guard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I wanted to give you my number.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call me sometime.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will.
Show me your hands!<eos> - Don't shoot!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Emily...<eos> Hays.<eos> I've been dog sitting for Daisy and Kyle while they're away.<eos> Are they in trouble?<eos> Almost done, babe.<eos> We just need to make sure Mark doesn't screw us up tonight.<eos> He won't.
I just need to rest for a little longer.<eos> Not that my mother will let me do much else.<eos> Will she let you come back to work?<eos> I have to come back to work!<eos> Back to London.<eos> This is where my life is.<eos> - And where you are.<eos> - Deils, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You can't come back if they don't give you a clean bill of health.<eos> They will.
Yolo. All right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Let's light this candle.<eos> All right, why do I smell sandalwood?<eos> Go away.<eos> You're painting the easel.<eos> - It looks good, right?<eos> - The Mason Hotel wants a painting.<eos> They won't accept an easel.<eos> Or... will they?

A world where Anne can be Queen is a world where Cromwell can be...<eos> Hendon, Royston, Huntingdon, Peterborough, sent riders on ahead so everything will be ready for you.<eos> This is a tactical retreat, not a surrender.<eos> Lady Anne is the key to winning back Henry.<eos> Find a way back into her confidence, Torn.<eos> Work a device to please her.<eos> The only way to please that lady is to crown her Queen of England.<eos> - Will you come north?<eos> -Hmm-hmm, I'll come fetch you. As soon as he summons you back.<eos> And he will.
You're a man who has borrowed all over Europe.<eos> I'm a man who knows your creditors.<eos> One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.<eos> What are they going to do?<eos> Bankers don't have armies.<eos> Neither will you, without any money.<eos> My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.<eos> Your task is to secure the north, to defend us against Scotland.<eos> If you cannot ensure these things, the King will take your land and your titles and give them to someone who will do the job that you cannot do.<eos> No, he won't.
"Fuck you, gypsies"?<eos> What's up with that?<eos> It's a message for a friend.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Stern.<eos> Pleasure to see you again.<eos> James St. Patrick.<eos> Oh, your wife's name is Tasha, right?<eos> Can you tell me where to find Mr. Stern?<eos> Well, you won't find him in a bathroom doing something with someone he shouldn't.<eos> Or you will.
- But how will you get there?<eos> - I've asked Mr Stark if I can ride in the front of one of the cars.<eos> Well, you've got a nerve!<eos> Mr Carson won't like that.<eos> Even Mr Carson can't always have it his own way.<eos> - Ooh... - Lady Mary's out, miss, and I don't know when she'll be back.<eos> Who shall I say has called?<eos> - I'll wait. - Er...<eos> Lady Mary could be hours, so there's no point in waiting.<eos> - I will, all the same.
In 20 years' time, there won't be a house of this size still standing that isn't an institution.<eos> One pound, seventeen and six.<eos> And sold!<eos> That's it.<eos> They're in the drawing room, they've got coffee and we're done.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Not very good.<eos> I'm sure it's not as bad as you say.<eos> Mr Henderson will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
You didn't put up much of a fight.<eos> - When are you going to learn to take responsibility for your own actions?<eos> Maybe when you do, mom.<eos> I was 20 years old.<eos> Well, I was 17 when my father summoned me back to Russia to tell me that he was a KGB general and it was time for me to do my patriotic duty, which I did.<eos> And still, I accept that as a choice.<eos> One that I have carried the burden of every day since I made it.<eos> We're gonna keep running for the rest of our lives.<eos> - Until they find us.<eos> - They won't.
You are beautiful, madam.<eos> You are kind, sir.<eos> I have always believed, when I meet my match, I shall know it.<eos> I wish to marry for love.<eos> - I have had many offers, sir...<eos> - I'm sure you have!<eos> - And when you marry, you wish to marry only for love?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, then, why not marry a stable boy, or a footman?<eos> Perhaps I will, sir.
You have to do something.<eos> - I'll be back here with a court order.<eos> [man] Our lawyers will have one too.<eos> Guess we all know what your word is worth, don't we, Detective?<eos> What did you do, Walt?<eos> [Morty] He came to see me with the documents, which are no longer in my possession, then he made the call to Major Halpert, surrendering.<eos> Your son's a hero.<eos> Your son is a traitor.<eos> - History will determine that.<eos> - No, sir. [Halpert] Court-Martial will.
He was a regular here at Sexoholics Anonymous.<eos> How'd your prints wind up on his lighter?<eos> I bummed a smoke off him last week.<eos> I'm trying to quit that, too, but...<eos> Body wants what it wants.<eos> Right, detective?<eos> Right now, this body only wants an alibi.<eos> I was upstate visiting my sister until this morning.<eos> - You can check with her.<eos> - We will.
-GPS: One in Tomstad phone.<eos> I called the task force as well.<eos> Should we not stop him and ask where he is going?<eos> "Wait."<eos> Hey, can I call you?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> I will.
It's of the utmost importance.<eos> What, did you honestly think that you could just walk into this camp and demand an audience with the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army?<eos> Well, I won't talk with anyone else.<eos> You realize that you've crossed over military lines wearing civilian clothing?<eos> That means that you can be hanged as a spy if I determine that your intentions are insincere.<eos> So, please, for your own sake, what is it you have to say?<eos> No?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Then you can just sit here until we ring in the new year.<eos> Not without your commander, you won't.
Prudence Stanley here.<eos> Could I speak to my niece, please?<eos> It's your aunt.<eos> ~ Aunt Prudence?<eos> ~ 'Phryne? '<eos> I was wondering if you were planning to return for lunch today.<eos> I've decided to stay because Mr Butler is making shepherd's pie and you know how much I love it.<eos> Tell Mr Butler to set an extra place.<eos> I'll be there immediately.<eos> Yes, I will.
Um, a store.<eos> What store?<eos> - My mum bought them.<eos> - What colour are they?<eos> They're brown.<eos> I'm trying to make him conscious of his reality, so he snaps out of his panic.<eos> - They're brown.<eos> - I googled it.<eos> - I don't think it'll work.<eos> - It won't.
Come on, Zeek.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Just a little bit more.<eos> Yeah, I'm coming, Millie, coming.<eos> You know, we've heard about this view for so many years, and we've never gotten up here.<eos> Yeah, okay, we'll...<eos> we'll see it all, Millie.<eos> - We'll see it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Morning.<eos> So that happened.<eos> It did, didn't it?<eos> I'm pretty sure... pretty sure it did.<eos> I'm pretty sure it's needs to happen again.<eos> We need to...<eos> We do still need to talk.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay, just...<eos> - We will.
Um, the door's locked because I am looking for my robe, sweetheart.<eos> And let me find it.<eos> So as soon as I find my robe, um, then you can come in, which is right now.<eos> Hi.<eos> So what's up?<eos> Mom, I left my flute at Dad's.<eos> - Okay. Well, what...<eos> - And I need it for band today.<eos> Good, well, we will go by his house on the way to school.<eos> No, we won't.
[inhales] Well, I guess I could talk to some Vice cops, and ask them to keep an eye out, but short of her getting arrested...<eos> - Couldn't we go looking for her?<eos> - No. Absolutely not.<eos> You most certainly cannot.<eos> That's a horrible part of town.<eos> It's not just prostitution, there's a major gang presence, and Kiara's not...<eos> The girls working there are not working for themselves. They have pimps, who have them brainwashed and on drugs.<eos> And the girl that you would find down on El Cajon is not the Kiara you know.<eos> So please, promise me that you will not go down there looking for her.<eos> I won't.
All right?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> They're making me leave tonight.<eos> There's a plane.<eos> Do the kids know?<eos> The soldiers took my phone before I could call them.<eos> When you see them, tell them that their letters kept me sane.<eos> Okay?<eos> Or... saner than I would've been.<eos> I will.
Chuck, you don't have to do that yourself.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> I'm glad we're doing this here.<eos> This is where they belong.<eos> People are saying terrorists might be behind this.<eos> I heard that, too.<eos> But why just us?<eos> Wouldn't they take out all of North America?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe they will.
So he just dropped the charges?<eos> Yeah, he must have had a change of heart.<eos> Must've done.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> Good to have you back, Detective Drummond.<eos> - Thank you, Detective Voss. - SHE LAUGHS<eos> Spoken to Jill yet?<eos> No.<eos> She'll come round.<eos> No, she won't.
I'm fine, Henry.<eos> You didn't seem fine when we ran into Ursula and Cruella.<eos> Well...<eos> I suppose that's because they remind me of a time in my life I'd rather forget.<eos> Time when I was a true villain.<eos> It makes me doubt if my happy ending's even possible. You can't think like that.<eos> I know, but sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be as happy as I was when it was just you, me, Robin Hood, and Roland.<eos> That feeling was, uh... [ whispering ] The closest I've ever been to happy.<eos> I wanna get back to that.<eos> You will, mom.
In the meantime, we'll talk to Keith Bradshaw.<eos> Told you I'd be back.<eos> What do you want, a medal?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Have you thought any about what we discussed last time?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
What's that?<eos> Knowing that you can never get them years back, especially if you didn't do it, you know?<eos> Especially if they cracked you up until you said you did it.<eos> Maybe cracked you deep enough to make you believe you did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'd be hard to come back from.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Nothing's ever gonna happen with me and Daniel.<eos> Can't.<eos> It won't.
No, thanks.<eos> I'll sleep on the couch.<eos> Are things going that bad?<eos> Let's say I need to take a break.<eos> You're staying here for how long?<eos> I'll take the 9am train to Montpellier.<eos> Can I take some days off?<eos> No problem.<eos> - She didn't come?<eos> - She will.
[ Roars ]<eos> Stay close, Senator.<eos> We've gotta get Trayvis out of here!<eos> Follow us.<eos> [ Laughing ]<eos> Was really hoping that shuttle would still be here.<eos> And that's not the ride we're looking for.<eos> Agent Kallus, they must not escape!<eos> They haven't, Minister.<eos> They won't.
I just want to know you're doing better than you smell.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> This lone wolf?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm a free man running wild and free.<eos> You said free twice.<eos> Well, that's how free I be.<eos> How's John?<eos> - Say hi to him for me, I guess.<eos> - Sure. I will.
We get out of here before the security feeds come back online, they'll never know.<eos> Let's hope Dutch is already on board.<eos> All docking bays shut down until future approval.<eos> Lucy, instigate reboot protocol.<eos> Critical systems only.<eos> John, I cannot disengage while the Rack is in lockdown.<eos> - Balls.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> No, Jaqobis.<eos> I will.
You should just stay with Walt.<eos> It'll be a lot safer for you with a man around.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> Boyfriend gave me a key.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To talk.<eos> Where is your, uh, friend Gab?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me where she is, and this'll stop.<eos> No, it won't.
Thank you.<eos> My presentation is about marriage law.<eos> This is me, Garrett.<eos> I'm in your class.<eos> This is Stacy.<eos> She is in our class as well.<eos> This is what I want.<eos> Oh, Garrett.<eos> Stacy, will you marry me?<eos> Oh. Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!
You may have resigned from Stoneheart, but you haven't resigned from Eldritch Palmer.<eos> You remind me very much of your father.<eos> You can break this chain of misguided loyalty once and for all.<eos> I don't think you're afraid of him.<eos> I think you think it's too late.<eos> That evil has already won.<eos> I don't believe that for a second.<eos> When you change your mind, we can be reached at this address.<eos> I'm not gonna change my mind.<eos> Yes, you will.
Previously on "The Strain"...<eos> You may have resigned from Stoneheart, but you haven't resigned from Eldritch Palmer.<eos> You can break this chain of misguided loyalty once and for all.<eos> - I'm not gonna change my mind.<eos> - Yes, you will.
- Why don't we get some backup.<eos> - Eph is right.<eos> We should go tell Justine.<eos> She's got cops, guns.<eos> She needs to know that strigoi got into Red Hook.<eos> No, we should stay here.<eos> Eichorst will come for me.<eos> I know it.<eos> We have a chance to finish him.<eos> And we will.
He makes these things up.<eos> What have you to say?<eos> What I always have to say.<eos> You know my answer.<eos> You've worked hard.<eos> You've saved.<eos> Enough's enough.<eos> Tonight, in your curtain speech, make the announcement.<eos> I can't.<eos> You won't.
The beta test was nearly flawless.<eos> Soon, VAL will shape the emotions of millions of users, and Fetch Retrieve will be one of the most powerful advertising and content delivery platforms in the world.<eos> And if a few people commit suicide along the way, tough luck.<eos> I feel awful about what happened to Paul Zimmerman.<eos> But he was the unfortunate consequence of a successful test.<eos> And I'm not gonna let you or Anna Mueller or anyone else destroy what I've worked so hard to build.<eos> Calvin, you can't just kill innocent people.<eos> You'd be amazed what a private security corporation will do for the right price.<eos> Luckily, I can pay.<eos> You will.
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Thank you, brother Thor.<eos> We must not lose faith, brother Phineas.<eos> Sometimes I fear it is my father who has lost faith.<eos> In me.<eos> I believe in you, brother.<eos> This is from my hen, Peep.<eos> Make sure to thank her for me, all right?<eos> I will.
Hey, mister, you got mold in that locker room.<eos> That shit is a health hazard.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> You're not even a member here.<eos> You said we was gonna work something out, right?<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> So today I'm a member.<eos> And you better clean that locker room, because if it remains filthy in here, I will fuck with you.<eos> Okay, I'll... I'll take a look.<eos> Damn right, you will.
And you better clean that locker room, because if it remains filthy in here, I will fuck with you.<eos> Okay, I'll... I'll take a look.<eos> Damn right, you will.<eos> Shirley's the main part.<eos> They'll give me a trailer and a big hotel room.<eos> And a big car, bigger than yours.<eos> Cool.<eos> My mom and I will get a bunch of money, like millions.<eos> Yeah, I really don't think anyone's giving you millions of dollars.<eos> Of course they will.
So, Andrew, what can I do for you?<eos> My friend Ray has a problem that only you can address.<eos> I see.<eos> Ray has a brother in County.<eos> He's also a Parkinson's sufferer.<eos> Ray was working on getting him compassionate release when there was an unfortunate incident with another inmate.<eos> Andrew, it's not the time...<eos> We would appreciate it if you would expedite his release.<eos> And if he gets out and fucks up again?<eos> He won't.
I just really think I need to go to bed.<eos> This early?<eos> You feeling all right?<eos> I'm fried.<eos> Coach killed us today.<eos> I'm running the 800 and the 1,500.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go rest.<eos> I don't want you getting sick.<eos> I won't.
I-I don't know.<eos> I haven't decided yet.<eos> What?<eos> I'm glad you got it.<eos> I am.<eos> But...<eos> I have needs, too.<eos> Like what?<eos> I need to know that you're not gonna run away again.<eos> I won't.
I see an opportunity.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> There's a new wave coming into D.C.<eos> If I can help a Congressman do something opportune -- uh, block an appointment that his party is desperate to kill, say -- he's in my debt.<eos> It's money in the bank. The future, Jane.<eos> That's what I'm thinking about.<eos> Screwing Dennis Abbott -- that's just icing on the cake.<eos> It won't work.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
I want them gone.<eos> I should have come to you first.<eos> Everything's going to be all right.<eos> Alex knew I was lying about all those nights that I wasn't here.<eos> I reached for the only explanation that he wouldn't have considered.<eos> And it worked.<eos> You know what would have happened if you couldn't convince him?<eos> The SVR would have killed us.<eos> I'm afraid he'll never forgive me.<eos> He will.
Well, what are you thinking, Frankie?<eos> Shadow puppets?<eos> You wanna mime something?<eos> Mom figures things ou! She makes leaps!<eos> Like, do you remember the time when I told her I needed a more manly deodorant, and she guessed that I was having sex with Ann Tomasino?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> - You will?
Pouchy as in the crime lord that cut off Vic's finger?<eos> Maybe.<eos> There are not two Pouchies, darling.<eos> Sinto muito.<eos> I'm confident that we will get past this and we will make a lot of money together, am I right?<eos> So, tune-ups and oil changes, too, or, uh...<eos> I just got a new car, and if you go to the dealer for...<eos> My Uncle worries you're not taking us seriously.<eos> No! You'll get the money!<eos> He will!
- You have 70 seconds.<eos> - Why 70?<eos> Do you really want to waste your time while I explain my algorithm?<eos> Right, all right, so I pulled a still from the security footage of your attempted mugging and sent it to the nearby precincts.<eos> We ID'd one of the mopes, and that's his apartment.<eos> I thought maybe you would want to do the honors.<eos> And you think this will make everything you did better?<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> It was Gina's idea, so...<eos> - It will.
'Cause I was just talking to a former Cardinal, a friend, Al Neely.<eos> Al "The Ape" Neely?<eos> Yeah, we played together at Nebraska.<eos> He, uh-- he married that actress, Isabella Ricci?<eos> Well, anyway, she's been twisting his arm, trying to get him to go see somebody about their bedroom problems.<eos> They'd heard of you and, uh... about flipped when I told them we were neighbors.<eos> They wanted me to put in a good word, you know? Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.<eos> You don't have to put in a good word.<eos> Just have them call the office.<eos> All right, I will.
It's all a part of the process.<eos> But for now, your chest only, okay?<eos> It feels so good.<eos> Could you maybe...<eos> Not on the first visit.<eos> It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.<eos> I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
If I do not, they will torture him to death.<eos> Do not do it, Manduca.<eos> Do not do it!<eos> - Manduca, no.<eos> - No one deserves this hell.<eos> Relax, Manduca, relax.<eos> Manduca, no!<eos> Karamakate.<eos> Come on.<eos> I will not.
- What if, what if.<eos> (Chuckles) At least you'll know.<eos> Right. Right.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> I'm finally free to go to L.A., and the timing could not be worse.<eos> Have you spoken to Emmett since he's been gone?<eos> No.<eos> I'm giving him space, and hopefully he'll figure things out, and then come to me when he's ready.<eos> He loves you.<eos> He will.
There it is. I must've missed it.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - How about we hang out tonight?<eos> Catch a movie?<eos> Come on, tell me you have something more fun planned.<eos> - What time?<eos> - I'll text you.<eos> I'm kidding. 8:00, my room?<eos> - I'll see you then.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I'm not going to be able to wait.<eos> Something must have happened.<eos> Can we reschedule?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I missed the bus on the way over here and I forgot my phone at home.<eos> I... I had to run half the way over here.<eos> Thanks for driving us home.<eos> Oh, it's fine, I'm sorry your moms couldn't stay to celebrate.<eos> - We will tonight.
Just say it.<eos> Can't you?<eos> Sure.<eos> ~ Yes!<eos> ~ Damn.<eos> I'll deal with it later.<eos> I WILL deal with it later.<eos> They're... playing a game.<eos> If I go into labour, he comes nowhere near that hospital.<eos> Course he won't!
Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine.<eos> I just wanted to...<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I got into Talmadge.<eos> That's fantastic news.<eos> I guess Jackie doesn't review every single application.<eos> Aria, Talmadge is a very good school, and it's a big one.<eos> It's unlikely you would ever run into Jackie.<eos> Don't let her ruin this for you.<eos> No, she won't.
Do we need to wait for the manager to show him the search warrant?<eos> He's on his way over now.<eos> Looks like someone's camera shy.<eos> We're not gonna need that.<eos> What are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin?<eos> We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police with a burner phone.<eos> We'll never pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.
We'll never pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> I found a drill bit that can break the lock.<eos> And I already rented a van and a dolly.<eos> What are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin?<eos> We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police with a burner phone.<eos> We'll never pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.
I'm saying I want what's best for you.<eos> You're approaching a very exciting time in your life.<eos> You're going to be meeting new people.<eos> You're going to be discovering yourself.<eos> Right.<eos> I can do all of that and still be with you.<eos> If we stay together, you might grow to resent me.<eos> But if you take this time for yourself... there will be no regrets.<eos> Promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
He's only doing this because he's mad at me.<eos> No, I'm doing this because a business was burglarized and there are stolen goods in the vehicle.<eos> Wait.<eos> You cannot arrest him!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Have you even heard a word that I've been saying?<eos> Will you please just stop being a cop for a minute?<eos> Toby!<eos> Just walk away, Spencer.<eos> No, I won't.
"I have something to say to you.<eos> Payback's a bitch named Yolanda!"<eos> You'll just need to get your bloodwork done, but you should be all set for next week.<eos> Thanks for squeezing me in.<eos> And thanks for the friends and family discount.<eos> Wait. We didn't say anything about...<eos> Oh, bye bye!<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to say anything.<eos> But I will.
Yeah, it's too dry.<eos> If I can rehydrate it, maybe Angela can reconstruct the image.<eos> Given the state of the skull, that may be our best chance at identifying the victim.<eos> Well, we have footprints-- two sets.<eos> Right, so he was chased down the hill, and he hid in the mine.<eos> Which was packed with explosives.<eos> Eh, bad for him.<eos> Well, there was a "danger" sign.<eos> Guy's not gonna stop to read the sign if he's being chased by someone.<eos> Well, maybe next time he will.
- Oh, let me guess.<eos> New student?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> My physical therapist.<eos> She's getting her degree in kinesiology.<eos> Klaus...<eos> How are you?<eos> Welcome.<eos> Dr. Pryce, um, you promised to get some sleep.<eos> And I will...
I hope you had a pleasant time.<eos> I wasn't in Paris, Sire.<eos> That's what I was told.<eos> The fault is mine, Sire.<eos> There was an attempt on my life, so<eos> I concealed my whereabouts and condition from the person who did it.<eos> - An attempt by whom?<eos> - I don't have proof, Sire, so I beg your indulgence until I complete my investigation.<eos> She may not come back.<eos> Of course she will.
I have found us the most incredible surgeries, all for the next few weeks.<eos> Look, a T.T.T.S. in a 19-weeker.<eos> A 21-week T.R.A.P. sequence that needs an R.F.A.<eos> A unilateral pulmonary agenesis.<eos> And that is just the beginning.<eos> - The beginning of what?<eos> - Your crash course.<eos> I have hunted down the most screwed up, medically compromised fetuses that I could find, and I'm bringing them all here to this hospital for you to learn and us to save.<eos> And you'll get to fix them all?<eos> We will.
Who?<eos> Ethan, wait!<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> We don't have very much time.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, baby let's go. We're going to go this way.<eos> I never meant to hurt Lucy.<eos> I don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> - Ever.<eos> - And you never will, Ethan.
No.<eos> Let him tell the others.<eos> They'll come for their friend.<eos> And we will be waiting.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> What is this?<eos> We haven't done anything.<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
I mean, that makes no sense.<eos> This coming from the girl who burned her house down.<eos> Do you think she's trying to cut off all ties to her past?<eos> I certainly don't think she's having a yard sale, Elena.<eos> Ok. Why are you getting mad at me?<eos> I'm not the one who did this.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just gonna look around campus, but maybe someone's seen her.<eos> Just let me know if you find anything, ok?<eos> All right. I will.
I won't be.<eos> This is the direction he'd come in.<eos> If he sends up a signal, it'll be from out there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or it... it won't be.<eos> When we go out there, it's never easy, it's never simple.<eos> It's always a fight.<eos> But we've come back from harder things.<eos> From further away.<eos> Glenn, Daryl, Abraham, and Sasha, they will, too.
I love you, okay?<eos> Mmm. I should probably hit the road.<eos> I'll be back before for dinner, but... what time do you think you'll get...<eos> ...off?<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Do you know how many blonde women there are in Manhattan?<eos> Okay, but you have to admit that could have been Carol.<eos> Along with the other three random blondes that you thought were her, too.<eos> Codependency or not, Bob and Carol are still out there, and if they catch us off guard...<eos> They won't.
Everything is not okay.<eos> I can't tell Elizabeth about Lori, Carter,<eos> I already told you why.<eos> Okay, but...<eos> You are not giving her a chance and you're not giving yourself a chance to get past this.<eos> Dad, this is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> Not my abduction, not the egg donor stuff, this one.<eos> You can't just bury something like this.<eos> If you tell her now, she might forgive you.<eos> - She won't.
let me be the one to tell her.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I need to see her face when she finds out.<eos> It's the only way I'll know if she has feelings for Josh.<eos> Okay, but I'm the one that's been keeping this from her, so I should be the one to tell her.<eos> You can stay in my hotel room.<eos> I don't think that-- really?<eos> Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.<eos> Promise me you'll tell her.<eos> I will.
She's smart. If we want anything to stick, we have to catch her red-handed.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> It'll be fish in a barrel.<eos> Two to three dozen beautiful women roaming the room waiting to be asked on a date.<eos> You will slip in.<eos> Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
Problem is, he knows how to cover his tracks.<eos> Yes, that's what Cat said. That's why I sprayed him.<eos> Right in the face, too.<eos> Oh, that-a-girl.<eos> Wh-What are you doing?<eos> Where am I?<eos> 160 stories below the city... in tunnels built long ago.<eos> And long forgotten.<eos> You'd never find your way out, even if I let you.<eos> Which I won't.
One serum-enhanced shooter.<eos> Still, JT said that both bullets had small, identical nicks on them.<eos> But the one that killed Agent Thomas? It had trace amounts of plastic on it.<eos> Which is why we have to get back into that room and see what it might've hit.<eos> It could bring us closer to the shooter.<eos> Catherine, come on, those agents have been in and out of that room all day long.<eos> Okay?<eos> They're here, still, right now.<eos> If we get caught...<eos> We won't.
That's coarse.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Just turn the knob.<eos> Don't bark at me.<eos> I'm not!<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just frustrated I can't do anything with this stupid hand.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> I'm here trying to play scientist, when I really should be trying to make captain.<eos> And you will.
I came to say good-bye.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You have Tommy now.<eos> You know, I always wondered if you two would've liked each other.<eos> Probably not.<eos> You love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I love you too.<eos> I always will.
We agreed to think about asking her.<eos> But there's no point.<eos> She doesn't like you.<eos> Maybe she'll like me.<eos> You ever consider that?<eos> Maybe she'll like me.<eos> I got confidence.<eos> Ladies love that.<eos> No, she won't like you.<eos> She won't.
Reason number five.<eos> Uh, this just in... you're not rich and Chanel is loaded.<eos> So, huh, doi, Neckbrace, that's who I'm bringing home to meet my parents.<eos> Well...<eos> I guess we'll just have to see how it goes bringing Chanel home for Thanksgiving.<eos> Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.
Maybe Folkmore didn't know.<eos> Karen died before Peter cold give him the tape.<eos> You think he would hold on to it for all those years?<eos> Well, it's possible.<eos> The tape would have been his last memory of his mother, so he kept it for himself.<eos> Something must have happened to the original recording.<eos> [Cell phone rings] There's our trigger.<eos> He's not going to stop until he replaces what he lost.<eos> Hey, sweetness, give it to me good.<eos> I will.
This is an irritating region.<eos> The food is vile, it's too hot, and there is no love for Rome or me!<eos> You shall change that.<eos> I thought perhaps...<eos> A statue.<eos> Yes.<eos> Statues of you across the empire, from Gaul to Egypt.<eos> Yes.<eos> We shall have one in this very room.<eos> We will.
Who knew nails were so long?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But it gives me an idea for the next event.<eos> Who can make a hole in the counter first?<eos> Go!<eos> Oh, we're really gonna regret this!<eos> I'll fix it later...<eos> With my hammer!<eos> No, you won't!
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...<eos> I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old.<eos> This is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> You tell her now she might forgive you.<eos> She won't.
He never flat out punched me.<eos> Um, he shoved. He knocked me to the floor.<eos> He was either drunk or high.<eos> That's when I filed the restraining order.<eos> And did he stay away?<eos> He called a few times, but last night was the first time that he sent his...<eos> Goon friend to scare me.<eos> Will you talk to him?<eos> I just want him to leave me alone.<eos> Of course we will.
A bit of ancient wisdom for you to mull on your journey.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> You're late.<eos> Shall we do this or not?<eos> I'm curious why you requested this parley.<eos> I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
I don't like being threatened.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Father, what did he say?<eos> It wasn't what he said so much as what he insinuated.<eos> A husband's duty is to protect his wife and family.<eos> And, as military governor, he would see to it that our family was protected from the patriot mob who now rule this city.<eos> I cannot marry that man.<eos> But he told me that he'd already proposed and you eagerly accepted.<eos> No, I... I did not.<eos> I will not.
Truly.<eos> Marvellous.<eos> Good.<eos> Then everything's settled.<eos> There is one more thing.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Will you bally well kiss me?<eos> Has anyone told Lord Merton we are here?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> Nor will they.
Why aren't you with her?<eos> She's a private woman and wanted only those closest to her near.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I didn't make the short list, given our unhappiness.<eos> I am sorry, Antoine.<eos> So you'll forgive me if I seek distraction elsewhere.<eos> Find a hobby or a whore or something other than revenge to occupy you.<eos> You risk both our lives going after the king's brother.<eos> If I have to, I will stop you myself.<eos> No, you won't.
All my friends, everyone in my life.<eos> Paige.<eos> To lie for the rest of my life.<eos> That's not who I am.<eos> Everybody lies, Paige.<eos> It's... a part of life.<eos> But we're telling each other the truth now.<eos> That's what's important.<eos> You're gonna get through this.<eos> We will.
- For your political smarts.<eos> - You know when you go off-message.<eos> - No, no, no, I did not...<eos> - You know when you purposefully...<eos> - I did not go off-message.<eos> I'm the governor, I have to say what I think.<eos> Yes, but you don't just say the first thing that comes - to your mind, Peter.<eos> - Look, if you don't like what I'm saying, then don't come to me with all your problems to fix.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.
Why does she have a picture of our dad?<eos> To prove that she had an affair with him.<eos> That woman is so crazy.<eos> Does she really expect us to believe that...<eos> Well, it isn't true, is it?<eos> This is why mom and dad are separating?<eos> Tay, I think it's better if you ask them these questions.<eos> No, I'm asking you.<eos> Yeah, and I'm saying, I think it's better if you ask them.<eos> Fine, I will.
I almost didn't make it.<eos> Or she was ready to jump out a window to get it over with.<eos> The story tended to vary when she told it.<eos> She's gonna be fine.<eos> Attention, we have a Level 1 hazmat, corner of 37th and Vernon.<eos> Waste container dropped from a semi.<eos> No victims reported.<eos> It's a level 1 hazmat.<eos> If you stay, no one will think less of it.<eos> Okay, I will then.
Whatever that was, it's gone now.<eos> How's McClay?<eos> He's passed out.<eos> I called the paramedics.<eos> Something jumped off the roof.<eos> What did you see?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Looked like something I'd only heard about in stories.<eos> I don't want to sound crazy.<eos> You won't.
Gee.<eos> I wish we could go out and celebrate, you guys paying, of course, but we-we've got a case.<eos> Right.<eos> And I got the results from the test on his hair follicles.<eos> It turns out Chili did have a crank habit, but there's no evidence he used the day he was murdered.<eos> Well, if Chili wanted crank and Morton didn't get it for him, then maybe he just went and got it for himself.<eos> I found abrasions on Chili's right metacarpals and second, third, and fourth proximal phalanges.<eos> That would be consistent with the bartender's description of the fight.<eos> Yes. But I would prefer that we find evidence that points to something we don't know.<eos> We will.
I said yes because I wanted to go.<eos> But speaking of places we've gone lately:<eos> - Did you visit Mom's grave?<eos> - I've been working.<eos> The King's welfare is never ending.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
Since Mom died, he's been... angry... bitter, self-destructive... oh, and... drunk-- he's drinking way too much.<eos> You know what he's experiencing.<eos> I try to help, but he doesn't listen to me, and I've got my own grief to work through.<eos> How's that going?<eos> Some good days... some awful.<eos> All compounded by being a teenager who can't be expected to maintain a teenage social calendar if I'm too busy worrying about... my father hurting himself or anyone else.<eos> Okay, I'll talk to him.<eos> No. Help him.<eos> Please.<eos> I will.
I mean, I have reason to believe that someone murdered him.<eos> If somebody killed Branch, got to be Nighthorse.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, he's been trying to get at me in all sorts of ways.<eos> He planted those old Indian bones on my golf course to try and stall my development.<eos> But I don't go down easy.<eos> When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I... I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him.<eos> - I will.

Seems that the only thing that's clear right now is the why.<eos> Whoever did this did it to help.<eos> Which brings up another why.<eos> Why do we got to break our backs to solve this thing when all the person was trying to do is get medicine to people who needed it?<eos> It's not like anyone was killed.<eos> Not this time.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We've confiscated all their pills.<eos> What's gonna happen when they hit again?<eos> Because they will.
On birthdays the schedule changes.<eos> Tonight all members of this family will be present.<eos> Well, I don't really have a choice since I'm still grounded.<eos> Well, that works out perfectly.<eos> Wait, what about Grant?<eos> He will be here.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> We have a plan. We are all gonna be on our best behavior and he will see how well everything's going and he will get comfortable with the idea of coming home.<eos> I don't think one dinner is gonna suddenly woo him back into the family.<eos> Sure it will.
I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> That's my granddaughter.<eos> What seems to be the problem, Chad?<eos> Mrs. Marshall, I was just discussing membership guidelines with these young ladies.<eos> Her parents haven't paid the Piper.<eos> Oh, right, I heard about that.<eos> That's fine, we shouldn't've come, we'll just leave.<eos> No, no.<eos> I was instructed to ask them to move along.<eos> Well, they will, to my table.
Sup?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Pff, like, three times.<eos> Now, why the hell you throwing bowling balls<eos> In the damn street?<eos> Long story, funny story,<eos> And I'll tell you guys all about it over beers<eos> At the nearest titty bar, my treat.<eos> Titties ain't gonna fix my car, poovey.<eos> No, but beardsly mcbugeyes over there will,
Cameron: I know, the network's fast, but we don't have anything that maximizes it.<eos> We have this... race car and it's just idling.<eos> Well, we have a race track.<eos> What we need is a race car.<eos> You're really annoying.<eos> But this will be our race car.<eos> Two player, first person game, online, over dial-up.<eos> We still have to figure out what it's about.<eos> What it's about.<eos> Yeah, we will.
It's Ned.<eos> Whoa, there, Roddy.<eos> Someone's getting a little too familiar.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Daddy.<eos> Time to hop aboard the<eos> School...<eos> Train.<eos> School Train?<eos> I'm going to die, children.<eos> And so will you someday.
Tell me about Caroline.<eos> She was my Omega little sister.<eos> Sweet, pretty, total go-getter.<eos> She had an internship at an Internet start-up as a freshman.<eos> Smart kid.<eos> What was she doing pledging the sorority?<eos> It was a family tradition.<eos> Her mom was an Omega.<eos> Someone has to tell her.<eos> We will.
- Nice to see you.<eos> - Ah, Ms. Boskoski.<eos> Cannot wait to see the smiling faces of those little orphans next week.<eos> I don't understand why I have to be the chauffeur.<eos> Library's on a budget.<eos> We can only afford to get two of us in the front door.<eos> Mr. Jones will find you access.<eos> I don't understand why I have to be the chauffeur.<eos> These are the true blue bloods.<eos> - The upper crust, if you will.
This group, this B613, think about what they did to you, what they did to us, what they have done to God knows how many other families.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Listen to me, Diego.<eos> I am going forward with this whether you're with me or not.<eos> Kim's not budging.<eos> She's going forward whether I'm involved or not.<eos> And you explained to her how completely insane that is.<eos> She thinks that the government will protect her.<eos> - No, they won't.
I haven't asked questions even though you've been extra weird and super-huckie.<eos> Look, you're clearly up to something.<eos> But did I tail you or hack you?<eos> No.<eos> I waited.<eos> I had this theory you would come to me when you were ready, but screw the theory.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Kim gave my B613 files to David Rosen, and she wants him to press charges.<eos> You can't let that happen.<eos> I won't.
Good.<eos> That's the right decision.<eos> If you give me $3 million.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, not you.<eos> I want $3 million from whoever hired you.<eos> I assume it's one of the guys in my book, and he's got to have money.<eos> I mean, Olivia Pope don't come cheap, right?<eos> Nobody's paying you $3 million.<eos> One of the publishers will.
You very much do do diapers.<eos> Yeah, not on babies, I don't.<eos> Just... okay, then pretend she's a very little old person, okay?<eos> I'm late for cast clinic.<eos> You know, if this was a boa constrictor, I'd know exactly what to do with it.<eos> What?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me know when pediatrics arrives, okay?<eos> Let's go learn to use a cast saw.<eos> Yes, we will.

Hmm.<eos> Anything up there?<eos> Not a thing, buddy.<eos> I feel like I saw some sort of a...<eos> Are they aware...?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose.<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yes, it will.
Kelly, please.<eos> Please help me.<eos> I - I don't know what's going on.<eos> You... you killed Dad.<eos> Oh no.<eos> Oh God.<eos> I - I bla-I blacked out.<eos> I, uh, please,<eos> I think you can, I think you can help me beat it.<eos> I will.
We've never spent this much time apart.<eos> I mean, what... what if we can't come back from this?<eos> I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But if I don't go, we'll never be able to have that.<eos> Yes... yes, we will.
It's not the ballet or whatever.<eos> Though... though it is a kind of a dance.<eos> There's grace, a rhythm...<eos> An elegance.<eos> Oh. Oh, okay.<eos> I got shushed, but the purple prose is fine.<eos> Shh! Okay.<eos> She is gonna pull it off, though, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, she will.
It's Dwayne!<eos> I win Hollywood!<eos> Celebrate now, you stuck-up snobs.<eos> But our plucky little school is going to surprise you.<eos> We will surprise you all!<eos> Well, Lisa, we didn't score a single point.<eos> That was surprising.<eos> Oh, you'll get them next time, honey.<eos> No!<eos> No, we won't!
Hmm, hmm?<eos> ♪ Creepy nursery rhyme ♪<eos> ♪ Like in every movie. ♪<eos> Mind games.<eos> Whoa, look at this line.<eos> This neighborhood has to be good.<eos> Sorry, ma'am, residents only.<eos> Too many randos crashed the block party last year, so "Spine Chills" is Pine Hills only.<eos> Mom, you said we could go here.<eos> We will, we will.
Maybe that's how he knows them.<eos> They live there?<eos> Or somewhere else the smell of death goes undetected.<eos> You're a death dealer.<eos> Think.<eos> How could a crew like that go to ground?<eos> Makes no odds to me cos I ain't looking for them nowhere.<eos> Aye?<eos> Well, wait for them to come looking for you, then.<eos> And they will.
Well, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes, so...<eos> Lashes?<eos> The Law of Hodoud is rarely enforced.<eos> And "rarely" is good enough for you?<eos> Look, I know you blame me for coming to Iran in the first place.<eos> And I'm sorry it's come to this.<eos> But if I hadn't come, my brother would be dead.<eos> No, I know, I know.<eos> I just want us to have our life back.<eos> We will.
We were respecting your privacy.<eos> And you're okay with this?<eos> Am I okay with my coworkers dating?<eos> No.<eos> Does that mean I want you off the team?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> And that goes for Deeks, too.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> Don't tell him I said that.<eos> I will not.
For the record, I have completed my in camera assessment of the Justice Department's position.<eos> Your Honor, before you continue, may I have a word?<eos> You've made yourself amply clear, Counsel.<eos> Sidebar, Your Honor?<eos> Denied.<eos> On behalf of the Attorney General himself, I must insist.<eos> The Attorney General?<eos> Get up here-- both of you.<eos> If the Attorney General is so interested in what goes on in my courtroom, - he can come down here and tell me himself.<eos> - He will.
You intentionally accessed classified intelligence without authority.<eos> I should have you arrested right here and now.<eos> Smiling Tommy Connolly.<eos> You always were a smug bastard.<eos> And you were always a paranoid, self-righteous prick...<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna quash this subpoena.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You will.
Hang on.<eos> Let me put this mask on you.<eos> Start him on an albumin drip.<eos> I want the surgery.<eos> Danny, we went over this.<eos> No.<eos> I want the surgery!<eos> Dr. Karev is gonna drain the fluid,<eos> - and you're gonna feel better.<eos> - No! I won't!
He's right here.<eos> Get him out.<eos> Okay, okay, Andrea.<eos> This is what I want you to do.<eos> I want you to take a great big sniff.<eos> What?<eos> Sniff in?<eos> No way.<eos> He'll end up somewhere behind my eyeball.<eos> No, he won't.
- I've been to a few. Haven't you?<eos> No.<eos> What about your sister?<eos> I didn't go to her funeral.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> - But you're going Hans' tomorrow?<eos> - Will you come with me?<eos> - Do you want me to?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then I will.
Ernie!<eos> Please apologize to Frondi.<eos> The flautist.<eos> Uh...<eos> The flute player.<eos> Sorry, Frondi.<eos> I should go.<eos> We'll take care of the charges and the damages.<eos> - We'll spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.

I'm serious.<eos> Me and Dawson are talking about a fun night out tomorrow.<eos> Hit some of the hot spots.<eos> Do some dancing.<eos> What do you say?<eos> To be honest, I would much rather hang out at Molly's for a beer, and then head home, and watch the Blackhawks game with you.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, but you guys should go, if you want.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I will.
What the hell good is that gonna do?<eos> You want the truth?<eos> I think you might have left some things out.<eos> Well, I didn't, and I'm not about to go through this whole damn thing again.<eos> Then go and find yourself another doctor.<eos> Because I'm not writing a prescription for anything without you talking to me.<eos> I... I can't stop staring at it.<eos> Oh, I noticed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So will everyone else.
I don't need to know why.<eos> I need to know if you want me to undo it.<eos> What?<eos> I know you and Donna aren't me and Jeff, but you are as close as two people can be without being that.<eos> Shit, Harvey, Scottie leaving didn't throw you off your game this much.<eos> I appreciate the offer.<eos> But as long as Donna wants to work for Louis, I am not gonna force her to work for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ ♪ Harvey, have you thought about what's going to happen if she doesn't come back?<eos> She will.
- Yeah.<eos> You're sure he said Remington?<eos> If you had seen what was in that file, Cyrus...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> What?<eos> I'll...<eos> Take care of it.<eos> - You... you will?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I will.
- You'll work things out.<eos> - I've lost hope.<eos> Don't!<eos> I lost hope, but everything's working out.<eos> Tom at daycare, the play...<eos> And with Christophe.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> - The shots don't work.<eos> - It'll work.<eos> What will?
- Mm, yeah, wouldn't it be nice to just stay here?<eos> Maybe go for a Sunday drive.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Saving the world is just so exhausting.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - I am so tired.<eos> Parker. - Hm?<eos> When Duke comes back, I am gonna have to go into the Void.<eos> We both know that. - And you're so sure that he's coming back?<eos> - Yeah, he will.
I know.<eos> What would you say if I asked him on a little vacay?<eos> Somewhere far from the Hamptons.<eos> - Too soon?<eos> - No, I'd say go for it.<eos> Don't hold back, Nolan.<eos> That's what I did with Jack, and look where it got me.<eos> And I have a private jet at your beck and call...<eos> If you want to fix that.<eos> And I will.
I'm sure you'll agree that discretion is in our best interests.<eos> Your secrets are safe with me.<eos> Of course in exchange, Helena is going to need a little favor.<eos> From one Queen to another.<eos> - If I refuse?<eos> - You won't.<eos> Say hi to the wife and kids for me.<eos> We're not going to have another day like we had today.<eos> Cos if we do, I'm releasing the video.<eos> No, you won't.
Yes, because it won't be a lie when you tell it.<eos> Absence of yes times time equals no.<eos> That's the law.<eos> If you're in doubt, you don't say no, you say, "Thank you for your advice.<eos> "All options are open to me.<eos> I plan to decide in the next 48 hours."<eos> Well, what happens in 48 hours?<eos> You do whatever you like, or you delay again, but you never, ever say no, because anything could happen.<eos> Redmayne will get just as angry if she delays.<eos> No, he won't.
The point is, Alex, it's out there.<eos> Christoph will soon be the most wanted man in America.<eos> I need to know how you came upon this information.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> I gave you a picture of Oscar Christoph in New York City.<eos> That's... - That's not enough?<eos> - No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You're going to have to explain yourself to the directors of the FBI, the CIA...<eos> So I will.
But there are men outside, Really bad men, Who want to hurt us.<eos> The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI.<eos> They're SVR. (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Victor, the FBI, they're-- They're on their way,<eos> (Sarah) what if those guys come in before they get here?<eos> Upstairs, behind all that stuff in mom's closet.<eos> But if they find us up there...<eos> They won't.
They're suspected of circumventing U.S. sanctions for the last ten years, cutting deals with Iran, Burma, Cuba, North Korea.<eos> Guessing we can add Russia to the list.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ooh. Got something else.<eos> A certain Brett Smith has been on their payroll since 2009.<eos> Head of security.<eos> That's the same guy who ransacked Arkady's house.<eos> Better tell Hetty.<eos> No need.<eos> I will.
The identity of the girl.<eos> It seems she is Alura's daughter.<eos> My dear little niece.<eos> Of course.<eos> She escaped with her cousin.<eos> A much less of a threat than he is to our endeavors.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> If she's anything like her mother, she will be just as formidable.<eos> It was my right to lead Krypton, I will lead Earth.<eos> We all will.
You're in Dallas again, working at Westgroup, with a network that you set up in secret...<eos> I think you didn't tell him 'cause you're not ready to give up on this.<eos> No, when we came down from the observatory, we talked about moving forward, but the way you're acting now, where you're headed, you're backsliding, and I didn't sign up for that.<eos> I don't know what you want me to do differently.<eos> I want you to stop meddling in other people's companies and build your own.<eos> Somewhere else, like we talked about.<eos> - What are you afraid of?<eos> - I'm not afraid of anything.<eos> You're the one who's afraid of your history, my history repeating.<eos> It won't.
Pernell?<eos> Pernell, I need you to sit back down.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> What do you see?<eos> Put the body where it belongs.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> No, no, you can't leave him at Julio's.<eos> I have to.<eos> What if someone finds him?<eos> - They won't.
Because you'd have caused a huge commotion. We'd have both been sacked, drummed out of the profession for good.<eos> So you left a note and ran?<eos> - I had so little time to decide.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Spoken to me.<eos> You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.<eos> I always will.
Because I love you.<eos> Well, I hope so.<eos> Because that's what I'm going to tell myself.<eos> A storm is coming, a storm is coming.<eos> Trees will fall and block our way.<eos> Cell towers will explode and cut off contact from our loved ones.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Cars will smash into each other and blood will pour from the cracks and we'll still get by.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes we will.
Can't imagine why I'd need that.<eos> Too early for sarcasm?<eos> Not where I come from.<eos> I thought I'd stay for a couple nights.<eos> Yeah, it would be good.<eos> Your father is dealing with the police.<eos> He's talked to all the other parents and we've all agreed that no one has to talk to the police until you guys are ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> - I'll do it today.<eos> - No, you won't.
What can't? Predicting quakes.<eos> Well, that might be true, but I happen to believe that it can be.<eos> Yeah, and how'd that work out for you in 2008?<eos> Well, someone's done their homework for once.<eos> Yes, I was wrong. I guess you could say I acted before I had all the data.<eos> But this is different.<eos> Here's the catch.<eos> See these white circles?<eos> They're microquakes, And they haven't happened yet. But I will bet you<eos> Dollars to doughnuts, they will,
The girlfriend will want her children.<eos> What is family now?<eos> Be brutal.<eos> I was brutal and you promised me Christopher.<eos> Yes.<eos> Just him?<eos> And his father Travis.<eos> You might as well kill me now.<eos> The old man is gonna do it later.<eos> No, he won't.
Alex!<eos> You bring this kind of carnage with you wherever you go?<eos> Where's Noma and Riesen?<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> Don't worry, they're fine.<eos> Now, my guards inform me that not one but two archangels have found their way into my city.<eos> That's a 25-year record broken.<eos> Have you ever wondered why Michael hasn't just killed Gabriel yet, hmm?<eos> Michael could end this war right now if he wanted.<eos> But he won't.
Let's bring him back and find out.<eos> The markings on Alex's body are Father's final message.<eos> If you harm him, they'll disappear forever.<eos> What good is a message if nobody can read it?<eos> Gabriel, please.<eos> Killing the boy won't matter.<eos> All we ever needed was his skin.<eos> If you kill him, you may as well kill me.<eos> I'll never forgive you.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
Hey.<eos> I'll meet you outside.<eos> Our puppy trap came up empty.<eos> - No.<eos> - He never went to the motel.<eos> In what world doesn't he at least look for the girl, Annalise?<eos> Want me to sit him down, make him spill it?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Okay, but you need me there in case he freaks out.<eos> - He won't.
Helen Keller could drill this thing.<eos> He don't want to do it, sir.<eos> You a conscientious objector, Travis?<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> Someone who likes to live under the protection...<eos> - All due respect, sir-- - ...and eat our MREs...<eos> You're not listening, sir.<eos> ...and sleep in a cozy bed with his pretty wife, but when it comes to getting his hands dirty, he doesn't want--<eos> - I'll do it, sir.<eos> - Hell, no, you won't!
Always carried out by women and he's escaped prosecution every time.<eos> We know he worked in the same house as you and that he left on the day that you stole the jewels from your mistress.<eos> - That's true. - And those jewels were never found and you've kept silent.<eos> But we believe he profited from the theft.<eos> We want you to testify to that effect as a character witness.<eos> We're only trying to protect vulnerable young women from him in the future.<eos> He's ruined several lives.<eos> I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.<eos> Please consider my request.<eos> Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.
110 West 138th Street.<eos> When he didn't show, I went across the street to wait for him at a coffee shop.<eos> We go there, show your picture around, they gonna remember you?<eos> They should.<eos> Oh, and just in case, check with the MTA, too.<eos> I had to take four different busses just to get there.<eos> I'm sure I'll show up on those cameras.<eos> We'll start with them.<eos> Any luck, the footage backs you up.<eos> It will.

I'm just glad you're doing better.<eos> You had me scared there.<eos> Sophie?<eos> She was pretty freaked out, too.<eos> You feeling up to seeing her?<eos> Yes.<eos> I want to.<eos> Just... I'm feeling a little sleepy.<eos> Tell her I'm okay?<eos> I will.
Jess, Cece doesn't love me and she never will.<eos> So I think it's time to let go.<eos> - Nick, I want you to have this five dollars.<eos> - What?<eos> Go buy yourself something special, like a burrito.<eos> I love burritos.<eos> Oh, I have to tell you something, Schmidt!<eos> I...<eos> But I can't tell you.<eos> So, I'll...
Hey, you're not going to believe this, but over here they think that's a sport.<eos> - No way.<eos> - I know!<eos> It's unbelievable, right?<eos> Nancy: (On phone) Skiing is like walking on long shoes in the snow.<eos> That's hilarious that they think skiing is a sport.<eos> You live in a very strange country, Bruce.<eos> I know, strange, but it's actually pretty beautiful.<eos> You guys should really come visit in the winter sometime.<eos> - Oh, we will.
Messier, you got the wrong guy! Hey!<eos> Chris.<eos> Hey, hey. Hey, Chris.<eos> - Chris.<eos> - Chris!<eos> Cade!<eos> I'll figure this out!<eos> Don't worry!<eos> King, we gotta do something!<eos> We will.
Shouldn't we just call the police?<eos> Clark and I already called for backup.<eos> Where are the others?<eos> Hanna and Caleb are checking the coatrooms.<eos> Aria was checking the bathrooms.<eos> Somebody should check the kitchens.<eos> Where's Alison?<eos> - Is she not here?<eos> - She was, but... - We can't find her.<eos> - But we will.
Mommy.<eos> Mommy.<eos> Do you know what makes me feel better?<eos> 'Come on, baby.<eos> I will help you.'<eos> Shh, Ali, it's okay.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Hey.<eos> I love you, Charlie.<eos> And I always will.
She's fine.<eos> You need to go to my flat.<eos> I'm taking take care of it.<eos> You were right, dembe.<eos> I should have told her.<eos> I understand why you didn't.<eos> No. You don't.<eos> The blessing of an honest man.<eos> She still hasn't found caul.<eos> She won't.
Henry talks of nothing and nobody else.<eos> Oh, I didn't think he knew enough about me for that.<eos> - Tell me, are you pleased with your progress this season?<eos> - I certainly am.<eos> - We're both driving at Brooklands next month.<eos> - In the car you tested in Yorkshire?<eos> Exactly.<eos> See?<eos> We'll get you interested yet.<eos> - No, you won't.
I thought I might equip myself with it for tomorrow.<eos> In case you catch a thief red-handed?<eos> You never know.<eos> But it's not at the cottage.<eos> And I wonder if it might have got left behind in my wardrobe.<eos> - He knows a lot about everything.<eos> - The trouble is, I think he does.<eos> - Did you enjoy our London spree? - I did.<eos> Have you decided if you're coming to Brooklands?<eos> I will if you will.
Sorry.<eos> I have an exam, but I didn't want to leave dad like this.<eos> He's kind of gone off the deep end about Thailand.<eos> Hey.<eos> Were you up all night?<eos> I'm, uh, researching armed conflicts in northern Thailand during the time I was missing.<eos> Somehow, I must have been part of one of them.<eos> You find anything?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But I will.
Has it never occurred to either of you the trouble you've caused by bringing him here?<eos> Nasrin, please.<eos> You're not being helpful.<eos> You didn't tell us your name.<eos> Khalil.<eos> Khalil.<eos> Once he's finished eating, bring him home.<eos> Give him something to wear that won't draw attention.<eos> What if the government finds out that we are harboring a fugitive?<eos> They won't.
Come on, Coach.<eos> The day before the biggest game of your career?<eos> That's exactly when you go.<eos> When you got something to brag about, right?<eos> I kept it quiet because I didn't want the team to know<eos> I was thinking about next season.<eos> Where was this recruiting trip?<eos> Scranton.<eos> It's a two-hour train ride, you can check with the people I met up there.<eos> Oh, we will.
I'll be right back.<eos> Sorry I crashed your party.<eos> How did you even know I was here?<eos> You and that guy were talking about it this morning.<eos> - I didn't know where else to go, so...<eos> - What happened?<eos> I was looking for a place to sleep tonight, you know, someplace safe, and a couple guys jumped me.<eos> You... you said you could help me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I will.
- And who can never be late?<eos> - Surgeons.<eos> - What happens if surgeons are late?<eos> - People die?<eos> Right on, sister.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I'm on the ferry. I... I just wanted to say that, um...<eos> - You're never gonna make your flight.<eos> - I'll make it.<eos> No, you won't.
Pastor, I know what I saw.<eos> She was wearing Aunt Ruby's necklace.<eos> It's a one of-a-kind priceless heirloom.<eos> I'll give you "heirloom."<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Look.<eos> There's no reason to go to the police.<eos> Trust me. I was the last one to leave the funeral home, and I promise, the necklace was still on Aunt Ruby when I left.<eos> It's not that I don't believe you, Reverend, but I would like to see that for myself.<eos> And you will.
Callie's getting her license.<eos> I haven't done the test yet, so fingers crossed.<eos> I'm sure you'll pass with flying colors.<eos> And you have a birthday coming up too.<eos> Yes, we're gonna have a party at the house, so I'd love for you all to come.<eos> Of course.<eos> We'd love to.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Sophia, you need to eat something.<eos> And I will.
- Do what? - Tell her to lie.<eos> I didn't tell her to lie.<eos> I told her about the consequences of her actions, that's all.<eos> Oh, come on. Are you serious?<eos> She was about to contradict Brett's alibi.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> This is not the way I want to practice the law.<eos> Oh, what, you mean successfully?<eos> So, what if the prosecution gets to her?<eos> They won't.
Let's go.<eos> Okay, and... 16, 17, 18!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Spent the day in basic training.<eos> Nolan's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak.<eos> Rahm's no friend of mine.<eos> Any word of your mother?<eos> They haven't caught her yet.<eos> They never will.
And I got other shit to do.<eos> It's impressive, Mike, but you know you can't take that to the FBI.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I need your help, Briggs.<eos> The ship docks at 7:00.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.<eos> Good job.<eos> You shouldn't be in here, Johnny.<eos> We gotta talk.<eos> We will, soon.
I'm starting the memory recovery process by engaging the device, programmed with the stitch algorithm and attached to my two subjects.<eos> How you feeling, Kirsten?<eos> You ready to do this?<eos> Yes, daddy.<eos> All right, sweetheart.<eos> Feel anything, honey?<eos> Just a little buzzing.<eos> Okay, I'm increasing the power.<eos> You find mommy, you bring her back.<eos> I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> - Stop saying that you're sorry.<eos> - Look, look...<eos> I don't want to go through life always worried about what's around the next corner.<eos> And I don't want my kids to, either.<eos> - Your kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to Steffan can never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Mmm. My microwave popcorn is done.<eos> Ooh! Ah! Yes!<eos> You're going to be offered a big bundle of money which will lead to you having a big chubby bundle of joy wrapped in blue.<eos> A bundle of money...<eos> you're going to get a job!<eos> Yeah. And some guy at my new job is going to knock me up.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Your instinct will be to say no to this offer, but don't.<eos> Oh, she won't.
Cheers to family.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - To family.<eos> (Doorbell rings)<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> It's family.<eos> Okay, how do I look?<eos> - Amazing. - (Giggles)<eos> I didn't hear you say thin.<eos> And you never will.
What's up, captain?<eos> I think i got an idea to get people excited About this chilleeze thing.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm thinking crowd funding.<eos> You mean like getting other people to chip in money?<eos> Yeah, diversity in start-up money is always a good thing.<eos> Uh... All right, look, all you gotta do is bring together A bunch of potential investors.<eos> You ask them for small donations, Then you just gotta figure out Some simple reward system for incentive.<eos> They get the payback when this thing goes big.<eos> Which it will.
What is the accusation?<eos> There's a bogus claim that rice ducked on a call.<eos> If it was bogus why hasn't it been put to rest?<eos> That's what i want to know.<eos> Okay, the two of you.<eos> Get this situation under control.<eos> Understood?<eos> On it, chief.<eos> [text alert chimes] You gonna talk to your guys?<eos> I will, yeah.
- Right here.<eos> And good news ...<eos> I taught him to swim and hold his breath for the rest of his life.<eos> I can't wait to tell you about Jewish camp.<eos> Wait.<eos> You came back from Jewish camp?<eos> It'll feel so good to have Jeff back ... the real Jeff.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> I'll never forget you, alien Jeff!<eos> Actually, you will.
Dad, how old were you when you knew?<eos> Knew what?<eos> That you wanted to be a writer.<eos> Since I was a kid, I guess.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm finishing my junior year, and I have no idea what I want to do.<eos> By the time you were my age, you'd already published your first book, and now you're winning this amazing award because you followed your passion.<eos> How can I be amazing if I can't find mine?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You will.
I've seen you looking... at the planes overhead... .. the trucks going past...<eos> You're staring into your plate at supper.<eos> You're lying in bed... your back to me.<eos> Taking yourself off up here to brood, instead of talking to your wife about the most important decision you'll ever make in your... in all our lives.<eos> You want to go and fight... Stan?<eos> Go.<eos> Because you're no bloody good to us like this.<eos> I know every inch of you, man, inside and out.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
We've told them that, again and again.<eos> My whole life you police have taken.<eos> Every time.<eos> First, my son.<eos> Then, my husband... and then, you take my daughter and put her in a uniform and you take her, as well.<eos> 16 years... 16 years, she didn't speak to her brother.<eos> Justice?<eos> The only real justice is when you take the law into your own hands.<eos> I'll find who did this.<eos> Sure you will.
I couldn't do it and... you took his dad round the side and told him before anyone else.<eos> The days you had to peel me off the floor, get me clean...<eos> You told your mother.<eos> I get sloppy when the Pinot comes out...<eos> I trusted you.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> He's done this before.<eos> Fell off scaffolding six months after we married. Broke two vertebrae.<eos> I didn't think he'd wake up then, but he did.<eos> He will this time.
Um... For?<eos> Angelo's birthday dinner.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> Sorry, I can't.<eos> -I have my ride-along.<eos> -Tonight?<eos> You can't reschedule?<eos> I have to get it done before spring break.<eos> I'm sure they would understand.<eos> No, they won't.
The famous sorrento family lemon cake.<eos> I hope I got it right.<eos> Mm.<eos> Damn.<eos> Our great-grandmother must have been some cook.<eos> Angelo made this for me when I was pregnant.<eos> Reminded him of his family.<eos> And now that he was having a daughter...<eos> He wanted to keep the tradition alive.<eos> And we will.
I hope this isn't indicative of how you've been running the Jeffersonian in my absence.<eos> This was my oversight, not Dr. Saroyan's.<eos> I understand that you're angry and...<eos> You told me my husband is dead.<eos> Angry doesn't begin to cover it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no time for that.<eos> We still don't know who this is or how he died.<eos> And we'll figure that out.<eos> Yes, we will.
Just comes up with the oil.<eos> They're just burning it off.<eos> Why don't they collect it?<eos> They're making so money up here they don't bother picking up loose change.<eos> Billy!<eos> Cody and I would just like to say thank you for the big send off, and for investing your hard-earned money in us.<eos> We're opening three laundromats in North Dakota, 'cause that place is booming.<eos> We're not gonna let you down.<eos> I promise.<eos> - We won't.
It's Abby.<eos> Please tell me the president is confirmed to attend the first lady's swearing-in ceremony.<eos> Go away.<eos> He's not going to the swearing-in.<eos> I tried.<eos> He refuses to attend.<eos> I've got Sally Langston all over me.<eos> She's looking, and looking hard.<eos> - He has to attend.<eos> - He won't.
I thought I'd have a chance before the state dinner, especially with the queen visiting and the optics of that whole...<eos> But I understand that you needed some space, some time.<eos> But I'm glad you came around.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> I think about what I did every day.<eos> Those jurors... [Sighs]<eos> What I did, uh, those jurors... I...<eos> [Sighs]<eos> I will never forgive myself.<eos> And maybe you won't either.
Noma, go!<eos> Find him.<eos> Michael, please.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's too late.<eos> The lower angels are here.<eos> - Their work will soon be done.<eos> - Then you have to stop them.<eos> - No, never!<eos> - Then I will.
- Hold on what?<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> Claire, you're wounded.<eos> There are eight-balls at our walls, in the tunnels.<eos> You're gonna need me.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Listen, Claire, I swore an oath to protect Alex, but it's more than just an oath.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> Look, if something happens, - if I fail him...<eos> - You won't.
I have to work.<eos> Of course.<eos> But if you can find the time, it's so important that your daughter have a way to communicate.<eos> It's no use.<eos> She can't learn.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Have you tried teaching her?<eos> We came to you for help and all you did was get our hopes up.<eos> If I can teach her one word, will you agree to take her?<eos> - You won't.
- Yeah, me too.<eos> - And yet you killed him.<eos> - He deserved it.<eos> - Is that funny to you?<eos> - No. What's funny is I finally figured out your secret.<eos> And what secret would that be?<eos> You'd do anything to protect your sister.<eos> Well, I know your secret too.<eos> Better hope I don't talk in my sleep.<eos> You won't.
I'm talking to that sat nav.<eos> That's the new voice.<eos> So I obey it all the way home.<eos> Took me three hours round the North Circular, I only live ten minutes away.<eos> My girlfriend asked why I was late.<eos> I said I'd dropped off for a drink at the pub.<eos> I couldn't tell her.<eos> "He's been a real shit today."<eos> "He's talking through the sat nav now."<eos> But I will.
He has limits.<eos> Well, then, let's go find him.<eos> - You are in league with the former Queen.<eos> - She employed me!<eos> - I didn't really know anything.<eos> - You have information.<eos> Oh, hardly anything, really.<eos> A tiny bit. You will give this information to us.<eos> - Oh, absolutely!<eos> Course I will.
Hush, you wouldn't understand.<eos> You can't.<eos> - Why can't I?<eos> - You can't just steal a TA... a box.<eos> - Why not? he sounds pretty dangerous... ish.<eos> - I have a key.<eos> OK, this Damsel person, he sounds...<eos> It's a... time... machine.<eos> I can take it, do whatever I want for as long as I like and pop it back a second later, he'll never know it was gone.<eos> - Yes, he will.
You know of River Song, wife of Hydroflax?<eos> I do.<eos> I know River Song of old.<eos> And if you spare me, I'll tell you who she's really married to.<eos> - Explain.<eos> - You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.
What's yours?<eos> None of your goddamn business.<eos> What do you do for a living, Ed?<eos> I work in advertising.<eos> Wife and kids?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got an 18-year-old boy.<eos> When you get home tonight, I want you to give him a hug and a kiss, and then I want you to thank the good lord that you've just been spared.<eos> Will you do that for me, Ed?<eos> Will you?
You haven't heard from me and you haven't seen me.<eos> - Can I trust you with that?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Okay, look, there's a couple things I need to get taken care of today, but...<eos> I'm gonna need to leave town for a little while.<eos> Listen.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You will?
Harrison, enough.<eos> I am moving on.<eos> To a place with a doorman.<eos> And there's nothing you can do about it.<eos> You know, it's funny. When you say there's nothing I can do, I always find something to do.<eos> - Like a flight attendant.<eos> - Oh, this is not over.<eos> Said the man walking away.<eos> You will not get the last word.<eos> Yes, I will.
The fact that he hasn't indicates that he has deep pockets and a network of resources at his disposal.<eos> Share this profile with your local divisions and with law enforcement.<eos> Search for escrow payments to match the unsub to his clients.<eos> One of those clients will be his next target.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Al.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> Hey, oh, whoa, whoa. Did you finish that engine transfer on that Jeep?<eos> I will tomorrow.
I'm just looking out for my people.<eos> And you think that I'm not?<eos> Look, I heard what Rick said.<eos> Which part?<eos> How they wouldn't all make it.<eos> They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
I am devoted. Your servant.<eos> You have a destiny to claim.<eos> Tell me... heavenly one.<eos> Tell me what you will have me do.<eos> It is time to lay down the sword, Wilkin Brattle.<eos> Your savior needs you to live the life of a different man.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
Is something weighing on you of late?<eos> You seem very... vigilant.<eos> As a devoted wife should be. To keep her blessings in good order.<eos> Yea.<eos> Seems my blessings have yet to settle into good order.<eos> You have known only the life of a journeyman, Maddy.<eos> Your rough spirit will quiet in time.<eos> And when Luca is of age to swing the ax, he will have no struggle with a settled life.<eos> Luca will not have this life.<eos> Of course he will.
What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna find the needle.<eos> Remember, NATs, you have two hours to find evidence in your rooms of potential terrorist threat.<eos> You can talk to me outside of class, you know.<eos> This isn't high school.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Have you found anything on my father yet?<eos> I mean, was he even in the FBI?<eos> I told you I'd let you know if I found something.<eos> And I will.
That's why you're here.<eos> The people who reached out to my son, they're reaching out to others.<eos> They're building cells on our soil.<eos> We need to infiltrate them, poison their network.<eos> I have a plan, but I need you.<eos> I need you both.<eos> I need you to work together as one.<eos> I let my emotions get in the way of my duty.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
They have no idea you were there.<eos> I can't believe I trusted you.<eos> Okay, look, if my... if my allegiance was to the FBI, you and Alex would both be in handcuffs right now.<eos> I did what I could do.<eos> It is my ass on the line, too, you know.<eos> So, what the hell do we do now?<eos> Up.<eos> You're gonna tell me how this wire from your family business ended up as a part of those bombs.<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> Oh, you will, eventually.
- Oh, God, another guy?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm loving this sex.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - No, I didn't hear anything.<eos> - Say my name, Chelsea.<eos> - That sounds like...<eos> - Ew, no.<eos> Okay, well then I will.
I'm just babysitting.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Jeremy, you wouldn't hit a man carrying a baby, would you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why?<eos> I slept with Whitney in her office.<eos> What?<eos> Jody, put that baby down - so I can strike you.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> I won't.
Jeremy, you wouldn't hit a man carrying a baby, would you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why?<eos> I slept with Whitney in her office.<eos> What?<eos> Jody, put that baby down - so I can strike you.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> I won't.<eos> - Put it down.<eos> - I won't.
- You've changed.<eos> - What?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Yeah, prove it.<eos> I got a new party drug called Stacey.<eos> - Let's take it.<eos> - Peter, I'm 27 years old and I have a baby.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I understand but come on, let's party.<eos> Okay, okay, we will.
Yeah, Rita helped me get a waiver, since, you know, I have a record.<eos> All I gotta do now is pass the physical, and I start basic training.<eos> Good luck, girl.<eos> You think this place is strict.<eos> Yeah, but in the army I get to shoot an M32 grenade launcher.<eos> Ooh, maybe I should join the army, get one of those hot Navy Seals.<eos> Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.<eos> Shut your pie hole.<eos> So what if this social worker finds out you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?<eos> She won't.
He didn't say anything?<eos> He was evasive.<eos> - Can we get back to this?<eos> - Evasive how?<eos> What were his words exactly?<eos> He said what you said.<eos> That you guys were fighting and that he didn't want to get into it with me.<eos> Okay, now you're being evasive.<eos> Maybe you should talk to him.<eos> Okay, I will.
What's happening?<eos> - Come on! - Oh!<eos> So much for stealthy.<eos> - Here we are.<eos> - And this is a good idea how?<eos> - I didn't kill him, I-I just iced him.<eos> - And screwed Coulson.<eos> He's working Rosalind, and you just shot her number two.<eos> - When she finds out...<eos> - She won't.
Neither of which he can do with a reduced workforce supporting him.<eos> Intriguing.<eos> So what's this revolutionary technology,<eos> Mr. Holt?<eos> Um, that is proprietary.<eos> But I can assure you, it will astonish the world.<eos> Our annual shareholders meeting's in six months.<eos> Present it there.<eos> Astonish us.<eos> Oh, we will.
Well, maybe you just hustle people.<eos> Drop 'em after you get what you need.<eos> Like you did to Alice's brother.<eos> - I didn't do that to Gus. - You didn't?<eos> Well, you did it to me, you little bitch.<eos> - I think you wanted to get up. - Yeah. Are you okay?<eos> Uh...<eos> Mostly.<eos> So, don't forget about the Christmas party tonight.<eos> - I won't.
I can't find him.<eos> Georgie, where are you?<eos> Oh, dear God, where is he?<eos> James, I can't find him.<eos> I can't find him!<eos> Livvy, just calm down.<eos> I need to know where he is!<eos> I need you to find him.<eos> Just find him!<eos> I will.
Georgie, where are you?<eos> Oh, dear God, where is he?<eos> James, I can't find him.<eos> I can't find him!<eos> Livvy, just calm down.<eos> I need to know where he is!<eos> I need you to find him.<eos> Just find him!<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
Our baby...<eos> Our baby didn't live.<eos> And... I couldn't tell him.<eos> The thought of being a father was the only thing that saved him in that dreadful clinic.<eos> It was the only thing that kept us together.<eos> Olivia, you must tell him.<eos> Anna, I can't.<eos> James adores baby Georgie and you.<eos> He will forgive you.<eos> No, he won't.

Thank you, Rose.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> It was a lovely day, after all.<eos> It was.<eos> I was happy, weren't you?<eos> I was wrong, to blame you for what you did.<eos> You were going to do it eventually, I see that.<eos> It was a stupid mistake.<eos> And it will never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.
Tranny.<eos> He-she.<eos> My personal fave.<eos> I told them to leave me alone.<eos> One grabbed my skirt, another my camera.<eos> I was pushed, and I tripped on my heels.<eos> Avery, can you remember anything else about the boys, anything they said or that they did?<eos> It was all a blur of shoving, people laughing, taking video.<eos> This isn't the first time, and the local precinct never follows up.<eos> We will.
So no wedding.<eos> No wedding.<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> We're through, Freddie!<eos> We're through when I say we're through.<eos> Ooh! And I say we're through!<eos> There really was no good time for introductions.<eos> In my defence, that's the first party I've ever hosted.<eos> Who wants to dance with me?<eos> I will.
- Marcus is precise. He won't "chat".<eos> Unless you're talking about mathematics, the discussion will be a waste of time.<eos> Is it possible that Alex would have confided in him?<eos> - That's a very serious allegation.<eos> - I'm just thinking aloud.<eos> Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
He's the sweetest man you'll ever meet with a kind word for everyone.<eos> I know you want me to get married.<eos> Don't worry, I will.<eos> It just might take a bit of time.<eos> Yes, I promise I'll call every day.<eos> Was that your mother?<eos> I wanted to say hello.<eos> When am I going to get to meet her?<eos> I'm sure I'll love her.<eos> Oh, you will.
I'm in a meeting.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> You want to get that message out there, too?<eos> What message?<eos> That your foundation does deals with Hezbollah?<eos> A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.<eos> And Mr. During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Listen, if things get gnarly...<eos> It won't.
I had sex with someone else when we were still together.<eos> You know about Carmen accusing Rita of hitting her?<eos> And I have a recording of Carmen admitting that she lied.<eos> Carmen knows that I kissed you.<eos> The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.<eos> It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.
- Bloodthirsty!<eos> - Thanks, Tuff.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Writer's embellishment.<eos> Get him, Snotlout.<eos> You guys can do this.<eos> Hey, be careful.<eos> He's pretty nasty.<eos> Whatever happens to us, promise me you'll protect those eggs.<eos> We will.
I'm Mr. So-And-So-Dick.<eos> I've got such-and-such for a penis."<eos> I never saw it fail to get a laugh.<eos> All right!<eos> That's enough! You guys are talking about my species.<eos> We understand genocide.<eos> We do it sometimes.<eos> Then you would give your penis so that Shrimply Pibbles might live?<eos> - Stop asking!<eos> - Yes, I will!
That's all I wanted.<eos> And I wanted to give that to you, but... but nothing.<eos> I should know this by now.<eos> No matter what Klaus does to you, to me, to the pack, whenever the Mikaelsons come calling, you will always be there to answer.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Out to the bayou.<eos> I figured I'd spend the rest of this holiday with my family.<eos> Jack...<eos> Have you found Camille?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Here.<eos> Allow me.<eos> Leave it.<eos> Mr. Kotomichi, please forgive me if I've done something to offend you.<eos> You have done nothing to offend me, Miss Crain.<eos> It is your presence.<eos> It brings danger.<eos> You cannot know what he risked giving you employment.<eos> Look, I don't wish to harm him.<eos> And yet you will.
_ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You seem anxious.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> You're talking as if the attack is certain.<eos> These governments might give in.<eos> But they won't.
All right.<eos> Before that... you sold cell phones to the others.<eos> To some of the others, yes.<eos> Well, nobody spends all that time with their eyes closed, hands over their ears.<eos> Come on, think I'm an idiot?<eos> I told you, I heard four words.<eos> Das Ziel ist Berlin-- Berlin is the target.<eos> That's all.<eos> Do you want me to make something else up?<eos> Because I will.
He wants her for something.<eos> Well, looks like he left his bachelor pad in the sewers.<eos> Grodd's a big-ass gorilla.<eos> He can't just waltz through downtown in the middle of the day without anybody noticing.<eos> Right, and if there's been sightings, then we might be able to approximate his location.<eos> I can call CCPD.<eos> They can access the tip hotline, send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.<eos> Good.<eos> We gotta get her back.<eos> We will.
My dad?<eos> What about my dad?<eos> Well, now that Quagmire ruined the surprise, we found your dad!<eos> You what?<eos> !<eos> That's right.<eos> He's coming tomorrow, for Father's Day.<eos> You shouldn't have done that, Peter.<eos> My father's not gonna be happy to see me.<eos> Sure he will.
Of course.<eos> I need you to trust me now.<eos> I have to do this on my own.<eos> And when it's done, I just...<eos> I hope you'll have room in your heart to take me back.<eos> I hope that...<eos> You know, before Bracken was killed, he told me you'd never be happy just being my wife.<eos> Please do not tell me that son of a bitch knew you better than I do.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
You want him to become more powerful, more full of... speed force.<eos> You're fattening him up like a Christmas goose.<eos> The more power he has, the more I can take and you're going to help me.<eos> Let me see her first.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> Please help me.<eos> Don't let him take me back there.<eos> I won't...
Are you going to let that old news get in the way of a little charity?<eos> And I'm evil.<eos> Collection booth.<eos> The far one, like, way over there.<eos> Yeah. You see it?<eos> See?<eos> Just so we're clear, me helping you kill Julian is your Christmas present, so don't be expecting any socks or a TV or anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we got to find him to kill him.<eos> We will.
I have been mistreated.<eos> I... you s... you saw this for yourself.<eos> Aethelwold, your years do not hide the fact that you are a disappointment.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> That you need to ask tells your father all he needs to know.<eos> What?<eos> That you are an unsuitable heir, that is what.<eos> Then I will change.<eos> You should.<eos> I will.
Avenging Earl Ragnar is not my business!<eos> That's for his son.<eos> - You're next to die, Ubba.<eos> - Then fight me!<eos> And you'll see who is next to die.<eos> - Fight me!<eos> - Lord, we're negotiating.<eos> You will not say another word.<eos> - He will not say another word.<eos> - He will not, no.
What if we were able to outflank the Danes?<eos> - How?<eos> - We burn their ships.<eos> Even if it's just three or four, they'd be running to the fire.<eos> - Then we attack.<eos> - They'll be disorganized.<eos> No shield wall.<eos> We could be killing them before they know we're there.<eos> - Who would set the fires?<eos> - I will.
We all fall to our knees before God!<eos> I won't forget what Alfred did to me in the name of his God!<eos> - I reject that God!<eos> - I will excuse myself.<eos> Are you there still...<eos> - the man I cared for?<eos> - Are you there still, the woman I ached to plough?<eos> Progress is being made daily, Lord.<eos> You must come to Cynuit and inspect the building work.<eos> Oh, I will, I will.
I have not yet finished.<eos> I beg your pardon, Lord, but if I may.<eos> It is clear that, like me, the arseling here is guilty.<eos> Thank you, my friend.<eos> Because of my own guilt, and because of my respect for Uhtred as a warrior, I request that he dies at my sword.<eos> You wish to become executioner, Leofric?<eos> My plea is for a fight to the death, Lord... me against the arseling.<eos> If God is with me, I will be the Victor and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.<eos> And if he should win this fight to the death, - what then?<eos> - He will not.
95 minutes to the target.<eos> And the Taliban unit, are we gonna - beat them there? - Too close to call.<eos> We have to warn them.<eos> - We have to tell them to move.<eos> - Tell them we know where they are, they'll think it's a ploy.<eos> Not to mention, it'll blow - the element of surprise.<eos> - Which won't matter if the Taliban get there first.<eos> I'd agree with you, Bess, but we promised them that their families would be safe in the U.S. before they surrender.<eos> I don't see how they're going to trust us if we change the rules of the game now.<eos> - They won't.
Keep digging.<eos> We can't protect them until we know who they are.<eos> What?<eos> What's going on in that beautiful mind of yours?<eos> I have been up every night thinking about how somewhere out there there are the lives of 12 strangers in my freakishly beautiful doll-like hands, and what if I don't get there in time and they're already dead or mostly--<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You're gonna find them.<eos> Right. Of course I will.
She's the same as me.<eos> You're the same as me!<eos> My real mother.<eos> You all need to listen to me.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> Monroe! Who is it?<eos> - My husband.<eos> He's looking for me.<eos> - No, no, no. You... You can't let them take her.<eos> We won't.
And you want me to use this on him during our duel.<eos> All I ask is that you last long enough to occupy him while I steal back the dreamcatchers.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> But for that... I don't need this.<eos> This... is where that magic belongs.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't beat Hook without it.<eos> Well, my feud with the captain predates you by centuries.<eos> And if I am gonna beat him, I'm gonna do it with honor.<eos> And I will.
- (clattering) - Boom.<eos> Sit down, sweetie.<eos> She didn't get it.<eos> They tell everybody that.<eos> I'm just saying, man, be careful with Patti.<eos> She's very vengeful and strong.<eos> Brian: I know what I'm doing, Kevin.<eos> Kevin:<eos> All right. Then just do it.<eos> (scoffs) Maybe I will.
Walk away.<eos> Why is he doing this, General?<eos> His motives could help us anticipate his next target.<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> What I do know is that Gibson is one of the most efficient killing machines the Air Force has ever made.<eos> Doesn't something feel off to you?<eos> Whoever did this to Jane knew about the drone program.<eos> That information's above Top Secret.<eos> Her first tattoo helped us save lives.<eos> Hopefully this one will too.
- I imagine he's with my father.<eos> - Where?<eos> Out in the Badlands somewhere, escaping Votan justice.<eos> Are you saying T'evgin attacked the convoy?<eos> The Votanis Collective slaughtered our people.<eos> When Nolan killed their vice-chancellor, it pleased my father.<eos> He took it upon himself to rescue Nolan from our common enemy.<eos> My father has a soft spot for the lesser races, but I still think you're animals.<eos> You don't believe what I'm saying, have a look around.<eos> We will.
We'll get 'em.<eos> Then what?<eos> It's not like that's gonna bring her back.<eos> Right?<eos> I'll be out here.<eos> Photos from the wedding, finally back.<eos> You know, it must be hard for you, looking at all this.<eos> Because of whatever it is you're not going to tell me.<eos> Yo, B, let it go.<eos> I won't.
Probably.<eos> You're right.<eos> I mean, we've been stuck in worse places together before.<eos> I like that word... together.<eos> So what happened, Kate?<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> Castle, this one's not about you.<eos> It's on me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
How I wish that were true.<eos> I appreciate your candor, Matt, but my Cuba speech is too important to entrust to a writer who's simply toeing the party line.<eos> - Ma'am...<eos> - It's not punishment.<eos> I know it's difficult to do your best work when you don't believe in the cause.<eos> I know that I would have a very hard time writing anything nice about kale.<eos> Which is why I'm thrilled that you will be writing my remarks for the World Food Prize Lunch.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Who-who's going to write your Cuba speech?<eos> - I will.
STEVE: Hello.<eos> (groans softly)<eos> No, I'm awake.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> That was some night.<eos> Yeah, it was pretty epic. (chuckles)<eos> (sighs):<eos> Um...<eos> I was kind of hoping you and I could talk a little bit this morning.<eos> We will.
Same question the other girls asked.<eos> There's no cure for me.<eos> And there's no cure for those guys over in Glenport Village either.<eos> The other girls?<eos> With the first ones, I was so impatient.<eos> I mean, the woman in Glenport was just... too old, And, um, Victoria --<eos> Victoria did it all wrong.<eos> But, um, let's hope that you get it right.<eos> I will.<eos> I will. Just...
Again. 200.<eos> Clear.<eos> I have a pulse.<eos> Sinus tach at 112.<eos> And... he's back.<eos> Get a BP and keep giving him blood.<eos> Send a rainbow of tubes and a type and cross.<eos> Get his blood gas and get him to the OR.<eos> Did you find my dad yet?<eos> We will, sweetheart.
What I don't get is, if Hancock and Spilatro had been friends all this time, then why did he turn on them?<eos> Well, Hancock's parole officer is listed as Bart Lewis.<eos> Maybe he can shed a little light.<eos> You and Halstead check it out.<eos> All right.<eos> How's Ruzek?<eos> Go talk to the parole officer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now if you leave the city limits...<eos> - Hey, hey, I won't.
CPD!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't move.<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> I got it.<eos> State's attorney is gonna have to figure out your charges.<eos> I mean, if you're lucky, he'll, uh, he'll drop the murder charge down to manslaughter since you're, you know, following the orders of a guy who's mentally unstable.<eos> You interfered with an operation sanctioned by the CIA.<eos> If you're CIA... how come nobody's come here to get you out?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> They will.
Your old man?<eos> No, the DA.<eos> Then take a breath.<eos> Why? Because you're too pissed off.<eos> It'd be like drinking and dialing, and friends don't let friends...<eos> So go get dressed and I'll give you a lift in.<eos> You and your ADAs and the detectives of your Investigations Squad are all way out of line here, and this department expects and demands that you void those arrests and drop all the charges immediately.<eos> I'll give him an hour.<eos> I'll give him a punch in the nose.<eos> No, you won't.
Uh, which approach are you going to use?<eos> Jade's fall caused her spinal fracture to become severely unstable, so Pierce and I will have to repair it at the same time.<eos> It's not ideal, but...<eos> We sit Jade up for a craniotomy, it would paralyze her forever.<eos> So we'll be doing this surgery endonasally.<eos> - Which is the wrong approach.<eos> - We're out of options.<eos> Warren, go scrub.<eos> Someone needs to sign off on the case.<eos> All right, I will.
Maybe...<eos> We should...<eos> We should talk about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Jade.<eos> Jade, can you hear me?<eos> Now can I get out of here?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, you will soon enough.
Because I-I wouldn't.<eos> He raped me.<eos> You believe me.<eos> I know you do.<eos> It doesn't matter what I believe, just like it doesn't matter how wrong it is that rape survivors are held to a higher standard.<eos> What matters is what I can prove.<eos> So he's just gonna get away with it.<eos> - No.<eos> - Quinn...<eos> He won't.
Did he land on his feet?<eos> Unfortunately, no.<eos> Mugs had borrowed $500,000 from a loan shark against the value of the painting.<eos> When he didn't steal it, he couldn't pay it back.<eos> A few weeks later, the loan shark shot him dead.<eos> There's something going on with that vent.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I don't understand. How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.<eos> And they won't.
Don't.<eos> TONY:<eos> So, what happened?<eos> We were in position, waiting for your signal.<eos> We need to follow the money back to Klugman.<eos> He dumped the tracker.<eos> Yeah, that's, uh, that was my bad.<eos> You think?<eos> Well, getting mad at me's not gonna help us track the money.<eos> Well, my sorry-ass phone will.
They'll treat you fairly.<eos> It ain't that simple.<eos> I may have hit Victor a few times yesterday morning when he wouldn't look into that burglary for me.<eos> But I didn't kill him.<eos> Says the man holding a gun on me.<eos> Eh, here. Take it.<eos> Take it!<eos> I didn't tell you any of this before 'cause I know how it looks.<eos> You didn't doubt for a second that I killed Victor.<eos> Neither will anyone else.
But P.C. Principal, I really don't have time.<eos> This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Find everything you needed today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
It's a freaking mint chip cake.<eos> Mint chip?<eos> Yeah, mint chip.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> And if it's melting, so what?<eos> We move the party up a little.<eos> In fact, why don't you tell everybody to be in the mill in 10 minutes.<eos> But Jay's not here.<eos> Yeah, who will give Herm's farewell speech?<eos> I will.
Mrs. Suzuki.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> - I shouldn't have...<eos> - I don't need an apology.<eos> I thought about what you said on the phone the other day, and...<eos> He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
- All right.<eos> - District says Antonio's undercover.<eos> They can't reach him right now.<eos> I'm gonna stay here with Casey.<eos> - Chief, you don't have to...<eos> - Look.<eos> I'm just going to update the house with news.<eos> Moment it comes in.<eos> Hey, listen, she's gonna make it, okay?<eos> They both will.
Oh, gosh. Uh...<eos> Okay, um...<eos> I didn't know that you were down here.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> I called a cab.<eos> I am so sorry about tonight.<eos> I never would've come if I'd known.<eos> Tomorrow morning, I am gonna file a request to be rematched with another program, and... you will never have to see me again.<eos> I want you to know that I didn't forget about him.<eos> I never will.
David died two months ago.<eos> Nicola, I'm so sorry.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Condolences start to sound so phony.<eos> I stopped telling people.<eos> I'm trying really hard to... to just be a mom.<eos> This is all I have left of him.<eos> I can't lose this baby.<eos> I won't.
Is it okay?<eos> Does it work?<eos> - It's fine.<eos> See? ‭<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, now, come on. Let's get back on track.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll go get the cocktails.<eos> You make yourself comfortable.<eos> I sure will.
- Of course.<eos> Okay. And thank you, Mr. Barba.<eos> I... I... I know how hard you tried.<eos> I'm going to spell Fin at the hospital, keep Rollins company.<eos> No.<eos> Liv, how about we go up together?<eos> Yeah, I... I'll, uh... I'll meet you there.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He's getting away with it.<eos> No, he won't.
Tied to money laundering, racketeering, and suspected in the disappearance of several witnesses in the family secrets case.<eos> Financial Crimes just sent over a report detailing recent transactions by Tafani's front company,<eos> Vesta Inc.<eos> Now, one of the names that showed up on the report is none other than Miss Lana Del Rio.<eos> Well, that's one of those aliases that Victoria used.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now, the check scam paid out in cash, so I'm thinking, you know, hush money.<eos> I'll pick him up.<eos> - I'll come with.<eos> - No, you won't.
Where's Quinn?<eos> I told you, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Listen, man.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Hold on a second!<eos> I don't know where Quinn is, but I know where your stash is.<eos> But you got to let her go.<eos> She had nothing to do with this.<eos> I will.
He never escaped, did he?<eos> No, but it was made to look that way.<eos> So you faked Quinn's escape to draw out Steadman?<eos> It was all I could think of to make this mess go away once and for all.<eos> I had him transferred to a medium-security facility in Pennsylvania under a new name.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> His cooperation and the whereabouts of Detective Boyle and Steadman's ill-gotten goods.<eos> So you found the stash?<eos> Yes.<eos> As will
Campbell got the usual protective treatment Which of course includes his photo being scrubbed from all the files when he went under.<eos> Well, scrubbed or not, someone had access to that photo and used it to get Campbell killed.<eos> Sir...<eos> Are you implying an internal breach?<eos> The identities of undercovers are accessible to a grand total of three people,<eos> Me, the Chief of Detectives and the Police Commissioner himself.<eos> A former captain of mine is serving 20 to life for murder, so you'll have to forgive us for not assuming someone is innocent just because they have a fancy job title.<eos> Just a little housekeeping.<eos> Can I assume, Lieutenant, that the three of you will make your devices available for inspection?<eos> We will.
- I'll have Denise send it all over.<eos> Yup, thanks, Elliot.<eos> Well... you like to surprise a girl, don't you?<eos> Still mad, huh?<eos> Please, sit.<eos> Carrying around a grudge that big must be exhausting.<eos> - This won't take long.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Did you get your rank reinstated?<eos> - Not yet, I will.
I see that.<eos> Why are you doing that?<eos> Because we need him. Ha!<eos> You need me.<eos> Oh, God help us.<eos> Wow, this is a nice office.<eos> This is... Pretty windows.<eos> Yeah, listen to me-- keep your hands where I can see them.<eos> You steal anything, I'm gonna shoot you.<eos> Yeah, I will not.
Pretended it never happened.<eos> Used me as your alibi.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> Sophie, this is Steve's mum.<eos> Mrs Kernan?<eos> Call me May, love.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm never having a boyfriend ever again.<eos> Course you will.
I'll be right back.<eos> We just sat down.<eos> The girl's room.<eos> You gonna powder your nose?<eos> Ooh, what a nice ass.<eos> Hey, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby come here.<eos> Pavel, can't you see I'm busy with work?<eos> Ah, yes, you're very busy with the old man.<eos> I thought we were gonna spend the afternoon together.<eos> - And we will.
I told the magistrate you'd say that.<eos> Which is why he appointed them to help with the move.<eos> Get in the taxi, Nicholas.<eos> No!<eos> I said I'm not going!<eos> Get in!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Sir, need you to stand back.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Like bloody hell I will!
That's why I put this building up.<eos> And I made those tanks, I made my own farms.<eos> I just wish that, you know, he could...<eos> [Strang] There's nowhere that Steven Avery will be able to go to get his reputation back if he wins this trial.<eos> He didn't commit the rape he did 18 years for.<eos> We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He never did.<eos> He never will here.
What do you think?<eos> The day you go to a restaurant, you're going with me.<eos> And tonight, you're eating here!<eos> No!<eos> That's too much!<eos> You're really starting to get on my nerves!<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said... that I'm starting... to feel nervous.<eos> And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!

3,438,532,321.<eos> Thrashed ya!<eos> Combinatorics, that's what I do.<eos> Glorified dice throwing.<eos> Bloody nerve of you both.<eos> You fail on primes, then you think you can just turn round and crack partitions?<eos> Can't be done, I'm telling you.<eos> Especially not by you.<eos> It can.<eos> And I will.

All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey. No ass-touching off the field, Joe.<eos> I knew you were full of shit from the moment I met you.<eos> I know this is gonna sound crazy, but if you're ever in the mood, I know a place that has great burritos.<eos> You just ruined my sister's wedding and you're asking me out on a date?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Can I call you?<eos> - Yeah, you better.<eos> - I will.
- Hmm.<eos> It's called a hard stare.<eos> My aunt taught me to do them when people had forgotten their manners.<eos> - Oh, give me strength.<eos> - Mr Brown, you can trust me. There really was an explorer.<eos> And if we can find him, I know he'll give me a home.<eos> A proper home, like yours.<eos> Now I've got an idea. But I'm going to need your help.<eos> - This is never going to work.<eos> - Of course it will.
Horry.<eos> Hey, Sunflower.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I went to the garage to get this wrench.<eos> Least I think it was the wrench I was after.<eos> But now I'm up here and I can't remember why.<eos> Well, I'm sure it'll come to you.<eos> No, it won't.
Okay?<eos> This is done.<eos> Okay?<eos> You got your stuff?<eos> Go on now.<eos> But now... now you'll think I'll talk.<eos> - I won't talk, Bob.<eos> - I know you won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.
- Nick died.<eos> God damn.<eos> I'll call later when I know more about the memorial.<eos> I have this tradition.<eos> It's something I do now when a friend dies.<eos> I save his Rolodex card.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away in the trash can?<eos> I won't do that.<eos> No, I won't.
That's why I brought you here.<eos> To put an end to this.<eos> We're going to leave here, not as Christine and Ben but as Christine and Mike.<eos> (Christine) I can't keep doing this.<eos> (Mike) Well, call Ben and tell him the truth.<eos> - No.<eos> -Tell him.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I will.
What's the opposite of "the world is your oyster?"<eos> I wish we could just go back and meet each other all over again.<eos> I'd present myself differently, so I didn't get your hopes up.<eos> I think it's hard for me to have something great every day and to acknowledge it.<eos> I have something great every day. If we were different people,<eos> I'd ask you to renew our vows.<eos> I think it's nice to renew vows.<eos> Maybe we are different people.<eos> Call when you get there!<eos> We will, Fox.
No, no.<eos> We're not going to town.<eos> Go over there.<eos> This is where my mother jumped from and killed herself...<eos> She was abandoned.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She was all alone.<eos> The man she loved left and took her life with him.<eos> I will never leave you.<eos> I won't.
Just waiting to be picked.<eos> I know you could use the money.<eos> Especially if you ever wanna play pool again.<eos> - I'm not exactly flush.<eos> - Well, hell, let's change that.<eos> 'ey, can I get a beer here for my poor relation?<eos> We'll be seeing you.<eos> You know, Giddons finds out that you and' Bo 've been chatting..<eos> He's gonna send you right back up, man.<eos> Yeah, he probably will anyway.
- There.<eos> - That's all you got?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Did it again.<eos> Did it again!<eos> - Dylan, stop.<eos> Stop it!<eos> - I won't.<eos> No, I'm not going to.<eos> I won't.
Future.<eos> I will decide by morning.<eos> Caesar.<eos> For years I was a prisoner in their lab...<eos> They cut me...<eos> Tortured me.<eos> You freed me.<eos> I would do anything you ask.<eos> But we must show strength!<eos> We will, Koba.
No. I'm sorry, Katrina.<eos> He's... he's not back yet.<eos> Really?<eos> Supposed to pick me up from school.<eos> I'm sure he's on his way.<eos> You know how he is.<eos> Uh, w... w... would you like to come in and... and wait for him?<eos> That's okay.<eos> Just tell him that I stopped by.<eos> I will.
That's the proof.<eos> If you choose to follow us, you follow us.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> They burn out real fast.<eos> I see it in Uco.<eos> I've tried to ignore it, but it didn't work.<eos> I know Uco has that fire.<eos> I had to lose a lot in my life before I could truly see that that was important.<eos> I don't want the same to happen to my boy.<eos> He won't, sir.
You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage?<eos> "Save"?<eos> Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!<eos> - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> You're a fucking coward.<eos> No, it can't go on like this.<eos> Really?<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You won't?
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.<eos> Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is?<eos> We haven't communicated since the vigil.<eos> Okay.<eos> Amy's parents?<eos> - No, it's...<eos> - More pressure.<eos> We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment.<eos> - No, Andie won't do that.<eos> - She will.
Okay.<eos> I'II see you tomorrow.<eos> See ya.<eos> Fernando.<eos> Where is your uniform?<eos> I've already changed.<eos> What about the grounding?<eos> I ran away Mariana!<eos> What if your motherfinds out Fernando.<eos> She won't.
I can get you the car.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - I will take a finger...<eos> - No.<eos> ...for every day that you do not bring me my Porsche Carrera.<eos> No, please, I'll get it.<eos> I'll get the Carrera, I'll get it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Told you not to fuck with me, right?<eos> - Yes, and I won't.
Of course we wouldn't it!<eos> We're family.<eos> But what exactly were you planing on doing when the killer showed up?<eos> Do you think they gonna come here?<eos> Who knows what they will do?<eos> They're killers.<eos> Well, we were planning om cashing out a second mortgage.<eos> Look, I don't have an agenda here, But I think it's a good idea.<eos> Because if and when these killers show up...<eos> And they probably will.
Mr. Lancaster.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> Better.<eos> Yeah, thank you. Much, much better.<eos> Uh, they won't let me in. It's family only.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> Could you just tell her I was here?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Of course I will.
I'm sorry not to be more positive.<eos> Fight for me, Gerry.<eos> You can bring them around, I know you can.<eos> Christina, you don't want to work for me, do you?<eos> No, I want you to come and work for me.<eos> Is that Carol?<eos> Speaking.<eos> It's Christina Noble.<eos> Yeah, I know that but if you could just be sure to tell Gerry that I called again.<eos> I will, yes.
I'm not stupid.<eos> Dude.<eos> - Dude, check this out.<eos> - What?<eos> New music CD from my CD pal Tariq.<eos> L-low long was that break, man'?<eos> - Three hours.<eos> - Three hours?<eos> - You are gonna get busted, man.<eos> - No, I won't.
Swiss.<eos> I asked her to marry me.<eos> You were in love with her?<eos> Bought her home for Christmas one year.<eos> It was a disaster.<eos> My mother hardly spoke to her.<eos> She threatened to disinherit me unless I broke the whole thing off immediately.<eos> Well, we couldn't have that now, could we?<eos> I've never forgiven her.<eos> And I never, ever will.
A true hedonist, who dazzled us with debauchery.<eos> His appetites knew no earthly bounds.<eos> No man was better loved by all he met, nor gave his time more generously.<eos> Get down, get down!<eos> We thought to see him Lord Chief Justice one day.<eos> But you live by the sword, you die by the sword.<eos> And, friends, Lord Riot died this morning.<eos> - Legend. - Mmm.<eos> He will not be forgotten.<eos> - He will not.
Great, lovely.<eos> There's only one thing that you want to do.<eos> There's only one thing that you've ever wanted to do.<eos> It helped me - getting back to work after, you know...<eos> Yeah, well, that's...that's great, isn't it?<eos> That's you.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> Well, it might help you too, John.<eos> No!<eos> No, it won't! No!
Mark, he'll only get charged with manslaughter.<eos> Diminished responsibility.<eos> He'll be out while he's still a young man.<eos> And then you can be there for him.<eos> You do this. You're going to be leaving him on his own again.<eos> Now, step aside.<eos> Gently, step aside.<eos> I can't do it, Mark.<eos> He's got to pay!<eos> He will.
Pray silence for the best man.<eos> [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends, and... um, others.<eos> A-also...<eos> Greg...<eos> Molly.<eos> I've just had a thought.<eos> Is that a brain?<eos> What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man?<eos> Well, he will, won't he?
That's... not Lady Smallwood, Mr Holmes.<eos> Is John with you?<eos> He's, um...<eos> Is John here?<eos> He's downstairs.<eos> So, what do you do now?<eos> Kill us both?<eos> Mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step, I swear I will kill you.<eos> No, Mrs Watson... you won't.
Frankie J Parsons at our house.<eos> That was going to be my moment.<eos> Now it's gone.<eos> Is it my fault?<eos> Darling, no, why would it be your fault?<eos> I wanted him to blow up the balloon.<eos> Well, you weren't to know.<eos> Will his soul go to heaven?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it will.
- and she is going to be Latina.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> And she might even be gay.<eos> - And we'll have an Asian president.<eos> - A balanced budget.<eos> And we will have another handicapped president.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> We're not gonna have a handicapped president.<eos> Yes. Yes, we will.
Okay, so we had a normal sex life.<eos> Then one day, out of the blue...<eos> Put a finger in my ass.<eos> You know, I'd never done that before.<eos> I didn't want to do it.<eos> Like, this was not my thing, and luckily, no one had ever asked me before, so it never really came up.<eos> But he asked me.<eos> And then my grandmamma popped into my brain.<eos> Whatever he wants you to do you better do it.<eos> Or some other bitch will.
He will never forgive me. Or you.<eos> - Ro...<eos> - You gotta promise me.<eos> - Ro!<eos> - No, promise me!<eos> I promise, what is going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Did you find Roxy?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But we will.
- Ro...<eos> - You gotta promise me.<eos> - Ro!<eos> - No, promise me!<eos> I promise, what is going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Did you find Roxy?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But we will.<eos> We will.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Thompson will not speak to you tonight.<eos> His time is up.<eos> For years, you've asked, "Who is John Galt?"<eos> You've asked that question in despair and resignation... as factories closed, goods became scarce, jobs disappeared.<eos> Your lives are becoming more difficult... as the life force of your world is draining away.<eos> You have asked that question without expecting an answer.<eos> I'm here to answer it.<eos> This is John Galt speaking.<eos> Mr. Thompson won't tell you the truth about the crisis in your world.<eos> I will.
Not going to happen.<eos> Kazeo, Sir.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Why won't anyone leave me alone?<eos> You're at Suzuran, aren't you?<eos> Move.<eos> Didn't you come here to conquer it?<eos> I'll kill you. If you really want to live free, why not quit this school?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I won't.
Lord Varys.<eos> Breakfasting with the king?<eos> I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.<eos> - Oh, to be foreign. - Ahem.<eos> Shae has been noticed.<eos> Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister.<eos> It's only a matter of time before your father hears.<eos> So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.<eos> My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.<eos> No, I will not.
I'll get the car...<eos> She'll get the pills.<eos> Go to France.<eos> I'll get the car, take the pills, we'll go to France.<eos> Get the car, we take the pills, we go to France.<eos> I thought you were waiting for my call back.<eos> Hi, Albert.<eos> Um, I want... i'm planning to come see you.<eos> I want to, uh, I want to come see you.<eos> And I will.
Take it seriously.<eos> They'll just keep you in here longer.<eos> I just can't stand being in here not knowing if my kids are okay.<eos> - And then if he comes back...<eos> - Rabbit?<eos> If he's alive, you hurt him pretty badly.<eos> He's alive.<eos> I put my kids in harm's way.<eos> - I have to get them out of it.<eos> - We will.
Get out!<eos> Who killed those Musketeers?<eos> And why?<eos> Who have you been speaking to?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is the truth.<eos> Leave...now and I'll spare you a court martial, and that's giving you a choice you don't deserve.<eos> One last time. Will you answer our questions?<eos> No.<eos> I will not.
Zed.<eos> I have a child I've never seen.<eos> I know it's mine, but I deny it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Scarlett, it's not gonna work.<eos> George.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't go without you.<eos> I won't.
Doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't matter?<eos> You bring a delinquent into your home, he robs you, takes advantage of you, and it doesn't matter?<eos> He'll be back, I'm sure, it wasn't him.<eos> Then why did he run away, tell me that!<eos> Sure, I'll hold...<eos> Who is your husband on the phone with?<eos> - The police, who do you thinlC?<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> Yes, I will, Rosa.
What are you, the grade police?<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool. [Chuckles]<eos> Well, my parents are out of town.<eos> And I'm having people, over Friday night.<eos> You guys should come.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we totally will.
- Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she was responsible for an attack on a military housing complex in Iraq.<eos> - Most of the victims were women and children.<eos> Well, Simone is her daughter.<eos> It's no small thing to kill a man.<eos> To see the life go out of him.<eos> I didn't think I could do it.<eos> But I did.<eos> And so will you.
How do you like that one talking to us like we don't know anything?<eos> I bet we've got more real money than all those young hotshots anyway.<eos> But I just want to know. What did you think of it?<eos> I liked it.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's bid on it.<eos> How?<eos> We haven't sold our own place yet.<eos> No, but we will.
The Queen won't like it. Nor will the King.<eos> She is irrelevant.<eos> A new navy will soothe his dismay.<eos> Do you ever wonder what is to come after this life?<eos> Never.<eos> The kingdom of heaven is a dream.<eos> Our only life is here.<eos> Pure heresy.<eos> Well, why don't you burn me?<eos> I won't.
What kind of promises?<eos> And don't say that it's complicated.<eos> Just... some stuff that I have to take care of.<eos> That's all.<eos> You ever think about being a lawyer?<eos> Only in my worst nightmares.<eos> How do you feel about this?<eos> I feel like I should tell my dad.<eos> You should.<eos> I will.
- Buffet very popular.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Is there an actual Vladimir, and if so, may we speak with him?<eos> Vlad very busy.<eos> He's meeting with his 10:00 now.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> He has very long day ahead.<eos> - We'll wait.<eos> - No, we won't.
I doubt he would be willing.<eos> Hello, Stephen.<eos> Is this okay?<eos> Well...<eos> I won't tell if you won't.<eos> Just... bearing in mind you have to drive.<eos> Jane needs help.<eos> Sarah, you won't forget a vitamin B injection as soon as you land. - No. Of course.<eos> - And you'll call me when you get to the hotel?<eos> - I will. - Yes?
You have to bring him round from the anesthetic.<eos> Are you sure it's what you want?<eos> The only way of weaning him off the ventilator will be to give him a tracheotomy. A hole in the neck, bypassing the throat.<eos> He will never speak again.<eos> There's no question.<eos> Stephen must live.<eos> I will see he gets everything he needs.<eos> I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.<eos> He may not survive the journey.<eos> Yes, he will.
- Father!<eos> - Mina!<eos> No!<eos> - Father!<eos> - Mina!<eos> Hello, my child.<eos> I've been waiting,.<eos> What games we will have now.<eos> We'll find her again.<eos> Will we?
That's an awful word, but that's what it feels like.<eos> An animal scratching to get out.<eos> Should we get you a priest?<eos> Someone to talk to?<eos> Would that help?<eos> I don't know,<eos> I've fallen from the faith.<eos> But, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Then we will.
Short and sweet.<eos> Or at least just short.<eos> In Gaffney, people called it the War of Northern Aggression.<eos> I personally take no pride in the Confederacy.<eos> Avoid wars you can't win, and never raise your flag<eos> - for an asinine cause like slavery.<eos> - He's on his way.<eos> Fine.<eos> - People will move on.<eos> - They won't.
- Do I have to?<eos> You have something between your lateral incisor and your canine.<eos> Looks like a little hamburger meat. Gone now.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Look at these choppers.<eos> - They could use a cleaning.<eos> - I'll make an appointment.<eos> - I'll make an appointment.<eos> - You should.<eos> I will, right away.
You are a spoilt mother's boy.<eos> Oh, no, it's alright.<eos> I must have just misunderstood.<eos> Please, please. It is his duty.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> This your room.<eos> You seem to know where everything is.<eos> How about tomorrow you take me to the War Office?<eos> - I'll pay you.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Got done for extortion.<eos> Lovely boy.<eos> Kirsty dotes on him.<eos> Figured I might take him under my wing, look after him.<eos> Kirsty would appreciate that, don't you think?<eos> 'Course, mate.<eos> She'll come.<eos> I know she will.<eos> She'll come... ..see us, see her boys.<eos> 'Course she will.
If from now on you don't do exactly what we say, we will bomb it.<eos> Please, please. I will do anything.<eos> - You've done it all already.<eos> - Please.<eos> Get up!<eos> We only ever had each other!<eos> Please!<eos> So every morning, every single morning that you wake up and you say your prayers, you say them for her, because you are the one who put her there.<eos> And God may forgive you for what you've done.<eos> But Israel won't.
Interesting.<eos> It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, it's OK.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Go away.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I can't...<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> We're strong, you and I.<eos> What if they find out?<eos> They won't.
Nessa.<eos> We must be very, very careful now.<eos> Tell no-one.<eos> Rachel and Ephra already know.<eos> About this?<eos> What happened to us.<eos> Oh, not everything.<eos> They know enough.<eos> If they go to the police...<eos> They won't.
You didn't deal with Hezbollah.<eos> We looked.<eos> And this...proves it.<eos> Seven years ago, the Stein Group launched its first phase of the telecommunications roll-out into the Palestinian territories and you got that contract.<eos> - So?<eos> - So, maybe you can tell me, how come it was Ephra Stein launched it and not his sister?<eos> How come he was in the lead back then, but now their roles are reversed?<eos> Take your time, it was seven years ago.<eos> Why don't you ask him that question?<eos> Oh, I will.
We cannot be compromised.<eos> Don't be so naive.<eos> We hide our secrets from each other...<eos> - Is Kasim mine?<eos> - No.<eos> It's hers. It's Nessa's.<eos> From ourselves.<eos> So, when you think about it like that...<eos> God may forgive you for what you've done.<eos> But Israel won't.
Hey, what's going on here?<eos> Watch out.<eos> Step aside.<eos> What seems to be the problem here?<eos> I won't take off my shoes.<eos> I won't.<eos> If you don't take off your shoes...<eos> I will not take off my shoes.<eos> ...you don't get on that plane.<eos> - I won't.
I have a feeling it's gonna be a hell of a story.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> This is one fucked-up church.<eos> He's not who we came for.<eos> I'll make sure the cops stay away for the time being.<eos> - Buy you guys some time.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, soldier boy.<eos> Still want to hear that story.<eos> You will.
I can't tell you how proud I am, that my seed is now growing inside your lovely big womb.<eos> But I'm not content with just showering your uterus with my love.<eos> Oh Sweet Jesus.<eos> I want to shower every other part of your body too.<eos> Starting with...<eos> -Your finger. -Feck...<eos> Off.<eos> Fidelma Moone, Will you marry me?<eos> Wow, you really don't understand the term low profile, do you?<eos> Of course I will.
You're far from here.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> At the hill.<eos> A great weirwood tree.<eos> You've seen it, too.<eos> Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you.<eos> He's waiting for you.<eos> We have to find it.<eos> You have to make it.<eos> We will.
Shh. Maester Aemon is coming.<eos> He's gonna make it all right.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Now!<eos> The outer gate won't hold.<eos> Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Aye.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
I've studied and logged nearly everything.<eos> I've taken apart and rebuilt most of it.<eos> It can save my son's life.<eos> It has to.<eos> He's in pain.<eos> You have to do something.<eos> The pain will subside as soon as the promethium finishes replacing the tissue.<eos> Promethium skin grafts?<eos> His body could reject them completely.<eos> It won't.
That's awesome!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, you look nice tonight.<eos> I like your dress.<eos> Hey, actually, um... keep her tab open.<eos> I'll stay for one more.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> So, here is my cell.<eos> - You better call me.<eos> - Oh, I will, Crystal. I will.
And furious.<eos> I was lashing out at all the wrong people.<eos> And a friend of mine suggested that I come here.<eos> To throw plates against a wall?<eos> You'd be surprised how good it feels.<eos> 'Kay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> I don't see how this will change the fact that Caleb's gone.<eos> It won't.
- Are you with the Reds?<eos> - With the Soviets? Do you work for Lenin and Trotsky?<eos> Are you a Bolshevik?<eos> Did you create a plan to finance Soviet Russia and destroy American banks and financial institutions?<eos> Who thinks that?<eos> Important people in Washington.<eos> PONZI STOPS!<eos> HE REIMBURSES<eos> Sir, is it true we won't start again?<eos> We will, Lucy Meli.
Mm...<eos> Elena...<eos> I'm here, Antonio.<eos> The boys need you.<eos> I know.<eos> Take care of them.<eos> Clay...<eos> Yeah.<eos> You find it in your heart to forgive.<eos> I... I will.
It's surgically inoperable, but I could use litt... no radiation, no skull flap.<eos> Nothing's 100%, but we could have a beautiful result.<eos> "Could" isn't good enough.<eos> Do you always get so worked up in defense of your patients?<eos> I mean, it's cute, but take my advice and detach.<eos> Emotions get in the way of everything.<eos> Emotions?<eos> You...<eos> I told you I'd fix it.<eos> And I will.
It's been like a month, I think, right?<eos> A month?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So they just pulled me out, said I was back.<eos> Am I back?<eos> For now.<eos> I suppose you're wondering why I called you down here.<eos> Uh, counseling?<eos> Make sure I don't go cuckoo again?<eos> I won't.
No other symptoms at all.<eos> Not everyone feels unwell, Shelagh.<eos> You know that as well as I do.<eos> I sometimes feel I don't know anything at all.<eos> Come on.<eos> I've done the paperwork.<eos> You get it sent off.<eos> And then, one way or another, we'll soon know for sure.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
I followed them, foolishly believing that Malcolm deserved the right to Alpha instead of you.<eos> I placed myself on the wrong side of history.<eos> I want to make things right.<eos> How so?<eos> I'm here to talk about Karl Marsten.<eos> But I think Elena should be here for this as well.<eos> And I'd rather not start without her.<eos> She'll make it.<eos> I know she will.<eos> No, she won't.

I did it the way that you would've wanted if you were there.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm glad it was you, man.<eos> They got my dad too, Joey.<eos> - They got him too. - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No...<eos> You gotta get these guys.<eos> Nicky, you gotta get these guys.<eos> I will, Joey, okay?
Wait here.<eos> - Where's Jane?<eos> - Interrogation room with a pedophile who lives near the park.<eos> Okay, uh, can you tell her to come down to autopsy<eos> - when she's done?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - We need to talk about our kiss.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - It can never happen again.<eos> - And it won't.
I... she just called me, and, uh, she said that she's getting off in a bit so I...<eos> - But, well...<eos> - I-if it's convenient.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's get it over with.<eos> All right, I have no idea how you are going to take this, but I need you to keep an open mind.<eos> When I have ever not been open-minded?<eos> And you cannot tell Sharon, either.<eos> I won't, okay?
Ma'am, you having trouble breathing?<eos> Are you okay? You need some air?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.<eos> It looks like you're hyperventilating, sweetie.<eos> Let me get a bag for you to breathe into.<eos> Oh, please, please don't get up.<eos> Would you like to go to the fountain and get some water?<eos> It's in the hall.<eos> -Yes, I will.
The Trags are planning an attack tonight at the carnival.<eos> - Can you stop it?<eos> - I can try.<eos> But Hadar is also planning on arming his soldiers inside the sector.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I convinced him to take me there later tonight.<eos> But if I leave to stop the attack at the carnival, I won't be here to prevent him from mobilizing his army.<eos> Castor, if you want to prove to me that you've changed, you have got to stop Hadar.<eos> Of course I will.
Mom?<eos> I'm not ready to hear this.<eos> When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> But then one day, things change, and it's over.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will.
Fine, OK, I won't.<eos> Because if you do, someone's gonna get hurt.<eos> "Jenna and Toby?"<eos> Melissa, you were the one who wanted to take a break.<eos> I've just been killing time.<eos> Waiting for you to come back.<eos> There's nothing wrong about us.<eos> We're not even related.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Please look, I'll do anything, OK.<eos> I'll get down on my hands and knees.<eos> I'll beg you if that's what you want me to.<eos> - Please!<eos> - Stop.<eos> Spencer, look at me.<eos> Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?<eos> And never take them with alcohol.<eos> If my parents find out...<eos> They won't.
No.<eos> That looks infected.<eos> After some soul-searching,<eos> George and I came to the same conclusion...<eos> Maybe drawing some boundaries wasn't a bad idea after all.<eos> Tessa...<eos> I'm so sorry about the other night.<eos> That kind of thing will never happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Really..<eos> Look...you have a good height<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Proper face-cut<eos> Anything else<eos> You have a good nose too. What else do you want?<eos> I don't have proper lips<eos> They are fine<eos> No one's going to kiss me, what's the point?<eos> She will Of course she will.
It was more like a spiritual guidance, type thing.<eos> The only difference was that he had a degree.<eos> I could put you in touch.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> Just a suggestion.<eos> Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?<eos> We really need his support with this.<eos> I will.
I'm me.<eos> But all that crap you said to him, that's gonna follow him around school.<eos> You know, because you're you.<eos> Are you gonna be a bitch about me eating pickles in here?<eos> Test results for the patient Carl Powell show an aggressive resurgence, of malignant cells in the prostate and surrounding tissue...<eos> You talking about Carl?<eos> Yeah,<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's not responding, to treatment.<eos> But he... he will, right?
Saved me?<eos> From what?<eos> !<eos> From living a nice life?<eos> From not getting stabbed?<eos> How selfish can you be?<eos> Well, maybe it's not too late, you know?<eos> You could call her and see.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Well, maybe -- maybe it will.
Why not?<eos> Conscience.<eos> When we got in there, we realised that there's no future in crime.<eos> None.<eos> None at all.<eos> There's not much of a future in that story, either, fellas.<eos> Come on, you're gonna have to throw me a bone here.<eos> We didn't shoot him.<eos> I'm not gonna get through this, am I?<eos> Yes, you will.
If you come out and release the hostages, we can discuss that.<eos> Sport... needs... drugs!<eos> People like me, people who create a race of super athletes, achieving goals beyond anything you can fuckin' imagine.<eos> I don't know, I can imagine pretty big, Rog.<eos> Shut up, please.<eos> So without performance-enhancing drugs, there are only amateurs.<eos> The flipside of course, and personally more interesting, would be to let people do no exercise at all, eat mountains of shit and watch what happens when they try to play sport.<eos> Stadiums clogged with obese people...<eos> - You will die here today.<eos> - No, he won't.
I don't need you.<eos> Let me have a quiet word.<eos> You stupid bloody idiot!<eos> Your father is the only person alive who can actually help you here.<eos> Let go.<eos> Hey, can't you see?<eos> You're destroying your life, mate.<eos> No, you can't, 'cause you're young and stupid, and you just think everything's gonna sort itself out.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> It won't!
I'll only be a minute.<eos> I-I'm not here to bother you.<eos> Honest. Make it fast.<eos> All right.<eos> He's good.<eos> I got the code to the gate, so getting in is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> Here's how it's gonna go down.<eos> Ty wants to be the big hero tonight, so we're gonna go in and follow our normal game plan, and then I'm gonna grab the maid and threaten her.<eos> Whoa, man, nobody's supposed to get hurt.<eos> Nobody will.
Then you will drive me to the sale at Gucci, where I will orgasm twice more.<eos> I'm not really in the mood.<eos> Since when?<eos> Mrs. Powell, please...<eos> Why do you keep calling me Mrs. Powell?<eos> I-I'm not trying to upset you.<eos> Well, then I think you should be a good employee and get naked.<eos> All right.<eos> I really can't afford to lose this job.<eos> Well, you won't.
For instance, 25 has come up 27 times.<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - No, it sucks.<eos> Like 34.<eos> Another bad one.<eos> But 5 has come up... 32 times.<eos> But 23 takes the biscuit: 49 times.<eos> So I'm playing... 23.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Everyone will.
I know that.<eos> At least, I know it now.<eos> But I also know that Jacob needs to love, and be loved, just like any other human being.<eos> And the board have decided he'd be better off out of temptation's way.<eos> Have you asked Jacob his opinion?<eos> I would love to be like you, Mr Hereward.<eos> I would love to be young and zealous and full of ideals.<eos> But what happens in St Gideon's is real, and compromised and shabby.<eos> And that can change.<eos> Maybe one day it will.
I thought he was dead.<eos> Well, he's come back to life.<eos> What are his paintings worth?<eos> Depends on size.<eos> And artistic merit, presumably.<eos> Not really, just size. (Mobile phone rings)<eos> He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.<eos> What's he done with all of it?<eos> Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you.<eos> No, I won't.
It's great.<eos> I love going to work.<eos> I'm a lucky guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here, it's my card.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Tell your mother I said, "Thanks for watching."<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Mosconi must have left some kind of trail.<eos> There are a million different hiding spots in this place.<eos> - We need some direction. - Yeah.<eos> I don't see any distinctive markings or clues.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> We've come too far.<eos> "Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily."<eos> Napoleon?<eos> An unwavering man, he would stop at nothing to find the Hope diamond's twin rock.<eos> Neither will we.
Um...<eos> Have you stopped taking your medication?<eos> No. I'm great.<eos> I'm totally great.<eos> You don't need to worry about me.<eos> I, I...<eos> Take your medication.<eos> Right now.<eos> Before it's too late.<eos> I, I... I will.
Barbara, I'm beat.<eos> Do we really have to go to this thing?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> So? Talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.
Goddamn it, Mother.<eos> What's this I hear about Queenie performing the Seven Wonders on Saturday?<eos> Cordelia, please.<eos> Maybe we could be kind to one another for a change, huh?<eos> My God, look at you.<eos> My beautiful little girl.<eos> Did you really think self-mutilation would restore your power?<eos> Right up until I tried it.<eos> You cannot lose your power.<eos> You never will.
I know this piece.<eos> It's a bit smaller than I remember.<eos> Old Cosimo's sword he bequeathed to his grandsons.<eos> How'd you get your hands on it?<eos> I swore to follow its instructions.<eos> "Freedom of the people"?<eos> Look what freedom you and Lorenzo have achieved for your people.<eos> The fight's not over yet.<eos> Lorenzo will return.<eos> Of course he will.
I got to tell you something.<eos> My friend didn't just bail at the last minute.<eos> You never invited anyone.<eos> No, since the accident, nobody gets what I'm going through, but...<eos> With you, it's... it's easy.<eos> You get it.<eos> I should probably get some rest.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I should go.<eos> Hey, but, uh, don't forget to put ointment on it.<eos> I won't.
- Wait.<eos> Are... are you...<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> Bryce.<eos> Will you marry me, Carrie?<eos> Oh, it's gorgeous.<eos> Of course I will.
Yes, but I'm sure you'll agree his is a different circumstance.<eos> He's also not a soldier.<eos> Let alone a Navy SEAL.<eos> You want me to watch his back.<eos> Quite the opposite.<eos> I want you to single-mindedly remained focused on Agent Blye.<eos> If you need to separate Mr. Deeks from the team, do so.<eos> I understand.<eos> I need you to bring her home, Sam.<eos> I will.
What do you want to do with her?<eos> We leave her here, she dies of exposure or the Taliban finds her.<eos> And she tells them all about us.<eos> Position, number of men.<eos> We can't leave her alive.<eos> We're not gonna kill a child.<eos> Agent Callen, why don't you ask your partner what we should do.<eos> We'll take her with us.<eos> If she slows us down-- and I want you to understand this-- you're trading her life for Kensi's.<eos> She won't.
Do you feel like it's working for you?<eos> We have agents on the ground.<eos> Give us some information we can use.<eos> Brunson bought $6.5 million worth of Krokodil on consignment.<eos> That means he's gotta pay it back fast.<eos> I was supposed to broker the sale, but now that I'm gone, he's gonna be scared.<eos> He's gonna be desperate.<eos> And you do not want Brunson desperate.<eos> I'll pick up Olivia.<eos> No, you won't.
I'll be happy to answer any of your questions later.<eos> Call me if you think of anything.<eos> Thank you so much for your time.<eos> Oh, Detective.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Here's something.<eos> Clark was working without a partner when he should've been.<eos> Budget cuts.<eos> Report that to the suits upstairs.<eos> I will.
On your knees, right now.<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> Hands.<eos> Drop it, Stone.<eos> If you want him to live, I suggest you drop it.<eos> Last chance. Gun down, now.<eos> Don't.<eos> He can't shoot a federal agent.<eos> I can.<eos> And will.
- I don't know.<eos> He said to just be ready.<eos> I gotta reprove myself to him.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're staying with me now.<eos> I'll take you to my place.<eos> - I don't need a place to crash.<eos> I need to get out.<eos> You said you'd do that for me.<eos> - And I will.
- This has gone too far.<eos> - What'd you find?<eos> I've got to get my wife out of the city.<eos> I have to go.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I forgot a doctor's appointment.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Wait.<eos> We need to finish talking about this.<eos> Oh, we will.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - I'm not marrying him.<eos> He's here for the summer, and he's nice.<eos> - He sells pot.<eos> - Nobody's perfect.<eos> And look, it's Cody Brennen.<eos> Hey.<eos> Norman, did you remember the handsaw?<eos> No. I'll...
Looks like a nine millimetre to me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> -Tracy?<eos> -It's Al Jenkins.<eos> I'm standing at Richard Martin's grave.<eos> -In Hazle Woods.<eos> -Who killed him?<eos> Where's Jaff Kitson?<eos> If he hurts my daughter, I swear -<eos> He won't.
Takes some real work.<eos> There's three steps.<eos> The plates, the paper, and the printer.<eos> Guess who we're looking for now.<eos> The hooker that kicked Ruzek in the nuts.<eos> How'd she characterize her interaction with Dean Masters?<eos> Went to his place once.<eos> 45 text messages between him and her over the last two weeks.<eos> - You said you'd hook me up.<eos> - And I will.
You stopped on the way and you dumped the gun.<eos> Now, you could have dumped it anywhere, but you chose to dump it in a lake, which is a good idea.<eos> Great hiding spot.<eos> Of course, until David Ronaldo figured it out.<eos> Ronaldo got your goat, didn't he?<eos> I don't even know what you mean.<eos> Well, I mean that he wasn't nearly as clever as you, but he was determined.<eos> His persistence really paid off for him, didn't it?<eos> Well, you tell me.<eos> I will.
Buy a lottery ticket before your luck runs out, eh?<eos> The feds have made a move.<eos> It's an Amber alert.<eos> - We have to reach out to Tate.<eos> - And say what?<eos> I can't magically call off an Amber alert, Miss Channing.<eos> We'll see 'em tonight.<eos> They'll be all right.<eos> They're not gonna make it to tonight.<eos> Yes, they will.
- What?<eos> - The state department secretly moved up his extradition... a day early, just after they received the demand video.<eos> Small-minded, fear-driven bureaucrats.<eos> The Russian ambassador's plane is set to depart from Burbank Airport right now.<eos> Mr. Ambassador, I'm asking for your cooperation.<eos> If Torbin Salvi succeeds, these chickens will only be coming back to Russia to roost.<eos> Yes, but here I have my chicken in hand.<eos> Dominik Salvi is personally responsible... for the deaths of hundreds of innocent Russians.<eos> My country deserves to see him pay.<eos> And they will.
He tried but... ..I fell back and it went off.<eos> And I...<eos> He...<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Not your fault, son.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> A tragedy.<eos> They'll have to believe us now... won't they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They will.
Got him there, too.<eos> He was in a pub, he was half a mile down the river from the flat.<eos> I mean, ask them, ask the pub.<eos> He'd been in there most of the day.<eos> He was on psychotropic drugs less than 800 yards from the scene.<eos> No.<eos> He was just drinking.<eos> I sat with him, then I took him back to Luke's.<eos> I mean, ask them.<eos> Oh, we will.
There's no time.<eos> Nice eyes.<eos> What station are you from?<eos> Solar flare alert.<eos> An x-class solar flare has begun on the starboard side of The Ark.<eos> All citizens must report to the nearest shelter zone immediately.<eos> This is not a test.<eos> This is a solar flare alert.<eos> Bell, I need to get home!<eos> You will.
Please, Lieutenant Shumway, I'm begging you, she needs to leave.<eos> As a fellow guardsman... just let us walk out of here and I'll do anything you want.<eos> Anything.<eos> You're not a guardsman yet, cadet.<eos> I.D. now.<eos> Stop her.<eos> How long are we supposed to wait?<eos> Will this even work?<eos> We'll find out.<eos> No, we won't.
As you can see, a lot's happened.<eos> We just don't know what.<eos> The whole year is gone.<eos> Who the hell would have done this?<eos> Did you get what I need?<eos> Show me.<eos> That's her blood... the Queen's?<eos> Lovely.<eos> Now... now I shall get my revenge.<eos> Of course I will.
I intend to start it up again very soon in a more receptive hospital environment.<eos> Uh, what... what hospital?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> You know, I hear a Manhattan straight up extra cherry calling my name.<eos> Uh, I sure do.<eos> So, uh, so a birds and the bees study?<eos> No kidding?<eos> Um, and you want to get it going again?<eos> I do.<eos> I will, somewhere.
Well, I'm assuming that it's not an accident, our meeting in a hotel in Alton, Illinois, a half-hour outside of town.<eos> Freud probably said it best.<eos> There are no accidents.<eos> Then we're of the same mind.<eos> I think we are.<eos> And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
And you really can't have glass bottles out here.<eos> It breaks, you gotta drain the whole pool.<eos> God...<eos> You are so drunk.<eos> _<eos> My life wasn't bad enough already, you had to make it worse.<eos> I had to show people what the Americans did.<eos> But I will be blamed for the CIA Chief's death.<eos> I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> - No, you won't.

If Liv can't shut it down, no one can.<eos> Andrew's a good man.<eos> We shouldn't throw him overboard just because we're taking on a little water.<eos> I'll discuss it with Olivia.<eos> Andrew's in the family.<eos> He's loyal.<eos> I can't believe you'd even consider...<eos> I will discuss it with Olivia.<eos> Okay. I'll take it off your plate, and talk to her myself.<eos> Like hell you will.
How did we end up here?<eos> What is this place?<eos> We could run.<eos> We could just disappear.<eos> Jake.<eos> We could run.<eos> You just have to say the word.<eos> If you get drunk tonight, I am going to take advantage of you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> [Chuckles] No, I won't.
Madam vice president.<eos> Sally.<eos> I confessed, Leo.<eos> You...<eos> You confessed? !<eos> Y... [sighs]<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> I will...
I'm standing outside your door.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean I'm drunk, and I'm... standing outside of your door.<eos> I'm not letting you in.<eos> - Liv.<eos> - You can't come in.<eos> [ Sighs ] I could come in if I wanted to come in,<eos> - and we both know it.<eos> - But you won't.<eos> No, I won't.
He's the only line we have on Sya Liao.<eos> Let's go.<eos> With the power and communications grids continuing to fail up and down the Eastern Seaboard, American military activity has increased dramatically in the East China Sea.<eos> High-placed naval sources now confirm that the U.S. is readying a military response to what is a Chinese cyber attack.<eos> And with the USS Ronald Reagan currently sending its F-14s to the very edge of the Chinese Republic's airspace, and armed conflict seems imminent.<eos> Gas mains are computerized.<eos> The system crashes, and they overload.<eos> The virus is spreading.<eos> How are we supposed to find one woman in this city when all of our systems are crashing?<eos> You won't.

More big news.<eos> Jackson and I have decided to have a Mardi Gras wedding, so we're getting married next month.<eos> Bridesmaid dress shopping Monday.<eos> Next month.<eos> Wow!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Maybe it was insensitive of me to ask you to be a part of my wedding party when you're still waiting on your own beau to propose.<eos> I'm fine!<eos> I am just wondering how we're gonna fit in all these festivities in one short month.<eos> Oh, we will.
- Benedict Valda.<eos> (Machine whirring) (Gasps)<eos> Time to rise and shine.<eos> Who are you?<eos> (Breathing heavily)<eos> - What is this thing?<eos> - That won't come off.<eos> It allows me to control your prodigious powers, miss Donovan.<eos> You'll do exactly what I say.<eos> Like hell I will. (Gasps)
- Dr. Scott says she has what she needs right here.<eos> - Dr. Scott.<eos> We have standing orders from the President of the United States.<eos> From five days ago.<eos> In the absence of a command structure, I decide what's in the best interest of our mission.<eos> And we have enough food here to last us what, a week?<eos> How much fuel?<eos> We'll find what we need.<eos> - We'll die out there.<eos> - No. We will not.
For maman, of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> For maman.<eos> For maman.<eos> Two doors.<eos> One leads us to the Well of Wonders, and the other drags us under.<eos> Under what?<eos> So, you're not going to answer any of my questions?<eos> Yes.<eos> You will?
Okay.<eos> - It's really nice.<eos> - No, you got to watch it work.<eos> Now, make sure you listen to the tone of the cuckoo on this one.<eos> Ready.<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you?
I actually am... the dumpster-diving type.<eos> So what is this gonna be?<eos> A loft space for short-term corporate housing.<eos> Okay if I take this?<eos> And this?<eos> And that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Take whatever you want.<eos> And if anyone gives you any trouble, just tell them that Wes said it was okay.<eos> Okay, I will.
You wanna get bounced back to juvie?<eos> Hey, where have you been?<eos> - Um, sorry, I...<eos> - Got lost looking for the bathrooms.<eos> You know you're not supposed to separate from the group.<eos> Yeah, I know, it's my fault. Um...<eos> I just didn't want to interrupt the tour.<eos> Sorry. It won't happen again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It won't.
What the fuck?<eos> Hey, Leticia, it's Norman.<eos> Yeah. Hey, I know you have your people out looking for my niece, but I was hoping you could help me out with another matter.<eos> Well, right away, if you could.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You two are the most prosperous people I seen tonight.<eos> God's been good to you.<eos> You can throw a little bit of something my way?<eos> I hope you motherfuckers die of cancer!<eos> 'Cause you will.
It's her event, so...<eos> Well, if anyone should be hiding, it's her.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, this.<eos> Well, I was trying to find a replacement for my wedding ring.<eos> And I got myself one little treat.<eos> Expensive little treat.<eos> Honey, this morning, you said to think of the money as my own.<eos> Do you want me to return it?<eos> I will.
Porn!<eos> He was so tiny.<eos> He was huge and bloody.<eos> It was 26 hours of labor. You prayed for death twice.<eos> Who wants to go get ice cream?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He had a huge head.<eos> You were built like a lollipop.<eos> I need someone to stay here with her.<eos> I will.
What's that?<eos> That you don't give a shit about anybody but yourself.<eos> Yep.<eos> I'm out here risking my life because I enjoy the scenery.<eos> You're doing this for Anana?<eos> Because you care?<eos> What does it matter why I do this?<eos> Because you're gonna hurt her.<eos> Maybe not tomorrow.<eos> But you will.
- I've already got a bit of a...<eos> - I'm sorry, what...?<eos> - What? - You didn't go to work today, did you?<eos> You've just gotta lift.<eos> - Okay. I know.<eos> Lifted.<eos> Now. Tell me more about your paper plane.<eos> Tell me about the 25 metres.<eos> If I can make a paper plane fly 25 metres. - I might just get a chance to compete in the Aussie junior championships in Sydney.<eos> - Will it?
Parsa thinks it's only fair we get a taste.<eos> The drone's been loaded with a hundred pounds of C-4 explosives.<eos> It's out there now.<eos> Erin Pace doesn't know the target.<eos> Could be lying.<eos> No, no. Parsa wanted us to catch her; it was part of his plan.<eos> He kept her in the dark intentionally.<eos> We need to find him.<eos> There's a second team at NSA helping the FBI run a high-frequency trace on any unexplained radio signals.<eos> - We will.
You all right?<eos> Laurel!<eos> She's still in there.<eos> Nice to see you again, Laurel.<eos> Helena, listen to me.<eos> This has to end.<eos> I agree.<eos> And it ends with my father in a box.<eos> The police are never going to hand over your father!<eos> No, they won't.
Really.<eos> How is any of this fine?<eos> Look, you need to concentrate on you.<eos> Now listen, are you going to your meetings?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's where I talk about how my father's facing prison.<eos> Laurel...<eos> This will all blow over, ok?<eos> Please.<eos> No. It won't, Dad.
The Mirakuru won't do anything against a head shot.<eos> Sara!<eos> Your mother's rally starts in a half an hour.<eos> I'd start getting dressed if I were you.<eos> She reminds me so much of me after I came home.<eos> When it just seemed... Seemed impossible to believe in anything even resembling hope.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did.<eos> Eventually.<eos> Sara will, too.
- I love you, too.<eos> Is opening up a new office...<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> And I have been chosen to open up the new office in Hong Kong...<eos> I love you.<eos> Wait, are you moving to Hong Hong?<eos> I love you.<eos> - Will you get out of here?<eos> - Yes, yes, I will. (Laughs)
- Hold on... ow!<eos> - Breathe.<eos> Steady. Even.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shut up! Just get this thing out of me.<eos> Okay, I can see the baby's head.<eos> - Keep pushing. - Aah!<eos> Give me your hand. [Squeals]<eos> Don't let this thing kill me.<eos> I won't, okay?
It was too salty, wasn't it?<eos> Salty means flavor.<eos> I like flavor.<eos> Ah, you're just being nice.<eos> Well, I didn't marry you for your cooking.<eos> Oh?<eos> Why did you marry me?<eos> Because...<eos> I forgot to pick up my refill for my prenatal meds today, and I have my six-month checkup tomorrow, and I know you'll go get them for me.<eos> Of course I will.
He donated a wing to the hospital.<eos> Your family has plenty of money.<eos> My father has plenty of money.<eos> I have to make my own way.<eos> So this is your idea of making your own way?<eos> You owe me $100,000.<eos> That's not including the car.<eos> You pay me by Friday, or everyone in East End will know what you did to your brother.<eos> And what if I decide to do the same to you?<eos> You won't.
I found this dying cow when I was on a run a few weeks ago.<eos> It was, uh...<eos> It was really thin, and it was looking at me with these eyes.<eos> So I shot it.<eos> I used my service weapon.<eos> Quit worrying so much, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got rid of the gun, right? And the shell casings?<eos> Right?<eos> I will.
A fine choice this day!<eos> Thank you!<eos> A fine choice, my lord!<eos> So I am married for the second time.<eos> As most of you know, my first marriage lasted less than an hour, because my own brother poisoned the drinks that day.<eos> Of course, the same thing can never happen twice, so let the wine be poured.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Here, here!<eos> Now who will be the first to drink in celebration?<eos> I will.
That all depends on what you're scared of.<eos> I don't know, cops showing up at my desk, full of innuendo about you? ♪ Could I need you this much?<eos> ♪ All of that has blown over.<eos> Felix Dawkins?<eos> Search warrant.<eos> ♪ Time flies ♪<eos> Oh, shit, not again. No no, it's a misunderstanding, I'm sure.<eos> How's it going, Morguey?<eos> Better hope we don't find anything incriminating in your friend's place.<eos> You won't.
Hi, Callie, I'm Rita.<eos> Welcome to Girls United.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I'll show you to your room after you meet all the girls.<eos> There are seven girls who live here full-time.<eos> Actually one just went home yesterday, so, your timing was kind of perfect.<eos> We appreciate you taking Callie on such short notice.<eos> Your foster moms worked very hard to get you in here.<eos> - Do I have to share a room?<eos> - Yes, you will.
Slept in the same bed.<eos> In the middle of the night, I curled up next to him.<eos> We were half asleep... it just happened.<eos> If I can have everyone's attention, please.<eos> Can all the nominees for Winter King and Queen please come up on stage?<eos> Her car's still here.<eos> That's a good thing, I guess.<eos> Go back in the party.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Not alone you won't.
I stopped going to piano for a few weeks, but I kept my dad's money.<eos> And I need to pay it back.<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - For you.<eos> For your apartment.<eos> When you were going into independent living.<eos> I... wanted to make sure you had everything you needed.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> I would've done anything to help you.<eos> And I still will.
No, no, that's it, right?<eos> That's why you're with me.<eos> I'm this hot-headed alkie that you, uh, seduced to fulfill your savior complex.<eos> What... what are you talking about?<eos> !<eos> I'm talking about you latching on to people that got problems so you can feel better about yourself!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> You can leave now.<eos> You're right. I can.<eos> I will.
Heard a ruckus.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Newlyweds decided to join the mile-high club.<eos> First-class problem.<eos> This one's all you.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Let's get you patched up.<eos> I should notify the pilot.<eos> - What if those people wake up?<eos> - They won't.
It's ok. Let her through.<eos> Well, if he didn't hate us before, he does now.<eos> Who cares?<eos> How's Finn?<eos> Alive.<eos> His people will care.<eos> How long until they figure out where he is?<eos> And what happens when they do?<eos> I mean, when they come looking for him?<eos> They will, Bellamy.
Don't make me ask, please.<eos> Jack?<eos> He is your father.<eos> And this new man is, what, some misguided attempt to make George jealous?<eos> I'll be appealing to a far more potent emotion than that.<eos> Regina's back.<eos> They say your husband's alive.<eos> You bring him home.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
And me you.<eos> There's enough there for your return flight and one back for your husband.<eos> There's something you need to hear and it must come from me.<eos> You've found a home here and you shouldn't lose it because we've lost each other.<eos> My heart would break even more if what we've had got in the way of your coming back.<eos> If it seems right, you bring him home.<eos> I couldn't do that.<eos> If it's right, you have to.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
- That's not for work.<eos> - Don't lie.<eos> Seriously, who is she?<eos> Hey.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Do I have a choice?<eos> First of all, you don't have to quit your new job.<eos> Really?<eos> But if you come home with even one little tattoo...<eos> No, I won't.
Come on, let's give ourselves the grand tour.<eos> Whoa, I could live in here.<eos> Okay, you know, when you think about it, the concept of a bidet is, like, disgusting.<eos> Oh my God, there's Chanel in here.<eos> Okay, we're trying stuff on.<eos> We're starting a Tumblr page.<eos> - You can do the captions.<eos> - Dude, no.<eos> What if we ruin something?<eos> We won't.
Apricot cruller for him, powdered sugar for me.<eos> And this morning, I got you a Danish-- it's prune.<eos> Does it ever occur to you that I have patients in actual need, people that are sick, people that are desperate for real help?<eos> So forget the prune.<eos> This is not a joke, Betty.<eos> You will put an end to this shameful charade today.<eos> Because if you don't, I will.<eos> I will tell your husband myself.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Well, then, Bill, you're the only one, because we are all selling something.<eos> I sold you on me, on what I could do for you.<eos> John Rock sold more than the birth control pill, he sold an idea, of pleasure without permanent consequence.<eos> He kicked open the door for you, but you've got to walk through it, stake your claim and say,<eos> "I'm in the pleasure business, too."<eos> That is not my business.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> I have a study, a practise, and I haven't cured one single case of sexual dysfunction.<eos> Yet, yet.<eos> But you will.
I'm not sure we belong together.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> - You're crazy, you know that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We should both go in.<eos> - No.<eos> This is on me.<eos> Besides, I need you to look after Nina and Sawyer.<eos> - She won't forgive me.<eos> - She will.
You married?<eos> I got a girl. Catherine, she's great!<eos> I bet!<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Waiting up for you?<eos> No, she's, uh, she's still in Morin Heights.<eos> Uh, when I decided to come here, she said maybe she didn't wanna, but I didn't believe her.<eos> That's not my idea of having a girl, bro.<eos> Oh, she's gonna come down.<eos> Mm-hmm. Of course she will.
I don't think Danny would...<eos> I don't want to talk about Danny.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I mean, what about you?<eos> How are you handling all of this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I want to say that I'm okay, but I...<eos> I just don't want it to affect the rest of my life.<eos> You know?<eos> It won't.
I just want the lies to stop.<eos> I know you, Lee Anne.<eos> (Sniffles) You are better than this.<eos> You're better than a man like Terry McCandless.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> This isn't the woman that I know you are inside.<eos> Please, just... stop.<eos> If I win, you'll change your mind.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
It was Pelant, Booth.<eos> Oh. Again?<eos> He had the evidence, all the bones, and then I was buried.<eos> It was a dream, right?<eos> He was laughing at me, Booth.<eos> What?<eos> He said that I would never find the Ghost Killer.<eos> Pelant is dead, right?<eos> I will find the killer, Booth.<eos> I will.
There were eight balls by the truck.<eos> What?<eos> Your father told me not to say anything, so you have to keep quiet.<eos> Alex, they attacked you.<eos> That's what they do.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You need to speak to your dad.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I will tonight.
Or maybe you're using this visit as an excuse to have purchased that jacket.<eos> You do remember me.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I'm fully recovered.<eos> Mentally, anyway.<eos> How's Aiden handling everything?<eos> Poorly, but he's agreed not to retaliate against Daniel.<eos> What about you?<eos> How will Emily Thorne return with a vengeance this time?<eos> She won't.
The fact that officers socialized together, mixed alcohol and illicit drugs and made a sex tape, and my client was the only one who was fired, that speaks to the heart of wrongful termination.<eos> You need to ask your next question.<eos> Fine.<eos> Did you have sex with Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> Again, outside the scope.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll answer the question.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
And that feeling that I've held so close...<eos> That feeling that he's out there somewhere...<eos> It's gone.<eos> Arliss is dead.<eos> I know that now.<eos> But...<eos> What?<eos> But I need to keep on living.<eos> Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I will.
Okay, so you, like, you don't write poetry?<eos> No, I did when I was your age.<eos> But, you know...<eos> That was a great paper by the way.<eos> - Yeah, great work.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Keep it up.<eos> Well, ladies, make sure to do<eos> - the reading for tomorrow.<eos> - We will.
Woodhouse. Mum.<eos> If I see this glass empty again,<eos> I will be very unhappy.<eos> Perish the thought, mum.<eos> Now then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> No?<eos> All right, then I will.
We lied out of love.<eos> Look how happy he is.<eos> I mean, he has no idea we had to cancel the wedding photos and my dad was so angry, he came up to our room and kicked Barney in the crotch.<eos> And the best part is your dad has no idea.<eos> He still loves me.<eos> Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?<eos> And, look, some good came out of all this.<eos> Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.<eos> Well, actually I didn't.<eos> But I will now.
The bri... the bri...<eos> He's really leaving.<eos> Hey, Barney.<eos> You still, uh, have my wedding ring?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got some work to do.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Blauman will cool off eventually.<eos> We'll see him again.<eos> Of course we will.
I'll take the risk.<eos> This is my life, my risk.<eos> Once you get past the grief of Aylee's death, you'll see.<eos> Your mother was right, you are relentless.<eos> When it comes to us, yes.<eos> But I can't do this.<eos> I am begging you, please stop.<eos> I won't.<eos> Ever.<eos> Then I will.
I just want to ask you to join the doug judy case.<eos> Officially, as partners.<eos> I want to catch this guy, and I can't do it without you.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Now I believe I owe you 1,000 push-ups.<eos> I don't care about the push-ups, jake.<eos> I care that you didn't honor our pact.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Listen, I know...<eos> My track record isn't exactly stellar, and I don't deserve this opportunity, but I'd like to try.<eos> Try what?<eos> Be her dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Just tell her to call me, okay?<eos> And you call me.<eos> Call me tomorrow and tell me what's going on.<eos> Of course I will.
- Us, too.<eos> But I wouldn't trade it for anything, because that is the face of a winner.<eos> And I'm not alone.<eos> Medal of Glory... a game so realistic, you can't help but come out of it scarred for life.<eos> Yes, yes, that is amazing.<eos> - We are in!<eos> - Ha!<eos> - No.<eos> - That's cool. I'll call you.<eos> - No, you won't.
- But I'm right here.<eos> - Charlie, I need you to be quiet.<eos> Maggie, every time she breathes, that lung is in the way.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Baumann, I need you to lower her respiratory rate.<eos> I need B.P. on the minute.<eos> I feel like there's somewhere else I need to be.<eos> Alex!<eos> - Don't forget the piñata.<eos> - I won't.
Oh, she's beautiful.<eos> Yes, isn't she?<eos> I'm told my wife died shortly after they fled Singapore.<eos> Thankfully, the boat made it to the mainland, and Lee was taken in by a lovely local family.<eos> She's 23 now.<eos> Of course it's funny, isn't it - in my mind, even though the years have marched on, she's always been a little girl.<eos> Anyhow, she, um... ..she didn't want to see me.<eos> She asked me to leave.<eos> I don't know if I'll ever see her again.<eos> Oh, surely you will.
I wonder what else is in that room of yours.<eos> Perhaps you should guess if you're so clever.<eos> It could be any number of things, couldn't it?<eos> But I put money on five spent bullet casings - one for Samuel, one for your mother and three for your father.<eos> And tell me this... ..was it your idea to frame your brother, Alby?<eos> Do you really think a blind girl could shoot that accurately, Doctor?<eos> I'm saying you could do anything you wanted to.<eos> But I do think... ..I do think it was Owen who did the shooting.<eos> He'll do anything you say, won't he?<eos> Yes, he will.
I need to get my ute. Well, it'll keep.<eos> Have you thought about what we should... tell the girls if you do end up... under arrest?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> For assaulting Paul?<eos> - How could you do that? ! - It was an accident!<eos> Alright!<eos> Settle down!<eos> Grow up!<eos> It's completely wrecked! Just make another one!<eos> Fine, I will!
He killed our uncle.<eos> He's been lying to all of us.<eos> - He's our dad!<eos> - Vic, you're an idiot.<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough.<eos> Listen, if there's one thing... the only thing...<eos> that I'm certain of it's that we have got to stick together if we're gonna get through this.<eos> Yeah, well, then maybe we won't.
I hadn't noticed.<eos> Just out of curiosity, which "associate" am I?<eos> Oh, boo.<eos> I would've put Van Der Hooven up there, but I think we might have run out of office space.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, Marty.<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!<eos> What the fuck, Jeannie?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> In fact, I will.
Does Helen know about this painting?<eos> I don't want her to know.<eos> I messed up.<eos> I hooked up with Carrie.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Did the police ever question you?<eos> I mean, what's your next question... what's my alibi?<eos> I was with my buddies down at the ice house till 2:00 A.M. or so.<eos> You can ask them.<eos> Oh, I will.
He makes a good profit From my enslavement to the lords.<eos> And because of that, He lacks conviction to pass the trials.<eos> What trials?<eos> The ones you'll have to face in order to set me free.<eos> Am I evil?<eos> Who really deserves the iron fist of punishment --<eos> The slave or the masters?<eos> That's a sad story, but it ends the same way.<eos> Killing me won't make a difference.<eos> Sure it will.
I love you, Katey-kakes.<eos> I love you.<eos> Daddy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Technically, it's only $26 million, but Carlos doesn't need to know that.<eos> Are you certain about using the real thing?<eos> Trust me... First thing Carlito's gonna do is check.<eos> The plan's gonna work.<eos> You just got to make sure your girls know what to do.<eos> They will.
Scott!<eos> Scott!<eos> Seth.<eos> Plan "B."<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, that's one for the books.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.
Scott!<eos> Seth.<eos> Plan "B."<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, that's one for the books.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.<eos> We will.
Some little chore that you have to get through or some little scene that reminds you that life will go on after they're gone.<eos> I used to think of that as a weakness, like I was giving up.<eos> And what do you think now?<eos> It's survival.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the way we get through.<eos> I can't imagine my life without Charlie.<eos> I can see it.<eos> And it breaks my heart... but I'll survive.<eos> Of course you will.
Allison, take the man's gun.<eos> Now, can we talk?<eos> Guys?<eos> They have a werewolf too.<eos> Let me help you out here.<eos> This kind of thing usually begins with something along the lines of,<eos> "It's not what you think." Or, "I can explain."<eos> Dad, let me help you out.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> I will.
I think your opinion might be slightly biased, Sheriff.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> What we're dealing with here is basically someone who lacks motive.<eos> No rhyme, no reason, right?<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Our enemy is not a killer.<eos> It's a trickster.<eos> The killing is just a by-product.<eos> If you're trying to say it won't kill us, I'm not feeling too confident about that.<eos> It won't.
She's screwing him!<eos> Okay, would you just take a breath for a second?<eos> This one doesn't even have a card!<eos> How is April supposed to return her gift if we can't even manage to keep the gifts with the card?<eos> Okay, we'll find the cards.<eos> Arizona!<eos> Stop.<eos> - We will fix it.<eos> - No!<eos> We won't!
You're psyched about that?<eos> You would go to prison Psyched? I didn't know that.<eos> For ice cream?<eos> MARTY:<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Okay. You don't need the money, and jail equals ice cream sandwiches.<eos> But I'm willing to bet that you have some associates in the drug game that would find no humor at all in the fact that you outed them to the Feds.<eos> I fitting' to out nobody.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You will.
Please.<eos> Here.<eos> We're gonna get you out.<eos> Zo, wait!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Take my life or I take his.<eos> Don't you dare do it, Leo.<eos> You...<eos> You said we'd go home.<eos> We will.
- Dr. Moise called with some good news, sir.<eos> The liver's young and healthy.<eos> It belongs to a laborer.<eos> No family.<eos> He won't be missed.<eos> Moise would like to move ahead with the acquisition.<eos> - I'm not sure I'll need it anymore.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, If these other people can't deliver what they've promised...<eos> - They can.<eos> And they will.
Is this the gem that they were after?<eos> London, 1836.<eos> Is that the same gem?<eos> Look who was helping Scotland Yard.<eos> Rebecca Reynolds.<eos> You think I'm related to this woman?<eos> It's a collar.<eos> What does it do?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
Right.<eos> Let's do it without all this Kabuki theater, detective.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Tell me what I want to know, and I'll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.<eos> Now what was your mission and what do they know about Lazarus?<eos> Do you want undignified?<eos> Then wait till you see what I do to you.<eos> You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.<eos> Your mother paid for it with her life.<eos> So will you.
Here.<eos> Allow me.<eos> You've ripped it!<eos> It's a cloak.<eos> It's Eric's cloak.<eos> And he's had it since before we met.<eos> He left it with me while he was away to keep him close, and now you have ruined it!<eos> If mending a cloak is our biggest obstacle, we're in fine shape.<eos> You realize you might not find him... or survive?<eos> I will.
And I knew I could use it.<eos> Use it for what?<eos> When you invoked the name of your love in a selfish plea for redemption, I was able to curse you... more specifically, your kiss.<eos> See, the next time your lips touch Emma Swan's, all of her magic will be taken.<eos> Everything that makes her special, that makes her powerful, that makes her a threat will be gone.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> And she'll defeat you.<eos> Then I'll send The Dark One to kill her before you can.<eos> No, you won't.
It's why you had a monkey look after her in New York instead of killing her.<eos> For some reason... you can't.<eos> It no longer matters, because you're going to remove her powers.<eos> I may not be able to hurt Emma, but I can hurt those around her... her parents, her friends... her child.<eos> Do not go near them.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You've become quite fond of the boy, haven't you?<eos> I will enjoy turning him into a monkey's breakfast.<eos> I'll stop you.<eos> No, you won't.
Rose was blackmailing her.<eos> Shut up!<eos> And Nenna shut Rose's mouth, took her stolen money, and ran!<eos> Shut it!<eos> The law requires that any charge against me be proved, Charlie.<eos> If the Commodore wakes to find me dead without good cause, he'll hold you responsible.<eos> And you know he'll punish you accordingly.<eos> Well, the Commodore hasn't woken, has he?<eos> No.<eos> But he will.
Cut it out!<eos> Can you do me a favor?<eos> Sure.<eos> Can you xxxxxxxxxxx alone for a while? (Come into the house when Father come.)<eos> Why?<eos> Cause is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (I need to tell him a few words...)<eos> About what?<eos> About us...<eos> What, if I become a lesbian?<eos> You won't.
If they're following him, then JT...<eos> Vincent, this isn't your fault.<eos> The hell it is, okay? !<eos> Everyone is here wasting their time because of me!<eos> Now JT-<eos> - JT is kidnapped!<eos> The man thinks he won a grant, for God's sake!<eos> You need to calm down and think this through.<eos> No, we need to save JT.<eos> And we will, together.
- I brought Jessica with. - Yay!<eos> Well, this shouldn't be weird at all.<eos> - Hey, Redbone.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> - Did you see "Field of Dreams"?<eos> - No.<eos> Say it, Big John.<eos> "If you build it, they will come."<eos> - Yes, they will.
It's my dad.<eos> She gonna be okay?<eos> Be careful out there, Max.<eos> The streets are crawling with ISI.<eos> And you're without official cover.<eos> What about the embassy?<eos> Totally in the dark.<eos> Langley?<eos> Langley knows, but they can't help you out if you get in trouble.<eos> Then we won't.
Light here!<eos> I can not see anything!<eos> Carlos!<eos> Do something!<eos> Why are you doing nothing?<eos> I do not want to!<eos> Do not do it!<eos> Lie quietly and close your eyes.<eos> If you zappelst, it will only hurt you.<eos> No, I will not, no, no!
Do something!<eos> He is canceled.<eos> He is canceled ...<eos> But then do something!<eos> Is that damn how she suffers?<eos> What the hell am I supposed to do?<eos> Not the movie!<eos> Do not shoot!<eos> - You film it not, right?<eos> - No, I will not.
Don't ever say I'm not a man of my word again.<eos> If we don't return our ace to the deck, then the probability of choosing a second ace...<eos> Jump on your right foot.<eos> Pause.<eos> Now on your left foot.<eos> Pause.<eos> High knees.<eos> High knees. Interesting.<eos> I'm not sure all this woo-woo spiritual stuff is gonna help dad.<eos> Not with that attitude, it won't.
- Really?<eos> You fixed a rape case.<eos> Did you know that beforehand?<eos> No.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Well, that doesn't mean much coming from you.<eos> Amanda, you need to turn yourself in.<eos> What, to I.A.B.?<eos> They're gonna put me in prison.<eos> Yeah, they will.
Snow, we have to do this.<eos> You have to do this.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't crush your heart. I can't lose you.<eos> You could never lose me.<eos> But this... this is our only chance.<eos> Think of our baby.<eos> Think of being a mother.<eos> Our child will never know its father.<eos> Of course it will.
Yeah, we can do that.<eos> The biggest mistake Adalind made was coming to you.<eos> As long as you have your child, you'll be vulnerable.<eos> The rest of your life.<eos> And so will she.<eos> What am I gonna tell them?<eos> [Exhales] They are gonna kill me.<eos> The royals?<eos> [Growls] [Snarling]<eos> They probably will.
Do you know what I've done for you?<eos> Do you have any idea what I have had to do for you?<eos> I do.<eos> There's not a day goes by I don't think about it.<eos> - Well, I don't think you do, or else you wouldn't be having this conversation...<eos> Boyd. ...with me...<eos> Boyd.<eos> ...right now.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will, okay?
The question is... who am I?<eos> Right.<eos> I give you a clue, you have a minute to guess the identity of the person in question.<eos> We must find a weapon to defeat Moloch.<eos> I fail to understand how a game played on telephones will help us solve our dire problem at hand.<eos> It won't.
When I see you again, I hope it's in a better world.<eos> It's the shofar.<eos> The trumpet that made the Israelites tremble at Mount Sinai.<eos> That brought down the walls of Jericho.<eos> That has signaled the starting of wars for aeons.<eos> And now is to sound the moment that Moloch has grown to his full glory, to call his servants to his side.<eos> It's nice to see that you've taken up an instrument.<eos> Perhaps after dinner tonight, we can have a recital.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
Especially a man facing life in a hellhole like this.<eos> An injunction against all involuntary treatments.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I would like to speak to my client in private.<eos> These won't be necessary anymore.<eos> Cynthia told me she was getting a new lawyer, but I thought it would take a while to process.<eos> There's always a way to expedite things.<eos> You'll find that I can be very persuasive.<eos> What else have you heard about me?<eos> Only that my wife thinks you can help.<eos> And I will.
I think about it every day.<eos> So does Luke.<eos> A lot of you got your lives back, too, because of me.<eos> So, at the very least, do me a favor and lay off my brother.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Our twin powers don't work like that.<eos> You actually have to tell Luke to his face.<eos> Well, I will.
Nod or shake your head.<eos> Good.<eos> One last question. Has Tom ever been to the camp?<eos> I never missed a day.<eos> I bet. I bet. Good.<eos> Great.<eos> You did a great job.<eos> We can tie him up and gag him.<eos> - What if he gets loose?<eos> - He won't.
- Congratulations.<eos> Couldn't have done it without a great and very patient S.O.<eos> Yeah, you could have.<eos> I'm no Clairvoyant, but I do believe some things are meant to be.<eos> Don't say I never gave you anything.<eos> They're coming for me.<eos> It's time we finally meet.<eos> Can't say I'm a fan... of this double-blind situation.<eos> How will the field teams meet us at the destinations?<eos> They won't.
She's still in shock.<eos> Said she doesn't even own a gun.<eos> Has no clue how her son would be able to get his hands on an arsenal like this.<eos> Who's processing their house?<eos> Morgan.<eos> And she also told Brass that the kid used the family van.<eos> Patrol found it a couple of blocks from here.<eos> Impound's bringing it in right now if you want to get on that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
CARY: Burner phones again?<eos> You've done this before?<eos> No, when we were leaving Lockhart/Gardner.<eos> This is different.<eos> - How long do we have to use these?<eos> - We don't know. The DEA is getting to Bishop through us, so any business calls, use these, and be careful, - the packaging can cut.<eos> - We got to go to court.<eos> Get a preservation order.<eos> Why? That won't help us now.<eos> It will with the judge.
Who's that?<eos> No-one to be scared of.<eos> Sssh...<eos> From the mouth.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> When I killed her... ..it weren't deliberate.<eos> Will you tell her?<eos> You tell her I didn't mean it.<eos> You tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Of course I will.
Counting the last night's surprise attack, I believe... about three times.<eos> But I wonder who is this new officer that is keeping you waiting?<eos> Someone quintessential to this battle, I'm told.<eos> Apparently, there is no one better to bring down Yi Sun-Shin than him.<eos> Byuk-Pa Port, Admiral's Fleet<eos> Considering insufficient number of your navy, it would be beneficial for you to dissmis your men and join forces with army<eos> -Father!<eos> -What is he doing with his sword out?<eos> -I overheard them saying they were going to kill us all!<eos> -Of course they will!
It goes like that.<eos> Thank you so very much.<eos> - Watch your step, darling.<eos> - Thank you, Will. Thank you so much.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - Thank you, darling.<eos> - And I will definitely listen to the song.<eos> - Thank you, Tom.<eos> - I really appreciate it.<eos> - I will.
Anyone with information on this is asked to contact their local authorities.<eos> Of course, you can keep it right here for the very latest on this breaking news story.<eos> No mask?<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We took care of the Brooke Ashton situation.<eos> - Suicide?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the coroner will confirm?<eos> Yes, he will.
Anyone could have acquired a sample and analyzed it.<eos> There is no evidence they're linked with Liber8.<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> What about her?<eos> She's embedded at Gautuma.<eos> It appears Liber8 placed her there.<eos> They will make a move sooner or later.<eos> What if pulling her out tips them off?<eos> It won't.
She also built grenades.<eos> It's not many.<eos> Again, thank you, Murphy.<eos> We'll make them count.<eos> If the grounders make it through the front gate, guns and grenades should force them back.<eos> And then?<eos> Then we close the door and pray.<eos> And pray what?<eos> That the ship keeps them out?<eos> Because it won't.
Fine.<eos> If you won't let me save you, how about we save everybody else?<eos> You're the only one who can fire those rockets.<eos> If you die, we all die.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Finn, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Clarke, I need to do this.<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
- We need to get Ken back.<eos> - Are you shitting me?<eos> We have six weeks till COMDEX and we need a case.<eos> Unless you want me to wrap the machine in a garbage bag, we need a designer.<eos> With only 256 bytes of RAM in the register, we have a bottleneck that sets off a four-cycle wait to clear every time we load it.<eos> - Hunt...<eos> - Plus a power regulator that gets so hot, users refer to it as the "coffee cup warmer."<eos> Hunt, you're listing off a lot of problems, and a lot of problems means a lot of money for fixes.<eos> We need assurances that correcting these will solve the computer's flaws once and for all.<eos> Well, they won't.
It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose...<eos> Tenzin!<eos> Now, now, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, please be quiet.<eos> I have some serious news.<eos> We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here.<eos> Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf... I see him.<eos> He's right there!<eos> I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire.<eos> Oh, no, who will help us?<eos> I will!
Actually, I was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand.<eos> No, no. You want to make American kids work?<eos> You're supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted, then I changed my mind and I hate it so much<eos> I'm faking stomachaches to get out of it. Would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?<eos> Um, I'm not sure this is the best use of my skills.<eos> I said wash! And, Bart, go work the deep fryer.<eos> Well, if I'll be doing this when I'm 40, might as well start now.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Guys, this is gonna be hard for a while. But we'll get through this as a family.<eos> Yes, we will.
So, no. I do not believe in any god.<eos> No.<eos> I made that mistake once before, and I'm not about to make it again.<eos> It's men like Kingston Tanner that preach nothing but-- but lies.<eos> You know, religion is responsible for far more bloodshed than I could ever be.<eos> It's only good for one thing-- power, and death is its-- is its greatest ally.<eos> But why choose Kingston Tanner as your target?<eos> Oh, no, no. No. He chose me.<eos> He's been taking my name in vain to increase his coffers, so I thought it best to teach the man a lesson and show the world what religion truly represents.<eos> And we will.
I wanted that, too.<eos> It didn't happen, though, did it?<eos> My beautiful family was destroyed, my son brutally beaten and imprisoned, and you-- you left me for Joe.<eos> I'm sorry, Lily.<eos> I truly am.<eos> Everything was so confusing.<eos> I had no choice but to go with him.<eos> So now you've chosen me.<eos> Please understand that this time I need to be certain you won't betray me.<eos> I won't.
Make 'em move!<eos> Hit the horn again!<eos> If you touch my horn again, I cut your hand off!<eos> Okay, big shot.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it, if it'll get us there faster.<eos> Look, I know I said I'd spring for a cab, but it's $70!<eos> And I'm gonna need that for a junior king room At the holiday inn express!<eos> Don't worry, Han, we'll chip in.<eos> No, we won't.
- Emily, maybe it's time --<eos> - Don't tell me to go to a doctor!<eos> All right, then I'll help you.<eos> We'll leave town.<eos> We'll go anywhere.<eos> No, I need to finish what I started.<eos> How can you if you cannot even trust yourself?<eos> Look, for starters, why don't you put the knife down?<eos> You can't let this destroy you.<eos> I won't.
Where did you get that?<eos> Oh, I bet you'd like to know.<eos> Just get the hell away from me, all right?<eos> I never want to see you... or hear you or talk to you.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Discharge on 27?<eos> Uh, that is correct.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Discharged with further investigation in case we find any additional holes in your alibi.<eos> You won't.
I'm not trying to make excuses, but I want you to know why I did what I did.<eos> I got a call my dad was in jail in San Antonio, and I panicked.<eos> I mean, maybe the guy drinks too much, but he's a decent man.<eos> And he saved my ass more times than I can count when I was a kid.<eos> I knew I needed to get him out, so I did the stupidest thing I have ever done.<eos> So I took that stuff from you and your roommates and put together bail.<eos> You're my witness.<eos> I'm swearing right here right now, I will get every bit of the money I owe back to Leslie and her roommates.<eos> If I'm your witness, you better make good.<eos> I will.
- Samuel.<eos> It's Samuel.<eos> He's alive.<eos> He's being released.<eos> Sammy boy! Huh? Huh?<eos> When do we go get him?<eos> I... oh, I have to report to Washington tomorrow.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> He'll release you for this.<eos> No, he won't.
Hold on, we'll get you out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bring the jaws in, come on.<eos> Look, the point is, Sam's gone to a lot of trouble to try and slow us down, which he has succeeded at.<eos> He's probably trying to buy time.<eos> Whatever his plan, it's happening now.<eos> Right, which is the reason we have to get out of here.<eos> You can't beast out. There are too many people out there.<eos> No one is gonna see me here.<eos> Yes, they will.
Well, you got 'em.<eos> She ever cook like that for you?<eos> How long were you two together, anyway?<eos> It was after Charlotte died, okay?<eos> I was alone.<eos> So I guess this makes you and Truman related.<eos> If they don't kill you, I'm gonna.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm looking for something to fight with for when Marion sells us out.<eos> Maybe she won't.

I got it for her.<eos> What, the decoder ring?<eos> Yeah, last week.<eos> I knew we were gonna nail it at COMDEX and sell the Giant.<eos> So I had the same jeweler in Berkeley make one up and send it out to the office.<eos> It's hidden in my garage right now.<eos> I'm gonna give it to her when I get back next week.<eos> Wow.<eos> I hope we sell the Giant.<eos> We will.
A fact that you, with this, would seek to correct.<eos> So this... This in your hands, becomes alive.<eos> Alive, Miss.<eos> Nobody wants dead and they wander the way to Leman Street. Off your fragile wrists up to your friend Mr Reid. On what all that you have made, or you would make,<eos> There's a man in a signalbox out there, with his brains removed from it.<eos> Hey, kid, I paid for that, I expect to see that eaten.<eos> First glance, I'd say, a shotgun.<eos> Eat it, God damn it.<eos> Will you not come?<eos> - No, Drake, I will not.
Come on, guys!<eos> Yo, Carl.<eos> We taking all them to school too?<eos> No, back to the parking lot where they live.<eos> What, they live in a parking lot?<eos> Van, but it's in a parking lot.<eos> What are we gonna do with Chuckie?<eos> I have to take him back to the hospital to see his mom and Frank.<eos> We're not all gonna fit.<eos> Sure we will.
All aboard!<eos> As they say, that's my cue.<eos> This is backwards.<eos> I should be the one leaving for the front lines.<eos> Welcome to the 20th century.<eos> Please, don't take any unnecessary risks.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Claire Beauchamp Randall, promise that you'll return to me.<eos> I will, Frank Randall.
James Blunt was 1.49.4.<eos> That is FW, which stands for flipping wet.<eos> So you are definitely going to the above him.<eos> So come on, be reasonable.<eos> I mean, I would like to be towards the top, but...<eos> That is the 1.45 region.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I don't know...<eos> Do you know, I was just about to say,<eos> "Well, Jesse Pinkman..." But I won't.
You never know when you'll have to run.<eos> And you...<eos> I think I'm gonna miss you most of all, scarecrow.<eos> I know I bag on you, but you're one of the strongest women I know.<eos> I watched you fall hard, but you picked yourself up and... started over.<eos> I admire you so much for that.<eos> [crying] Oh, god, why do you have to go?<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> I'll be out before you know it.<eos> No, you won't.
Apparently, after they broke up, his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things, and he wants them back.<eos> And he needs the garage-door opener to get into her place?<eos> Her... mom's place, but yeah.<eos> But given his record, why doesn't he just steal it himself?<eos> Because her truck is parked right outside of her bar, and he can't get close to it without someone spotting him and then telling her.<eos> And you're actually thinking about doing this?<eos> If I don't, he won't sign.<eos> Castle, he could drag this on for years.<eos> And if you get caught?<eos> I won't.
Justin's right, you're a coward.<eos> Oh, is that what he was saying?<eos> 'Cause I agree with that.<eos> Hey, Sabrina, how's it going?<eos> Guys, box her in.<eos> Her stare's cold, Danny.<eos> Les, could you help me out?<eos> She's your friend.<eos> [Sighs] Sabrina, I warned you about Danny and you said it would never affect our friendship.<eos> And it won't.
[Tires screech]<eos> If it should come to it, let Robert be the hero today.<eos> You are not to endanger yourself.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying to you?<eos> There are so many things that could go wrong today, Joe.<eos> I should really be with you.<eos> Yeah. Everyone plays their part, Em.<eos> Now this is what I need from you.<eos> Please just... just do this for me, yeah?<eos> Of course I will.
She could break this case open.<eos> Do you need another minute?<eos> No.<eos> Sheila...<eos> I know this wasn't easy. Call me, anytime.<eos> I can help with the grieving process.<eos> Thanks, but I won't be needing this.<eos> Keep it.<eos> You may, change your mind.<eos> I won't.
They're extremely friable, so soft hands.<eos> You're on the right side of the table.<eos> You have one chance, or else you could rip through the aorta, which is essential to connecting the new heart when it arrives.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just take a breath, just throw the stitch.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I've never put a horizontal mattress in an aorta before... only in a bowel.<eos> From this side, I'll just tear through her native aorta.<eos> - Well, what if I tear through it?<eos> - You won't!
Ugh.<eos> No means no, asshat.<eos> I need to get back to work.<eos> I might still need your help, Shaw.<eos> Did you not hear anything I just said?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> But I'm also trying to save a kid.<eos> You had to put it that way.<eos> You said you would get my son back.<eos> And I will.
I'm here!<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> [Breathing heavily] Put your hands in the air, Olivia.<eos> What'd you think, it was gonna be easy?<eos> After all our time together?<eos> I feel like you don't even know me at all.<eos> — What do you want?<eos> — Your gun.<eos> Otherwise you won't find the girl.<eos> Nobody will.
I never wanted to be the type to think big thoughts about the nature of things and...<eos> All I ever wanted was a stack of pancakes and a V8.<eos> So I'm recommending that you take over as Chief.<eos> Oh, I-I appreciate that, but I...<eos> No, no, you're the real deal.<eos> You got the instincts and the disposition.<eos> I didn't see it before, but now... And Vern saw it. I know that.<eos> And so I'm hoping that after you have the baby, you come back here and take things over.<eos> I-I will think about that.<eos> I will.
Okay it'll take half an hour to get to the farm.<eos> Once he realizes that Mom didn't call, it'll be too late.<eos> You get in and out as fast as you can.<eos> Don't be a hero.<eos> Get what Kellogg wants and we'll meet back at the rendezvous.<eos> We go to him together.<eos> Then we leave for good.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> Look, if something goes wrong...<eos> It won't.
So do me a favor, help me out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, I think we should let Dale go up.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> I know, but it's dangerous and Barbie is more experienced.<eos> Jim, the town's looking to you right now, okay?<eos> They need a leader, not a martyr.<eos> - If anything happens up there, then...<eos> - It won't.
May I speak, Your Honor?<eos> Of course, "Pastor."<eos> Doug, Briana...<eos> I loved your daughter more than words can express.<eos> The church and the garden will be a tribute to her, a sanctuary in the city where friends and family can visit and mourn the loss of the most beautiful woman that I've ever known.<eos> Her dying wish is my living vow.<eos> As pastor...<eos> I will keep her memory alive.<eos> I know I'm asking a lot... but would you consider joining me in honoring your daughter?<eos> Yes, I will.
Of course we do.<eos> Lead the way.<eos> Sir.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> She said I never lied to her.<eos> Today, I did.<eos> But she's alive and safe.<eos> We did that, at least.<eos> Why didn't you tell her the truth?<eos> I will.
I've got you, man, okay?<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Dougal, is it bad?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> It wasn't spurting, which meant the femoral artery wasn't cut.<eos> So there was a good chance I could stop the bleeding at the thigh.<eos> Will I lose my leg?<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
We need to keep it that way.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't use our own listening devices on us. It's rude.<eos> Well, someone has to do something.<eos> This is the problem with bureaucracy.<eos> It takes far too long to discover the truth...<eos> I believe you.<eos> Then why are we standing here?<eos> We have to find who took him.<eos> We will.
I don't expect you're here to discuss the DOD's budget. Tea?<eos> I'm assuming you've heard about the woman who died a very theatrical death in New York.<eos> Privacy terrorists.<eos> They call themselves Vigilance.<eos> They do like to make a statement.<eos> Do they have our names?<eos> Has the program been compromised?<eos> It's possible, but I won't know for sure until we get access to Leona Wainwright's office.<eos> If anyone finds out about the system...<eos> They won't.
And I think she liked it.<eos> Until one day, Andy was a distant memory.<eos> Danny, I can't wait to die.<eos> My funeral is going to be off the chain.<eos> There's gonna be a signature cocktail.<eos> My ashes will be around the rim.<eos> Ashes?<eos> You're not getting cremated.<eos> St. Peter doesn't want a pile of dust in the pearly gates, and I'm gonna have to vouch for you.<eos> Hmm. But I will.
Until now, because...<eos> We just flagged an e-mail.<eos> Sender is anonymous, but the recipient is an overseas alias we've been tracking.<eos> It mentions a rental address in Virginia<eos> "where you can lay low and won't be disturbed."<eos> This proves there's an operative in the States.<eos> I mean, this could bust the whole case wide open.<eos> I will get with the FBI and NCIS...<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
I suppose you don't know anything about that, either.<eos> Nope.<eos> Cutter wouldn't take the stand, so I didn't get his violent past on the record.<eos> What about Officer Walsh's testimony?<eos> It wasn't enough.<eos> At the end of the day, the jurors just saw a cop defending himself against a violent criminal.<eos> Started out that way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wish Cutter knew when to stop and I pray he doesn't go out there and do it all over again.<eos> He won't.
Oh, God.<eos> Ah, I always thought the two of you should've made a go of it.<eos> Mom!<eos> What?<eos> Just pour the wine.<eos> Why don't you move back, Allie?<eos> Phoenix has nothing for you.<eos> Your family is here.<eos> Yeah, Allie, why don't you move back?<eos> Maybe I will.
Hey, baby.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Hey, big guy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Belden?<eos> Gone.<eos> Those guards?<eos> Both dead.<eos> Find him.<eos> We will.
And now we have to teach others to hear these frequencies again.<eos> Tell me, if we could hear them, what, for example, would we hear?<eos> How to never die.<eos> Who else knows of your research?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's the stuff that I talk about on my radio show, but only Bill and me know the really mind-blowing parts of his theory.<eos> Oh, it's been good talking to you, man.<eos> I have been looking for someone who understands frequencies.<eos> Mr. Segreto, I thought that you came here so that we could talk about them.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will soon.
I never congratulated you on your appointment, Jimmy.<eos> So, congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's a challenge.<eos> But I like challenges.<eos> I was sorry about your old boss.<eos> - I liked Will Gardner.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If I can do anything, please tell me.<eos> Oh, I will.
- Uh... no.<eos> Then what do you think you're doing?<eos> Admiring them?<eos> Yeah, this isn't a shoe store.<eos> They don't belong to you.<eos> - She was just...<eos> - Trying on other people's shoes.<eos> Who does that?<eos> - I'll just take them off.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I'm some... some chump 'cause you want to get Truman's little bitch on your team?<eos> Well, we got a spy in Truman's house now.<eos> And if she convinces other people in town, we got an underground.<eos> Who cares?<eos> We could've used the gas.<eos> We could've taken out a truckload of Patriots.<eos> And anybody else who gets caught in the middle.<eos> You said you wanted to win!<eos> I do.<eos> And I will.
Yeah.<eos> I just, you know, I want to pack up, get out of here and move on.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> This'll all work out, you'll see.<eos> Right.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I think you know.<eos> Look, you get out of here.<eos> I'm gonna call the cops.<eos> No, you won't.
I am gonna go outside and get some air.<eos> Why don't you just stay here and figure out if there's some other crime you can commit to get out of this one?<eos> You should have called me the minute this went down.<eos> There wasn't time.<eos> You had time to see Allison Holt.<eos> I was trying to get out in front of it.<eos> Allison Holt isn't our problem.<eos> Mike Ross is.<eos> The U.S. Attorney keeps poking around, he's gonna find out that his star witness isn't even in the bar.<eos> No, he won't.
I know who you hang out with.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. I just needed to sit down for a bit.<eos> Should probably get used to these seats, though.<eos> I can't change who I am.<eos> But that doesn't mean I want to sit at home every Sunday when my family's off at church.<eos> You would go to church with me?<eos> You're my wife.<eos> Of course I will.
It evolve into that.<eos> We evolve.<eos> We ha to.<eos> An now we've evolve into hunters.<eos> I tol you.<eos> I sai it.<eos> Can't go back, Bob.<eos> I just hope you unerstan that nothing happening to you now is personal.<eos> Yeah, you put us in this situation, an it is almost kin of a cosmic justice for it to be you, but... we woul have one this to anyboy.<eos> We will.
Boy, it's pretty toasty in this car.<eos> You know, this isn't working.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> You're not leaving.<eos> If you don't drive me, I'll take a cab.<eos> Good luck finding one in this neighborhood, especially looking and smelling like you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm walking to the car, right now.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> No, you won't.
Thank you, Grace.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> You guys. Aw.<eos> So, can I give you a lift?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> To the ferry would be nice.<eos> Cedar cove?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just do me a favor and do your job, make sure the feds hold up their end of the deal.<eos> Yeah, they will.
And the... toplessness.<eos> Mike, you want to, you want to jump in here?<eos> Ma, we-we love you.<eos> We care about you.<eos> Are-are you going nuts or what?<eos> Mike!<eos> I don't need to sit here and listen to this.<eos> Well, we just want to talk and make sure everything's okay.<eos> You're not gonna put me in a home.<eos> Of course we won't.
Are-are you going nuts or what?<eos> Mike!<eos> I don't need to sit here and listen to this.<eos> Well, we just want to talk and make sure everything's okay.<eos> You're not gonna put me in a home.<eos> Of course we won't.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Yeah, you say that now.<eos> If things get too bad, we'll deal with it.<eos> Of course we will.
- Kieren, please.<eos> While they sit around and high-five each other about killing us, like it's a big joke!<eos> Oh, no, that's fine with everyone!<eos> I say one thing and that is indecent? !<eos> I'm sorry, but that is bullshit!<eos> Come on, Simon.<eos> - Come on! - Yeah.<eos> You do know I'm proud of you, Philip?<eos> You'll do what's right by Sylvia and Henry, won't you?<eos> Yes, I will.
~ Doesn't get any better looking, though, does it?<eos> ~ No!<eos> MATURE JENNY: 'If we are lucky, we find love.<eos> 'If we're blessed, we understand its meaning.<eos> 'The bird-print kisses at the bottom of a card 'will not vanish like the snow but will endure.'<eos> You know you should get it down on paper.<eos> What?<eos> Write my memoirs?<eos> I think you should consider it.<eos> I will... .. after Christmas.
Guys, look.<eos> Melanie Cross went missing and was never found.<eos> The family moved "To Chester's Mill from Zenith a short time ago."<eos> Zenith?<eos> That's the same town that I'm from.<eos> I thought you looked familiar.<eos> Melanie's family lived at 24 Old Oak Drive.<eos> If she remembered the combo when she stood in front of her locker, then...<eos> You think she'll remember more if we take her to the house? No.<eos> No, she won't.
He took care of me, and then went out to look for a job.<eos> That was not ordinary.<eos> He read books.<eos> That was not ordinary.<eos> I told him, "you did your time.<eos> Don't make trouble."<eos> But he went around telling everyone that he was innocent.<eos> That was not ordinary.<eos> Ma'am, I assure you that we will do everything we can to find the people...<eos> No, you won't.
But we can't help you unless you agree to press charges against your father for grand larceny and possession of stolen property.<eos> Me against my own father?<eos> Yeah, then we can apply for a warrant to search for the documents.<eos> What kind of daughter is doing this?<eos> Kasia, do you want to sleep on it?<eos> All the sleep in the world, I can't have my own father arrested.<eos> Reagan.<eos> Hey. Meet me at Puddings, 64th and First.<eos> The doorman from Ilene Clayton's building wants to talk.<eos> Wants, or will?
Reverend, I'm so sorry.<eos> I know Oakfield was very special to you.<eos> Never mind that.<eos> What does a man like him want with a place like this anyway?<eos> I washed Stanley in that sink the day he was born.<eos> I remember.<eos> We had every birthday party of his in this room, till he was 19, till he went away.<eos> Him and George.<eos> You think you won't be able to keep him alive when you leave this house.<eos> But you will.
She's 16 tomorrow.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Well, she seemed so mature.<eos> I am mature...<eos> Whatever will her parents say?<eos> Never mind about that, but next time she comes calling, m'lady, kindly send her away.<eos> She's not used to the antics of the civilised classes.<eos> Thank you very much, I can manage now.<eos> Are you going to tell Mum?<eos> I won't if you won't.
George, we're making her a big part of this zoo by taking her hand-outs and we hardly know her. We've got no choice.<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> Oh, it's all right, love, come here.<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> He will!<eos> Someone left him outside the council.<eos> They called an exterminator but I talked him round.<eos> Put him down, Dad.<eos> He'll bite you.<eos> Hey, no, no, he won't, June Bug.
I don't want you doing that.<eos> I'll still live here.<eos> I can help out in the evenings, but during the day I'll be out in the world.<eos> If you're sure.<eos> I am.<eos> I never realised how much Mew did about the place.<eos> She's got the right idea, you know. Striking out.<eos> There's little point in sinking more blood and sweat into this place if we're only going to end up handing it over to somebody else.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> Of course it will.
It's thready.<eos> What is it?<eos> What is happening?<eos> He's bleeding internally.<eos> The bullet must have nicked his liver.<eos> Ah. Fix it.<eos> I told you, he needs surgery-- real surgery, in a real hospital.<eos> No.<eos> You think if we take him to a hospital, he will tell them where you are.<eos> He won't.
What? That's my line.<eos> I know, but Heather's here and I need to get back before she gets suspicious and my tail catches up.<eos> Whoa, hold up, Heather is here right now, downstairs?<eos> Yeah, surprise.<eos> Wow, it really is like old times:<eos> Me hiding in shadows, you hiding me.<eos> Yeah, and me lying to my sister, Tess covering for me.<eos> I am so sick of lying.<eos> I thought we were moving past all this.<eos> We will, somehow.
Just be ready to finish the job.<eos> What makes you think Emily is gonna follow the lead?<eos> Because what else would a doting daughter do?<eos> I should've gone with you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> He's not.<eos> And what if there had been more than one of them?<eos> We have gone too far to take a misstep now.<eos> - If I lost you --<eos> - You won't.
Only this time I can't create another hero myth.<eos> This time, we need the real thing.<eos> I didn't hear you come in.<eos> Not much has changed.<eos> Everything has changed.<eos> Hmm. Yeah.<eos> I know I can't make up for the lost time, and...<eos> You have a whole life that I'm not a part of.<eos> Whatever I can do to make it easier,<eos> I will.
No.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know, I don't think so.<eos> So... you could just deny everything.<eos> You deny putting the idea in his head.<eos> You say that none of those conversations ever happened.<eos> That it was all him.<eos> I mean, if it becomes necessary.<eos> If they get caught.<eos> Which they will.
So... you could just deny everything.<eos> You deny putting the idea in his head.<eos> You say that none of those conversations ever happened.<eos> That it was all him.<eos> I mean, if it becomes necessary.<eos> If they get caught.<eos> Which they will.<eos> Which is why you mustn't go anywhere near that money.<eos> Even if it looks like they've got away with it.<eos> Cos they won't.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Did Mr. Sampat tell you anything about the source?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Did Mr. Sampat tell you his name?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Will you tell us the name of your source?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Let me phrase that differently.<eos> Would you tell the grand jury the name of the person you know to have stolen classified government documents containing secrets, which if made public, could calamitously threaten our national security?<eos> No, sir, I won't.
You're safe now.<eos> My name is Sebastian and I want to help you.<eos> What's your name?<eos> This whistle, I know what it means, and it strikes fear in my heart, too.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Have you seen the Darkness?<eos> Don't bring him back with us, my lord.<eos> That child will take us all to hell.<eos> No, he won't.
Don't agree with him!<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me,<eos> I have to get up there and start living my new amazing life as Felix Fischoeder, the condo king with a dark secret and a girlfriend!<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, God. Please, Mr. Fischoeder, do something.<eos> I have kids!<eos> Oh, come on, Bob.<eos> Those kids aren't that great.<eos> Felix, come back!<eos> I will... later.
Why intentionally have every skitter in the vicinity chasing after you?<eos> 'Cause if they're chasing after me, they won't be chasing after you.<eos> Well, I think it's great.<eos> I think it's a fantastic plan.<eos> It has zero chance of success, but, uh, what the hell?<eos> And what's this Faraday suit?<eos> How do we know this thing's even gonna work?<eos> It will.<eos> Yeah, and how do we know that Dingaan here's not just gonna hop the fence and skedaddle?<eos> He won't.
You're my ideal man.<eos> And I'm not talking about your bulging muscles.<eos> Though I have to admit-- for someone so strong, you lack the beefcake look.<eos> No.<eos> You have the three qualities I love in a person.<eos> One-- you lack a moral code.<eos> Two-- you can kill a man with your bare hands.<eos> And three-- you have to do whatever I say, or I'm gonna make sure this whole place knows that you have someone else's shit under your fingernails.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Not now, you won't.
But the biggest joke of all-- the thing that'll sink ya every time is hope.<eos> Hope that the world will right itself.<eos> That the just will be rewarded and the wicked punished.<eos> Oh, once you buy into that horseshit, you're dead in the water.<eos> The only way to survive in this disgusting godforsaken world is to take control.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna take care of our people but us.<eos> Dell hurt one of our own, we can't let him get away with that.<eos> Can't let... that degenerate prick win.<eos> He's got to pay.<eos> He will, Ma, he will.
The worst possible.<eos> Yeah, he is.<eos> He's the worst!<eos> What a guy.. But.. that's not the most painful part. The worst part is I still love him!<eos> A lot.<eos> Even though I hate him and think he's a terrible person.<eos> That is.. very painful for me right now.<eos> It hurts..<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Because you won't.
When do we leave?<eos> Working on it.<eos> State's negotiating with the French for a joint investigation.<eos> Gibbs...<eos> Admiral Kendall's daughter-- you sure she got away?<eos> Yup.<eos> Could she be the shooter?<eos> Not likely, but she might know who was.<eos> Then Agent DiNozzo's first priority is to find her.<eos> He will.
I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> Send your riders after theirs.<eos> If they stop, they may reveal some English sympathizers amongst the French.<eos> You're squeezing your cousin Elizabeth's throat, and to what end?<eos> To give the people hope.<eos> So they can imagine a brighter future.<eos> Such glory you promise. And so cunning you've become.<eos> How you've changed since you came back to us from convent.<eos> I miss the girl you were.<eos> Many will.
She fought them off.<eos> Her arms are pretty bruised.<eos> If the head injury had been any deeper, we'd be having a different conversation.<eos> She's a lucky girl.<eos> What constitutes luck?<eos> LEWIS: Tony.<eos> Do you know who did this?<eos> We'll find them.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Or I will.
I was delayed... on another case.<eos> You were with Hugo Blayne.<eos> Keeping a close eye on me?<eos> I'm flattered.<eos> We're keeping a close eye on everyone involved with Mr Lawrie.<eos> OK, Hugo and I went for a drink at the Perch.<eos> I didn't know I had to tell you in advance.<eos> You can check with the bar staff.<eos> Very kind of you.<eos> We will.
(Sighs) This is never gonna end.<eos> I don't think you can do that in here, Jenny.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Jenny, listen to me.<eos> This motion is a smoke screen.<eos> They have nothing.<eos> - Then why are they doing it?<eos> - Politics.<eos> - If they win?<eos> - They won't.
She's playing you off of Roman.<eos> She wants his money.<eos> We're all very cool with each other.<eos> Wait...<eos> I... didn't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> - I was just...<eos> - He couldn't stand up for himself.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> - We have to help Jason.<eos> - We will.
-Am I right about that?<eos> -Son of a bitch!<eos> You... You asshole!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> You're the nothing.<eos> You.<eos> -We won't see her again.<eos> -Get off me.<eos> -No, sir.<eos> You will not.
That's right.<eos> - That's right.<eos> That's right. - Leave her alone.<eos> The girl should have been mine.<eos> Nobody's yours, Gorman.<eos> Nobody.<eos> And if you think you're getting Joan back--<eos> Oh, I'm gonna get her back.<eos> You think Dawn's gonna stop me?<eos> I will.
He felt it.<eos> And you hold onto whatever you want to, but I think you should hold onto that.<eos> I should have been able to do it myself.<eos> You could've.<eos> But you let yourself feel it.<eos> Kept your eyes open.<eos> You let me help you.<eos> She'll tell you she won't make a deal.<eos> She'll tell you she won't compromise.<eos> But she will.
I am so sorry.<eos> Jen!<eos> Jen!<eos> You crashed into that girl's car on purpose.<eos> I came across her story, and I wanted to make it right.<eos> - It worked.<eos> - Whoa, wait. What worked?<eos> Manipulating retaliation for a girl that did not even ask for it?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> She will.
I thought you were with Mr. Rich Chivalrous lawyer.<eos> He's a waiter.<eos> His name is Rich, and he kept saying,<eos> "oh, would you like another?"<eos> And I thought he was trying to loosen me up, but then it turns out he was just doing his job.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what, you'll get him next time, Cheryl.<eos> - Will she?
Go.<eos> Go.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ Can I stay here?<eos> Boy, are you fucked.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You're wondering if I have a sense of debt to you for saving my life...<eos> Maybe I'll change my mind about decimating yours.<eos> But you won't?
Go.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ Can I stay here?<eos> Boy, are you fucked.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You're wondering if I have a sense of debt to you for saving my life...<eos> Maybe I'll change my mind about decimating yours.<eos> But you won't?<eos> No, I won't.
Yes.<eos> See, it ain't me he's scared of.<eos> He's afraid I'll make him see his own true self.<eos> Would you reveal him if you could?<eos> You finally starting' to see he's a fake?<eos> No.<eos> I can't hold that notion.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You'll be shot, you try to leave.<eos> No, I won't...
Put that back on.<eos> Colonel mustard in the library with a knife.<eos> Oh.<eos> So very interesting.<eos> - What did he show you?<eos> - I'm not going to tell you.<eos> But I'll get revenge on you.<eos> - Not if I get it first.<eos> - Oh, will you?<eos> No, you won't.
Hold the iPhone.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Seeing Matty move on like I have would make me happy.<eos> I call bluffnanigans, Jenna.<eos> No one wants to see their ex date other people.<eos> - I do.<eos> I want Matty to date.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, if you're so sure, why don't you set him up yourself?<eos> Maybe I will.
There's only a storm in my bedroom!<eos> OK, see you after work.<eos> Bye.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I was going to call.<eos> I don't have a phone.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I know everyone does, but...<eos> Did you find your friend?<eos> You will.
Actually, I have a date with Lucy.<eos> - What?<eos> - With boobs? You lost.<eos> Yeah, but you get points for effort.<eos> Who knew?<eos> - But...<eos> - Phil...<eos> Your Honor, one more item.<eos> - Tell him that he's looking magisterial.<eos> - Okay, I will.
- Of course!<eos> - Incredibly charming?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Terribly wealthy.<eos> After several years of painstaking research, I've finally got my man.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Well...<eos> You may kiss me.<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - Well, you will. Of course.
Wardrobe full of them.<eos> ~ I'm sure there's something you can change into. ~ Thank you.<eos> ~ Let's get you cleaned up, shall we?<eos> ~ No, William!<eos> I won't pretend any more.<eos> I'm tired of pretending.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> SIDNEY: It'll be here.<eos> It has to turn up.<eos> Exactly, of course it will.
It's a hog.<eos> What?<eos> A hog.<eos> A dead hog.<eos> It ain't a murdered body?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> He waved me forward.<eos> Must be his leg.<eos> You gonna tell the sheriff?<eos> Most surely will.
Fine.<eos> Fine?<eos> Good.<eos> This Saturday?<eos> Yes, this Saturday.<eos> What do you want, Sidney?<eos> Amanda, your guests are here.<eos> I'll be right in.<eos> You haven't even spoken to the Parkers.<eos> I will.
Tell the police.<eos> Nothing touches that man.<eos> Stand up to him.<eos> He's killing us so we can't expose him.<eos> We can't ruin his perfect life.<eos> You are not a coward.<eos> It took courage to disobey his order.<eos> Don't let him get away with it.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> Of course I will.
You're wearing a new aftershave.<eos> I believe it has Ambergris in it.<eos> That's very expensive for the office.<eos> What's the special occasion?<eos> Uh, you know, date night with the wife.<eos> Yeah, Lena's on a short list for a position in the commerce department in D.C., so we're celebrating.<eos> Well, tell her congratulations for me.<eos> Oh, well, it's not said and done yet, but we're hopeful.<eos> You know, Jane we will bring Lisbon back home safe.<eos> Of course we will.
But then she came to her senses and left me.<eos> Yeah, well, they do that.<eos> What happened to your husband?<eos> Uh, he...<eos> He was a lawyer.<eos> Was in D.C. for a deposition, and decided to go for a run on the hotel treadmill.<eos> And he had a heart attack.<eos> There is a part of him that I still feel.<eos> I just want it to go away.<eos> It won't.
You're just a child, Henry.<eos> The first 200 years are easy.<eos> You still believe.<eos> So, how long have you been...?<eos> More like 2,000.<eos> You want to call me something?<eos> Call me Adam.<eos> Feels like I've been here right from the beginning.<eos> I think you and I should meet.<eos> Ah, we will.
- Hey, I'm a cop, not a hypnotist.<eos> - I did not set that fire.<eos> Even if that's true, Rick, you have exhausted all your appeals.<eos> I don't care about the courts.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> My son only knows me as this selfish, lying, fall-down drunk.<eos> - That's not who I am anymore.<eos> - I'll call him.<eos> See if he'd be willing to come by and say goodbye.<eos> He won't.
- Just grab the files for me, will you?<eos> - Sure, just as soon as I get the okay from the lead detective and the D.A.<eos> Two signatures, easy-peasy.<eos> That's BPD-2410 and 2413.<eos> - What?<eos> - I need the files now.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Everything is time-stamped.<eos> - Once I get the forms...<eos> - You will.
I think that's best.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Eli?<eos> At least look at me.<eos> What am I supposed to do with myself?<eos> Aren't you done with me telling you?<eos> What are you waiting for anyway?<eos> She won't even open the door.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - She won't.
- Yeah.<eos> I'll, uh, bring the vermouth.<eos> You bet your bippy you'll bring the vermouth.<eos> Consider that bippy broughten.<eos> Yes.<eos> I hope you have a good time with your nephew tonight.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> He's an exceptional young man.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow morning.<eos> Yes, you will.
Edgewater's aw...<eos> Edgewater is for super, super violent kids.<eos> They will eat you alive.<eos> - You told me to hit him.<eos> - I know. I know I did, okay?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I'm gonna fix it.<eos> I'm gonna fix it.<eos> - I'll stay at your place.<eos> - No, no, you won't.
Quickly, there's no one!<eos> So you discovered my secret army.<eos> You see that their loyalty needs some work?<eos> These benders shouldn't be used as weapons, they have the right to choose their own way.<eos> These benders are citizens from the Earth Kingdom and I am their Queen.<eos> Taking them constitutes an act of war.<eos> If they disobey me...<eos> All the power of my kingdom will fall upon them!<eos> They will come with me.<eos> No, they won't.
I googled me some, too.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to open-mike night at the Bluebird Café.<eos> - We have some amazing singer/songwriters...<eos> - I tell you what... this was a mistake.<eos> - ... for you tonight.<eos> - I'm gonna get out of here.<eos> - Tonight's list includes some longtime favorites...<eos> - No, d... do... don't.<eos> Just... - ... and some very interesting newcomers.<eos> - I will...
All right.<eos> I thought you said you talked to her.<eos> She's late again.<eos> I did, and I thought she got the message, but...<eos> This is getting old, Gunnar.<eos> All right, I'll call her, and I'll see what's going on.<eos> Kiley: Hello?<eos> Please tell me you're on your way to pick up Micah.<eos> I can't lose him, Gunnar.<eos> And you won't.
Yeah, pretty much.<eos> Can you show me?<eos> Hey.<eos> How's Edgehill's number... one artist?<eos> Or can I call you that, since your opening act has an album on the charts but...<eos> You don't?<eos> You know what?<eos> I bet this is your business... school way of asking if I got one ready for Edgehill.<eos> I told Henry Benton we'd be releasing next quarter.<eos> Yeah, and we will.
Previously on Suits...<eos> You're good with me working on the takeover with Logan.<eos> As long as we don't let that affect this.<eos> We won't.
Somebody's using my resources to pass classified secrets.<eos> And I thought that Borz might know about it, but...<eos> He was close to some people when he worked for me that were involved.<eos> That's what you couldn't tell me?<eos> I run a company that has several hundred million dollars in federal contracts, based in part on the fact that I can keep secrets.<eos> Anyone finds out that I have a mole, I'm ruined.<eos> Those contracts are gone, and the thousands of people who depend on me lose their jobs.<eos> If I have a mole, I need to find him myself before anyone else does.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Who's that?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> What does she want?<eos> She needs us back at the office.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You're not going to work.<eos> You just told me you have a drug addiction.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
You got the rope I need to hang myself?<eos> Here are your passports.<eos> That'll get you through, no problem.<eos> And we're workin' on gettin' you somethin' else to pitch.<eos> It's not gonna be a tunnel.<eos> - Yeah, what is it?<eos> - A plane.<eos> A plane?<eos> You found a plane?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
Uh, sorry.<eos> [Chittering]<eos> [Bleeps]<eos> [Electronic sigh]<eos> So, uh, see you around?<eos> Not if we see you first.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> [Grunts]<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You won't.
Are you in love with Alistair, Miss Reynolds?<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Alistair, no, wait!<eos> Vincent, wait.<eos> Wait for what?<eos> They already think I'm guilty, which is what Gabe wants them to think, right?<eos> No, he wants you to go after him.<eos> Kill or be killed.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.<eos> Yeah, but I won't.
A real doctor.<eos> - Thanks for everything, Doc.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on, you should smile.<eos> You just made 50 grand for 24 hours.<eos> - Smiling's extra. - All right.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Call me.<eos> All right.<eos> I certainly will, Officer.
Sleep tight.<eos> Max, we should go.<eos> Will.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> You never told her she had a brother?<eos> Well, I was hoping to tell her tonight.<eos> Then you showed up in your... condition.<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> I won't let you disappoint her the way you've disappointed everyone else in your life.<eos> - I won't.
- I won't.<eos> - You know dad, did it ever occur to you that you disappointed me?<eos> Never.<eos> Oh, uh, by the way, your wife, she barely touched her food, and, uh, what with that and the slight tremor, my guess is Adderall.<eos> You might want to look into that.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Well, so much for avoiding the big blowout.<eos> - Had to be done.<eos> God, I hope I don't blow this.<eos> You won't.
She died for you.<eos> What did you say?<eos> She died for you.<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> My Daughter Abby, she died for me.<eos> It was the first night of the war, and because of Abby, I was able to survive.<eos> Please, Senator, turn off the water.<eos> You can change things.<eos> Now we are gonna go outside and let the people know that things are gonna be different now.<eos> We will.
What?<eos> I don't even know...<eos> Because if something has changed since I first told you, if you don't want me to get married again, I need you to be open about it, instead of acting out.<eos> No, that's not it at all.<eos> Mom, I'm really happy for you.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know, honestly, I just forgot.<eos> Okay, I will try and change the time.<eos> - But if you miss it...<eos> - I won't.
The woman you think is your mother is not your mother.<eos> She's your kidnapper.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> No, stop talking, stop talking!<eos> Please, please, please...<eos> Carter, Carter.<eos> I just wanna go home, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I just wanna go see my mom.<eos> All right, Carter, and you will.
- You'd've rather they get away with it?<eos> - With what?<eos> They may have lied, but they're not criminals.<eos> I think this is the part where you're meant to back me up.<eos> What if they're into something they can't get out of?<eos> - The police might be able to help.<eos> - Like the detective said, if they've got nothing to hide, they have nothing to worry about.<eos> Why don't you let us find out what's going on?<eos> If there really is something bad, you can go to the cops and we'll come with you.<eos> We will...?
I'm not scared.<eos> I'm worried, like any mother would be.<eos> I just - - I just want to keep you safe.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> That's why I'm meeting with him -- to keep us all safe.<eos> It's not that simple, not where the Espheni are concerned.<eos> He must want something from you, Lexi, or none of this would be happening.<eos> I need to speak to him.<eos> You'll kill him.<eos> No. I won't.
Good.<eos> You know, I, uh, I didn't plan to come back to 15.<eos> I'm an analyst.<eos> I take orders.<eos> I go where they tell me to go.<eos> Of course.<eos> And you and, uh, Sam seem... good, so...<eos> I'm here just to get a job done. That's it.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> This is the dress that I was gonna wear.<eos> You're wearing it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's, um...<eos> This is the dress that I was gonna wear to... get you back.<eos> Well, it's a nice dress, and you look beautiful in it.<eos> But it doesn't change anything.<eos> What will?
Ralph occupy yourself with this.<eos> I have a riddle for you to figure out.<eos> You can tell your mom the answer at the end of the day.<eos> So, what kind of punch does a jellyfish like?<eos> You got it?<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> All right, hold on one second.<eos> Any dreams you have of him making a team or being in student council, it's just, uh, not gonna happen.<eos> I thought you told me he'd eventually fit in.<eos> No, he will, just not at school.
I know what you did for Jamal.<eos> Please, Jamal told me.<eos> Only me.<eos> I know how hard it must have been for you to go against everything you are.<eos> I want for us to work together.<eos> We both love Jamal.<eos> He needs us.<eos> He'll, um... he'll grow into the job.<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
I just didn't think it mattered.<eos> My son is there every fucking day.<eos> - Are they doing coke around him?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We don't do it ourselves. We don't bring it to the ranch.<eos> We don't sell to kids, ever.<eos> We have rules.<eos> Oh, how principled of you.<eos> Well, if you want to go, just... just go.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- He's gonna ask about me.<eos> - Specifically about my car.<eos> - Why?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I need you to say nothing.<eos> You never met me. You never fixed my car.<eos> What's that worth?<eos> How about 10 grand?<eos> Will that do it?<eos> No, but 20 will.
- Oh, please. She'll never let that happen.<eos> She's already made that mistake once.<eos> I don't give a shit what you want, Alison.<eos> Fine.<eos> I need you to say nothing.<eos> You never met me. You never fixed my car.<eos> What's that worth?<eos> How about 10 grand?<eos> Will that do it?<eos> No, but 20 will.
Should I do something?<eos> They won't find him.<eos> They're so afraid of him.<eos> I think they're afraid of me.<eos> It doesn't matter what they think.<eos> Maggie's with them.<eos> She used to believe in me, but now...<eos> Everything's changing.<eos> I haven't changed.<eos> I never will.
She thinks he's her father.<eos> What?<eos> We captured him, but then he escaped.<eos> He's been feeding her all these lies.<eos> What does he want with her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All he would say is that he's protecting her.<eos> But he's behind this.I know it.<eos> We have to get her out of here!<eos> We will!
Don't think that.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> You're gonna be great.<eos> I'll get you through it, all right?<eos> What are you people doing? !<eos> Get back behind the barricade!<eos> Get -- the Espheni are on the attack!<eos> Come on!<eos> When they see that we mean no harm, we will be spared.<eos> Like hell you will!
Usagi?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm not Usagi!<eos> Why are you... Well, because I'm a Sailor Guardian.<eos> This is not what normal people can do.<eos> Well, I am like this now but...<eos> You have superpowers too?<eos> Don't get in my way.<eos> Step back!<eos> I won't!
Thought we were already in the ninth circle of hell, but looks like there's a bonus level.<eos> Not one of 'em's got kids.<eos> They die out here, it's just them dying.<eos> Me, I go, kids'll have nothing.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Stay on mission.<eos> It's always the mission' isn't it?<eos> Draw straws like a good soldier.<eos> You can bet straws isn't gonna decide anything.<eos> A gun will.
Elsa...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I need you to find a way out.<eos> I need Anna.<eos> Well, we don't have her right now, but we have a way to find her, and we will, but right now, you're gonna have to do this on your own.<eos> I can't control this.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Y-you're trapped.<eos> It's a battle you can't win, but it's exactly the kind of battle you have to fight, or you'll die.<eos> No, I won't.
- That's crazy.<eos> - It is crazy.<eos> It's no crazier than saying that gluten causes tantrums.<eos> Right?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> All right, guess what, I'm gonna sign off on this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will regret it, but I'm signing off on this.<eos> - You're not gonna regret it.<eos> - Yes, I will.
It'll take some time to sift through it.<eos> Finch, I found Claire.<eos> Where?<eos> In the middle of the street.<eos> Looks like you were right, Harold, she does have a death wish.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> It's my job.<eos> So is finding out why you were standing in traffic.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Well, maybe your father will.
Actually, it's the furthest thing from my mind.<eos> Well, why is that, Alicia? Why?<eos> Because I hate politics.<eos> I do, too, Alicia.<eos> The last person I'd vote for is someone who liked politics.<eos> We have enough politicians.<eos> We need leaders who actually understand what it means to be a public servant.<eos> Listen, I've got to go.<eos> Promise me you'll think about it?<eos> I will.
Wining and dining the Port Authority.<eos> But I can tell you this right now.<eos> The Kings won't like this.<eos> And I'm afraid your Mexican solution...<eos> Well, that ain't gonna land on its feet.<eos> Let's go.<eos> This is bad news,<eos> Jax. If we don't get the guns, means we're gonna want most of Lin's turf.<eos> And that won't make Tyler very happy.<eos> No, it won't.
Come on.<eos> You know, Connor... he could be anywhere by now.<eos> Yeah, but he ain't gonna be using commercial transport.<eos> That's right, and he's gonna need cash to go underground.<eos> Give Tyler a call.<eos> You want the Niners to start looking for him?<eos> No. Connor doesn't know that Tyler's with us.<eos> We get him to call, tell Connor that Marks needs a shipment of guns when he gets out and that black will give him half the money down.<eos> Connor shows up for a duffle full of cash.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Come on.<eos> Eat fast.<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> Tommy scratched me.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Well, how'd he do that?<eos> I'll trim his nails. Let me see 'em. Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You really should try to eat something, Ma.<eos> I will, baby.
I got four coming up from AZ today.<eos> How many are having problems with the shift?<eos> Leland's boy, Scoot.<eos> Rudy.<eos> Maybe Decker.<eos> The rest don't give a shit.<eos> The hell they doing here?<eos> Tully wanted me to meet 'em.<eos> You tell Leland?<eos> We will.
- Why was she in here?<eos> She can't know what we're doing unless...<eos> No, there's only one Librarian,<eos> - and he was just spotted in...<eos> - Budapest, I think.<eos> Expedite the time table just in case.<eos> Start tomorrow with that blonde idiot at my desk.<eos> Honestly, how hard is it to knock?<eos> And if these people come back?<eos> They won't.
It's just me and the boy.<eos> You know lying' to a federal marshal ain't just a sin, it's a felony.<eos> There's no one here.<eos> You see for yourself.<eos> I ain't seen what's back there yet.<eos> Satisfied?<eos> I don't satisfy easy.<eos> I'm comin' back for you and the baby.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I will.
Correct.<eos> And then I get hammered.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> You got roughly 45 minutes.<eos> Take your car, get Ralph, drive like hell past the Santa Monica mountains.<eos> Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.
I just got to help Chucky catch up a bit.<eos> - Where you heading?<eos> - Stockton.<eos> Gonna see my lawyer, have him draw up a contract so I can sell my piece of Diosa.<eos> - Did you tell Jax?<eos> - I tried a couple of times.<eos> It's no worry, though.<eos> I mean, he and Alvarez, all good.<eos> - Yeah, well, you're gonna have to tell him.<eos> - And I will.
Well, I don't know.<eos> But I tell you, if I find out, I'm not gonna tell you anything until I know why.<eos> I went to see Juice this morning... trying to piece together...<eos> Jax, I'm really sorry.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I...<eos> I understand.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, Mano.<eos> Uh, yeah, if I see her, I'll, uh... I'll let you know.<eos> I will, I will.
- All right.<eos> - That's sweet.<eos> Well, Ali's still suffering in silence.<eos> Ah, the poor thing.<eos> I could barely get a smile out of her.<eos> If we didn't know, I'd ask her, "What's wrong?<eos> Why you being so quiet?"<eos> So ask. I'm afraid she'll make me.<eos> You're ex-CIA.<eos> She won't.
Montauk was a major center for moonshine production?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> It's true... they sold to all of Long Island, half the city, and there was never a bust out here.<eos> Too far out, I suppose. Too unassuming.<eos> Hmm, what are you trying to tell me, Mr. Solloway?<eos> I'm just trying to give you a little context for this town, Detective.<eos> There are feuds out here that have been going on for almost a century.<eos> Between the Hodges and the Lockharts?<eos> Do yourself a favor. Read my book.<eos> Okay, I will.
- What?<eos> - I'm not selling it. That was a mistake Cole made.<eos> He was upset about his brother, which I understand, but you can't make a sentimental decision like that about something so big.<eos> I'm gonna wait until the commercial loan comes through, and then I'm gonna sit the boys down and I'll tell them the good news.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> They all think they're about to be rich.<eos> They've been making plans.<eos> When they find out...<eos> - Whey're not going to find out.<eos> - Of course they will.
Garcia weeded out the mental health transfers.<eos> No one fits.<eos> Our best bet is still the morgellons group.<eos> Next week.<eos> When's their next meeting?<eos> It's too long to wait.<eos> We could take another shot at the leader.<eos> There's definitely something that she was holding back.<eos> You had thought she wouldn't rattle.<eos> She won't.
The least I can do, is comfort him when he's down.<eos> Go.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> Stuff has been sitting on your desk for days.<eos> I wanted you to have it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll need it for my new office.<eos> You got a job?<eos> - Not yet, but I will. - Oh.
What did I tell you?<eos> Don't throw me a sassy look.<eos> There's plenty of wash to be hung.<eos> Plenty of fish in the creek, too.<eos> Go on.<eos> That man.<eos> Sidney Snow.<eos> Did you get him?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> You will?
Just... laughing, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tonight was fun.<eos> God, is that awful?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It was sad, but... fun.<eos> Quinn, I'll just fuck it up.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I will.
- We good?<eos> I am looking at Gabriel right now.<eos> We're good to go.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Definitely.<eos> That is Luison.<eos> - Monroe.<eos> - You were supposed to tell me when this guy was coming home!<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Is Victoria back?<eos> - As if you don't know.<eos> I'm staying here until you tell me where she is.<eos> Damn you!<eos> Achashverosh. - Haman.<eos> Mom. Are you alright?<eos> I can imagine the look on your father's face when he realized I'm not home.<eos> Why are you thinking about him?<eos> Do you think that if you ask questions you'll get answers?<eos> You won't.
Or I'll take this whole place down!<eos> - Drop it!<eos> - It's a dead man's switch!<eos> You shoot me, my finger goes off the trigger.<eos> And everyone dies.<eos> You.<eos> Get behind the wheel.<eos> We're driving out of here together.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Why didn't he just kill her?<eos> I'm sure Winthrop was probably trying to get information out of her.<eos> We know she was close to learning the truth.<eos> Did you get DNA results on the hair you found in the coffin?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was a definite match to Briscoe and Winthrop's birth mother.<eos> D.B., Winthrop was definitely at that convent.<eos> He was there searching for his brother.<eos> - We can't prove that, though, right?<eos> - Oh, we will.
Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Enough with the dog already.<eos> You haven't heard a single word I've said.<eos> I don't have time for this now.<eos> Ok, fine.<eos> Then make time for this.<eos> I'm telling your wife about us.<eos> No, you won't.
Did she come with anybody?<eos> No. Another customer came over to her and the two of them did this sort of slow dance.<eos> And then they left.<eos> You could tell the guy was just doing it as a goof, but she was totally into it.<eos> I noticed that you have surveillance at the front entrance.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Those don't work.<eos> It's just there to scare off underage students.<eos> Well, listen, if you think of anything else that might be helpful, please, give us a call.<eos> I will.
I think they were just trying to hurt me badly enough I would run away from your father.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, don't be.<eos> Just... try and understand.<eos> Your father and I, we didn't want that poison anywhere near us or our children.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Look, you promised me you'd sleep, Naomi.<eos> I will.
Right, Jing, you'll take chapter two.<eos> Stephen, chapter three. Mitchell, chapter four.<eos> Chantelle, chapter five.<eos> And Joe's going to bring it on home with the anchor leg.<eos> Only if you help me out first.<eos> Fine, but I won't lie in court and I refuse to handle stolen goods.<eos> Cleo's Peng and this party's the last opportunity I'll have to pull her, but she thinks I'm as sexy as a shit in a lift.<eos> With a turn of phrase like that, I'm amazed she can resist you!<eos> I'll help you, babe!<eos> We all will.
I'll tell you what... admit that I've won and I'll give you a hint.<eos> I'll give you a chance to find Kent or Oren before...<eos> Bzzzzzt!<eos> Fine.<eos> You won.<eos> Now give me the hint.<eos> Changed my mind.<eos> Seven minutes left.<eos> She's got to make a move, shake him up somehow.<eos> She will.
We're not getting through, are we?<eos> That's all right.<eos> I have a feeling that the cartels have people that can be... very persuasive.<eos> That bastard tortured me for ten days, made me beg for my life, humiliated me and then somehow thought I was going into business with him.<eos> I only needed him to set up the hijacking.<eos> You always planned to kill him.<eos> He figured out I'd taken the money off the container before we even left port.<eos> He was angry.<eos> He got what he deserved.<eos> So will you.
It sure sounds that way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't think of one single solution in this whole, entire universe that would allow me to go to my event tonight.<eos> No.<eos> Now, he only eats nuggets, so just nuggets for dinner, maybe one or two nuggets before bed, and, if I'm not home by morning, a bowl of nuggets with some O.J.<eos> Um, okay, here is my number if you need to reach me.<eos> Oh, I would like to request that you keep the door to my wig colosseum closed because, if I did not make it clear, this whole situation is on climate control and has an estimated value of 60 grand.<eos> $60,000?<eos> Okay, Kevin, I'm leaving. Get it.<eos> I will, baby.
Well, there's nothing to say.<eos> - You attacked me.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I never hurt you.<eos> I love you.<eos> How am I supposed to believe that?<eos> Please, please.<eos> OK.<eos> You need to leave right now.<eos> OK. OK. I will, but...
Please.<eos> Please just let me go.<eos> Let you go?<eos> What, after you snuck into my home, hid here, waiting to kill me?<eos> You are a very sick young lady, and everyone knows that you're the one with psychiatric problems.<eos> You attacked me just like you did your ex-boyfriend, and I had to defend myself.<eos> I had no choice but to kill you.<eos> I mean, after all, you and Kenneth have been stalking me.<eos> No... no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Yes, they will.
The sorcerer did locate a third magical sister, yes, and she... will be a perfect match.<eos> What do you mean, "will be"?<eos> Therein lies the catch.<eos> She is not born yet.<eos> How does the sorcerer know something that hasn't happened yet?<eos> He knows many things.<eos> For example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...<eos> To the dark one, you will never find your happy ending.<eos> But if I give it to you...<eos> I will?
If that were the case, evidence of the murder weapon would most likely be found near those arteries.<eos> So we look again?<eos> We do.<eos> I should thank you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> For what?<eos> For busting me.<eos> For making me work harder.<eos> My career is about more than pleasing you.<eos> I should make a difference.<eos> Well, perhaps you won't.
Liam!<eos> Liam!<eos> Liam!<eos> Do you remember when you told me that I might... I might have such strong feelings about a boy that it might be hard for me to decide what's right to do?<eos> It was something like that tonight with Jeff.<eos> You know, I like him an awful lot, and we... we have such fun dances.<eos> But tonight, the feeling between us kept getting stronger and stronger.<eos> Okay, it's been, like, 15 minutes.<eos> Karma, say something.<eos> Fine, I will.
~ Ooh.<eos> Merci, monsieur!<eos> Oh, it's just a small one.<eos> Well, I... I know you live alone, so a full-sized bottle would be too much for one sitting.<eos> Well, I could have asked one of my toy boys round.<eos> ~ You don't have a toy boy, do you?<eos> ~ No, it was a joke.<eos> I'll laugh about it later.<eos> Don't forget the card.<eos> I won't.
Lady Doutzen and her household will be returned home.<eos> - Herr Schuler was very helpful.<eos> - You're a wonder.<eos> Queen, diplomat, white knight.<eos> Francis dealt with Herr Schuler directly.<eos> It was his doing.<eos> He's a good man, you know, and he'll make a good king.<eos> Your opinion is enough for me.<eos> And your lover, Lady Doutzen, when will she return to you?<eos> - She won't.
No, jacob.<eos> It was sweet of you to invite her.<eos> It was her time, and she knew it.<eos> She just needed someone to show her how.<eos> Is that why you went to see her in the park?<eos> I had to lie about it.<eos> People who aren't like us wouldn't understand.<eos> Am I gonna have to go away one day?<eos> One day...<eos> We both will.
Actually, Your Honor, I do.<eos> I am AUSA Perotti, and I have a federal warrant here to stop these proceedings.<eos> For what cause?<eos> Pending the disposition of federal criminal charges against J-Serve for theft of trade secrets.<eos> The company's assets have been frozen.<eos> Theft of trade secrets?<eos> You're charging the company - J-Serve has stolen millions of dollars of intellectual property, Judge.<eos> The civil suit can't proceed until the criminal case has been resolved.<eos> Peter's introductory remarks will last approximately five minutes, and he won't stay on stage during Alicia's speech.<eos> - He won't?
Yeah.<eos> I'll always be right here.<eos> Sure, our family wasn't perfect, but nothing's ever unfixable.<eos> Guess who just booked his first modeling gig.<eos> You can suck it.<eos> Well...<eos> I am very proud and not at all surprised.<eos> I never really believed this could have happened.<eos> But you always did.<eos> And I always will.
You're a hard worker...<eos> A bootstrapper.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But you should know, I will personally make sure you lose that scholarship and this crappy minimum-wage job and any chance you have of a future if you don't tell me where you're keeping the video of the girl you and your buddy screwed<eos> at that party last night.<eos> I need answers, Bobby.<eos> Hey, Jake, it's me.<eos> Sorry I haven't had time to talk, but I was thinking, my place for dinner tonight?<eos> I'll cook.<eos> Okay, I won't.
But I've been inside before, and Anna wasn't there.<eos> The library's... well, a funny place.<eos> There are all these tunnels underneath.<eos> You think she could be down there?<eos> Regina kept a whole dragon under there for 28 years.<eos> I'm sure you can fit a small princess, too.<eos> Yes.<eos> Frozen by the Snow Queen.<eos> That's why we never found Anna.<eos> But now we will.
I mean, we both think that.<eos> And I-- Well well, and you've outgrown the position.<eos> Yes, everything's-- everything's growing except for my salary.<eos> Right.<eos> - It's a joke, but--<eos> - Sure.<eos> - But yes, um... - Mm-hmm.<eos> I know--I do know that things have been slow here, but obviously, things are gonna pick right back up.<eos> - Yeah, we think so.<eos> - Yeah. Oh, they will.
What say we see how many drinks it takes to make me good at my job?<eos> Those photos...<eos> Who took them?<eos> - How did you have them? - How did you have them?<eos> You stole them from my safe-deposit box, and you took that knife.<eos> The investigation of Conrad's murder was heating up.<eos> I had to lead them away from you.<eos> By handing them my knife?<eos> If they link that to me...<eos> They won't.
You have to defend yourself, Cary.<eos> - He did nothing wrong.<eos> - Then subpoena him<eos> - and have him say that. - He has nothing to do with the coke going missing.<eos> Well, neither do you.<eos> But they'll crucify him.<eos> Cary, they're crucifying you.<eos> Look, you have to tell them that you were under orders.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then I will.
Staff?<eos> Other members?<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Did you ever notice anything suspicious?<eos> Well, there was one guy, a sleaze bag lawyer who used to come here looking for clients.<eos> He was always bringing the Mikorskis papers to sign, confusing them.<eos> You got a name on that lawyer?<eos> I may have his card in my office.<eos> Oh, I'll go with you.<eos> Of course, you will.
Who is The Decembrist?<eos> Fitch.<eos> His name is Alan Fitch.<eos> Milos, this you cannot do.<eos> Give me one reason.<eos> - Because he's mine.<eos> - Yours?<eos> He gave the orders, discredited you, and you want to protect him?<eos> This is not for you to do.<eos> But I will.
Because Michael wasn't just a whore.<eos> He was a whore sent by Elizabeth North to entrap me.<eos> I'm bugging her phone because she set me up, and I need to know what she has on me.<eos> I need your help, Liv.<eos> She's a client.<eos> Who's trying to destroy your friend.<eos> We've been on opposite sides before.<eos> We've survived.<eos> We won't survive this.<eos> Neither will he.
It's not something I'd wish on anyone.<eos> That bomb went off... and I woke up.<eos> My body woke up.<eos> I'm not the same person I was, but if you will give me a second chance, if you will try...<eos> I have some good news.<eos> I can call off the hit men 'cause Elizabeth North is already dead.<eos> Please be joking.<eos> Please have good news.<eos> A source close to Elizabeth tells us she keeps a secret apartment under an assumed name at the Findley.<eos> A love nest, if you will.
Goodsell looks quick, purposeful.<eos> He's working an op.<eos> Question is-- for whom?<eos> This area he's covering is full of government agencies.<eos> You got the DEA, the USCIS.<eos> There's even a federal courthouse.<eos> He could be working for a foreign agency.<eos> The sushi manager doesn't know anything about him?<eos> No, and the shelters we talked to don't recognize him, either.<eos> But maybe their clients will.
That's why I chose to be a CDC officer.<eos> It allowed me to investigate troubled people.<eos> What about Audrey?<eos> Can you help her?<eos> I've been trying, but I thought that on the inside, she was still Mara and not a copy.<eos> There can't be a copy, not... not in one world.<eos> So if you took Mara home, then Audrey would get better?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Look, our best chance at fixing all of this is if you bring Mara to me.<eos> Then I will.
Did she now?<eos> You did a lot of good stuff for my kids when I wasn't there for them, and I never thanked you.<eos> So... thank you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, is this one of those amends things?<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in. Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
- Gabriel!<eos> - How did Jonas know the child's name?<eos> - Jonas met Gabriel the other day.<eos> - It's so cute!<eos> Would you like to issue me a warning, director of Justice?<eos> Just for a while, Mother;<eos> till little guy catch up us.<eos> I think we all agree that he will sleep in my room.<eos> - Only if the Elders says It's Okay.<eos> - They will.
This rotten town.<eos> Those it can't corrupt, it soils.<eos> It's soiled you, John Hartigan.<eos> Put that bottle down, Nancy.<eos> You've had enough.<eos> It made you lie to me.<eos> You're not even here right now.<eos> You said you'd never leave me.<eos> I never left you.<eos> I never will.
This way...<eos> Come on.<eos> - I dont believe it we're in their cellars!<eos> You're supposed to lead out not, not further in.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> Come on, this way.<eos> Everyone, into the barrels, quickly!<eos> - Are you mad?<eos> They'll find us.<eos> - No, no, they won't!
You can not hunt thirty orcs on your own.<eos> But I'm not on my own.<eos> You knew I would come.<eos> The king is angry Tauriel.<eos> For six hundred years my father has protected you.<eos> Favorited you.<eos> You deviate his orders.<eos> You betrayed his trust.<eos> Come back with me he will forgive you.<eos> But I will not.
- Turn around and do not come back.<eos> It's undoubtedly a trap.<eos> The evil that is hidden here...<eos> I command it come forth!<eos> I command it reveal itself!<eos> And now come here.<eos> The Wizard has come.<eos> He is lifting the spell...<eos> He will find us!<eos> Yes... he will.
What we always did.<eos> Follow Gary King into almost certain oblivion.<eos> Hello, Steven.<eos> You all right, mate?<eos> Pete.<eos> Hi, mate.<eos> Didn't we decide to stop calling him Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.<eos> No, they won't.
And I'm so glad that Jane Fonda stopped all those causes of hers and made a nice movie with her father.<eos> I just don't understand people like her and Ed Asner, shouting their opinions all over the place.<eos> Listen to me, because you're all on your way.<eos> When one reaches star status, it is not an invitation to show everyone how to change the world.<eos> It is not our business to change the world.<eos> We are here to entertain the world... and to sell drinks and souvenirs.<eos> These kids better go get ready for the next show if they're going to entertain anybody.<eos> Will you watch us tonight?<eos> We put a new song in just for you.<eos> Of course I will!
-Hey.<eos> I'm gonna give you the tiny little momma.<eos> Daddy..<eos> -I know you're mad at me.<eos> I know you are.<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> No matter what anybody says, i.. Love you.<eos> Alright that's it.<eos> -More than anything in the world.<eos> And i always will.
Go back there and cup his ass.<eos> He's quite a stocky man.<eos> - He might have a knife. - I don't even have to be here.<eos> I can go home and watch Family Guy if you don't want to play.<eos> I'll get the check.<eos> Excuse me! - Can I have the check?<eos> - She doesn't need the check.<eos> She's joking.<eos> - Then go cup his ass.<eos> - Okay, I will.
He sent them back to the place of their birth.<eos> Their home now a prison between heaven and earth.<eos> Erik severed the link between giants and men.<eos> And peace returned to his kingdom again.<eos> The mystical relics were all that remained safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.<eos> And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep.<eos> And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend.<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
-[Chris] You want to play with your grandpa?<eos> -[kids] Yeah!<eos> [Chris] Get in there.<eos> Is that the way you like it?<eos> -[Lucy] Yeah, and then put that on.<eos> -[girl] Put the hat on.<eos> [Max] No, I will not wear a hat.<eos> -[kids] Why?<eos> -[Max] Cause I'll muss my hair.<eos> -[kids] No, you won't.
So much love to give.<eos> Sharing that love...<eos> That's the most important thing.<eos> [Max] More important than work.<eos> More important than dreams.<eos> It's more important than anything.<eos> [Max] Do you understand, Honey?<eos> I understand.<eos> [Max] I love you, baby.<eos> And I always will.
No, Dad...<eos> That's what happened to your mother, and that's what's gonna happen to him.<eos> I'm really sorry, Mr. Grigio.<eos> Go.<eos> Get out of here and be safe, no matter what.<eos> Okay?<eos> Julie...<eos> I have to go.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> Yes. Yeah, I will.
Lot less than laying around, trying to figure out how long it would take to flunk out.<eos> I'm gonna go for a walk.<eos> I'm trying to take care of him.<eos> I know.<eos> I know you are.<eos> At least I've got my classes to get my mind off things, but he's... did you ever try to talk to dad about things?<eos> Dad?<eos> I just have to be strong for him until he comes out of it.<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
He came out of nowhere.<eos> I swear to God, I never saw him.<eos> You guys all right?<eos> You guys Okay?<eos> Pay-per-view! Pay-per-view!<eos> Pay-per-view! - It's gonna be real.<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> I'm not believing you brought this boy to the bar.<eos> We're going to the movies.<eos> We will.
That was from, like, eighth grade.<eos> I didn't know you still associated with these... people.<eos> No, Dad, I swear, I didn't know they were coming.<eos> Your interview with Dr. Collins is at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.<eos> I'll pick you up at seven.<eos> - Your suit is pressed?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I had to call in a lot of favors to get you this interview.<eos> Be rested, be sharp, do not embarrass me.<eos> I won't.
We're still re-seeding the atmosphere.<eos> It's breathable, but thin.<eos> In the event of an evacuation, two breaths every minute from one of these will compensate for lower levels of surface oxygen.<eos> Lights out in five.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Look, this may be amusing to you, but they'll come looking for me.<eos> You wanna fight me?<eos> Is that the test?<eos> To see if I'll attack an old man?<eos> Well, I won't.
Hey, what's going on up there?<eos> What is this?<eos> That is the price of leaving the nest.<eos> Oh, who are you?<eos> You're pretty cool.<eos> Come over here!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Hey, don't be afraid.<eos> I'm not gonna eat you or anything.<eos> He will.
And I want to tell you everything.<eos> Good.<eos> Tonight, after you were gone, I thought a lot.<eos> About you... and how you've been treating me, and I thought:<eos> Why do I love you?<eos> And then, I felt everything in me... just let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly... and it hit me that I don't have an intellectual reason.<eos> I trust myself, I trust my feelings.<eos> I'm not gonna try to be anything other than who I am anymore... and I hope you can accept that.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
I don't think he's worried about the opinions of a mid-level foreign attaché<eos> That's why I signed Hillary's name to it.<eos> I'll see if The Times will hold it.<eos> No, I've got bigger issues.<eos> No, Sarah, I am collecting cables from the head of every foreign desk.<eos> You tell me, then, what do I ignore?<eos> This?<eos> This destroys the Sudanese peace talks, this screws a source in Amman...<eos> The Times will redact the names.<eos> Yeah, but, what about him, will he?
You're not a car.<eos> You're a snail.<eos> I got a shot here, Chet.<eos> I can do this. You'll see.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> I will not stand by and watch the only brother I've got risk his life chasing some impossible dream.<eos> I'm sorry, Theo.<eos> All of these people, they believe in me.<eos> Guy Gagné believes in me.<eos> Why won't you?
Take the jewels to your office...<eos> Find an AC vent, open it, and stuff 'em in.<eos> - Put the grating back on and forget about it. - But...<eos> You don't tell your mother and you don't check on them to make sure they're still there.<eos> In about three months, I'll send someone in to get them from you.<eos> Might take a long time to fence, but after that's done, you'll receive your share by express mail.<eos> You can't put that money in a bank, Leslie.<eos> You can't go on a crazy shopping spree.<eos> Okay.<eos> But... How much will it...
My plane takes off in two hours.<eos> The bus is about to leave.<eos> Who cares? Stay!<eos> The kids have school in two days.<eos> We'll figure it out. Stay!<eos> There is a spark.<eos> Stay.<eos> Yeah, Mommy, stay!<eos> But if I stay, I'll have to find a job, get a visa...<eos> We will.
It's business.<eos> I would do the same.<eos> But it isn't just business, is it?<eos> What we do. It's passion, love.<eos> Which is why we are prepared to risk our lives for it.<eos> Not me.<eos> If I had more talent and could earn better money with something else, I would.<eos> How do you know you will make money here?<eos> You haven't yet.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
You're a really great singer.<eos> You've got really great taste in gowns.<eos> You make it a little hard for me to take myself seriously in this getup.<eos> Where are you in there?<eos> There you are, yeah.<eos> Do you slow dance?<eos> Sure.<eos> ♪ Suddenly life has new meaning to me ♪<eos> I don't remember Wattlesbrook teaching us that move.<eos> Yeah, neither will those posh boys up at the house.
This is a mistake.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> - Sir!<eos> Sir?<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - In all its glory.<eos> Chester, look, I can't do this.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I will.
Please!<eos> Give me that fucking hand or I'll knock your fucking teeth right down your fucking throat.<eos> You understand me? Eh? Eh?<eos> Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!<eos> Please. Just let me out of here.<eos> Of course I am going to let you out of there, mate.<eos> You've been a real good sport.<eos> But first I'm going to grab us another drink.<eos> You're going to let me go now?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.
In a one-handed slide rule contest, I'd win first prize for sure.<eos> I think I can make each rib half an ounce lighter.<eos> Really? That's good.<eos> Thirty ribs makes about a pound.<eos> That's too much.<eos> Half a pound is enough for two.<eos> I could eat a pound of mackerel by myself.<eos> I'll keep holding your hand.<eos> You should sleep. - You won't let go?<eos> - No, I won't.
Move your feet!<eos> Sell her.<eos> What's all this?<eos> You will sell the negress.<eos> Sell little Pats?<eos> She pick with more vigor than any other nigger.<eos> Choose another to go.<eos> No other.<eos> Sell her.<eos> I will not.
Monsieur Poirot?<eos> Poirot?<eos> (Entrez.)<eos> How are you, old chap?<eos> Not dead yet.<eos> Did you have a good chat with Norton?<eos> And he told you what he saw?<eos> Well...what was it?<eos> You might misunderstand.<eos> Of course, I won't.
You have baby names?<eos> You want babies?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Don't you?<eos> What'd you say we let the Mama take a look?<eos> I'd love to...<eos> Now hand over my baby.<eos> Bo promised...<eos> She promised nothing would happen to my baby.<eos> Then nothing will.
She wants our forgiveness.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> You destroyed us.<eos> You ran off in the middle of the night.<eos> We lost our standing. We were almost exiled.<eos> No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
Rytsas.<eos> That was close enough.<eos> Does she know her daughter's a queen?<eos> Not yet.<eos> That will be a surprise, I expect.<eos> Many surprises for her.<eos> How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?<eos> Will you come with me one day to Volantis?<eos> When all this is over?<eos> I will.
So right...<eos> There is an exhibition game in Japan and I got no one to send over there.<eos> What do you mean "no one"?<eos> You know, nobody wants to play.<eos> Looks like I am to play myself. I want to play.<eos> I can do that.<eos> - What's your last name?<eos> - And you can go to Japan? - Wherever.<eos> - How about your friend?<eos> - Of course, he will.
What would be the point?<eos> He'll be broke.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> Or is it worse than that?<eos> I don't want to get mixed up in something heavy.<eos> You already are.<eos> How would you know he won't come looking for you?<eos> But he won't, will he?<eos> No.<eos> He won't
Sorry.<eos> What?<eos> That's such a cheat.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Honeymoon?<eos> Bed and breakfast in Scotland.<eos> I am not taking my pants off for Scotland.<eos> But it's all we can afford.<eos> Take off your pants.<eos> I will not.
Back of King's Cross tunnel.<eos> At 3:30.<eos> I'll be there. And, Martin...<eos> You be careful.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's a bit bloody late for that.<eos> Do you think it'll work?<eos> It'll buy us a few hours.<eos> He'll see you.<eos> No, he won't.
Why do you laugh?<eos> One day, Lupo, all that you see here will fall under Rome's rule.<eos> And if that day happens a bit further down the road, because of Da Vinci's intervention... ..so be it.<eos> But he has the key.<eos> That makes him one step closer to obtaining the Book of Leaves.<eos> Let him keep it for now.<eos> At least we know where it is.<eos> And besides...the key is useless without its counterpart.<eos> And what if Da Vinci obtains that?<eos> He won't.
Derek. Hey.<eos> You're not really quitting, are you?<eos> Look, this isn't what I signed up for.<eos> I don't believe in this anymore.<eos> But you can't leave.<eos> Well, apparently I can, and you should find a way out as well.<eos> Hey, I'm not like you.<eos> This is my big break.<eos> It may never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.

Every room keeps getting blocked.<eos> (Electrical sparking) There's a way, we'll find it.<eos> Or... we could just... glare at it.<eos> I hate this.<eos> The warehouse was supposed to do good, but instead, it just keeps killing the people I love.<eos> Well, that's kind of a simplification.<eos> Is it, though?<eos> You died, Leena died, and now, the whole damn world is dying.<eos> Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and Myka will find a cure.<eos> - They will.
- Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's a cup phone.<eos> See?<eos> You put your ear in that, and I put my mouth in that.<eos> You are a genius.<eos> Absolute brilliance.<eos> Thanks for watching them.<eos> - Say hi to your mom from me.<eos> - I will.
You will do what we do.<eos> And we will watch how well you do it.<eos> You represent the finest schools.<eos> Your intelligence and achievement is well noted but to excel at this internship, you're going to need far more than brain power.<eos> What you're going to need...<eos> Nothing funny.<eos> Googliness.<eos> The intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine for change.<eos> Now, you will be divided into teams and by the end of the summer only one team will be guaranteed a full-time position.<eos> The other 95% of you... will not.
But these concave petals, they... ..they reflect sound over a much larger area.<eos> Like a cave.<eos> And it draws the bats in.<eos> It's a consensual arrangement.<eos> The bats get nectar and the flowers get sex.<eos> (Laughs)<eos> Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.<eos> You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.<eos> They must.<eos> They will.
That's a Jewish surname.<eos> Explains why she's buried in a pauper's graveyard.<eos> Who is she?<eos> And what is she to Riario?<eos> Maybe only gets stiff for the stiff.<eos> You might be right.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.<eos> - If he sees us...<eos> - He won't.
Will you?<eos> If revenge is your aim, you must overcome your apprehension.<eos> Now that we've established my propensity for directness, I have a question for you.<eos> Where is my Maestro?<eos> Have you ever tasted blood, Nico?<eos> It erm... possesses a peculiar saltiness.<eos> Don't bother, Nico.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Wouldn't reveal anything even if he did.<eos> - Yes, he will.
Death is on its way to take Kauko.<eos> Don't grieve for him. Don't pity him. Guess where he is now?<eos> The Valkyries are taking him home to Valhalla.<eos> Right at this moment he is...<eos> He is drinking ale with the gods. Yes,<eos> He is happier than even we are, With our boat and... These goods.<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death. It was done in the name of king Aelle,<eos> And king Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will... If the gods will it.
Because Ragnar told you to.<eos> It is often the way that the new Earl deals with the family of the old.<eos> Ragnar won't kill you.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> My brother doesn't hold grudges.<eos> He's strange that way.<eos> Well...<eos> Even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.<eos> And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.<eos> They won't.
It's different.<eos> Get down!<eos> Mortars.<eos> They've crossed Houston.<eos> We gotta get to the river.<eos> But Kenya's back there.<eos> There's half a squad between us.<eos> She's smart.<eos> She'll go to the river.<eos> No, she won't!
Count along with me, Isaac.<eos> One... two.<eos> Three.<eos> Mr. McCall?<eos> Uh, I'm sure it's an emergency if your mother needs you to leave school, but I'm gonna give you a warning in the nicest possible way. I am well aware of your attendance record.<eos> I don't wanna see you slip back into old habits.<eos> I won't.<eos> It's gonna be different this year.<eos> Resolutions are only good if you stick with them, Scott.<eos> I will.
Okay.<eos> Golden opportunity.<eos> For what?<eos> Little kid and a woman.<eos> Ask them for a hand, get a hold of those weapons.<eos> What?<eos> We do it quick, they'll never know what hit them.<eos> - No. Whoa, whoa.<eos> - We're out here to bury Donna.<eos> And we will, after.
This one does not travel in the hold.<eos> She is far too precious for that.<eos> No, this one we keep close.<eos> We nurture, Inspector.<eos> For when she's grown just a few more years, well, imagine the price we shall fetch for her.<eos> It was you.<eos> The policeman on the boat that day.<eos> Victor told me how you screamed for your girl...<eos> You will tell me where you keep her!<eos> I will not!
You watch, you watch.<eos> Where?<eos> !<eos> There is not much provided in this world which aids the course of justice.<eos> So we take what we can, Miss Silver.<eos> Do it, Sergeant!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> You will tell me?<eos> I will!
No.<eos> You haven't forgiven me.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> You don't love me anymore.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm with someone else now.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I feel an infinite tenderness for you.<eos> I always will.
I'm sorry, Martha, but let's go.<eos> Uh, thanks for the cookies, Dad.<eos> I can't deny it's an interesting area.<eos> Interesting?<eos> Yeah, I've been looking into it.<eos> Did you know that... if you take every single person killed in a terrorist act around the world in the last 20 years and you add to that all the lives lost in the Middle East since 1967, the Six Day War,<eos> and you add to that every single American life lost in Vietnam, in Korea, and in every single American engagement since then...<eos> Iraq, Afghanistan... if you take all those lives and you multiply it by two, that's the number of children that die of malaria every single year.<eos> So are you saying you'll help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
What would I be doing?<eos> Do--do I need to type?<eos> Because I'm not very good at that.<eos> I just--I can't believe it.<eos> I-I can't believe it.<eos> Okay, I guess--I guess you really are feeling okay.<eos> Now, look, I know this all sounds really cool, right? Yeah.<eos> But it's also a lot of responsibility.<eos> New York is an intense place, and you're gonna have to prove to me that you can handle it.<eos> I will.
I'm sure, kiddo.<eos> You should take this, Carrie.<eos> I think Dorrit should have it.<eos> Mom always loved you in green.<eos> It's the losing of love that makes us who we are-- the loss of a parent.<eos> Of your virginity... ♪ All they really want<eos> Who you thought you might be...<eos> Nobody saw you, right?<eos> 'Cause if your dad found out...<eos> He won't.
- I don't care.<eos> The only reason why we're not dead right now is because their card game ended and they went back inside.<eos> Juliet was definitely right about you.<eos> What do you mean right about me?<eos> About what?<eos> That you're too emotionally invested in this case - to be involved. - [Clicks tongue]<eos> Look, I want nothing more than to bust Carp, but we keep going on this crazy train, we're gonna end up like the Blueberry.<eos> Okay, fine, fine, fine!<eos> You want out? Then get out!<eos> - Yes, I will, I will.
You stole this airplane, you stole the Cadillac.<eos> Those are felonies.<eos> You are in big trouble.<eos> Oh, relax.<eos> No one stole anything.<eos> I rented this plane, and I'm fairly certain those Hispanic gentlemen stole that Cadillac from someone else.<eos> That should make you feel better.<eos> - It doesn't.<eos> Not one bit.<eos> - Well, then this will.
I'm making biscuits for my brunch.<eos> Borrow?<eos> So I'll get it for you. (computer chimes) thanks.<eos> Oh. I think someone just winked at me.<eos> Can you blame 'em?<eos> Huh. I thought we were out of whiskey.<eos> Angela bassett played tina turner in the movie.<eos> That's what's happening here.<eos> Want me to fight angela me?<eos> 'cause I will.
Secret's out.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> But I need you to put out the lighter, okay?<eos> Look, Jesse...<eos> Jesse, I don't want to kill you.<eos> And you don't wanna be killed.<eos> So put it out.<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He won't.
Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad...<eos> Okay, boys! Take it all.<eos> Let's get everything.<eos> Put out the lighter.<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He won't.
Wait. This doesn't add up.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> What doesn't make sense?<eos> Kang would not go out like that, sir.<eos> That's not who he is.<eos> I think he's still in the bunker.<eos> And he has the president.<eos> He's gonna try and slip away.<eos> If Kang is still on the premises with the president, you can't let him leave.<eos> He won't.
No.<eos> That's all.<eos> For now.<eos> Dr Parr a friend of yours?<eos> A friend of my wife's.<eos> It just goes on and on.<eos> Relentless.<eos> It will stop, I promise.<eos> I just thought, when she woke up, we would get some answers.<eos> And you will.
Yeah, thanks for actually washing your clothes.<eos> I did all of your laundry while I was at it, Mrs. J.<eos> - You didn't have to do that.<eos> - It was there.<eos> Plus, it was worth it to see Adam's cock.<eos> - What? - Huh?<eos> I know those were your rooster boxers.<eos> Uh, there are multiple roosters, so it would be "cocks."<eos> - I'll drive.<eos> - No, you will not.
- You didn't have to do that.<eos> - It was there.<eos> Plus, it was worth it to see Adam's cock.<eos> - What? - Huh?<eos> I know those were your rooster boxers.<eos> Uh, there are multiple roosters, so it would be "cocks."<eos> - I'll drive.<eos> - No, you will not.<eos> - No!<eos> - No, you will not.
Not since they finished the debriefing.<eos> Now that they have everything they need to know, we are dispensable.<eos> What did you tell them about Max Mostov?<eos> Nothing that we hadn't already told Moscow in our reports, about his behaviour and opinions.<eos> You heard he's been deported?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> He wasn't dangerous.<eos> Will you remind them, Colonel that we should never stay in one place for too long?<eos> Yes, I will.
Hmm. You can't settle anywhere, can you?<eos> Which makes me think you're unhappy.<eos> My work is important.<eos> I've never quite understood what it is.<eos> Is this my colour?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> I thought you might need it.<eos> I know how you feel the cold.<eos> They'll steal it.<eos> No, they won't.
You must believe that you will.<eos> That they will survive and so will you.<eos> You survived polio.<eos> Is it true we are headed for Romania?<eos> So they say.<eos> Ah, I have cousins there.<eos> They have a fine orchestra.<eos> If they won't have me, it will mean a cap on the pavement.<eos> Will you go back to fight this war, Colonel?<eos> We both will.
Take it back to the hospital. Somebody will want it.<eos> I want it.<eos> - It's me or the baby.<eos> - The baby, sweetheart.<eos> Know you're gonna regret this.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Are you gonna leave?<eos> - No.<eos> Everybody always leaves.<eos> I won't.
I don't know what to do.<eos> Oh, no, please don cry when I'm eating.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just I miss it.<eos> I miss it so, so much.<eos> And the missing makes me sad.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Really?<eos> You will?
Not so much.<eos> Then I fear for you.<eos> I do work with one advantage, however.<eos> You want to tell me?<eos> It's my home field.<eos> Always were a faker.<eos> You shouldn't have killed the boy, Frank.<eos> I never knew a man who could make cheating so heroic.<eos> Care to take a turn with me, Miss Hart?<eos> I will.
I mean, I've felt that way myself.<eos> I'm sure a lot of people have.<eos> You're not alone, Atticus.<eos> Um, I'm sure we can work it all out.<eos> Wait, does that mean you'll take me back?<eos> Fuck no.<eos> You're a lying, cheating, fucking scumbag. Wah!<eos> - Okay, I'll take you back.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You will?
He wants to concentrate on his sobriety and enlightenment.<eos> He's at fucking Happy Endings!<eos> - Listen, do you think maybe--<eos> - No, Charlie.<eos> You don't even know what I'm about to say.<eos> You were gonna ask me to go talk to him for you.<eos> - Would ya, Hank, please?<eos> - No, can't do it.<eos> - Won't do it.<eos> - Of course he will.
Is he your boyfriend?<eos> No, but it's kind of better than a boyfriend, you know?<eos> No.<eos> It's kind of more exciting.<eos> That sounds too exciting.<eos> It's hard to describe.<eos> Are you just getting home?<eos> My dad's gonna kill me.<eos> Maybe you should go.<eos> I will.
We are to choke this boy now. But before we do, I would have a broader picture painted as to what and why.<eos> Find Captain Jackson.<eos> Bring him back to the dead room.<eos> Tell him...<eos> Tell him I would have a more intimate study of our fellow, Manby.<eos> Good evening to you.<eos> God sends his confections for the poor boys what's incarcerated here.<eos> This way, sir.<eos> Now, you tell me should any other come visit my boy.<eos> I will, sir.
Because he owes his name to you.<eos> An English name.<eos> It was an English world in which he hoped to survive.<eos> He had none he was born with?<eos> He might have.<eos> The cruelty men found him, trapping rats for food in a railway yard.<eos> He was eight and knew no parent to tell him it.<eos> And you became that parent... that person to whom he may now turn.<eos> Miss Goren, you will get word to me should he come to you for refuge, will you not?<eos> I will, Inspector.
- We came into some money.<eos> - Tell him how, Augie.<eos> - We've been saving this story.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, the first 10-, 12,000, I really worked for.<eos> Put away a little each week.<eos> But he's not telling you the big news.<eos> - Why we're in New York.<eos> - You tell them.<eos> Okay, I will.
And he needed help.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He killed himself because no one gave a damn.<eos> So everything that we talked about, our... our plans and having a family... none of it was ever going to happen.<eos> He lost his life.<eos> And I lost everything.<eos> But his sacrifice won't be forgotten.<eos> Killing people isn't going to bring your husband back.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
People dig a little mystery, Hank... a tease, an intellectual reach-around...<eos> Things like spontaneous combustion in Budapest.<eos> Or... Or skunk apes in Arkansas.<eos> I swear, you put one of these on the cover...<eos> No, you know what?<eos> I am not gonna pay for you to go skunk aping in Arkansas.<eos> Well, it's really not as dirty as it sounds.<eos> And the point is, if you send us, you get to chill at home with Laila for the weekend.<eos> Yeah, and we'll stay in one room to keep costs down.<eos> No, we won't.
Lance can't help you.<eos> I can.<eos> Oh, my God! Come on!<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't fucking move.<eos> I will fucking kill you.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> No, not you.<eos> - Yes, I will.
I know how important it is to you.<eos> It's just...<eos> I got Alec off, and we still haven't found the killer.<eos> - So until we do...<eos> - I know.<eos> It's just... we let stuff like this come between us before... and I don't want to let that happen again.<eos> That's why I have to solve this.<eos> So we can put everything with Alec behind us<eos> - and we can just start our life again.<eos> - And we will.
He already on the wagon?<eos> Oh, why do you have to say that?<eos> As of right now.<eos> You out on furlough?<eos> No, I've gotta work.<eos> He's gotta finish parole hours.<eos> You guys want a lift?<eos> No, we gotta get our bus passes signed by the driver.<eos> - You find Debs and the boys?<eos> - Not yet, but I will.
This is-- it's helpful.<eos> You know, they made this video for shock value.<eos> Joe's playing with us.<eos> It's like a game to him.<eos> There's no concrete evidence to support psychopathic behavior is hereditary.<eos> You think I don't know that.<eos> I know my son's not a psychopath, but you put heroin in someone's arm long enough, they become a junkie.<eos> These people are killers.<eos> Why can't you find him?<eos> We will.
Ryan!<eos> Don't scream, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Jacob, right?<eos> - No talking.<eos> I'll be quiet.<eos> I just want to say one thing.<eos> If you let me go, I won't say anything to anyone.<eos> Of course you won't.
It was because of the shoes.<eos> Who needed Sebastian when I had these?<eos> Fabulous work, everyone!<eos> Carrie, your feet are spectacular.<eos> They're divine, really.<eos> Well, my feet thank you.<eos> Careful.<eos> They may get too big for these shoes if they get any more praise. (Chuckles)<eos> Not like I'll ever get to wear them again.<eos> Of course you will.
You like fish?<eos> Saw it on a scuba diving trip.<eos> Thought it was beautiful.<eos> Mm.<eos> I don't like fish.<eos> I like pork, chicken.<eos> But, uh... It's a pretty fish.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's gonna rub off when I sweat.<eos> No, it won't.
Let me go by myself.<eos> I don't want your fucking hands touching me.<eos> - Can someone get Anna's coat?<eos> - Call a taxi!<eos> OK, I'm going.<eos> - But not as long as you keep glaring at me.<eos> - Back off.<eos> Come on guys, back off.<eos> - Good. Do so then. Go.<eos> I will.
Mmhmm. And now that I'm relatively clean and soberish, I'm painfully aware of how we left things.<eos> It's just--I mean, I...<eos> It's all so-- unresolved?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Yes.<eos> It may have to stay that way for a while.<eos> I figured as much.<eos> But, uh, we should reconvene again and talk about this-- the state of our union and whatnot... Sometime soon.<eos> Hmm? - Let's play it by ear.<eos> - Okay, we will.
You're in good hands with Mom.<eos> What's up with that Peter dude?<eos> What?<eos> I mean he's a total dork, right?<eos> How much do you think he benches?<eos> Uh... Time's up!<eos> Dale!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Promise me you'll take care of Petunia!<eos> I will, Kantmiss.
Let's<eos> - Suicide?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Who found the body?<eos> - A lady walking her dog.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If I find out this is your fault!<eos> Commissioner Lafarge, you are out of your mind.<eos> Don't stare at me like that, Mendes, I'll recover.<eos> You, maybe, but he won't!
What time should we be there tomorrow?<eos> You don't eat it with a fork<eos> Take this<eos> Did you talk to her?<eos> Yes<eos> So what?<eos> As you guess<eos> She doesn't like you marrying again<eos> She is afraid that he'll leave you after a while<eos> He won't
Yeah, probably shouldn't have showed you that one.<eos> The women who made and used these items are now in the SHU or down at the max facility with added sentences.<eos> Their lives are basically over.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> I am Natalie Figueroa.<eos> I am the Executive Assistant to the warden.<eos> I try and visit often.<eos> If you have any concerns, specifically regarding your needs as women, please come to me.<eos> I will handle them personally.<eos> Yeah, she will.
I have no intention at all to expose you.<eos> - Has she told anyone else? - No.<eos> - How can you be sure?<eos> - I know her.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> You know what could happen to me? !<eos> - Please, Mr. Walker, calm down.<eos> - Calm down?<eos> You're not the one facing the possibility of arrest and chemical treatments! Neither are you. No one else knows.<eos> No one else will.
If I do get grabbed, I'm gonna let them know you're a dirty-ass cop.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> Huh? Are you threatening me?<eos> 'Cause you go right ahead.<eos> They'll put me on a desk, there will be an investigation, and we'll see who lasts longer.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What do you think the NBKs are gonna do when I tell them you broke into a house and tried to pin it on them?<eos> You wouldn't do that.<eos> Oh, I would.<eos> And I will.
After that, we'll stop, huh?<eos> Like we always wanted.<eos> Put your mask back on.<eos> I'm not an idiot, Yan.<eos> Here, some food.<eos> I don't want any.<eos> You have to eat.<eos> After we make the ransom video, your father will pay, then you can go home.<eos> He isn't going to pay anything for me.<eos> He will.
Small talk.<eos> Just a couple having breakfast.<eos> Talk about the...<eos> Michel, we know how to talk to each other.<eos> Of course.<eos> But you must explain that you are moving to the Amsterdam apartment, that you are leaving the French flat empty.<eos> How will we know if it works?<eos> It will.<eos> What if it doesn't?<eos> It will.
Is that a Compass Rose?<eos> Mind your business.<eos> Oh, it's something you want to hide?<eos> Why get a tattoo you need to hide?<eos> You interrogating me?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> We'll finish this.<eos> Later.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
She's been learning to speak Castithan too.<eos> Nice, dad.<eos> Well, that was unfortunate.<eos> Well, her presence is intolerable.<eos> She insists on bathing alone.<eos> Who does that, I ask you?<eos> Humans.<eos> Well, it's not right for a proper Castithan household, for a proper Castithan wife.<eos> Alak must show that he can control her.<eos> And he will.
Can I get a drink right...<eos> Yeah, just up the block and to the right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Who is that guy?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Thought it was someone I once knew.<eos> I wonder what she did.<eos> Why would they let her ride in here with us?<eos> I'm gonna say something.<eos> I will.
I know.<eos> The bottle fell.<eos> What bottle?<eos> My nail polish.<eos> It's a mess here.<eos> No need to rush.<eos> We have no math class.<eos> Nice, so I can study English.<eos> VWI you call the next on the list?<eos> -I will.
And why were you asked to join this task force, do you think?<eos> I was the Agency's point person on Nazir.<eos> The point person? What does that mean exactly?<eos> It was my responsibility to try to track his whereabouts and anticipate his next move.<eos> Anticipate his next move.<eos> You mean... stop an attack?<eos> If you're asking, did he outsmart me?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> If you're asking, will I ever forgive myself?<eos> No, I won't.
I just suggested they relocate.<eos> You're not safe here.<eos> No shit.<eos> Norman...<eos> I believe we have a matter to discuss.<eos> It's not a good time, Liv.<eos> Of course it isn't.<eos> If you...<eos> if you ask me to leave,<eos> - I will.
What have you done with the other?<eos> I told you preparations had been made.<eos> In the pope's chamber.<eos> Concealed in the crucifix upon his offering table.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> My father lives.<eos> You've failed.<eos> What say you to that?<eos> Today he lives.<eos> One day he will not.
The maid's family is dead.<eos> The maid too, I'm sure, would have been disposed of had we not finished her first.<eos> There is someone thinking far ahead, tying up loose ends.<eos> Who?<eos> His name is Rufio.<eos> He is a man of my cousin Catherina Sforza's household.<eos> I have known him since he was a boy.<eos> He's the most deadly, the most lethal--<eos> - We will find him.<eos> -No. N0, you will not.
I'm sorry that I jumped to the wrong conclusion the other night.<eos> I've been called a lot of things before... but never a murderer.<eos> But I guess in retrospect I can see how you connected those particular dots.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry.<eos> There's my date.<eos> Nice.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> She's smart too.<eos> Maybe you should run over there and marry her.<eos> Maybe I will.
Liam.<eos> Ty?<eos> Apparently, my reputation precedes me.<eos> I'm sorry. We haven't met before, have we?<eos> Think I would have remembered.<eos> I'm... I'm new in town, but... don't go firing up the private plane just yet.<eos> Uh, I mean, assuming you have one.<eos> Well, the tennis coach is waiting for me.<eos> Naomi, see you at the club tonight?<eos> Maybe you will.
It's just until the parents come round.<eos> How's that little miracle going to happen?<eos> Hmm? And how, pray tell, is you doing everything for the child helping the parents?<eos> Appeasing your own guilt, are you?<eos> I have no idea what you mean.<eos> I saw your face when that child was born.<eos> You were distraught, Nurse Lee, as every midwife has been before you.<eos> God help us, we're only human.<eos> But your guilt will not help the mother to bond.<eos> What will?
You don't have to do everything he tells you, you know.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Time to call Shirl.<eos> He'll be out with Rick.<eos> Or in a ditch somewhere.<eos> No, we have to call Shirley about this.<eos> You call her, she'll call the Treatment Centre and they'll take him away.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> We can't lose him again, Sue.<eos> We won't.
Isn't a day trip this time, partner.<eos> You're leaving...you're leaving Roarton?<eos> Why?<eos> Lots of reasons.<eos> This place.<eos> It's never going to accept people like us.<eos> Never ever.<eos> It will.<eos> We'll make them change.<eos> No, it won't.
She really has to take them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you.<eos> Should I treat you or something?<eos> No need, good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Everything is here sir.<eos> Don't forget about the medicine.<eos> I won't.
But it's already too late to cancel.<eos> What would I even say?<eos> Say no, that's what.<eos> Tansy, it's one night out.<eos> With my ex-husband and Zoe Hart, who I just don't find that much fun, and... when you're with her, I'm sorry, but neither are you.<eos> Yes, I am. I'm fun.<eos> (chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine. I understand. I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
WADE: So, yeah...<eos> ZOE: Mm-hmm.<eos> You're... really good at that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a little scary.<eos> Can be.<eos> "Foreign Accent Syndrome"?<eos> No, man, that's not a thing.<eos> It's hard to believe, I know, but you can look it up.<eos> Oh, I will.
Please?<eos> Two minute warning.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> What?<eos> Jesus, they don't give you any time.<eos> I know.<eos> Honey, have you talked to your dad about Alex?<eos> No, I...<eos> Not yet.<eos> I will...
Maybe he should've.<eos> That gun goes off, the only person that dies here today is me.<eos> What does he mean?<eos> Well, you see, Dwight here's a bullet magnet.<eos> That's... that's his trouble.<eos> Jordan fires that gun anywhere, the only person it's gonna hit is Dwight.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No.<eos> But he has to pay.<eos> He will.
George Washington?<eos> - Oh, not again. - Uh-oh.<eos> Looks like Frankie D.'s in the house.<eos> All right, come here.<eos> I want you to keep him distracted.<eos> I'm gonna look for another way in.<eos> Okay.<eos> you know what I don't understand is, what's so special about this club as compared to... That one over there with no line?<eos> Why don't you go over there and find out?<eos> Well, I will.
Hey, if Ricki has a pain in her knee, we all have a pain in our knee.<eos> Well...<eos> It's up to you, champ.<eos> I have to play in the open.<eos> If you don't have this operation soon, you might not be able to walk in 10 years.<eos> Hey, she's made her decision.<eos> Okay, I wish I could tell you what you want to hear.<eos> - It's just...<eos> - That's okay.<eos> Someone will.
Good.<eos> Keep it that way.<eos> Don't put it on her.<eos> She doesn't deserve it.<eos> She deserves picket fences and... fairy tales.<eos> She does.<eos> Mess her up, I'll come back and haunt you.<eos> I got it.<eos> No, I don't think you do.<eos> But you will.
This stupid merger.<eos> It's bad enough my vote is worth 1/3 of what it was last week.<eos> Now our uni-balls, gone.<eos> Our... What?<eos> Pens, Donna.<eos> The new quartermaster,<eos> Barbara L. Tottingham, will not buy us any more uni-balls.<eos> There's not one single uni-ball in this entire firm.<eos> - Please stop saying uni-ball.<eos> - No, I will not.
Well, he knows how you feel about George.<eos> He wouldn't defy you and appoint him.<eos> As for Richard...<eos> I want you to take my son, Anthony.<eos> You are the only one I can trust with him.<eos> They will never accept it.<eos> I do not care what they will accept.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
Thanks, God!<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I hope it's okay that I'm here.<eos> Yeah. Of... of course.<eos> I couldn't watch the finale without you.<eos> It just wouldn't be the same.<eos> Mark, will you accept... my silver burrito?<eos> I will. Yes.
Yes, repeatedly.<eos> He's not cracking.<eos> Maybe they need to enhance the enhancements.<eos> What is your name?<eos> ! What is your name?<eos> !<eos> Who are you working with?<eos> !<eos> He hasn't answered any of our questions yet.<eos> He will.
Give me your water.<eos> Now, the water should work as a lens.<eos> Mm-hmm. And bend the light, so...<eos> Look, Luca!<eos> It's bigger.<eos> I can see the name.<eos> Whoa. "Ricki Evans."<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Nope.<eos> But somebody will.
You kept it.<eos> The things you do... mean something to people.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I couldn't fix it.<eos> Fix what?<eos> Ricki will never see her grandpa again.<eos> But you did good.<eos> You gave her your rabbit.<eos> She won't forget that, Abby.<eos> She won't.
I didn't know that.<eos> I'm in advertising.<eos> It's not that.<eos> It's just that it was a private conversation.<eos> What are you, his priest?<eos> This is how wars are won.<eos> Your friend's mistake was underestimating you.<eos> I hope ketchup makes the same mistake so you can blow their mind.<eos> So, correct me if I'm wrong, Pete.<eos> I certainly will.
I'll try his hotel.<eos> Don't bother, no one's seen him there all morning.<eos> Remember that bug you gave me last year?<eos> The remote tracking device?<eos> You actually use that?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Kazmi's got a coat pocket.<eos> I'm proud of you, boss.<eos> Damn thing better work.<eos> Of course it will.
Episode three-- that's all I'll say.<eos> Oh.<eos> Why don't you two watch it together over a game of Tiddlywinks?<eos> You seem to be upset over my game of "let's put the peacock in its place."<eos> I'm glad you mentioned that. I brought a little going-away present for you.<eos> This is a biscuit and a bottle of water. It's what I assume they serve in English prison, which is where your client's going for freezing our client's assets.<eos> It's a violation of international law to intimidate a litigant into settling by choking their funding.<eos> You seem to think you've got me by the short hairs.<eos> However, if you turn to page 693 in this tome, you'll find an exception to that very law.<eos> No, I won't.
But you're a newsagent.<eos> I sell 'em.<eos> I don't want to be in 'em.<eos> Why?<eos> Don't get smart.<eos> I'm just trying to find out about Danny.<eos> He did a newspaper round for you, didn't he?<eos> Are you gonna leave nicely or do I have to ring the police?<eos> Well, if you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
- We're ready, Dr. Brennan. - All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> She's under.<eos> Oh. I'm just going to work.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Not if I survive the procedure.<eos> This is going to turn out just like that day.<eos> We're never going to see each other again.<eos> We Will.
Okay.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> She's under.<eos> Oh. I'm just going to work.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Not if I survive the procedure.<eos> This is going to turn out just like that day.<eos> We're never going to see each other again.<eos> We Will.<eos> Of course we will.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, trust me.<eos> I know precisely how ridiculous it sounds.<eos> Might as well have a phone in your shoe.<eos> And yet, spies like you have been using it for centuries.<eos> This pen, for example, had traces of a type known as permanent fluorescing ink, imperceptible to the human eye, and revealed only under an ultraviolet light.<eos> Now, I went to the morgue this morning, and I shone Teri's hand under a UV lamp.<eos> Even after the wash, her palm was covered in the stuff.<eos> And when she struggled with you, she got it all over your clothes.<eos> Captain, if you will?
The Johnsons?<eos> Three houses down.<eos> They went away on vacation, didn't cancel their newspaper.<eos> Well, thank you very much, Mr. Victor.<eos> You are a vigilant neighbour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, look, while you're here, could you deal with all the illegal parking on this street?<eos> I take photos of them.<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Absolutely, we will, mm-hmm.
I-I was only trying to make you better.<eos> Well, it worked really well, didn't it?<eos> You're a hell of a doctor!<eos> I only wanted what was best for you.<eos> I still do.<eos> That's why you sent your friend after me.<eos> I asked him to protect me.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You should've just left me alone.<eos> I will.
We have 19 houses we have to look into.<eos> At night?<eos> Fuck me.<eos> How are we even gonna see if Vogel and Yates are in a house, if they're even holed up in one of these fuckin' places?<eos> What if they're in his van and he's already killed her?<eos> He hasn't.<eos> She's fine.<eos> He keeps his women alive for weeks.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Unlike you, I don't actually enjoy any of this.<eos> So what's next?<eos> I told the crew that Miles was going to New York for a few days, so that should buy me some time.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I have to go to a crime scene... At my apartment building.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Please don't leave town before we talk again.<eos> I won't.
I thought we'd go there, since you're on the next few days.<eos> I mean, if that's okay with you.<eos> Yeah, that's okay with me.<eos> Don't smile?<eos> Just send this to the passport guy.<eos> He'll have a new identity and all the paperwork for you by tomorrow.<eos> Do I get to pick my name?<eos> I doubt it, but I'll ask.<eos> So does he drop it off, or--<eos> No, I will.
Didn't even know she was married.<eos> It says here you got a record.<eos> Do you have any idea how many years aiding and abetting a fugitive will buy you?<eos> Look, I'm the one who's been... helping out Arlene.<eos> Now I see what you two really bonded over.<eos> You sure can pick 'em.<eos> Listen, do me a favor.<eos> Either of you hear from your old friend Hannah McKay, you give me a call.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Hey!<eos> This won't help.<eos> New equipment just crossed the Deh Cho bridge.<eos> It will be here tonight and we will fly it to the mine first thing in the morning.<eos> It better.<eos> The consortium will pull out if there are any more delays.<eos> They said that?<eos> Threatened to back a mine in Australia.<eos> We can't afford anything else to go wrong.<eos> It won't.
Oh, my God, Chris. What's wrong?<eos> Mom, I hate it here. I want to come home.<eos> All the kids are mean, and I keep messing everything up.<eos> Even Jinx the Robot is picking on me.<eos> Hey, you've got something on your shirt.<eos> Joke complete.<eos> You and dad were right.<eos> I'm not smart enough to be here.<eos> Can you come get me, please, Mom?<eos> Okay, honey, of course we will.
You know, I...<eos> Very much...<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You have to go.<eos> Claud.<eos> Claud, I'm really sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I'm counting on you to stop this guy more than anybody, okay?<eos> I will.
More than you know.<eos> Okay, maybe.<eos> But a year under Harvey Specter, they would kill to have you.<eos> And you wouldn't be the only one.<eos> There are people from Pearson Hardman going to Bratton Gould?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> Jimmy, you have to tell me that.<eos> Mike, come on.<eos> If they knew it came from me--<eos> They won't.
Well, beg away.<eos> My motion to dismiss is Wednesday with Judge McIntyre.<eos> I've never been able to connect with him.<eos> Yeah, that's 'cause you don't understand him.<eos> Well, all I know is he's punitive.<eos> No, he's a stickler.<eos> Don't be late, don't be sloppy, don't be disrespectful, and he'll love you, just like he loves me.<eos> Since you know him so well, would you do me the honor of signing on as first chair?<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
We've been here before.<eos> No, usually you're accusing me of making things personal.<eos> But this time you're making things personal for Robert Zane. No.<eos> He made it personal.<eos> And how exactly did he do that?<eos> He threatened our firm.<eos> And on top of that, he tried to show Sloane Moseley what she'd be in for her if this goes to trial.<eos> So I'm just returning the favor.<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't seem to have much of an effect on him. Trust me.<eos> It will.
- Kendrick?<eos> - He's the only person at the CIA who knows about Division.<eos> He's committed to keeping it a secret.<eos> He wouldn't just send some random agent out to deliver it.<eos> It would have to be him.<eos> Amanda targeting the Director of the CIA?<eos> That's a little crazy, even for her.<eos> Amanda targeting our closest ally in the government-- it's not so crazy.<eos> We need to get those files.<eos> We will.
Hey, come on, I'm on every news channel, Alex.<eos> They've raided my apartment.<eos> They're questioning my sisters, my teammates.<eos> I mean, my reputation's already tarnished.<eos> The longer I stay hidden, the guiltier I look.<eos> You're actually thinking about going through with this?<eos> I'm innocent, remember?<eos> I got a whole secret agency trying to prove that.<eos> And I believe if I take the heat off of them, they'll return the favor.<eos> We will.
But now it is absolutely eating you raw.<eos> You were the best thing to ever happen to him - and he threw it away.<eos> - Yeah, you were the best thing...<eos> I was the best thing that ever happened to you and you just threw it away.<eos> Ma'am, we have to go now if you want to catch Kent for a hostages meeting.<eos> Okay, listen, I will not have you undermine me with Catherine.<eos> - Will you be wanting a clutch?<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will not.
- Yeah, you were the best thing...<eos> I was the best thing that ever happened to you and you just threw it away.<eos> Ma'am, we have to go now if you want to catch Kent for a hostages meeting.<eos> Okay, listen, I will not have you undermine me with Catherine.<eos> - Will you be wanting a clutch?<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will not.<eos> - Oh, you don't?<eos> - No, no, I will.
- The music business goes in waves.<eos> First it's rock 'n roll, then it's...<eos> - Don't they want to release it?<eos> Now isn't a good time for a boy with an accordion.<eos> Are they going to release it or not?<eos> - No.<eos> I need a miracle.<eos> - There's no such thing as miracles.<eos> We'll never sell those 300 copies.<eos> I will.
I might just forget my lyrics.<eos> Just think about ovulation.<eos> It'll kill the mood.<eos> Oh, that's true.<eos> Well, as your manager,<eos> I insist you concentrate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Riley made you her manager?<eos> Yes, she will.
Well, years makes it sound like decades.<eos> It hasn't been that long.<eos> You're losing your mind.<eos> How long has it been since you've had relations with a woman?<eos> (Sighs) Recently.<eos> Lying again.<eos> Find a woman.<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> I will.
It's what it's all about.<eos> Okay, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna release the trustees, but I'll have an agent sit on each of their homes.<eos> Rigsby, you take Jason Lennon.<eos> Cho, you take Kevin Rome.<eos> I'll have Karl sit on Stephen Doppler's hotel.<eos> I'll take Melissa Enfield.<eos> We'll be in radio contact the entire time.<eos> If Lorelei tries to go after one of them--<eos> She will.
Aah! Aah!<eos> Oh.<eos> Patrick.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I told you, I need to do this on my own.<eos> No, you need my help now.<eos> Police are closing in.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Do they know I'm here?<eos> No, not yet, but they soon will.
Henry!<eos> Come to your mother.<eos> Come on, you must remember me?<eos> Go on, Henry.<eos> Lady Mother.<eos> Henry, I miss you very much and I would have come sooner, but I have been made to live very far away from you.<eos> It is punishment for my loyalties.<eos> Henry, the wicked York king, has taken your title.<eos> But we will get it back for you.<eos> We will.
The same guy who has you stealing jewelry did this to Holly.<eos> He uses kids like you.<eos> And then he just gets to walk away while you have to sit in here and answer all my questions.<eos> You know what you are to him right now?<eos> You're a loose end.<eos> So take a hard look, because this is your future.<eos> This is you.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> He won't hurt me.<eos> He won't.
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell!"<eos> That shit never gets old, right?<eos> I might actually be lucky this happened now.<eos> Guards just think I got the flu like everyone else.<eos> Well, in two days, you're gonna be wishing you had the flu.<eos> I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll get through it. I'll get back on track.<eos> They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
Uh, I drove a ship.<eos> Did you now?<eos> Yeah, my dad showed me how.<eos> That's me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is Cora trying to control you with the dagger?<eos> Oh, you'd know if she was, and most of you would be dead by now.<eos> Well, then we'll just have to take the fight to her before that can happen.<eos> We will.
I returned that a few hours ago.<eos> It's just... some cash I keep lying around the brownstone to pay informants. It's not much, but, um,<eos> I assume you'll want to go on the lam again once you've recovered.<eos> Is that for my benefit or for yours?<eos> The road to recovery, I've found, is as treacherous as it is tedious.<eos> Tests of my sobriety arise almost daily.<eos> You were just the most recent.<eos> Hey.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> Always will.
Is it word from Richard?<eos> He's using you, you fool, to shame Henry and rob men from his side.<eos> But you're so vain you think he loves you.<eos> He does love me, you spiteful...<eos> You're a whore.<eos> You are monstrous in the eyes of God for what you've done with him.<eos> You are the monster for murdering my poor brother!<eos> You know nothing!<eos> My son will never marry you.<eos> Yes, he will.
Gillette is a human being.<eos> But he won't be for long if you don't clamp that artery.<eos> One!<eos> Brett?<eos> What in the hell?<eos> Were those gunshots?<eos> Oh, who knows with these people? It's one calamity after another.<eos> Yes, exactly, that's why you need a nice, long, relaxing cruise.<eos> But I really, really, really don't think I'll enjoy it.<eos> Sure you will.
Sadly, desperate times call for desperate measures.<eos> Like getting Mary Margaret to trick me into killing my own mother?<eos> You may be able to hide behind your dagger, but she can't.<eos> She's going to die for what she did.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> We both know killing her will cost you the thing you want most...<eos> Henry.<eos> Why don't you just give up this obsession with vengeance?<eos> You know it can never make you happy.<eos> Yes, it will.
Wait.<eos> I... I know... I know what this is.<eos> I think I remember who I am.<eos> Well, I'm sure Mr. Gold will be thrilled.<eos> These are the places you saw it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This town's lousy with magic.<eos> Now you should go. If Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
You're the fiancee.<eos> Are you and Neal here for the magic?<eos> Are you two trying to take the magic from Storybrooke?<eos> Neal has nothing to do with any of this, okay?<eos> He knows as much as you do.<eos> Actually, now you know a lot more.<eos> So do we have a deal?<eos> I can't leave without knowing what you're doing here.<eos> Sure, you can.<eos> And you will.
You know, most folks, they... they wrote me off.<eos> But some didn't.<eos> And they found me.<eos> "They"?<eos> Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.<eos> This little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic...<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> No, of course it will.
Yeah, I don't think so.<eos> Take a look.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> He's alive, Hook.<eos> He beat you.<eos> Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.
Take a look.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> He's alive, Hook.<eos> He beat you.<eos> Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> I will indeed.
- What that thing do?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Out of all the gals in this...<eos> - God... what...<eos> - you walked into mine.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Um... - Yeah, take a sip.<eos> Okay, look, I think you're amazing.<eos> Would you like to have a drink with me?<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
Don't jump!<eos> Hold it right there!<eos> You scared me half to death out there.<eos> Are you not getting enough attention?<eos> I'm fine!<eos> I am fine!<eos> You wouldn't let me out.<eos> - I was partly joking!<eos> - Nick, we will talk about this in the morning.<eos> Yes, we will.
Lana?<eos> You want to go sit down, watch some TV?<eos> You'll be able to see dad from there, hmm?<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Go.<eos> We better keep an eye on her.<eos> We're not going to hurt her or you.<eos> We just need to know what we need to know.<eos> Clients... I talk about 'em, they come back and make sure I can't talk again.<eos> This one won't.
You get me out of here, I'll give you whatever you want.<eos> Talking about sending me to Washington to meet the director.<eos> Most of the talk's all hearsay at this point, but looking good.<eos> Hey, did you... - Did you sign that paperwork?<eos> - That what?<eos> The forms I e-mailed you last week.<eos> No. I haven't.<eos> Okay, well, you know they're to protect the baby in case something happens to either one of us, so I'm just...<eos> I'm gonna need your signature.<eos> Okay, I will.
Thank you, Master.<eos> May I read it? Be my guest.<eos> It's not my work.<eos> It's your handwriting.<eos> Count d'Orgel's Ball...<eos> Nice.<eos> It's the outline of a novel.<eos> There's more to write.<eos> But I won't write it.<eos> Raymond will.
I want to see the lockers.<eos> This way.<eos> Hey, Ian.<eos> Didn't expect to see you here.<eos> Yeah, I'm training.<eos> Trying to keep my mind occupied.<eos> I heard about this fight between you and Diego.<eos> Yeah. It's just something that I gotta do, you know?<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> You will, for your brother.
I doubt that it's organically grown.<eos> Hah! Doubt it's grown at all.<eos> You bring me here and you risk my life, and you expect there to be no consequences?<eos> That's what's wrong with this military and this country.<eos> You're lecturing us on right and wrong.<eos> The agent who died because of you had a wife and a six-year-old son.<eos> And you think this is the justice that they were looking for?<eos> No, but it prevents others from needing to seek justice at all.<eos> This must end.<eos> It won't.
That sergeant I stabbed, he was coming after my daughter.<eos> She's 11.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah, she is.<eos> My family got to Texas.<eos> They're, uh... waiting for me.<eos> Well, then, you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know...<eos> I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but he can't get away with it!<eos> - 'Cause everybody always gets away with everything!<eos> - He's not going to!<eos> - It's not fair!<eos> I promise you, mother.<eos> We will get him.<eos> He's a bad guy, and we will get him.<eos> We just have to do it the right way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we will.
- Straightened myself out.<eos> - Till last night.<eos> Alexei almost bled out.<eos> You could have killed him.<eos> Uh, I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> How long you been working at that gym?<eos> You see him every day.<eos> I-- I see a lot of people.<eos> We're gonna find your prints on that weapon.<eos> N-no, you won't.
The is only this moment.<eos> You are wise, esteemed husband.<eos> And you bring great honor to this family.<eos> And here in Japan, nothing is more important than honor.<eos> And I shall bring even greater honor with my new scheme.<eos> Tonight, at Waterman Cable, when everyone else leaves, I will stay and work eight additional hours.<eos> For no pay!<eos> Strictly for honor!<eos> But Waterman-san will catch you and look at you silently for a moment!<eos> He will not.
That's pathetic.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Now you hit me.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What is your damage?<eos> Look, given that you were held at gunpoint in this very room little over a week ago, I thought, perhaps, a test of your ability to defend yourself was in order.<eos> It was.<eos> You have much to learn about the art of self-preservation.<eos> Okay, if you ever do that again, I swear...<eos> You'll what?
I just, um...<eos> I want you to know that, um...<eos> I know, Stefan.<eos> Elena, don't do this.<eos> We can find another cover story.<eos> This is the best one.<eos> No one'll ask questions.<eos> Ok. If you burn down the house, it'll be gone.<eos> What if one day when this is all over, you want to come home again?<eos> I won't.
Senator Terrence Pratt.<eos> You said Pratt could hurt you.<eos> My brakes -- I don't have my brakes.<eos> You need to leave New York.<eos> Mozzie has a safe house outside the city.<eos> It turns out that employer I.D. number is for a security company named Griffin-Moore, which is linked to the 50th floor of the Empire State Building.<eos> Let's get that box and bring my father home.<eos> 13 bucks for an ice cream?<eos> Gluten-and dairy-free -- you won't find that in Kansas.<eos> Yes, I will.
! Oh my -- you asshole!<eos> Was he crushed?<eos> ! Probably woulda been.<eos> If I'd told him about it. Ugh.<eos> But wait, why did Corelli hire ISIS to prevent the assassination?<eos> To show the cardinals he was trying to prevent it, all the while assuming- What, that we'd totally bl-ow my God he assumed we'd totally blow it?<eos> ! Well... ISIS has a certain reputation.<eos> Hey, whoa! Not cool, Payne Stewart!<eos> Oh, my God, if Malory ever hears about this -<eos> Which she won't!
- much like Germany and Italy in World War... - No.<eos> Good call.<eos> Together, we run a no-nonsense office.<eos> _<eos> Preconference room meeting with Dwight went really well. Oh.<eos> Bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.<eos> All depends on the conference room meeting itself.<eos> - Is that them again? - Yeah.<eos> Maybe you should call back.<eos> I will.
Yeah, I saw, and Shaul told me.<eos> I wanted to call you back.<eos> Then why didnt you?<eos> I had some stuff I had to deal with and things to do at home.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I wanted your advice on something. And to remind you about the haircut.<eos> Is that mine?<eos> I never recognize the ringtone.<eos> Shaul, you said you"d change it.<eos> I will.
Thank you.<eos> What you've said...<eos> it was beautiful.<eos> Well, thank you very much.<eos> I guess you're going back to Turkey tomorrow.<eos> I can't go home.<eos> As soon as I set foot in my country... I'm going to be killed.<eos> ♪ Blue Bloods 3x15 ♪ Warriors Original Air Date on February 15, 2013<eos> I can assure you that nothing came from this office.<eos> Nor will anything.
- It's one case.<eos> We'll see you at the next 44.<eos> In the meantime, we won't be participating in that deposition until you put Ms. Mitchell back on a plane.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> But you're out of the doghouse with Jessica?<eos> Out.<eos> What?<eos> You never said how it went with Manningham.<eos> And I never will.
She said she was thinking about who her real friends were, and, how she wanted to put the past behind her.<eos> You know how Ade is.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't think we should be eating these, you guys, okay?<eos> Silver, this wouldn't happen to have anything to do with you and Mark, would it?<eos> I mean, you know the last time you and Ade fought over a guy.<eos> I know.<eos> And I have to handle it, like, now.<eos> And I will.
George has been disappointed.<eos> You know, it's been so hard for him.<eos> You will forgive him, Edward, you will!<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Mother, but I will not.<eos> You will forgive him.<eos> I command it.<eos> You do not command me.<eos> I am your MOTHER!<eos> Yes, and I am the KING!<eos> You will!
- Um... not really.<eos> She took a great shine to you.<eos> She thought you were a very bright little boy.<eos> You were interested in everything.<eos> So she always kept you in her mind.<eos> And just before she died...<eos> Vic said that she hoped you might be the one to carry it on.<eos> - Carry on with what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I will.
The Black Hunter Corps...<eos> White officers and black soldiers going after Boni.<eos> We have to find and fight maroons.<eos> - You get weapons.<eos> Surely Masra Omhoog can't sell you.<eos> - The price was right.<eos> We don't all have a misi like yours.<eos> But when you come back, you'll be a free man, won't you?<eos> When I come back... if I ever come back.<eos> - Of course you will.
Was that her?<eos> She wants to know why you're not picking up.<eos> She sounded mad.<eos> She's mad?<eos> Did you ask her why she went to the SHU?<eos> No. That's none of my business.<eos> Dude, look, you can stay here, we can go shoot guns, you can help me set up my maple syrup taps, but you have to talk to my sister.<eos> Communication is key, man.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> I will. I just...
I mean, if... If she wasn't the one they were after and she's just in the way--<eos> Mr. Castle, you need to stay positive.<eos> Whatever their motives, the kidnappers will realize she has value.<eos> Now what we need to do next is go to your home and set up a trap and trace on your phone lines so we're ready for their call.<eos> I'll wait for you outside.<eos> Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
What about a witness coaching a barrister?<eos> I have a friend who is displaying a sudden and surprising burst of talent.<eos> I think he's getting help.<eos> Well, he's not just risking his own neck.<eos> He's risking his case, his client, and the reputation of his Chambers.<eos> So, for the sake of your chum, I suggest you find out what's going on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you need to go in the other one?<eos> They're both mine.<eos> Yes, we will.
Why don't you sneak your camera into the courthouse?<eos> Part 35, fourth floor.<eos> Take a picture of the defendant. Put that out there.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because he's a child molester who may walk because your idiotic crusade scared off the main witness.<eos> Yeah, well, not everybody does the Reagan bidding. Really?<eos> That's all you have?<eos> Miss Reagan?<eos> You try taking my picture again, I will shove that camera...<eos> Hey, he won't.
Listen to me.<eos> It's my problem and I'm gonna take care of it.<eos> We have to come clean.<eos> It's the only solution.<eos> Ruth would want that.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think it's a shakedown.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen, Sean.<eos> Yolanda?<eos> No, you won't, Ray.
SHE ordered this?<eos> Do you speak of the Queen?<eos> I speak of that witch!<eos> That is treason!<eos> I suggest you silence your wife, Sir Henry.<eos> Please, stay calm, Margaret.<eos> It will be no hardship, Mother.<eos> You are my son.<eos> He will stay with me.<eos> He will not.
Just a little domestic misunderstanding.<eos> I'll touch base when we have a plan.<eos> Thanks for having my back in there, partner.<eos> I will take a bullet for you, but wives are a whole other thing.<eos> I'll remember that.<eos> I don't have a wife, so...<eos> You should stop talking.<eos> So, I'm not speaking from experience.<eos> So you should really stop talking.<eos> But you won't.
You have contract.<eos> Not to honor it would be an insult and a mistake.<eos> Yep?<eos> Eric, Greshnev just left the cover house.<eos> Keep him in your sights.<eos> Will do.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To follow him.<eos> What if he makes you?<eos> He won't.
You got it?<eos> Control, alt, delete.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sweetheart, are you all right?<eos> How's little Carl?<eos> Perfect.<eos> I keep checking to see if something's changed, if somehow he knows his mother's... gone, but...<eos> He's too little.<eos> He couldn't possibly understand.<eos> He will one day.
You're right, Castle.<eos> It does change how I see you.<eos> It makes me like you just a little bit more.<eos> Don't forget Mr. Whiskers.<eos> Oh, so now you remember his name.<eos> Could you give us a second, please?<eos> I was hoping you'd come.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye this time.<eos> "Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.<eos> You won't.
(quietly): We're just trying to protect Jimmy.<eos> Obviously we care about him a little more than you do.<eos> SABRINA: Really?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Name his top three allergies.<eos> Trick question.<eos> He doesn't have any allergies.<eos> If I eat peanuts, I'll die!<eos> That's right.<eos> He will.
I know it's not a lot to go on...<eos> Um, it's almost too much to go on.<eos> Look, Sullivan's trout farm is just 1/4 mile away.<eos> Who do you think you're dealing with, Winger?<eos> I don't know, Houlihan. Seems sort of thin.<eos> In an investigation, one dude always has to go opposite the other dude.<eos> That's how they get things done.<eos> Well, you guys can work it out.<eos> - Yeah, we will.<eos> - No, we won't.
Be careful, now.<eos> It's Abed's camera.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Watch it.<eos> Oh, where is the stop button on this?<eos> Oh, here it is. Okay.<eos> - You want to hear my pitch?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A strong, independent woman, starting her own business.<eos> An "entrepreneu-her," if you will.
- You need to go to sleep.<eos> - I can't.<eos> So why can't you sleep?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Don't make me sorry for taking you to the movies.<eos> No.<eos> I just keep thinking... what if somebody shoots Henry?<eos> No one's gonna do that.<eos> - But they could.<eos> - But they won't.
I can be a person second.<eos> I just...<eos> Before, I just didn't know that's what we were doing with each other, is all.<eos> We're good. Abby.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Maybe we're going about this whole morality thing the wrong way.<eos> - We have nothing on these guys. - Doesn't matter. - What if they call our bluff?<eos> - They won't.<eos> - What if they do?<eos> - They won't.
We know you're about to fire Sarah Stanner for violating the morality clause of her contract.<eos> - Huge! - I'll get security.<eos> - Go ahead, Larry.<eos> It's Larry, right?<eos> Before you have security set their tasers to stun, let me just say that in this box my colleague is holding is dirt.<eos> All the dirt we spent the past week digging up on every single one of you. Dirty dirt. Filthy dirt.<eos> Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right? - Actually, I don't.<eos> - Oh, soon you will.
But my dad is a terrible boss.<eos> He is so mean.<eos> "Princess, coffeepot's not gonna wash itself."<eos> That's where you got that?<eos> I said it to you one time.<eos> Well, you just gotta tell him straight up, man to man.<eos> Woman to man.<eos> You're very shapely.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
He likes fruit, you know.<eos> Well, mangoes, and erm... any bugs you can catch.<eos> You know, he sort of likes it best if you, if you mash the bugs up in the fruit.<eos> No big deal, a couple of times a day.<eos> Well, in the morning at eight and again at six.<eos> Don't worry, I'll take care of your lizard.<eos> Ah! Beer!<eos> Just what I need.<eos> You won't come back, will you?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.

Come on, Linden<eos> Why are we here?<eos> Keep driving<eos> Over there<eos> Why are we here?<eos> I used to find them hanging out down here<eos> Turn off the car<eos> You can explain what really happened<eos> They'll believe you<eos> No, they won't
[ Chuckles ] I'm just glad he'll be there at all.<eos> He's been so damn moody since I got home, I want to throttle him.<eos> Everything's all right, though, right?<eos> I mean, he's okay with us getting married?<eos> I guess.<eos> I mean, he hasn't really said much.<eos> I'm gonna fly him up to Atlanta with me... have him help me pack up the apartment.<eos> It'll give us a chance to talk.<eos> Well, let me know if there's anything I can do.<eos> I will.
I'm Edison, thank you."<eos> And everyone claps.<eos> Mr. Dinkler, shouldn't Louise and I make sure that we're not both doing the same thing for our Edison project?<eos> Well, let's see, Jeremy.<eos> Is your project going to blow everyone away?<eos> 'Cause if it's not, then don't worry about it.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> ! Hey, everybody, volcano-girl here is gonna blow our minds.<eos> Did you hear that, Tom?<eos> Well, I will!
What?<eos> On your neck.<eos> Is that a bite mark?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Christine bit you. No... oh...<eos> Christine got excited.<eos> It doesn't mean that she bit Emma.<eos> Better not take her to daycare for a while.<eos> I'll just tell them that you did it while we were making love.<eos> No, you won't.
Like hell I'm staying here.<eos> Gunnar!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ! Go home!<eos> Not without you.<eos> You go home!<eos> Gunnar! You go in there, I am going in there with you!<eos> Somebody in there knows exactly what's happened to Jason.<eos> And the police will find them.<eos> They won't!
Your reputation?<eos> Reopening the case would be too messy?<eos> Yeah, you have no idea what I'm thinking.<eos> Okay, so tell me because I don't- - I don't understand.<eos> Just got to get out of here.<eos> Things have blown up with Jen.<eos> Just-- just can't get into it right now.<eos> James, right now we need to find this car.<eos> - We need to find Adrian.<eos> - And we will.
- And if he won't go?<eos> He was Elizabeth's first recruit, her agent.<eos> I've had my differences with her but if this ends the hard way, I don't want her to have to do it.<eos> - You'll be there?<eos> - Of course.<eos> So we know who killed Chris.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Yeah. Don't have him yet.<eos> But you will, right?
Actually, Your Honor, it's been a long day for Avery.<eos> If it please the court, I request permission to recall this witness at a later time.<eos> Perhaps after I call my expert.<eos> Again, Your Honor, I'd request a frye hearing to determine the validity of this expert.<eos> As I already ruled in chambers, we're allowing it.<eos> And Mr. Purcell...<eos> I've given you latitude already. Don't abuse it.<eos> 'Scuse me.<eos> So, wait, you think maybe this means he won't call me to the stand?<eos> Oh, no, he will.
What is it? Whisky.<eos> God, it's huge.<eos> I thought you might need it.<eos> You understand me, don't you?<eos> I like to think so.<eos> Some fresh coffee, Mr Molesley.<eos> Shut the door. My God!<eos> Shut the door!<eos> Will you help me? Will you find me some clothes?<eos> Of course I will but...
Is something wrong between you?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't know what it is.<eos> She says it's nothing I've done but I can't believe that.<eos> It must be my fault because she is incapable of fault.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> There is no such thing as a marriage between two intelligent people that does not sometimes have to negotiate thin ice.<eos> I know.<eos> You must wait until things become clear.<eos> And they will.
- No, it's not a "whatever."<eos> First Gallagher kid getting his diploma.<eos> - It's a big deal.<eos> - Who'd you buy it from?<eos> He's getting it fair and square and setting a good example for both of you, so pay attention.<eos> We have to go to some stupid ceremony?<eos> Nope, I'm picking up my diploma at the guidance office and getting the hell out of there.<eos> There's no ceremony in the fall.<eos> He'll walk with everyone in the spring.<eos> - No, he won't.
No!<eos> I bought a wedding dress.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> And it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in the dress, so...<eos> So?<eos> We're living together.<eos> We're already saying that we're married.<eos> Come on, show it to me.<eos> All right, maybe I will.
Gross story.<eos> But cool name.<eos> A name defines you before you have a chance to do it yourself.<eos> Sometimes being unique is exhausting, but it's who I am.<eos> Thanks for the cool name, Dad.<eos> Did you know that your mom's going back to her maiden name?<eos> It's... it's like she's saying that we were never married.<eos> It makes me super sad.<eos> You should tell her how you feel.<eos> Maybe I will, Sarah.
I don't speak Spanish, you snake!<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm in the ocean now!<eos> I'm in international waters!<eos> I've got a shell.<eos> Let's just go.<eos> Let's just get out of here.<eos> - Point Break style?<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> I will Point Break style this moment!
Headnurse.<eos> "...only beats for you."<eos> His name is Hans Müller and he's traveling to Paris on behalf of the IG Farben.<eos> Written and signed by the defense inspection 3.<eos> And he should hurry.<eos> From Paris he has to make it to the unoccupied part.<eos> To Marseille.<eos> After that he's on his own.<eos> If I see him again...<eos> You won't.
You heard dad.<eos> She was on all that medication towards the end.<eos> People do weird things when they're on drugs.<eos> When Dylan was on Vicodin after his root canal, he bought the complete DVD set of "Dr. Quinn medicine woman."<eos> Get going, ladies.<eos> The pool's for residents only.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We'll leave.<eos> Uh, no, we won't.
I'm here!<eos> Conspiring to promote prostitution.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> - Not guilty, your honor.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> It's you.<eos> Your majesty.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I will say that I am guilty if I can just pay the fine and go home.<eos> No, you won't.
We'll go together from there.<eos> 'And now a summary of the headlines at three o'clock.<eos> 'Police this afternoon say they have found the hideout of the thieves 'who stole over £2 million from the Post Office night train.<eos> 'Officers are now examining Leatherslade Farm, '30 miles from the bridge where the robbery took place.<eos> 'A police spokesman says they are confident arrests would follow.'<eos> We wait till dark, head down to the farm, cop for whoever's there.<eos> Burn the place down ourselves.<eos> Did you not hear the news?<eos> It won't work, mate.<eos> Course it will.
It's clear as day.<eos> Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe.<eos> But it wasn't this face.<eos> But never mind that, Your Majesty!<eos> Up on your feet.<eos> Hup! How dare you?<eos> I'm the Queen of England.<eos> I'm not English.<eos> Elizabeth, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my dear sweet love, of course I will.
Well put.<eos> You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.<eos> It would be nice to have the increased income.<eos> Stop taking money from my parents.<eos> Money from family does come with strings attached.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers?<eos> No.<eos> "Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you're gonna have to pay for it yourself."<eos> Well, maybe I will, old man!
[Laughter]<eos> [Sniffing] - You nervous?<eos> - [Scoffs] No. [Sizzling] You should be.<eos> That's our last steak, man. Oh, shit!<eos> - No!<eos> Oh, gross, man. Don't you ever power wash your patio?<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's totally edible.<eos> Really? Then eat it.<eos> Well, I will,
Ultimately, we learn the most about ourselves through the losses.<eos> Swanson, I hate you.<eos> Nothing will change that.<eos> But I respect the hell out of your short game.<eos> You got my vote, hombre.<eos> Hey, you got a hole-in-one on 18, so I'm supposed to give you this.<eos> No, he gets the dragon too?<eos> A fine trophy.<eos> - I think I'll keep it in the office.<eos> - No, you won't.
I am the witness, not the criminal, and that Emma is attacking me.<eos> Let me explain to you just how important you are to this process.<eos> A man who raped and killed five young girls could end up going free... unless you speak up.<eos> Is that what you want to happen?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, Sharon.<eos> Obviously, I don't want that to happen.<eos> But even-- even if I-I plead the Fifth or whatever, people will find out about me.<eos> They will.
Tough couple of days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You crossed a line, Dino.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> How I feel... isn't the point.<eos> How you understand your job, that is the point.<eos> Sometimes you're not gonna like yourself very much for the decisions you have to make; knowing how the men feel about the decision you made... but you're gonna have to make that tough decision again and again because that is the job you accepted.<eos> I get that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will.
I can't do it. Ah.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. That's too big.<eos> What kind of huge snowman are you making?<eos> You're tall, that's why.<eos> If you weren't blind, you would know that I'm not actually that tall.<eos> Is this me?<eos> Yup.<eos> That's why, you're kind of cute. you're kind of cute.<eos> I wish I could open my eyes and see.<eos> You will soon.
Nothing?<eos> What do you mean, nothing?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> The marriage wasn't consummated?<eos> Nothing happened!<eos> Nothing happened?<eos> Nothing at all?<eos> But it must happen.<eos> For the sake of both our families, it must happen.<eos> And it will!
What do you mean, nothing?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> The marriage wasn't consummated?<eos> Nothing happened!<eos> Nothing happened?<eos> Nothing at all?<eos> But it must happen.<eos> For the sake of both our families, it must happen.<eos> And it will!<eos> Yes, it most certainly will.
Do you honestly think it matters one jot to me?<eos> Well it should!<eos> It must!<eos> Would you have this alliance soured with Naples the moment it is struck? Huh?<eos> Naples was, and always will be, an infected swamp.<eos> What about Lucrezia?<eos> She must be told.<eos> I will tell her.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
What changed your mind?<eos> I suppose it came to me that these balls and presentations and comings out are not just aristocratic folderol but traditions by which members of this family measure their progress through life.<eos> And you wanted to be part of that?<eos> Well, I felt by dismissing it as trivia,<eos> I was being smug and intolerant.<eos> Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So, have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will!
I hope I can make you understand how important that is.<eos> I'll pay you whatever you want but it has to be a complete secret from my family.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I think it should be our secret, My Lady.<eos> Ours and no-one else's.<eos> I'll er... send a letter to myself tonight and tell Marjie it's about an old friend of mine who's died and asked for me to take the child.<eos> She won't question it.<eos> Then nobody but you and I will know.<eos> Mr Drewe, would you do that for me?<eos> For you and the little girl, My Lady, yes, I will.
If that's okay, I mean.<eos> Oh...<eos> Well, I mean, I saw you with two ladies. I thought you were with them.<eos> Never seen 'em before.<eos> So... cool to crash?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Freddy, he was my partner, and he was my friend, but he wouldn't be dead if it weren't for this dome.<eos> You're gonna have to tell Rusty.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Like hell he will!
It's kind of a biggie.<eos> How would you feel about doing something for Bill?<eos> Why would I do anything for Bill?<eos> Do you still have feelings for him?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> The thing is, it's not really him that I'm asking for, it's for me, for my friends.<eos> - Vampire friends.<eos> - They're all gonna die.<eos> You realize Bill wants to kill me.<eos> He won't.
I haven't seen him or heard from him in a while.<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm leaving you all this in a voice mail.<eos> I just feel like there's so much I wanna talk to you about.<eos> Hopefully I'll see you at the funeral in the morning.<eos> I'll save you a seat, 'kay?<eos> I love you.<eos> Yes?<eos> Pick me up in an hour.<eos> - What if he wakes up?<eos> - He won't.
Let me in there.<eos> You hooked him real good.<eos> Come here, you little bugger.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> It's a catfish, cuz.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
Adam Eshel accessed Shin Bet files for me and found an interesting photo.<eos> The two men were working for the South African mercenary in Angola.<eos> Looks like they've stayed in touch.<eos> When was this photo taken?<eos> Five years ago.<eos> Mossad was tracking blood diamonds that were being used to finance terrorist activity.<eos> That's good work, Ziva.<eos> Come on, let's go home, get some rest.<eos> You, too, McGee.<eos> I will.
He told mel would.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Beth, you're a good kid, but there's no possible way I'm taking you with me.<eos> It's not gonna happen.<eos> III<eos> (Josh) Here.<eos> Put that on.<eos> Ew, this is gross.<eos> It'll save your life.<eos> No, it won't.
He still hosted game nights here every Wednesday.<eos> And here...<eos> His "Get Out of Jail Free" card.<eos> Eliza Perkins...<eos> Was strangled with this lanyard.<eos> I bet you'll find two sets of DNA on there, hers and her murderer's...<eos> Congressman Oliver Dawson.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll take it down to the lab right away.<eos> No, you won't.
Take me too, take me too, then I can see English Premier League!<eos> All right cheeky chops.<eos> One thing at a time, let's go and deal with this goose shit first.<eos> See you.<eos> See you, babe.<eos> Let's go away.<eos> Come with me to Paris.<eos> Say, "Yes."<eos> Yes.<eos> You won't, will you?
No.<eos> You will test it tomorrow, on me.<eos> I must let you get back to your lab and ensure your calculations are correct.<eos> Tomorrow, van Helsing. Tomorrow.<eos> I thought I told you specifically to keep this to yourself!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> General Shaw is a traitor.<eos> You know, I admire your patriotism, Harker.<eos> If anyone should even suspect that I had anything to do with this...<eos> They won't.
Damn it!<eos> Broke my nose, man!<eos> I'm gonna need a doctor!<eos> Why don't you tell us where they're going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This was wayne's show.<eos> He wanted somebody to slow you down so he could get away, And I volunteered.<eos> Anything to get away from that madman.<eos> I ain't trying to die out here.<eos> Now you won't.
All that matters is that you're back, and that Muirfield's gone, and they can't... hurt anyone else like they hurt us.<eos> Zhao got away.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, and we will find him, I promise.<eos> But not tonight.<eos> Tonight... (whispers): please don't go.<eos> ♪ 'Cause I can't make you love me ♪<eos> ♪ If you don't<eos> ♪ You can't make your heart<eos> I won't.
Okay, we can't keep doing this until Gail knows about us.<eos> Movies, dinners, whatever it is, it just... feels sneaky.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Get back here.<eos> You can't tell her.<eos> I have to.<eos> She's my friend.<eos> So... I will.
Well, you can't.<eos> You know the rules.<eos> You're his father.<eos> I'm his father.<eos> The lie we live by.<eos> The lie we live by.<eos> I need you to keep your promise.<eos> To always protect him.<eos> And me.<eos> I will.
You hand my mother over.<eos> Okay, let's try this again.<eos> You hand it over, I let her go.<eos> Don't trust him, Steve.<eos> What are you gonna do, hmm?<eos> You gonna watch her die, son?<eos> I think you're out of moves.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> You didn't want anybody to see what was on there anyway, right?<eos> Now nobody ever will.
No.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I-I drove her away.<eos> Oh, Raj.<eos> Penny, I...<eos> I miss her already.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me? Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
Though I-I'm no great fan of montage.<eos> I don't suppose you've read André Bazin,<eos> "The Ontology Of The Photographic Image"?<eos> I'm waiting for the movie.<eos> It's pretty theoretical.<eos> Pseudorealism versus true realism.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> You know, the film you're shooting won't survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Nothing will.
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...<eos> Oh my God, you're back!<eos> So you'd actually rather have "carnival"<eos> on your resume than an internship in a state senator's office?<eos> Regina: It's the type of job most high school kids get.<eos> Plus she got this one herself.<eos> What if Bay decides she wants to move in - with Regina for good?<eos> - She won't.
Hey, bri, there's an exhibit of the plein air painters at the Whitney.<eos> What do you say we head uptown and grab some brunch?<eos> Sound good?<eos> A museum?<eos> Talking to me?<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> So another Sunday watching roller bladers in the park.<eos> I thought we might change it up.<eos> We will.
- I do.<eos> You miss someone looking after you.<eos> I miss you looking after me.<eos> You miss someone making your decisions for you.<eos> I miss you making my decisions for me.<eos> Argh! I can't do this.<eos> Um, if I don't get that research pack on my desk today, I'm the one who has to explain to Mr Reid tomorrow.<eos> It's me that's going to look bad.<eos> Please don't let me down.<eos> I won't.
You're not dying.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You got out of Boston.<eos> You built a good life.<eos> You have a beautiful family.<eos> Don't let Mickey poison this.<eos> I saw something in you, Raymond.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> I won't.
One "no" would've been fine!<eos> Everything okay in there?<eos> Yes.<eos> Only it's not okay.<eos> It's not okay at all. If I don't get my crown tonight, I won't be able to go back to Equestria for another 30 moons.<eos> Oh, what are we going to do?<eos> Hmm... we tell them the truth.<eos> Let them know what's really at stake if you don't get the crown tonight.<eos> They'll help us figure something out.<eos> But what if they won't?
How you doing? What's new, girl?<eos> There's nothing new.<eos> I just...<eos> I'm trying to secure your bail and help you get outta here and help you get better.<eos> You wanna help me?<eos> I tell you what.<eos> You sell my house.<eos> Burn the whole place down.<eos> I don't care, 'cause right here, this is where I'm gonna be, and if Rayna doesn't pull through,<eos> - She will.
Why?<eos> !<eos> Ever since you got your memories back, ever since you remembered that you're Snow White and Prince Charming, your lives have... they've...<eos> Well, they've sucked!<eos> No.<eos> No, we found you.<eos> And lost Henry and Neal and countless other people!<eos> Emma, the minute I let go of the belief that things will get better is the minute I know they won't.<eos> We'll find Henry.<eos> No, you won't.
Stomach flu or...<eos> There's no fever.<eos> Could it be something you ate?<eos> Your mother did bring by a huge dish of turkey tetrazzini this evening.<eos> Ugh. Is there nothing that woman doesn't use cream cheese in?<eos> You know, when she brings dinner over and you're not here, I feel obliged to have seconds.<eos> Well, you shouldn't feel obligated to do anything on her account.<eos> It'd be a lot easier if you two just occasionally crossed paths.<eos> You really should make more of an effort with her, Bill.<eos> I will.
Please don't tell.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Be careful out there.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> So promise me this will not happen again.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Because, if it does...<eos> - It won't.
I told you, don't leave.<eos> But you go.<eos> This... this is what happens.<eos> We all get trouble.<eos> So now you stay here.<eos> Here, between these walls.<eos> This is your new home.<eos> You will eat here, sleep here, shit here, die here.<eos> Carrie won't save you.<eos> No one will.
- You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.<eos> I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.<eos> You've been to hell and back.<eos> I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...<eos> We will.
If you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.<eos> I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable, but the guy's a junkie, sir.<eos> How far is he into withdrawal?<eos> Hardly started.<eos> What he's feeling now, it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.<eos> Methadone would make it easier.<eos> Has to be cold turkey.<eos> Where he's going, we need him functional.<eos> Even if it kills him?<eos> It won't.
MARCO: Do you know who he is?<eos> WALTER: Of course.<eos> He's my father.<eos> SONYA: Walter Chambers has a home address on file.<eos> MARCO: David once said his uncle had Alzheimer's.<eos> SONYA: David Tate was here that day.<eos> Come on.<eos> SONYA: What are you doing?<eos> MARCO: What if we can't find him?<eos> SONYA: We will.
Erin, no, leave it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> If it's him, it's important we know what he says, okay?<eos> Answer it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mary, where are you?<eos> I can't tell you that, John.<eos> They...<eos> They won't let me tell you.<eos> All right, okay, of course they won't.
- That man's death is on your head.<eos> - I don't see how that can be right.<eos> - I didn't ask you to kill him.<eos> - I warned you to stay away.<eos> You can't hold me accountable if you choose not to listen.<eos> See, the thing is, I can hold you accountable, me being a copper and all that.<eos> - Give me that camera!<eos> - Oh, I don't think so.<eos> Give me that camera or I will shoot him!<eos> No, you won't, Thomas.
Come on.<eos> I lied.<eos> They love you, man.<eos> - The whole world loves you.<eos> - You're a bad man.<eos> Welcome back, Mr. Henry.<eos> I'm Kay, your new segment producer.<eos> - Potential new segment producer.<eos> - Right. I've got to earn it.<eos> And I will.
Think about him.<eos> Think about the feelings you're getting.<eos> Describe it to me.<eos> It's a...<eos> It's a chill.<eos> I can't explain it, but it's like I can feel him. He's trying to reach out to me, but I don't know where he is, and I can't understand what he's trying to say.<eos> All I know is that he's scared, and he's lonely, and he's in a lot of pain.<eos> He's in a lot of pain.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> We will.
I'm pretty sure 'cause there's a lot of blood.<eos> Did you call an ambulance?<eos> You have to come over.<eos> It went under the couch.<eos> I can't even look.<eos> What if it's still alive?<eos> What if I lift the couch and it starts flipping around?<eos> I'm not your boyfriend.<eos> Maybe I'll make it worth your while if you come over.<eos> No, you won't.
They'll listen to you.<eos> That day in court, you said if I worked hard and turned my life around, doors would open for me.<eos> I remember that, and I stand by it.<eos> Okay, so I did what you said, 'cept the doors are still closed.<eos> All I'm asking is for you to open one for me.<eos> I'll see what I can do...<eos> But ultimately, it's up to you.<eos> I can't make people trust you, Lenny.<eos> You have to earn that.<eos> I will.
I can talk to the parents, see if the blanket rings any bells.<eos> No, I'll talk to them.<eos> Think about it.<eos> They've got the big car, the big house.<eos> They won't even notice.<eos> All I need is his pin.<eos> Or hers.<eos> They'll think it's online fraud or hackers.<eos> But what if they found out?<eos> They won't.
I-I'm too exhausted to be having this conversation right now.<eos> Come on, Wilfred.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, you should come over for Sunday brunch, bring some champagne.<eos> We'll just hang out, drink mimosas.<eos> I promise not to talk about Dad.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> I hope these work.<eos> Oh, they will.
No, you didn't.<eos> If you think I'm going anywhere without Lizzie and Mica--<eos> If you want them to leave, to go out there with you?<eos> Lizzie's sick.<eos> Mica is 10 years old.<eos> She can't.<eos> We'll keep them safe.<eos> You're not that woman who was too scared to be alone, not anymore.<eos> You're gonna start over, find others, people who don't know, and you're gonna survive out here.<eos> You will.
- Yeah.<eos> Then you were right to send her away.<eos> I don't know if I could have.<eos> You could have, Maggie.<eos> You've done harder things.<eos> Don't doubt yourself.<eos> We don't get to anymore.<eos> Rick, the cluster's getting bigger than the one that took the fence down.<eos> - We need to do something.<eos> - We will.
Conor, Bridg.<eos> I'm going into town.<eos> Avi's in charge.<eos> He needs a doctor, Raymond.<eos> If he dies, it's a mortal sin and we all go to hell.<eos> You still believe that crap?<eos> After what he did to our family?<eos> - I know killing is wrong, that's all.<eos> - We take him to a hospital he turns Bunch in for shooting him.<eos> - Maybe he won't.

Shit, I don't know who he is.<eos> He's nothing to do with me. He's my grandad.<eos> Men like this fought in wars, cheek by jowl, belly-down, crawling through the mud, the blood, and the fear. And for what?<eos> Eh?<eos> Boys with hair straighteners. Girls in jeggings, with their flabby arses hanging out!<eos> It was my very real privilege to have met you, sir.<eos> You need to step up!<eos> He is your responsibility!<eos> Oh, fine!<eos> Fine. I'll...
Listen to me.<eos> This lapel pin... Is a camera.<eos> Now, if you can program its feed into my laptop, you and Jose can work from the car.<eos> And Michelle and I will be inside on earbuds.<eos> It'll be like... Like we're partners on a Secret Service Detail.<eos> - Like you and Bob Scott.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Bob Scott was with you on Clyde Ritter's detail.<eos> He let you down, Sean.<eos> And you won't, Edgar.
I can get Sam Dino to pick up our whole inventory.<eos> Nothing changes on your end.<eos> Sambel runs protection.<eos> You ship through Mendocino.<eos> Same deal, just a different territory.<eos> Granted, I know how much you'll miss working with me.<eos> GAALAN: I'll take it back to the Kings.<eos> I think they'll let you walk away if they know you're doubling their business.<eos> - JAX: It's not gonna get doubled.<eos> - GAALAN: Yes, it will.
I got fucking drunk... and I shot him.<eos> You what?<eos> Ray had to take care of it.<eos> He killed him right in front of us.<eos> It really fucked up Terry.<eos> And it really fucked up me.<eos> How's Ray feel about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you fucking ask him?<eos> All right, I will.
Guys.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> I don't care.<eos> He can talk to anybody he wants, tell them what to do, and that's-- that's up to them.<eos> I don't-- he can tell me what to do, but I ain't gonna do it.<eos> - We split, or let's go together to get...<eos> - Wood, fire...<eos> Who wants to do mushrooms?<eos> - Mushrooms.<eos> - I will.
You got to get your show ready.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> At some point, I'm gonna have to call my parents.<eos> Do you have to?<eos> My father keeps a scrapbook on me.<eos> He Googles me every morning.<eos> He's gonna understand.<eos> - He will.<eos> - Not deep down.<eos> No one will.
Oh, my God!<eos> You like him, too.<eos> Doesn't matter, does it?<eos> He's a married man.<eos> What does Olivia say?<eos> Nothing!<eos> I can't tell her.<eos> She's your best friend.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> And I will!
Per his most recent memo.<eos> He's communicating with you through memos?<eos> You've been left adrift on lady law's fickle ocean with no rudder, no captain?<eos> He hasn't been in the office since he took over the program, if that's what you're asking.<eos> No, I think I was perfectly clear in what I was asking, Simon.<eos> Am I supposed to respond to that?<eos> Yeah, by going back to your desk right now and doing it correctly.<eos> But--<eos> Simon, a memo from Nigel is not gonna stick its boot in your ass.<eos> A memo from me will.
Yeah, and look how you turned out.<eos> Graduating summa cum laude from both Cambridge and Harvard is quite the failure.<eos> Your parents' choice to "homeschool," much better.<eos> Okay, that was only till I was ten, and my mother's science fair was legendary.<eos> You must be so proud of your uncontested blue ribbons.<eos> Okay, you know what,<eos> I'm not gonna let you shatter the glass that I spent years blowing.<eos> And I'm certainly not gonna let the likes of you tell me who I can and cannot blow.<eos> He's not gonna come.<eos> He will.
He's gonna be fine.<eos> - Bunny?<eos> - Yes! Shirley: Patrick Doyle.<eos> - Look at you, James Dean.<eos> - Patrick Sr.: Well, we grew up on the same block.<eos> Casey's going back to Afghanistan.<eos> - For how long?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He said he hadn't decided whether to re-enlist.<eos> - He will, unless...
Do you wanna see the e-mails you sent me while you were with him?<eos> I'm never gonna get it.<eos> So the small favor you can do for me is not saying something as inane as, "You forgot you were mad at me."<eos> Because sometimes, you're not as cute as you think you are.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - I want to know who leaked the story.<eos> The campaign's happy to announce the results of the latest New Hampshire Journal poll, which has Governor Romney in the lead with 37% of New Hampshire's likely Republican voters, well ahead of Rick Perry with 18%,<eos> Ron Paul with 14%, then Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain.<eos> You forgot about Huntsman, Gingrich, and Santorum.<eos> - And soon you will, too.
- Hello?<eos> - Hallie, what the hell is going on?<eos> Why is everybody but us writing about the job speech Romney's gonna give in Las Vegas?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm sorry, Evan.<eos> The rest of the press corps got an advanced copy.<eos> - Why didn't you?<eos> - I wasn't on the bus.<eos> You said this stunt wasn't gonna fuck anything up.<eos> - It won't.
No.<eos> I'm horrified!<eos> His anger is entirely for Wickham.<eos> You were only 15, Georgiana.<eos> I myself know how... ..convincing he can be.<eos> Let's all of us hope he'll be out of our lives again soon.<eos> Hardcastle will want alibis for everyone.<eos> We were all together last night, of course, except for you, Colonel, and your night-time excursion.<eos> I'm sure you'll be able to offer him a full explanation as to where you went.<eos> I will.
I'm not really into art.<eos> "Says Eric Griffith."<eos> 'Cause, you know, it's my job to cover all the angles.<eos> And what about yours?<eos> Job.<eos> You find anything yet?<eos> Yeah, I'm still looking.<eos> We're on our way to the office now, check out some more want ads.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're gonna find something.<eos> 'Course we will.
Michael, calm down.<eos> We're done with this.<eos> So this is over?<eos> The first part, yes.<eos> Set our sights on new horizons.<eos> This is gonna loosen you up.<eos> It's a chemical relative of benzodiazepine... mixed with a synthetic hallucinogen.<eos> Drugs will only make this more complicated.<eos> I'll tell you whatever you want to know.<eos> Yes, you will.
Now, you get some rest because it is clear to me there are more demons inside of you, and I will do whatever it takes to dig them out.<eos> A spy is trained to deal with a wide range of external threats-- combat, pursuit, capture, interrogation, even torture.<eos> Training is designed to expose you to as many situations as possible so that when you encounter them in the real world, you're ready.<eos> There are situations, though, you simply can't prepare for.<eos> No amount of experience or training can help you when the threat comes from inside your own mind.<eos> Frank, stop it, you're drunk.<eos> Just calm down!<eos> Nate, go next door, now.<eos> He'll hurt you.<eos> No, he won't.
OK. Just to get to know each other.<eos> I can entertain you with my small talk.<eos> OK.<eos> His small talk's not very good.<eos> 'Completely oblivious to Warwick's peril...' Oh, God!<eos> Oh, bloody hell!<eos> Oh!<eos> CAR SKIDS 'Mr Smalltalk had completely forgotten not go on about himself.'<eos> The important thing is not to panic, cos everyone thinks helicopters will just fall out the sky if the engine fails.<eos> They won't.
Yes, Stan retreated into himself, and, yes, he didn't give you what you needed, but maybe he...<eos> Maybe he didn't know how.<eos> Maybe he was just doing the best he could.<eos> A bachelor auction?<eos> It's so much fun!<eos> And the best thing is, you don't have to say anything.<eos> You just have to look handsome.<eos> And you've got that covered.<eos> Yeah, well, what makes you think she's gonna bid on me?<eos> She won't.
- She obviously needs help.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> Just put her over the line and that's it?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
You believe him?<eos> I do.<eos> Paul Briggs is a good agent.<eos> No, you know...<eos> Paul Briggs is a great agent.<eos> He's put away more guys in a year than people do in their entire careers.<eos> This guy saved my life.<eos> He deserves our help.<eos> Then we'll help him.<eos> We will?
- Where are you two going?<eos> - To a barbecue.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I thought you didn't like barbecues.<eos> Oh, I never said that.<eos> But since you're so into barbecues, and they're so important to you, I thought I'd give them a shot.<eos> [Whispering] They're talking about you.<eos> I would love it if you both could stay.<eos> Why, thank you, Collin.<eos> We will.
Abaddon?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Thought you Kentucky fried that meatsuit.<eos> I did, Dean.<eos> You -- well, then, how did she get it back?<eos> Thank you.<eos> And why's she playing G.I. Joe?<eos> No clue.<eos> Why don't you ask her when we find her?<eos> Oh, I will.
I'll be right behind you.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Hands behind your back!<eos> - Sean, get behind me!<eos> - Get your protectee and get out of here!<eos> I'm not leaving without you.<eos> Do your job!<eos> Bob!<eos> Cops are gonna be coming down that ramp any second.<eos> No, they won't.
- Yes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what I'm trying to do, but my boss is playing favorites with one of my operatives.<eos> You seem to be getting stuck on this one issue, Calder.<eos> So, let's remove the problem, shall we?<eos> Annie Walker no longer works in your department.<eos> I'll transfer her out.<eos> Now you can turn your attention to other matters of DPD concern.<eos> Okay.<eos> I certainly will.
They didn't kill Ezequiel.<eos> We broke an international auto fraud ring and caught Nick Castigan's killer, and I'm thinking, with enough pressure, we can make 'em for Ezequiel's murder as well.<eos> It was a good day, Carrie.<eos> I'm telling you we're missing something.<eos> Now I want to go into that list of buyers again, see if one of them has a registered .22.<eos> Please, I got people from the City Council calling me, diplomats from the State Department.<eos> It's like half the traders on wall street bought one of those cars.<eos> We're done. I can't go to this kid's father and tell him we have the guy who murdered his son.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I will.
These guys wanna open up the door to privacy?<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll show them that door swings both ways.<eos> Lucas?<eos> This hack of yours was supposed to give us access to privileged information, not create chaos.<eos> It's part of um... a... campaign.<eos> A well-orchestrated plan.<eos> When were you going to tell me about this plan?<eos> Trust me on this, you'll know soon enough.<eos> Everyone will.
I'll persuade him to let us take a look at it.<eos> But even if Escher could provide the power source, there's still other factors.<eos> Say you returned to the exact time and place that you left.<eos> There's no guarantee that it's the same life that you left.<eos> I'm willing to take that risk.<eos> You leave and there's no one else here to stop the others from continuing to change history.<eos> There's every chance that you return to 2077 to find nobody waiting for you.<eos> No Greg, no Sam, maybe nothing at all.<eos> I can't accept that, Alec.<eos> And I won't.
He's the new leader of Los Dark Douchebags.<eos> But we were such good mascara buddies.<eos> Although he did send Clio to kinda scalp you.<eos> Well, I'm gonna put the boots to Vex until he tells me where<eos> - the Wanderer is and how I kill him.<eos> - Wait up, Dyson is still...?<eos> - Looking for Lauren.<eos> Yeah. - Glad to see your love life finally got less complicated.<eos> - He has to find her.<eos> - He will.
[Sighs]<eos> I guess maybe Durant's right.<eos> Some men are architects, and others, just builders.<eos> I don't mind it like that.<eos> The offer still stands to build east with me.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> I'm heading west with the U.P.<eos> Good night then.<eos> I'll see your Pacific one day, Mr. Huntington.<eos> Yes, you will, Mr. Bohannon, one way or the other.
- This is Lorraine White.<eos> - She's deceased.<eos> Call Bloomquist.<eos> She's still alive.<eos> Kristen Haseman... she's alive.<eos> Victor is gonna be very happy to see you.<eos> Great work.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You should celebrate.<eos> He will.
That's how we do it, people.<eos> Bottom line, as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Michael Westen, welcome back to the CIA.<eos> Your mission is a deep-cover job going after the leader of a terrorist network.<eos> I am the man you've been waiting to meet.<eos> This is where we learn if you are the man you say you are.<eos> I've done everything you've asked of me.<eos> That should count for something.<eos> I'll tell you whatever you want to know.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Lacey, now he's sending it out to people!<eos> I even heard a few Chess Club guys talking about it.<eos> I don't really feel like confronting that creep Doug.<eos> Lacey, he...<eos> If it makes it to my friends, then so be it.<eos> They'll be mad, but they'll forgive me.<eos> Yeah, but Jo might not!<eos> Jo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.
Lacey, he...<eos> If it makes it to my friends, then so be it.<eos> They'll be mad, but they'll forgive me.<eos> Yeah, but Jo might not!<eos> Jo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.<eos> I mean, it'll be weird,<eos> - but she'll understand.<eos> - No no, she won't!
It was destroyed in the quake.<eos> Who in the hell could be feeding us year-old surveillance?<eos> Healthcare has enough problems without you punks.<eos> You're not the only one allowed to bring a friend!<eos> I'm clear.<eos> That makes one of us.<eos> China!<eos> Go ahead, waste your arrows.<eos> That hurt, but it won't stop me.<eos> That will.
Good.<eos> That's a deal then.<eos> Yes...<eos> Bye.<eos> I tried to walk Maria's way to school.<eos> That won't be for another five years.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> But it's still good to know.<eos> We'll pull through, right?<eos> Of course we will.
It's a delay.<eos> Not a failure.<eos> I'm not sure there's a distinction.<eos> Not in this context.<eos> What Duncan is trying to say is, we can still right the ship.<eos> Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
That's the best theory the F.B.I. can come up with?<eos> That Jane killed Benjamin Marx and burned his face off?<eos> We're exploring every angle.<eos> He's an angle.<eos> Listen. If I wanted to kill Benjamin Marx,<eos> I would have done it the first time.<eos> He was a sociopath that stole from widows and orphans, and he got what he deserved.<eos> But I didn't do it.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
Bob Kirkland?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> He thought you were Red John.<eos> Of course.<eos> How long have Homeland Security been watching me?<eos> Eight, nine years.<eos> I did what I thought was best at the time.<eos> Don't expect me to apologize.<eos> No, no, I-I won't.
Well, at least we know where the chapter is.<eos> 13 gilded pages means 13 chapters.<eos> Let's hope Mosconi didn't write a foreword.<eos> If all Hagen wants is the chapter, then it's not about the value of the book.<eos> No.<eos> It's about the information on the pages.<eos> Moz, you can leave those pages blank.<eos> Nobody's going to see them.<eos> Uh, not soon.<eos> No. But eventually, they will.
The drugs will take effect soon.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I removed the water bottles and poured it myself.<eos> You'd be surprised how easy it is to reseal a plastic lid.<eos> Are you picking your fingernails, doctor? 'Cause that would mean you're nervous.<eos> - Are you nervous?<eos> - You can't do this to me.<eos> Tell me where the money is.<eos> The FBI will never find it.<eos> No, they won't.
Not till you pay me.<eos> You're getting ahead of yourself.<eos> I need to authenticate it first.<eos> Let's get a move on.<eos> Ticktock.<eos> Calcite levels and pebble texture appear appropriate.<eos> I assume that's good news.<eos> Oh, it very much is.<eos> Then I think this is the part where you pay me.<eos> I will.
- I think he likes me.<eos> You're on Brian.<eos> I have to go to see Nina at the hospital.<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - We spoke last night.<eos> She said if I didn't come see her today, she was going to have sex with her oncologist.<eos> That sounds more like her.<eos> She must be feeling better.<eos> Tell her I love her.<eos> I will.
In 1996, Reed spent three years with a foster family and their son, Ezra Barnes.<eos> He served three tours in Iraq.<eos> He's stateside now.<eos> 20 bucks says he was stationed at Camp Kirby.<eos> Pay the man.<eos> The Mayor's foster brother is assigned to a weapons convoy that carries SCAR 16s by truck.<eos> The convoy's scheduled to come through Starling City tonight.<eos> FN SCAR 16s are military assault weapons with grenade launchers.<eos> The man gets a hold of these, Oliver, it's game over.<eos> He won't.
You knew about the bomb that killed Declan!<eos> It's time for me to face punishment for my sins.<eos> I think Father Paul can convice Conrad to confess...<eos> To everything.<eos> Some believe confession helps a guilty soul find peace...<eos> Releasing us from the shame and regret of our mistakes.<eos> In the face of mortality...<eos> Many feel the need to seek this closure to make things right.<eos> Because if death doesn't kill us...<eos> Our demons will.
It's okay.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> When I heard you might be here, and that you might still be alive, I knew I should be happy, but I wasn't.<eos> I was terrified.<eos> I didn't understand why until now.<eos> From the moment I saw you in New York, in the instant you stepped back in my life, I knew.<eos> I knew I'd never stopped loving you.<eos> And before I even had a chance to take a breath, I... I lost you once more, and all that pain that I had pushed down for all those years, it just came... rushing back, and I... I didn't know if I could go through it again.<eos> I love you.<eos> I probably always will.
Ew!<eos> Just take a chill pill.<eos> I will not take a chill pill!<eos> You have seriously crossed the line here, Dorrit. Oh, my God.<eos> You guys have a rubber?<eos> ♪ Rubber, rubber, rubber, you have a rubber ♪<eos> Shut up, you little twerp!<eos> She didn't mean that, sweetie.<eos> It's just, we don't want you misunderstanding what you saw and telling someone.<eos> Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.
- Audrey went after him?<eos> - Duke called her Audrey too.<eos> She's Audrey.<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> You'll explain now.<eos> Audrey was gonna shoot me.<eos> That guy got in the way.<eos> When she gets back, she will kill me.<eos> No!<eos> She won't.
You knew them?<eos> In a way.<eos> Looks like Vince was taken by surprise.<eos> Dave fought back.<eos> He was a tough old guy.<eos> Blonde hair.<eos> William.<eos> Listen, he is trying to set me up, okay?<eos> He planted that there. I-I can explain everything.<eos> Yeah. And you will.
***<eos> ***<eos> Ah, crap.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Open the register.<eos> No, please.<eos> I won't talk.<eos> I won't talk.<eos> No, you won't.
- Wade, you don't want that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Wade, things have changed.<eos> Things have changed?<eos> Troubled people giving me power?<eos> That's changed?<eos> I have a better way to end The Troubles now.<eos> Okay, listen, he's got to be here.<eos> Stop, or I'll shoot.<eos> No, you won't, Jordan.
Yes, it'll be like sleeping in your own bed again, and I'm betting, when you do, you're gonna remember who you are.<eos> How does me giving someone a Trouble fix the one that's already killing people?<eos> Well, we used to set up complementary Troubles to see how they'd interact... fire and ice, that sort of thing.<eos> Jordan caused pain, and Nathan can't feel her.<eos> And this one is a sound Trouble, so you're gonna have to make... a silence one.<eos> Bam.<eos> She's a natural.<eos> I will never give a Trouble to solve a Trouble.<eos> I'll find another way.<eos> No you won't.
What kind of curse do you want?<eos> And use your imagination.<eos> Two, the person you choose is key.<eos> I mean, who are they?<eos> Are they a good match for your intention?<eos> Now, the curse, or intention, is shaped in here.<eos> You're giving them a release.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I'll never believe that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
The temptation is too much.<eos> He will get you back.<eos> You won't be Audrey Parker anymore, and you won't care.<eos> But I do care.<eos> I care about you.<eos> I'm not gonna let you do this.<eos> How do I justify what I did to Lincoln?<eos> I can't just give up.<eos> We'll stick him in a soundproof room.<eos> We'll... something.
You can feel her, can't you?<eos> You can feel... Us.<eos> We better keep going.<eos> They're not going to find us.<eos> You ready to take that chance?<eos> You know what they'll do.<eos> We've broken every rule there is.<eos> Yeah, but we've had so much fun doing it.<eos> Mara, they'll take you from me.<eos> No, they won't.
What?<eos> Quentin may have arranged us in neat numbers for now, but I'm sure if he saw you, he wouldn't hesitate to kill out of sequence.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - We need to stay inside.<eos> Especially you, Mrs Stanley.<eos> No doubt he wants to finish the job.<eos> To kill me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, supposing he gets inside?<eos> He won't.
The police want to question you about your uncle's murder.<eos> You're obviously in no shape for that.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> We'll work it out.<eos> But you need to sleep this off and get your head straight.<eos> We need to get you ready for their questions before they bring you in.<eos> We'll put you up in a hotel.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going into a hotel.<eos> T.J. I won't!
Mom?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because you're acting kind of weird.<eos> Oh, I'm just worried about Uncle T.J.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> Dad will get him out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, he will.
Now, about my case.<eos> One of my clients, an executive at a Fortune 500 company, is refusing to pay a $14,000 invoice.<eos> I need your help to collect.<eos> Why would a rich guy fight you over a bill?<eos> Well, a few weeks ago, he showed up without an appointment, and I was booked.<eos> He offered me 10 times my normal rate.<eos> I said no, and he got angry.<eos> I'll schedule a meeting with his lawyer.<eos> - We'll get it worked out.<eos> - No, you won't.
All right, she was found dead last night.<eos> Her body was dumped off of Highway 18.<eos> NERO: Jesus Christ.<eos> CANE: That's a warrant for your vehicle, Mr. Padilla.<eos> We need to take it in.<eos> The caller who spotted the body said they saw a Ford pickup truck drive away from the scene.<eos> NERO: He got one of these for me, too?<eos> ROOSEVELT: Right now, we'd just like you to come down and answer a few questions.<eos> LYLA: . Hey, I'll call Gemma.<eos> NERO: - No, you won't.
We only get one shot at this.<eos> You ready?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making certain I don't slow you down.<eos> You know what you must do.<eos> Good luck, Cyrus.<eos> I won't leave you!<eos> There's no time to argue.<eos> When Jafar learns you witnessed my escape without alerting the guards, he will kill you.<eos> No. He won't.
So it doesn't bother you breaking up a family and...<eos> Wait, wait, wait, do you think I'm dating Benny?<eos> - To be generous, yeah.<eos> - I'm his daughter, Katie.<eos> You three make quite a crew.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which reminds me... a cabin on Lake Carroll, two days pulling large-mouth out of crystal clear water.<eos> Oh, man, they're going to love that.<eos> So will you.<eos> Yes, I will.
Just, uh, things are a little messy with her ex.<eos> Last shift, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's what I wanted to talk about.<eos> Not about you and my sister?<eos> Don't sweat it.<eos> She tells me everything, and I always liked you.<eos> Tell that to your mother, please.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I will. I will.
You know, check that out for a little while.<eos> Nice.<eos> - It just feels different.<eos> - Try again.<eos> Just give me... ♪ No, no, no<eos> ♪ No, no, no it's still catching.<eos> It still feels tight. - It can happen with scar tissue.<eos> - I feel like...<eos> - I feel like I'm never gonna heal.<eos> - Hopefully, you will.
Love you.<eos> Crap. What's wrong?<eos> Aren't you excited about the interview?<eos> Well, I was, except it's right in the middle of the concert.<eos> I'll just have to...<eos> Be direct and explain to Walt that this interview's really important.<eos> No.<eos> What I have to do is figure out how to be in two places at once.<eos> You're never gonna pull this off.<eos> Sure I will.
She now makes a handsome living selling secrets, mostly of a technological nature.<eos> I really don't understand any of it.<eos> But she's clearly stepping up on this one, trying to make a legacy for herself.<eos> She owns that nightclub.<eos> Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun, until she tried to strangle me with her stocking.<eos> I'll get a warrant.<eos> You'll have it by the time you get there.<eos> She won't talk, and even if she did, what would you expect her to say?<eos> She may know Seth's location.<eos> She won't.
Kyle, when she abandoned you, I was there.<eos> You can't just replace me.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Let him...<eos> let him go.<eos> He wants to go home.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll come back for you.<eos> I promise.<eos> No, you won't.
No, I get it.<eos> All right.<eos> Fellas.<eos> Shit.<eos> Our new tail.<eos> This is bad, Jackie.<eos> We got a very, very busy week ahead of us.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to finish that conversation.<eos> We will.
What's the most valuable thing in your office?<eos> My medal of valor.<eos> God, you are such a hero.<eos> All right, how about this?<eos> I will bet you that by midnight tonight, I can steal the medal of valor from your office.<eos> Why would I possibly agree to that?<eos> Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime.<eos> And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.<eos> But if I win...<eos> You won't.
Well, guess what she said.<eos> Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition.<eos> Fine.<eos> The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the american ballet academy.<eos> I was a classical dancer.<eos> And I was good.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I knew you were a big softy.<eos> You tell anyone, I break your face.<eos> No, you won't.
He could have it delivered.<eos> Giving it in person would make her even more happy.<eos> And you can also make sure it gets delivered with your own eyes. Tell me clearly whether it was delivered to her, or not. If she took it, the lid... spin it, please.<eos> It did get delivered.<eos> Then it's good<eos> Did she like it?<eos> I guess it was whatever..<eos> She liked it that much? If I personally gave it to her, I could've seen how much she liked it<eos> But I told myself I wouldn't do that<eos> I won't
Once a week I head out to pick up cottonwood, yarrow bark, some other meds, and I store it...<eos> In here.<eos> Cozy.<eos> So what makes you think they're just gonna let you out of here?<eos> The town still needs medicine.<eos> Troops do too.<eos> I can sneak Aaron past, right out to Monroe.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> - What if they search the wagon?<eos> - They won't.
Uh, my needs are simple.<eos> I need a phone that can draw a mustache on people and occasionally will call my mother and hang up.<eos> And she needs one with a good camera, because I have to film my video pitch for new pants.<eos> I have a hole in my butt.<eos> You know you're supposed to, right?<eos> [Stapler clicks] Max, I might be a virgin again.<eos> I love my new phone!<eos> It's so cool and red.<eos> It feels like anything could happen!<eos> But it probably won't.
I just don't see the point any more.<eos> Sean, stop showing us up.<eos> Sean, come on, now, let's talk about this.<eos> I wanted to talk about this, but none of you would listen.<eos> And then, Niamh locked me in a cupboard.<eos> You locked him in a cupboard?<eos> Yeah. And I want to know who let him out.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Stop being a mouth and put the knife down, Sean.<eos> No! I won't. So what?
He thought it was intruders but... ..in the darkness and in the confusion, he fired.<eos> By the time he realised, it was too late.<eos> Trixy was lying there on the kitchen floor.<eos> Your horse was in the kitchen?<eos> He looked as though he was sleeping.<eos> How does a horse get into a kitchen?<eos> I still can't look my father in the eye.<eos> Did your house just have like massive doors?<eos> I thought that this exhibition might put it to rest, but... ..it hasn't.<eos> It won't.
I mean, if I were you, and I had me, I wouldn't write anything down on a list either.<eos> You're teasing me.<eos> I am.<eos> But look at you.<eos> You know, this...<eos> these are just little things.<eos> You know, where I want to go, you know, climb things, go to outer space, huh?<eos> What, lean on the Tower of Pisa?<eos> Did you get your tuxedo?<eos> I will.
I know you're upset.<eos> Upset?<eos> "Upset" doesn't touch it.<eos> Rachel, I killed those guys by thinking it.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I really do.<eos> They were gonna shoot Miles... and then I felt this flash of anger, and then they caught fire.<eos> And I can't any more of this.<eos> What if someone else gets hurt?<eos> They won't.
Jax: Tell Gaalan I'm honoring his demands.<eos> We'll run the guns through Clay.<eos> But we all know that plan's a risk.<eos> If it falls through, I want the Kings to know that Marks is still willing to distribute.<eos> Tell them that.<eos> Connor: Aye.<eos> I'll pass it along.<eos> CHIBS: You two.<eos> Make sure they get there whole.<eos> JUICE: We will.
So I've noticed.<eos> When's the funeral?<eos> Day after tomorrow.<eos> I wanted to give her foster family a chance to change their minds about attending.<eos> Do you think they will?<eos> No.<eos> You can stay in the guest room.<eos> Till the service.<eos> If you want to.<eos> I will. Thanks.
My friend Atticus Hoye once took me to a poppers den.<eos> You don't get a den for poppers.<eos> Well, that shows how much you know.<eos> All these naked guys injecting themselves with poppers by sitting on these big rubber needles.<eos> Atticus, he couldn't get enough of it.<eos> You know what they say, once you pop you just can't stop.<eos> So if you, er, change your mind about tonight...?<eos> I won't.<eos> Well, you might.<eos> I absolutely won't.
People can change.<eos> Terrible... unspeakable things happen to all of us, but... that doesn't give anyone the right to destroy someone's life.<eos> Whatever happened to you, whatever the truth is, for 14 years, you let an innocent man believe that he killed the one thing that he cared about.<eos> The one person in his screwed-up universe that he genuinely loved like a daughter.<eos> You took his desire to protect and save you, and you perverted it.<eos> You twisted it.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You haven't changed, Darcy.<eos> You never will.
It isn't easy making friends in grade school when you sound like Natasha.<eos> I... Don't have a lot of time.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Must hurry.<eos> Remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes when this is all over.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> You weren't going to leave without me, were you?<eos> I should kill you right now!<eos> You won't.
How wonderful.<eos> Ah, so listen.<eos> Doing the thing was 50,000.<eos> Keeping quiet about it, I'm thinking it should be 50 more.<eos> Oh, I want word to spread.<eos> It's kind of the whole objective, actually.<eos> You see my point?<eos> You should know, I find post hoc negotiation... distasteful.<eos> Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought, doctor.<eos> But soon, everyone else will.
Hit man, bro.<eos> Yeah, he'd call someone like me and I would do it.<eos> That's exactly how I envision it going down.<eos> That's not what's happening here though.<eos> Did she send me those texts or not?<eos> We did.<eos> I would like you to know oh, my God.<eos> That even though we were seducing you for our coworker, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little turned on myself.<eos> Me too, if that will make you feel better.<eos> It won't, okay?

I searched a four-block radius around the school.<eos> The kids are in the wind.<eos> You shot him, now you're trying to save him?<eos> I need you to check the local police scanners, see if any cars were stolen near the high school.<eos> And check all the surveillance video you can.<eos> Airports, train stations, and bus stations.<eos> - Jake and Morgan can't have gone far.<eos> - And Ellen?<eos> - She'll come back for him.<eos> - No, she won't.
Look, when I was pregnant with Morgan, the hormones made me crazy, just moody and weepy and...<eos> It's normal.<eos> Just give her some time.<eos> She'll call you, she will, she just needs a bit of space right now.<eos> Okay, okay, Mrs. Sanders.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Tell Morgan...<eos> - I will.<eos> I will.
Look, practically every kid in the school knows something ugly went down between you and my sister.<eos> And me being up there with you...<eos> Feels wrong.<eos> So...<eos> Can I just say one thing?<eos> - What?<eos> - I miss Olivia.<eos> And if I could take everything back, I would.<eos> - I'll pass that on.<eos> - No, you won't.
You get a little older, we'll add a little hooch in there.<eos> That'll really keep us warm.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's nothing to be nervous about.<eos> Hank...<eos> Keep your hands steady.<eos> Just like we practiced on the range.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't want to miss.<eos> Well, then, you won't.
Carey, we made a commitment to our employees.<eos> Yes, and that commitment means nothing if we go under.<eos> Who was the last person?<eos> Ah. It was Robyn, wasn't it?<eos> We can't let her go.<eos> We'll have no investigator.<eos> And how much have we investigated in the last two weeks?<eos> Look, it's just for a few months.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> No, I will.
I just needed some time to just clear my head.<eos> It's not that simple, Paul.<eos> I saw the toll combat took on you.<eos> You still think I'm a danger, don't you?<eos> - Joss, I never laid a hand on either one of y'all.<eos> - No!<eos> I'd just find you asleep on the kitchen floor cradling a gun, with our son in the next room.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Spread out in case Finch comes up with her location.<eos> [Phone line rings]<eos> Judge Monahan?<eos> It's Joss Carter.<eos> I apologize for calling so late, but I was hoping you could grant me an arrest warrant tonight.<eos> It can't be done in the morning?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> I have a sworn statement implicating a prominent member of city hall in a major crime and corruption ring.<eos> Have you spoken to the DA about this?<eos> I will, first thing in the morning.
Maybe I can buy you a couple of minutes.<eos> Please.<eos> No.<eos> You have to come with us.<eos> He's coming with us.<eos> Prepare to fire.<eos> What is this, Gene?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Horn said he was gonna leave my daughter alone.<eos> And he will.
But I also believe in good form.<eos> So when I win your heart, Emma-- and I will win it-- it will not be because of any trickery.<eos> It will be because you want me.<eos> This is not a contest, Hook.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You're gonna have to choose, Emma.<eos> You realize that, don't you?<eos> Because neither one of us is gonna give up.<eos> The only thing I have to choose is the best way to get my son back.<eos> And you will.
These are scrubs.<eos> Oh!<eos> A doctor. Uh-huh.<eos> That's pretty cool.<eos> It is. What are you doing right now?<eos> You wanna get a burrito?<eos> No, I do not wanna get a burrito.<eos> It's 9:00 A.M.<eos> Okay, well, if you change your mind...<eos> I will not.
I don't... just...<eos> It's our schedules and, you know, phone tag.<eos> I don't have the bells and whistles phone plan with night minutes, I don't have it.<eos> Why don't you call her from here?<eos> We'll all go out to dinner.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Tell your guy to wear his fanciest dress shorts.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell Mary to bring aersolity.<eos> I will.

Is that how you saved Aunt Erin? Mm-hmm.<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> Who invented that?<eos> Your grandfather.<eos> I mean, you used to drill that into us every time we went into the city.<eos> Or every time we got on the subway.<eos> Actually, Pop invented it.<eos> He used to do the same thing to me.<eos> But we actually never had to use it.<eos> And please God, we never will again.
Look, I'm CIA. I can help.<eos> Why would Zevlos work with the CIA?<eos> I'm the one who snuck him into the States.<eos> I provided him with intel, with names of operatives.<eos> Look, I can move just about anything in or out of the country.<eos> Now, I can do the same for you.<eos> So... so let's just land this plane and talk this through.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You won't regret this.<eos> No. But you will.
Let's get crackin'.<eos> Come on, let's make this album.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This feels momentous.<eos> Oh, God, I am so, so sorry, Mr. Carlson.<eos> Look, sometimes emotions are so hard for Max to read.<eos> You have to understand that, you know, he's come such a long way.<eos> But I will sit down with him tonight and I will explain to him why it was so inappropriate to take that photo.<eos> I promise you this will never happen again.<eos> It won't.
That's... that's kinda what I was thinking.<eos> You should like shave your head and get all peaceful about it.<eos> Your sacrifice saves the world.<eos> Yes.<eos> I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.<eos> What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks?<eos> Things just keep getting better here, Tom.<eos> And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow here on stage, and things are gonna go off!<eos> You gonna come with me to Israel, Kyle?<eos> Yes, I will. Huh?
You're sorry?<eos> I quit.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I want you to turn my badge in for me.<eos> (Scoffs) Get outta here.<eos> I'm done. I don't need it.<eos> First of all, no.<eos> And secondly, when we do decide to quit, that's gonna be a decision that we make together. - As a couple. - Oh...<eos> Just take the damn badge.<eos> What... I will not!
Meet the 14th President of our great Republic.<eos> Always the Professor.<eos> That was not meant to be a lesson.<eos> It was a warning.<eos> Olivia Pope knows about Remington, and now she's working for Josephine Marcus.<eos> If she thought she needed it, she'd use it against us.<eos> She'd let Marcus use it against us.<eos> She thinks she knows.<eos> She thinks she knows because of Ballard, and he's yet to come across anything concrete.<eos> And he won't.
I have so many questions I want to ask you, but I'm afraid you'll kill my friends if I do.<eos> So, you know...<eos> Let's just talk about the weather or, uh... How I can't form attachments to people because my mother is dead, and my father is that thing that goes bump in the night.<eos> Or...<eos> You pick a topic.<eos> One question.<eos> (Sighs) What?<eos> You can ask me one question.<eos> And you won't kill Jake, or Huck...<eos> - I won't.
I'm lost.<eos> Where are we?<eos> My ears aren't workin'.<eos> Help me out here.<eos> - You suck!<eos> - You suck!<eos> Could you... do you have a mic I could take?<eos> No, you need to turn around.<eos> If you don't get back on the stage now,<eos> - you never will again.
I came back.<eos> There will be no such thing as what you are worried about.<eos> It's not something that an exiled person can decide.<eos> This is the place where we will be living.<eos> Are you in your right mind?<eos> Do you live here?<eos> Did Tan's family move?<eos> Are you not able to use your eyes now?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Oh, will you?
Where are we on the contents of the box?<eos> Still working on those passports and tracing the money, but ballistics did confirm that it was the gun used kill Victor Fokin.<eos> The good news...<eos> We actually did find a partial on one of the casings in the magazine.<eos> But it's not Tom Keen's, and there were no hits on it through AFIS.<eos> Give me updates as soon as you have them.<eos> Meanwhile, there's been a development.<eos> Reddington's brought us a case.<eos> It's about time he realizes that he has to talk directly to us.<eos> He won't.
But he couldn't stop me.<eos> Your father's on his way.<eos> But of course you knew that.<eos> That's why you showed everyone your face.<eos> You wanted him to know that you'd won.<eos> And it worked.<eos> But you have to admit, what I've done is extraordinary.<eos> My father will never forget it.<eos> Certainly Dana won't.<eos> Or maybe she will.
My phone is still upstairs.<eos> Without you even realizing what's happening.<eos> Wow.<eos> I'm such a dodo.<eos> I didn't even bring my phone today.<eos> - I know what you're doing.<eos> - We're gonna talk about it.<eos> Okay, well, you have my number, so I can start tomorrow.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - I will!
I thought I'd made my feelings clear.<eos> The Paradise is not her playground.<eos> But see how much she has learnt.<eos> I will not have my daughter smelling of that shop as if she were the spawn of some merchant!<eos> Perhaps you were right.<eos> A governess, tutors - it all does seem rather unnecessary.<eos> Perhaps I should simply send her away to school.<eos> I will not allow it!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I will not!
So, um, can I ask you a favor?<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, you know Steve has that tough guy act down pat.<eos> Mm-hmm. But underneath it all, he's still that vulnerable little guy who thought he lost his mom and had to grow up too soon.<eos> And Mary, she's the only one who really gets that about him because she lived it, too.<eos> And, um, well, once I'm gone, they're gonna need each other more than ever, even though they both won't want to admit it.<eos> Stubborn kids.<eos> So...<eos> You think maybe you could see to it that they stay close?<eos> I will.
What else are you hiding?<eos> Nothing, I swear.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Conrad's hired a publicist who's determined to put a sheen on everything we do, including promoting this wedding, which if we don't act quickly, it'll be too late to do anything.<eos> I thought you were relying on Jack Porter - to break them up.<eos> - I've heard that he's courting Ms. Lemarchal.<eos> So clearly that won't be coming to fruition.<eos> - Then we'll find another way.<eos> - Oh, we won't.<eos> You will.
I'd tell him myself, but it might be best coming from you.<eos> Cos you're with him.<eos> And he loves you.<eos> What time are you supposed to be there?<eos> 9:30.<eos> That's going to look good, isn't it?<eos> The head teacher's son and his stupid friend, the two plonkers that don't turn up.<eos> Right, upstairs, pair of you, come on, get changed, I'll drive you in.<eos> Yes, love.<eos> I will.
He's not gonna hurt Hannah or the baby, will he?<eos> Not while she's pregnant.<eos> He has to keep the child safe.<eos> And after?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> We're gonna be a family again.<eos> No, we can't be a family.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> But it will this time.
I don't know.<eos> Even if we can find Pan, he was powerful before.<eos> With Henry's heart,<eos> I... I don't know if we can hurt him.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> Look.<eos> You nicked him.<eos> If he can bleed, we can hurt him.<eos> And if we can hurt him, we can kill him.<eos> And we will.
"You can't open it.<eos> Ha ha ha!"<eos> Audience, who laughs at locksmiths?<eos> AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Love.<eos> Love laughs at locksmiths.<eos> Oh. You lock the girl up, you lock the boy up, or you put locked barriers between them and they'll always find a way through to each other. BILL:<eos> Aww. Except they don't, do they?<eos> No.<eos> If you lock...<eos> They won't, will they?
Kill the President.<eos> Correct.<eos> So if she does this, she injects the President with the poison... he'll die instantly?<eos> Within seconds.<eos> You're positive?<eos> I need to know, if I ask her to do this, it's going to work.<eos> That he'll die right away and will it be traceable?<eos> Will it look like he's dying of natural causes?<eos> I need to know that, uh, she won't get caught.<eos> She won't.
Previously on "Betrayal"...<eos> - I thought this wasn't gonna happen.<eos> - It won't.
Girlfriend?<eos> While we were dating?<eos> That two-timing son of a...<eos> Hey. Diane.<eos> While you were dating Eddie, you and Fornell were...<eos> Oh... forget it.<eos> Did she have to sign in, too?<eos> No, just the box's owner.<eos> Well, we're gonna have to find her.<eos> We will.
Season 2, Episode 16 "Risk Assessment"<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Geez!<eos> - Man, we need to call the police.<eos> - You can't.<eos> Stop.<eos> We'll just take the rug back to where we found it.<eos> Jason, this rug has our DNA on it now.<eos> The police might end up thinking we killed this guy.<eos> - No, they won't.
You're leaving?<eos> What about us?<eos> You don't want us - to come with you?<eos> - Of course I do, more than anything.<eos> But you do have a choice.<eos> I can't ask you to come with me when none of you expected to live in Portugal.<eos> You all moved from Scotland to be here in France. No, Mary.<eos> We left to be with you.<eos> So you'll come with me?<eos> Of course we will.
My life was richer than yours will ever be.<eos> I'll miss it.<eos> Nothing is more fickle than public opinion.<eos> You'll get drunk on power, just like I did.<eos> That's life, Bayan.<eos> We'll let them wear themselves out.<eos> Then rush them.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> His head will hang in Lingbei province.<eos> No, I will.
He wouldn't even fight for you!<eos> But I would have died for you, father.<eos> But you could not say the words.<eos> What words?<eos> What words do you want? !<eos> Call me your son.<eos> You are a bastard, boy.<eos> Just say the words, and I will spare you unending pain.<eos> I will never give you what you want.<eos> You will.
Happy to do it.<eos> Surprised, but happy.<eos> Uh, maybe I could change into one of those cute chef jackets.<eos> Oh, chef Nicholas only permits pastry chefs to wear these.<eos> But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this.<eos> I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.<eos> I have some workout clothes you can wear.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I haven't worn them yet.<eos> But I will someday.
I'm just gonna go grab a bite.<eos> Do you want anything?<eos> I wanna move this stupid finger.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Try again?<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> Damn it!<eos> You put the sensors in weeks ago.<eos> I haven't moved the damn thing once.<eos> You will.
It is the presidential initiative on brain mapping.<eos> - It is the thing.<eos> - Okay.<eos> No.<eos> We're starting phase two.<eos> Okay? He's my brain now.<eos> Meredith can have the rest.<eos> I get his brain.<eos> - I'll get rid of them.<eos> - No, you won't.
- Turn over the paper.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - Just... turn it over.<eos> - It's not about the money.<eos> - It's a lot of money.<eos> - I don't care how much money it is.<eos> - It's not about that.<eos> - Will you at least watch our movie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he will.
No, sir.<eos> They're proud people.<eos> They've had a hard road.<eos> But no matter what's thrown at them, they never turn their backs on who they are.<eos> Takes guts.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This is a city of immigrants.<eos> You and me included.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> I will, sir.
Oh!<eos> Excuse me, I'm just gonna have to "Oh" this out until I'm not surprised anymore.<eos> Lois, before I get mad at your dad, h-he isn't the Little Caesars guy, is he?<eos> No, Peter, we've been through this.<eos> Good.<eos> I could never be mad at that guy.<eos> He says my favorite word twice in a row.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.<eos> Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
I'll never go to prom with you.<eos> I'd rather be thrown into the ocean wearing a speedo made of meat.<eos> - Silence!<eos> - No, you silence.<eos> Don't you dare tell me to silence.<eos> Okay, then shut up.<eos> You can have the Asians back, but I wanna negotiate my own terms.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Now shut your silly little mouth, or you will never see Fred again.<eos> In fact, no one will.
It's normal.<eos> Absolutely normal.<eos> 18 covers.<eos> Here we go.<eos> You're better.<eos> I'm pleased.<eos> Your dinner.<eos> They brought it this afternoon when you were asleep.<eos> You should have woken me.<eos> I will next time.
Are you breathing easier now?<eos> I still don't want to go back to the castle.<eos> They'll want answers.<eos> My father didn't pose our marriage as a question, but I will.<eos> Do you want this?<eos> I want you, but I'm afraid.<eos> I don't want to start a war.<eos> And what if my efforts fail?<eos> What if no one supports my claim in England?<eos> Every Catholic will.
Robocracker?<eos> Does that exist?<eos> Not yet, my friend. Not yet.<eos> Oh, God, we've read your scripts before.<eos> What do you mean, "Oh, God"?<eos> You don't really do subtlety, do you?<eos> Er, subtlety can lick my balls and then eat a plate of my ass for dessert.<eos> I'll just go on Wikipedia, bosh out a plot mash-up.<eos> That's not going to work.<eos> Er, yes, it will.
Well great!<eos> So you are indulging him again?<eos> That's enough!<eos> Your son is smoking drugs and you don't even care!<eos> He doesn't just smoke them, he deals drugs as well.<eos> I should've seen this coming!<eos> Wait!<eos> You have no right to go in there.<eos> -I will have to call the police.<eos> -I'm sure you will.
Nail warned you: don't stick your nose into other people's business.<eos> Anyway, it was nice chatting with you but I'm late for work.<eos> A nose for a nose.<eos> A cellophane bag filled with white powder.<eos> Weighs around three kilograms.<eos> Supposedly heroin.<eos> -Sign this.<eos> -I'm not signing anything!<eos> -You will answer for this!<eos> -Of course we will.
You know it's not real, right?<eos> You know there's not one thing genuine about her.<eos> You know that she's not even a real lesbian, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I know that.<eos> You could have saved me some embarrassment.<eos> Scat, there is nothing real about her.<eos> - No no no, you don't know Six... at all.<eos> Why do you shackle yourself to her?<eos> Sneaky Pete will take care of you...<eos> - and so will I.
- She's my ex-wife. - Oh.<eos> Not ex for too long, huh?<eos> So you okay lately?<eos> I've been worried about you.<eos> Thanks, Annie, I'm fine.<eos> You know what I'm doing on this case?<eos> Sure, I do.<eos> You understand why I have to help them.<eos> If you don't help those poor boys, who will?<eos> Nobody will.
Technically you do work for me.<eos> Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.<eos> If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling you right now, I ain't goin' to him.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?<eos> - But listen to me, when this thing placed,<eos> - I'm gonna take care of everything.<eos> and I fuckin' say, and you tell that fuckin' piece of shit.<eos> - If he comes correct.<eos> - I will.
And with a United States military man, no less.<eos> You are a disgrace to that uniform!<eos> No, he's not a Marine.<eos> He buys those uniforms on eBay so Dad doesn't find out he's a modern jazz dancer.<eos> What?<eos> That's possibly worse than the incest thing.<eos> This is an abomination.<eos> I'm telling Todd.<eos> - No, he won't believe you.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
I ran her prints.<eos> Unless she's lost a lot of weight she was wearing someone else's fingerprints.<eos> She's good.<eos> She may be, but we have a trace on the necklace.<eos> I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E's, and, um....<eos> Selina Kyle.<eos> The databases are full of close-calls, tips from fences.<eos> She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.<eos> We should send the police before she fences the pearls.<eos> She won't.
You have to be supervising him or he has to be working for you at all times.<eos> - It's the mandate of the court.<eos> - Yeah, all right, I'll...<eos> This doesn't work for me.<eos> I'll find him immediately, all right?<eos> Yes, of course, I'm sorry.<eos> You're right, I'm sorry.<eos> Find him quickly, and you have to call me as soon as you find him or I will get on the phone with the judge.<eos> - No, no, no, that won't be necessary.<eos> - Well, I will.
I'm here, baby.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm coming back, Lennie.<eos> I'm coming back.<eos> Okay?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You have other sons?<eos> Two.<eos> And if I killed you, they will come and seek revenge.<eos> They will, for sure.
Negative, sir.<eos> Enjoy these naval exercises, Hopper.<eos> They are likely to be your last.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Is there anything I can do to help?<eos> Negative.<eos> If you want to talk about anything..<eos> I don't.<eos> If you change your mind..<eos> I won't.
I wish I could've done something.<eos> Done something?<eos> Jack, you stood up to Pitch.<eos> You saved us!<eos> But Sandy...<eos> Would be proud of what you did.<eos> I don't know who you were in your past life.<eos> But in this life, you are Guardian.<eos> But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?<eos> You will.
Eat. You'll find out.<eos> Speaking of sex.<eos> We've been married only weeks.<eos> Barely weeks.<eos> Everything is barely weeks.<eos> We have minutes to live.<eos> We don't want to start counting the times, do we?<eos> And having solemn discussions on the subject.<eos> No, we wanna do it.<eos> And we will.
We'll only attract more sharks!<eos> Please!<eos> Please.<eos> It's our only chance.<eos> Our only hope is to fix the ropes first.<eos> Tighten everything up again.<eos> Herman ...<eos> We have built a raft like Tiki did.<eos> And he succeeded.<eos> And so will we.
Come on!<eos> This way!<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> You stay right where you are!<eos> You may be dead already, but I will still shoot you!<eos> Wait!<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Son!<eos> Step away from the zombies!<eos> No, I won't.
And, of course, no matter what color a slide turns, nothing sells "scary" like a big reaction.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at that reading.<eos> Have you been in this room recently?<eos> Why are you still standing there? !<eos> Get to the nurse!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Wire it quick, Nate.<eos> Yes, I will.
Y-you're not coming home?<eos> Sharif!<eos> Answer me.<eos> Do you remember what to do?<eos> Yes!<eos> I remember.<eos> Good.<eos> I want you to secure your future.<eos> I want you to do it now.<eos> I will.
I want you to do it now.<eos> I will.<eos> Where are the files?<eos> They're at Habibi's place.<eos> Fourth shelf of the remline chest.<eos> How soon can you get there?<eos> I'll go first thing tomorrow.<eos> Good.<eos> And call me when it's done.<eos> I will.
But from now on, it is my way or the highwahahtmaa- fferrohshelechnichwa y.<eos> There has been a regime change!<eos> Yo!<eos> You are stocking the shelves.<eos> You, senile Romanian accountant.<eos> You are on the cash register.<eos> The CEO of Green World does not drive a hybrid!<eos> The chemicals in Green World produce made this boy grow tits!<eos> You promise not to steal again?<eos> I won't.

– I am.<eos> – You could use some of that.<eos> You could use some "Shut the hell up." How about that?<eos> – You just lack initiative.<eos> It's not that big...<eos> – Oh, yeah? You lack a dick.<eos> Boys, please tell us what's going on here.<eos> Well, it would seem that a Virgin Mary has appeared... in the syrup of a local man's pancake.<eos> No, it has not.<eos> Well, it will in a second, okay?
Stop. Please.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Please, help me.<eos> What the fuck is this? !<eos> Stop right there or we'll shoot!<eos> I didn't make it.<eos> I didn't make it.<eos> What didn't you make?<eos> The collection.<eos> And neither will you!
Fuck.<eos> Here.<eos> I think these should fit you.<eos> What's got into you girl?<eos> Maybe you should let her go now.<eos> Until we hear from Ethan, I'm not lettin' that one outta my sight.<eos> I already told you...<eos> He's dead.<eos> You don't know my brother.<eos> I never will.
Just dial 9 for an outside line.<eos> Yes, the IRA does continue to insist it's serious about peace, but a lot of people are going to find that hard to credit when the organisation appears to be trying to send young men and women over here<eos> to place bombs on the London transport network.<eos> And now the police have issued this photograph of the alleged bomber tonight.<eos> It is a little indistinct.<eos> It was taken from the security camera before she went into that tunnel, but they hope that someone will recognize her from it.<eos> Now, in other news, and the government is expected to give its decision later today...<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> They'll never know.<eos> They will.
Yeah.<eos> He keeps glaring at me.<eos> Pedicurist, pedicurist, pedicurist...<eos> Fuck!<eos> I'll have to quit this job soon. - Please don't.<eos> Play the gigs first.<eos> - I won't play with him on Saturday.<eos> I'll stay home.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> I will.
I-low do you feel about moving out when you're older?<eos> To a group home.<eos> When you die.<eos> - That's when you'll move out?<eos> I won't move to a group home.<eos> My home is a good place for me.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> But we'll go check out the apartment you signed up for.<eos> - No, we won't.<eos> Oh yes, we will.
Right here.<eos> You know, this lucha between you two, it's no good.<eos> Well, I didn't start it.<eos> But you ended it.<eos> And made it a lot worse.<eos> He lied to me, Ricky.<eos> You're young.<eos> You haven't met that special someone yet.<eos> So you don't know.<eos> But one day you will.
Knock knock.<eos> How about this-- You, uh--<eos> You eat up all your food, we'll get you up and out of here and go take a walk.<eos> What do you say?<eos> It'll do good to be outside.<eos> You're pregnant.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Uh, I don't really have a choice.<eos> You think it'll make a difference?<eos> Of course it will.
Nah.<eos> No one listens to me.<eos> I say it's the guys that make up the rules, the boys that always have all the answers, even though their answers always prove wrong.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> Rick's the leader of this group,<eos> - it's Hershel's farm. - Maybe we oughta change that.<eos> What, are you gonna lock 'em in a room and take their guns?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That could get out of hand.<eos> No, no, it won't.
I'm going to the bishop's.<eos> What about the curfew?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I don't need your judgment or your prayers.<eos> I won't pray for you. I'll pray for our sister's salvation.<eos> How could you get so lost?<eos> I have reasons to hate myself, but this is not about me.<eos> I must leave the region.<eos> Can you look after her?<eos> I will.
He smells so good.<eos> - No.<eos> It starts at midnight?<eos> - So?<eos> - We can be there for 10 minutes.<eos> - It's Halloween.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - He will not.
I'll be back around 1, but if you guys are finished early you can just let yourselves out. Okay.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> What time is it?<eos> I think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts.<eos> Mark.<eos> If she does arrive, she'd be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.<eos> She won't.
Make it last until the real stuff comes.<eos> - What is it, Pa?<eos> - Sit down.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> We can't go on like this, I'm an old man now.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm an old man.<eos> And this money business, Serenella's thing has worn me out.<eos> - It's just a phase, it'll pass.<eos> - It won't.
A bottle of gin.<eos> - Fuck what you've stole it?<eos> - Look.<eos> - Give me the bottle.<eos> Why?<eos> - Then you love me.<eos> - You're stupid.<eos> Come and have a drink!<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - I will not.
I didn't go in, Margaret.<eos> I... I just couldn't.<eos> Trevor...<eos> Find daddy, baby.<eos> He's over there with Mr. Benton.<eos> You really should come to the counseling group.<eos> The Union has great people for us to talk to.<eos> I can't.<eos> Really I...<eos> I will.
I'm afraid of you.<eos> – Ok alright, let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you, they're staking out all my houses anyway,<eos> I'll stay with you, until... until... you know un- un- until the hearing.<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.<eos> – You cannot drink in my house.<eos> – You cannot drink in my house. – I won't, I won't, I won't.<eos> You can't have a drink.<eos> I won't.
I will knock on their door and tell them what I told you.<eos> Maybe they will listen.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just promise me that you'll end it.<eos> Give it to Ling, And he'll get rid of it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ju-- please come back in.<eos> Stay back, Alice.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> But you will.
Yes. Thanks a lot.<eos> Dr. Tapia's here.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Yes?<eos> Why didn't you pick up?<eos> I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
Now!<eos> - I am.<eos> We'll be together soon.<eos> You've been saying that all night and you're still there.<eos> The main thing now is to get you safe.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> How can you be fine?<eos> Alex, they won't let you go!<eos> Of course they will.
Yes, it is, and now that we know the truth, there is nothing in our way.<eos> Humphrey's not the reason we're not together, and neither is the dowry.<eos> Is this about saving my life again?<eos> Because we're past that.<eos> You said you wanted to wait until your marriage was over. Now it's over.<eos> Chuck, I don't blame you.<eos> And as crazy as this all has gotten, I know why you did everything.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And I love you.<eos> I always will.
Go ahead.<eos> You don't have a case.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> The court will decide that.<eos> In the meantime, your assets will be frozen.<eos> Thank you for coming forward.<eos> I can't believe you're taking their side.<eos> I mean, they're just using you.<eos> And when they're done, they'll throw you out just like they did me.<eos> No, they won't.
I couldn't ruin Chuck's life and Nate's in the same night.<eos> Can I just ask why?<eos> Why do you do it?<eos> I only became Gossip Girl recently, and--and right now it's the only thing I have.<eos> I mean, it's--it's the only thing in my life that I can hold on to, you know, because a lot of times my life is just really out of control.<eos> Well, I get that, but you're doing exactly what was done to you and to everyone else.<eos> Yeah. I mean, I was hurt, sure, but I survived.<eos> A little adversity can actually be good for you.<eos> You'll see how things work around here.<eos> No, I won't, actually.
You should be happy for me.<eos> If you say so.<eos> But Vanya say same thing about "Warcraft,"<eos> and then D.S.L. bill come...<eos> Yes, of course everything's set for tonight.<eos> There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I hope that's not overconfidence I hear in your voice.<eos> I don't need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is.<eos> If anyone finds out...<eos> Jack, they won't.
How?<eos> It's not specific to this place.<eos> It's my brother's.<eos> Access all areas.<eos> I, um, ahem, acquired it ages ago.<eos> Just in case.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> We'll get caught.<eos> We won't!
What?<eos> Of course you should tell me.<eos> Of course you should tell me.<eos> - She hasn't been feeling too well.<eos> Her stomach's... she's okay, and then she's not okay.<eos> City General will only treat people without insurance, so...<eos> - Is that... you need money?<eos> Mom, you need to tell me if you need money.<eos> Look, I can help.<eos> I will.
- I'm not usually much of a drinker.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I think I might be a bad person.<eos> - You're not a bad person.<eos> I think you're a beautiful person.<eos> I got a letter from my mom yesterday.<eos> She told me that I let her down.<eos> - Did you write her back?<eos> - No.<eos> No, but I will.
It is a complicated matter.<eos> But didn't you say you could talk some sense into him?<eos> I can, and I'll be happy to.<eos> But I also know how much Mr. Krrayer loves you.<eos> He won't give you up without a fight.<eos> Mr. Kroyer is a great man, a famous and highly decorated man.<eos> Whom will people believe?<eos> Him or a woman leaving him for another man?<eos> - I thought you wanted to help me.<eos> - I will.
- It's on the desktop.<eos> Even if I have to hang up, you should still be able to track the phone - as long as it's still powered up.<eos> - Good.<eos> That is brilliant, princess.<eos> You're a genius.<eos> - Are you hurt?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> I'm just scared.<eos> Please find me, Daddy.<eos> - We will, sweetheart, we will.
Forgive my appearance, Your Eminence.<eos> We have worked long hours without sleep and-<eos> I only care about your work, Signor Vittorio.<eos> The fate of all of us depends on it.<eos> This is true artistry.<eos> I'm pleased it pleases you, my lord.<eos> And there are- Ninety-five more like it making their way from other foundries as we speak.<eos> Ha!<eos> Perhaps our fragile illusion will yet have substance.<eos> It will, my Lord.
Yes, it is.<eos> This "X."<eos> Park the truck on it now.<eos> And what if I don't?<eos> Oh, it's your ass, not ours.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Okay, so now they've got our truck and our plans to break in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happens if they don't drive it in?<eos> They will.
Yeah.<eos> My brother just chopped off someone's head.<eos> It's not right.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> He's 16 years old.<eos> He shouldn't have to live like this.<eos> Elena...<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> I have to fix it.<eos> We will.

Looking for Lilith in all the wrong places.<eos> Well, you're gonna help us with that.<eos> If things are about to get messy, maybe you should meet the owner of this fleshy temple...<eos> A puppy of a man.<eos> You'll like him.<eos> Jeffrey?<eos> Jeffrey, is that you?<eos> No.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> We will.
Personally, I don't think it's fair to ask a thing like that.<eos> It's very self-serving.<eos> I agree.<eos> Mm-hmm. I think you're just going to have to go with your gut on this one, Charlie.<eos> - Go with gut.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Got it.<eos> Oh, um... have you had a chance to talk to Stuart... about Santa Monica cop-- if there's a part that I could read for?<eos> You know, something small, of course.<eos> No, but I will.
You just said Marilyn the musical like "Marilyn, the Musical."<eos> I didn't say it like anything, I'm saying like it's not a bad idea if someone were looking for ideas, which you, are not.<eos> - Oh how would you do it?<eos> - Oh, for crying out loud!<eos> - Don't get mad at me!<eos> - I don't know, you could do scenes from the movies, you could have a big group theatre number.<eos> You could've a baseball number.<eos> That's what Tom said.<eos> That's great, Mom.<eos> I will.
Most of my life, yes.<eos> Long time.<eos> I just can't imagine eating...<eos> I think... that we have just found our first opportunity to award some money tonight.<eos> Iris.<eos> I would like for you to eat the steak and the foie gras.<eos> I really would.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> You can...<eos> But you won't.
Well, allow me to thank you for your bravery and your service.<eos> Really.<eos> But, um, yeah, that said... opening your mouth was a big mistake.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> So.<eos> Cover the walls and the... area around the table.<eos> Wait, what are you guys doing?<eos> That was incredibly stupid, Travis.<eos> I will fuck that guy up if I get the chance.<eos> But you won't.
I guess it's time to call Boreanaz.<eos> Aw, wh's wrong, Punkin?<eos> Shannon, I'm so, so glad this is happening for you,<eos> I am.<eos> I don't think Will wants to marry me.<eos> For God's sake, Amelia it's 2012.<eos> If you want to marry Will Suester, ask him.<eos> Will<eos> I love you so.<eos> I always will.
You.<eos> Oh. Great.<eos> It's a date!<eos> I mean, you know, metaphorically speaking.<eos> Not like a real date.<eos> Just like, you know, you're gonna be there and I'll be there.<eos> So we'll meet there together.<eos> I'll see you Saturday, Jane.<eos> Yes, yes, you will!<eos> Or you won't.
You volunteered?<eos> They need me.<eos> You know, Joanie plays the accordion.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is somebody here?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I fell asleep.<eos> Well, it's time to go home.<eos> I will, in a bit.
It doesn't.<eos> I tried to crack that nut.<eos> I mean, if anything, I should be jealous.<eos> But I look at you and I feel like, I don't know,<eos> I'm getting to experience my first time again.<eos> It's a good day for me.<eos> This is as good as this job gets.<eos> Savor it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I will.
Why do they get to decide what's going to happen?<eos> They just do.<eos> So enjoy your lunch.<eos> I'll see you after.<eos> I have to get my box.<eos> Do you really wanna come back here and do this again?<eos> - I'll bring it home. - ( Elevator dings )<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> You will.
- Who?<eos> - My husband, of course.<eos> Shake some reaction out of that great lump!<eos> Do you happen to have a cigarette?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now look here, don't be obtuse, Tietjens.<eos> Dammit, man, is the department's duty to support Waterhouse and make his case to the house. Do you understand?<eos> Minister has to show the figures for the insurance bill will balance.<eos> Well, they won't.
How many hours you got left?<eos> Six months.<eos> But your momma's not a big-shot lawyer getting you and your pals community service for tampering with evidence.<eos> I thought you said they killed somebody.<eos> That's what the cops think, but the cops can't prove it.<eos> Cops are stupid.<eos> - We didn't do anything.<eos> - Don't talk to them.<eos> I'll talk to anybody I want to.<eos> - No, you won't.
Her father says no.<eos> I have to give her something.<eos> I'll give it to her.<eos> You go home and wait for her to ring you.<eos> OK?<eos> Here...<eos> Tell her I did my best, and tell her that Alo helped me cos he does computer shit on his PlayStation.<eos> All right.<eos> And tell her that you're a mean old cow who probably never gets laid.<eos> I will.
'Alex.<eos> Right.<eos> 'How you getting on?<eos> You all set for the move next week?<eos> ' Yeah.<eos> 'Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Remember to label everything.<eos> 'D'you hear me Alex? '<eos> Yeah I will.
Well, miss a fucking class!<eos> This is important!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll sort it.<eos> Course.<eos> And Franky!<eos> You need to tell her.<eos> Tell her I'm coming home!<eos> Tell her I...<eos> I will.
That wretched animal is going to have to live downstairs!<eos> These came.<eos> From Persie.<eos> "Beloved sis.<eos> Make sure you spoil her.<eos> Smacking kisses, Persie."<eos> It's rather ingenious, sending flowers from Berlin.<eos> You wait.<eos> You'll get the bill from Constance Spry tomorrow.<eos> I won't.
Yes, I fear so.<eos> Sorry about that, too.<eos> Leave me out of your next deception.<eos> Oh, that's a shame.<eos> You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception.<eos> My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade.<eos> I would see him released.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.<eos> No, he won't.
Bitch!<eos> - Shut up. - Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What exactly are you celebrating?<eos> You left the truck behind.<eos> So what?<eos> So what?<eos> So what if they find prints?<eos> And what if they trace it back to the wrecking yard?<eos> They won't.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means we're gonna hit you where hurts, right in the...<eos> Cinnamon rolls.<eos> What?<eos> George, that geyser on your lawn caused extensive water damage to our driveway.<eos> And, sadly, we're gonna have to have the whole thing repaved.<eos> Ooh, that sounds expensive, George.<eos> Oh, it will be, and if George doesn't pay for it, we'll sue.<eos> - Don't want to.<eos> - But we will.
Which is horse shit you can leverage.<eos> All right, let's go get this money.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna take a stroll so I get a feeling for the corporate culture.<eos> All right, good afternoon. Galweather real quick, I'll take care of it from here.<eos> And this is my mobile.<eos> You can call me whenever you want. See what happens.<eos> - She won't call<eos> - See what happens.<eos> - She won't.
A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.<eos> I'm sorry, Your Grace.<eos> You're right, I'm stupid.<eos> Of course you'll be in the Vanguard.<eos> They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest.<eos> And he is only a pretender.<eos> Your brother's turn will come.<eos> Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.<eos> Some of those boys will never come back.<eos> Joffrey will.
They told us to wait out here.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's in room 803.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, hey, um,<eos> I wanted to give you guys something.<eos> Uh, made this for the baby.<eos> Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.<eos> Yeah. Thank you, Lip.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Did it show him at the bar where your second victim was the night she died?<eos> Harris has a cab.<eos> And he asked for two keys to that motel room the night he raped Gwennyth.<eos> And Harris didn't drug her.<eos> Well, how do you know for sure Stroh did?<eos> He's using your fascination with him to get his client off.<eos> You want Harris to walk?<eos> I want 'em both -- Harris and Stroh.<eos> I won't give up one to get the other.<eos> And Baldwin will.
This lady's a doctor.<eos> Poisoning's a very personal crime.<eos> We all have our gifts.<eos> Mine was for chemistry.<eos> Your gift left 70 people dead.<eos> And I sincerely regret my actions.<eos> I'm much improved.<eos> I would not, nor could I, hurt a fly or any other creature.<eos> Johnny thinks he's at a parole hearing, that his answers will buy him freedom.<eos> They won't, Mr. McKee.
Andrew.<eos> Wait.<eos> Catherine, why are you trying to keep me out of my bedroom?<eos> You were about to take a bath in our tub, weren't you?<eos> Even after Siobhan explicitly told you the master suite was off limits.<eos> I-I'm sorry, Andrew.<eos> I just...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I won't tell her.<eos> You won't? No.
You don't have a shot.<eos> One.<eos> He will do it.<eos> Drop the gun, guy.<eos> Two.<eos> Hauser, don't.<eos> Three.<eos> I know you don't want me here, and it doesn't matter to me that you think you deserve this, 'cause you don't.<eos> You're my blood, and I won't leave you here alone to rot in this hellhole.<eos> I will not.
What?<eos> Love you.<eos> I don't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You said I would always be in your heart and that is too cruel a fate.<eos> Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else.<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
I got your text.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Follow me.<eos> David, you're scaring me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is you're late, and the wine's getting warm.<eos> We have to stop doing this.<eos> We just started doing it.<eos> We have to figure out what we're doing.<eos> We will.
Well, so how many do you need to sell?<eos> Like 1,000.<eos> How many did you sell last year?<eos> Forty-two.<eos> Ask your landlord to cut you a break.<eos> Mr. Gold doesn't offer much leeway.<eos> Mr. Gold's your landlord?<eos> If we miss a payment, we're out.<eos> And then he'll reassign us. And we'll have to leave Storybrooke.<eos> No, you won't.
It's nothing.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I wasn't looking where I was going.<eos> But he says he's fine.<eos> I'm fine, papa.<eos> Really.<eos> Are you sure, Bae?<eos> Yes. I'm fine.<eos> Well, I suppose it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Hmm?<eos> Jimmy's dad Lloyd, he, uh..<eos> Good night.<eos> Night.<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> Are you gonna leave?<eos> No.<eos> Everybody always leaves.<eos> I won't.
Can I make you a grilled cheese?<eos> You can make me one.<eos> Where's Lip?<eos> (Both grunting, panting)<eos> God, you're so fucking hot.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.<eos> (Both grunting, moaning)<eos> Shh. I don't want Ian to hear us.<eos> He won't.
Fatima has failed to understand that what the judge says has to take precedence over her profound need to talk to her family.<eos> She gets it now.<eos> I've explained it to her in no uncertain terms.<eos> If you grant her bail, I'm sure she won't let anyone down again.<eos> Bail is refused.<eos> But I'm going to bend over backwards to help Ms Ali.<eos> I've had another trial collapse this morning.<eos> Is there any reason why this trial can't start tomorrow?<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Will you?
Competition?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> High quality heroin.<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> This bag left the Ali house with the younger brother after the unfortunate incident with the bottle and before the arrival of the emergency services.<eos> The 24 minute gap.<eos> They're all over it - fingerprints, DNA.<eos> Bag and contents.<eos> I won't ask how you...<eos> No, you won't.
- What's this?<eos> - It's progress.<eos> - Nine digits?<eos> - You work in intelligence.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> For once, I'd like you to handle one of these meetings while I lurk in the shadows.<eos> You couldn't lurk if you tried.<eos> That number we gave her...<eos> It better pan out.<eos> It will.
Investigating date.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, if Pullbrook died after Reggie then his heirs get the money.<eos> If he died first, then I do.<eos> But that's absurd.<eos> What right have his heirs to inherit anything?<eos> Darling, what right have I?<eos> Frankly, what difference does it make?<eos> I shan't keep it if I get it.<eos> Well, actually, you will.
I mean, nothing was secure.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> We could all die tomorrow.<eos> We could, Ginger. For sure.<eos> We could. - Bella.<eos> - Well, she's right.<eos> It is getting serious.<eos> But I don't want to die.<eos> I want to grow up and do things.<eos> And you will, honey.
- Why not?<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> You can't stop a war if there's going to be one.<eos> It's in the hands of God.<eos> That's convenient.<eos> Whose hands are you in then?<eos> Just wait.<eos> He'll dump you too when you're older.<eos> No, he won't.
I looked through the Book of Shadows, but there's nothing about contacting ghosts.<eos> You want to speak to the dead,<eos> I think I have just the thing.<eos> Nothing's happening.<eos> This is so lame.<eos> We're witches.<eos> It should work.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But...<eos> Maybe this will.
This is me.<eos> So you're leaving tomorrow?<eos> At the crack of dawn.<eos> But I was thinking I'd come back.<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, this place isn't exactly Buenos Aires.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But there is a lot more to Chance Harbor than the guidebooks suggest.<eos> Well, then you should come back.<eos> Well, then I will.
What are you talk-- No, Joe.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do, and you should know that better than anyone, Steve.<eos> When your father died, there was nothing you wouldn't have done to find the man who killed him.<eos> It's the same with Wo Fat.<eos> He's driven by revenge.<eos> Nothing is gonna stop him from coming for me.<eos> Okay, fine, so we find him first and we take him down, Joe.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> One day, we will.
No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do, and you should know that better than anyone, Steve.<eos> When your father died, there was nothing you wouldn't have done to find the man who killed him.<eos> It's the same with Wo Fat.<eos> He's driven by revenge.<eos> Nothing is gonna stop him from coming for me.<eos> Okay, fine, so we find him first and we take him down, Joe.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> One day, we will.<eos> We will.
And the more he didn't jock me, the more I jocked him?<eos> That's you, except with a sad, middle-aged, weirdo poetry teacher with B.O.<eos> Did I just receive a lesson in human nature from the least human person I know?<eos> Yeah, you think about that, beeyotch, because I see it sinking in.<eos> I want you to make love to my wife.<eos> Fred, digging' the goatee.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I can't.<eos> I-I care about you as a friend, but I can't.<eos> I won't.
- What could he have died from?<eos> - Hunger, thirst, malaria.<eos> So the wind won't take it away.<eos> Rocco, come and see the sun.<eos> Rocco, come!<eos> Leave me alone, I want to sleep.<eos> Go to N'Dula on your own.<eos> - I'm not going home on my own.<eos> - We'll never get there.<eos> Yes, we will.
I've been doing a bit of pro bono financial work for the Kid's Leukaemia Foundation.<eos> It's CFO by default.<eos> It's one of Clover's little pets, I said I'd help sort out.<eos> Things have gone a bit pear-shaped, and I thought I'd employ your smarts from the get go.<eos> I don't do commercial law, mate.<eos> No, no, this is criminal.<eos> OK.<eos> Oh, look, I... borrowed a bit from the Foundation, purely as a loan.<eos> I haven't had a chance to pay it back yet.<eos> I will.
It's either exact or it's inexact.<eos> The combination of the two words doesn't make it either more right or more exact.<eos> That's very true, isn't it?<eos> Alastair?<eos> Eyes up. Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lincoln is going to let you know when we have a date.<eos> I've given Mr Emery the date.<eos> Oh. There's no trial date yet.<eos> OK, then I won't.
Marine.<eos> Nice.<eos> 20 years.<eos> So, if we get you a new I.D., will you give housing another try?<eos> Another try?<eos> Give it another try?<eos> Another try?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll -- yeah.
I'm sorry too.<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> It's not fair!<eos> They were so happy!<eos> It's gonna be OK.<eos> It's not gonna be OK.<eos> Why did they break up?<eos> They were meant for each other.<eos> They'll find love somewhere else.<eos> No, they won't!

Then there's me.<eos> What can I say.<eos> I'm me, I'm 18 and I can do anything I want.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh hi.<eos> At 8.<eos> - Oh, right. I can't today.<eos> - I thought we agreed.<eos> - My boss is going to kill me if he finds out.<eos> - No, he won't.
- Oh hi.<eos> At 8.<eos> - Oh, right. I can't today.<eos> - I thought we agreed.<eos> - My boss is going to kill me if he finds out.<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> My 25th birthday is once a year and I want you there.<eos> - I'm gonna miss it this year...<eos> - No, you won't.
Come on!<eos> Do you recall this?<eos> My body pressed against yours?<eos> You trembling helpless, as you tremble now --<eos> I am far from helpless.<eos> You think this makes difference?<eos> My death will not heal the scars you bear.<eos> Nor erase memory of my cock inside of her, or all those that followed.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
Russell Edgington's dead.<eos> Oh, those motherfuckers.<eos> You mean they never told you?<eos> Never told me what?<eos> God, I wish there was somewhere else to eat in this town.<eos> I'm with you there.<eos> I've been friends with him my whole life.<eos> Why don't you just go talk to him, then?<eos> Why don't you just go talk to her, then?<eos> - Maybe I will.

What?<eos> ! You're living off your savings?<eos> but I'd better start working soon.<eos> y'know. don't we?<eos> What's a nursery school?<eos> Huh? Why don't me or Ame go to one?<eos> that's because...<eos> I wanna to go to one too!<eos> You can't! {RAME! }<eos> I will! {IKUUUU!

My heart's still beating like crazy.<eos> why'd you hide?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's like an ocean out there.<eos> Feels like we're going to sink into it.<eos> Are we gonna live here in secret forever?<eos> Not like we have a choice if our parents don't show up.<eos> Why?<eos> Your mom will definitely show up.<eos> She won't.
Give it up for Ann!<eos> Good choice.<eos> Leslie, I don't know the first thing about running a political campaign.<eos> Ann, you beautiful tropical fish.<eos> You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.<eos> You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> - You haven't?<eos> - No!<eos> You will.
That's a big decision, but there's work we need to do on the ending.<eos> So don't leave town.<eos> No tweeting.<eos> Keep your cell phones on.<eos> This is a moving target.<eos> I'm going to church tomorrow to say a prayer.<eos> Church?<eos> That sounds really nice.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Maybe I will too.
- Okay...<eos> Holly, I'd like you to meet my client, Kevin Tyler.<eos> He plays for...<eos> Yeah, I know who he plays for.<eos> He plays for... - New York. - New York.<eos> Yeah, I'm a big fan of... - Basketball. - Basketball.<eos> I'm sorry. I just don't... Get out much.<eos> I was going to say, "follow sports."<eos> Well, maybe you should check it out.<eos> Maybe I will.
You work at opposite ends of the building.<eos> You barely see each other.<eos> It's not about seeing each other.<eos> It's about his methods costing me $1.2 million.<eos> If you'd like me to go somewhere else,<eos> Diane, just say the word.<eos> No, David.<eos> You will stay here because we leave you alone.<eos> Somewhere else will leave me just as alone.<eos> No, they won't.
I'm never gonna see you again, am I?<eos> If you'd like to plan a vacation to some friendly, non-extraditing country, I'd be happy to set up a weekend for you.<eos> It hurts.<eos> It's real.<eos> I get that now.<eos> We're not gonna get that 1.6 million, are we?<eos> When the courts release it, it will go into your account for about nine minutes, and then it will mysteriously disappear.<eos> Don't try to stop it.<eos> - We won't accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
Okay.<eos> Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.<eos> Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.<eos> His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him.<eos> His 60-foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12.<eos> Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten.<eos> She has.<eos> Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.<eos> Don't.<eos> I won't.
Like maybe he was a serial murderer or something.<eos> If he's a serial murderer, then Carl's a serial murderer.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Uh, delivery. I ordered some clear soup.<eos> Clear soup?<eos> That's not a thing.<eos> It is a thing.<eos> It is a thing.<eos> Tell your clear soup hello for me.<eos> Okay, I will.
And now I do actually see your point.<eos> Krieger, go!<eos> Á¡Vamonos!<eos> Damn!<eos> Krieger can't outrun anything with all that handicapped shit.<eos> I gotta go after them!<eos> But this conversation is not over!<eos> You'll never catch 'em.<eos> Yes I will!<eos> No you won't.
Some what what?<eos> Couscous.<eos> It's healthy.<eos> Looks shit shit!<eos> Don't worry about anything for Dermot, I have a pesto pasta salad.<eos> I'm after cooking some Superquinn sausages!<eos> No.<eos> The salad's better for him.<eos> He'll have the sausages!<eos> Oh, no, he won't!
- Sorry.<eos> - Oh, that's too bad.<eos> Professional gross foot would really put us over the top.<eos> Hey, Boo.<eos> You know, that blister would be a lot more disgusting if it popped.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> All right, well, good luck. Gah.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Text me with the winner.<eos> Okay, we will.
What?<eos> What?<eos> You know something.<eos> What?<eos> All I know...<eos> I know Karen Stillworth, the head of the committee.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You have got to give me your word that you do not repeat this.<eos> I won't.
What?<eos> You know something.<eos> What?<eos> All I know...<eos> I know Karen Stillworth, the head of the committee.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You have got to give me your word that you do not repeat this.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
These men are dangerous.<eos> I-I can't go back to them with nothing.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.<eos> Look...<eos> Maybe there's a way we could help each other out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well... I could give you enough information to keep your bosses happy.<eos> What if the other cops find out?<eos> They won't.
I'm a pathologist.<eos> This is my colleague, Harry Cunningham.<eos> Hm.<eos> Did someone tell you we were coming?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ha-ha.<eos> We want to ask you some questions about your son, Arnold.<eos> Don't... don't tell him I'm here, will you?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We won't.
Break it up!<eos> Break it up!<eos> Back to work, Ronnie.<eos> I'd like to speak to Warden Swickle, please.<eos> Happened again, Arturo attacked me.<eos> I've filed several complaints.<eos> I don't know why the state keeps sending maximum prisoners to minimum security facilities just to ride out their last year.<eos> It's like throwing snakes in a hamster cage.<eos> Feel free to file another complaint.<eos> - I will.
What's wrong? !<eos> Here you go.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Are you sure you're going to be all right, Grandpa?<eos> I'm fine. I just slipped.<eos> I think we should take him to the hospital.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> No, everything is just fine.<eos> April's going to take you to school.<eos> Yeah... I will.
All I could see was the endgame.<eos> All that money.<eos> The shit with Tara, me lying to you, just part of the mission.<eos> insult you by trying to say I'm sorry-- there's too much damage for that-- but your involvement with John's death...<eos> the stuff he says about you... in some of those letters...<eos> I take that to my grave.<eos> I-I don't expect you to... forgive me.<eos> But at least I'll know I did one right thing.<eos> I love you, Gem.<eos> I always will.
Hey, Matt.<eos> Matt.<eos> Hey, there, buddy.<eos> What happened to Jenny?<eos> I'm guessing that she went back with her brother.<eos> Do you think Ben loves the rebel Skitters more than us?<eos> Ben doesn't love the rebel Skitters.<eos> He just needs to fight with them... to protect us, to protect you.<eos> But what if when he's there, he realizes that he likes them more?<eos> He won't.
- You could teach.<eos> Me?<eos> Teach?<eos> No no no no no.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - No no no no. I don't teach.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So your plan was to drag me to the accountant to show me how much money we don't have and then do absolutely nothing about it.<eos> You want me to do something about it?<eos> I will.
Well, my husband was supposed to pick me up at 6:00 but he can be such an idiot.<eos> I'm sure he can.<eos> Where did you go to school, Devin?<eos> I had the best education in the world.<eos> Private kindergarten where I got straight check marks.<eos> Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals.<eos> Year abroad on an all-male catamaran.<eos> Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence.<eos> I had every educational advantage, Jack.<eos> Just like my children will.
Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> You sure it won't hurt him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's good for him, to be touched.<eos> Okay, I'm just going to try this and see how it goes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can get into bed with him.<eos> I'll mess up his lines.<eos> No, you won't.
But now, after this, I really don't give a shit about you anymore.<eos> You might not have my memory, but you better remember that.<eos> What the hell did you say to Daniel?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What matters is I don't ever want to see Mike Ross in this office again.<eos> - Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
You gotta take me from an "A" cup to a "D"?<eos> I realize that this is a lot to take in right now...<eos> No, this is ridiculous!<eos> Richard and I were friends for ten years before we hooked up.<eos> It took 10 years and a 120 pounds.<eos> Then he finally saw me in that way.<eos> And now you want to mutilate me.<eos> Doug, I really think that you...<eos> He will leave me, Dr. Reid.<eos> Maybe not right away, but he will.
Okay, look, okay, but you... you made it work.<eos> You always do.<eos> The patient is fine.<eos> Look, you can't control everything.<eos> I know you want to.<eos> But you can't, okay?<eos> Is Meredith all right?<eos> I don't know how to talk to her, Richard.<eos> Will you talk to her?<eos> Yeah, I will, I will.
No.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell us about Mallory.<eos> I'd gone home.<eos> Whenever he books a 5:00 p.m. audition, I just have to stay and greet, and then he lets me go.<eos> Okay, we're going to need a list of all his five o'clocks.<eos> Eddie's going to be upset.<eos> He doesn't have to know.<eos> If your boss is a good guy, we won't find anything.<eos> No, you-- you will.
The department -- they wouldn't have thrown you under the bus.<eos> It's an accident.<eos> It could have happened to any of us.<eos> You go back in to the investigator.<eos> You tell him you were served with divorce papers, and you had a bad day.<eos> - Had a bad day. - Yeah,bad day.<eos> I had a bad day.<eos> You go back in there, and you tell him the truth.<eos> Or what?<eos> You will?
I want my work.<eos> I spent so many hours working on that, and we broke up because of the work, so...<eos> I just want to take it with me to whatever stupid job is gonna ruin my life next.<eos> We own the work product.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You know what?<eos> I hope to God that when we die, our "work product" doesn't flash before our eyes.<eos> But for some of us, that's all we have.<eos> All right, if she releases all future claims...<eos> She will, she will, all right?
My advice is plead guilty and ask the judge for a psychiatric report upon yourself.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> Will a report do any good?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> Can't do any harm.<eos> Will it help reduce his sentence?<eos> No.<eos> It might.<eos> It won't.
Just when I'm here.<eos> Isn't that gig reserved for uniforms or retirees?<eos> Martinis are only three bucks.<eos> Marshal.<eos> Forgive me for saying this, but I think you could be doing a whole lot better.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Set me on a course of self-improvement?<eos> You want me to get to the point?<eos> I'd just as soon you'd get the hell out.<eos> I will.
I guess it is.<eos> And it's not a gay holiday.<eos> Oh.<eos> No. It's not a gay holiday.<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> I wouldn't know... I...<eos> Uh...<eos> I'm kind of new at...<eos> You're going to help me plan the wedding, right?<eos> Of course I will.
Lots of people don't.<eos> Children don't take these things well.<eos> He can't forgive me. Thinks it's all my fault<eos> But it was because of all the debt.<eos> He played slots.<eos> OK, I have to go.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Went and drowned himself, the bastard... and now we have to live with it.<eos> See the psychiatrist tomorrow.<eos> We will.
Really? - Mom.<eos> Tessa.<eos> She wants to know what's up for the weekend.<eos> - Tell her you're hanging out with me. - She'll spend the weekend hiding in the handicapped stall of the girls' room.<eos> We need to find someone to hook Tessa up with.<eos> Would you like to sleep over tonight?<eos> I don't think my mom would allow that.<eos> Of course not. Ha, ha.<eos> I just don't want him to lose interest.<eos> I won't.
Threats?<eos> No.<eos> Then why should I get hurt?<eos> I don't mind worrying myself sick over a grandson, a teenager.<eos> That's life.<eos> But to worry myself sick over a forty-year-old daughter, that's not fair!<eos> Y'all right, Mrs M.<eos> Hello, Martin.<eos> Look, she's got to knock it on the head.<eos> She won't.
Hello!<eos> Insurance papers...<eos> Ok, seems like we have everything we need.<eos> - Do I pay when it's ready?<eos> - No, you pay now.<eos> - Will it take long?<eos> - Look, I'll go to the cops after the weekend.<eos> The paperwork takes three days.<eos> So it's going to be a genuine inspection certificate?<eos> Of course it will.
I've been reading Klyuchevsky's books on Russian history lately.<eos> "The least propitious condition for the organization of government in the Moscow state seems to be the attitude of the Moscow tsar towards his primary means of administration, the Boyars."<eos> Do you think I still have a chance to fix things?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I will do everything I can.<eos> Great idea. Show who's the boss to all those who think they're above the law.<eos> I'll help you out with the media so they'd provide truthful coverage.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hope, of course, that your region will support the state policies.<eos> - We certainly will.
Baxter.<eos> What did she say then?<eos> Why did she say my name?<eos> Where's out money?<eos> We know where it came from.<eos> It's drug money.<eos> Yes?<eos> We're not drug dealers.<eos> No. Then if you stole it, how do you know the person you stole it from won't come after it?<eos> They won't.
The other bow.<eos> The one on her costume.<eos> We arrested the wrong man.<eos> What?<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> So you're saying Darren didn't do it?<eos> Well, he's guilty of blackmail, but that's as far as it goes.<eos> So what if the killer's still out there?<eos> What if he comes after me?<eos> He won't.
Yeah, look, that's our address.<eos> That's where we live, right?<eos> Are you sure you didn't know about this?<eos> Yeah, Frankie, I was just keeping it a secret so I could surprise you.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Mike, we can't have a wedding at this house.<eos> I'm too ashamed to even open the door for the UPS guy.<eos> You've gotta talk to him.<eos> Relax.<eos> I will.
Shit!<eos> I told you to drop your gun!<eos> Drop your gun!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Get behind me, girl!<eos> Don't shoot, Max!<eos> Please!<eos> Your colleague isn't injured. He's just unconscious. That's all.<eos> Slowly put your gun on the floor, and the girl and I will leave.<eos> No, you won't!
Yeah, well, she can be very persuasive.<eos> Yeah, speaking of which, she wants to persuade you to come back over there and finish your charts.<eos> To be honest, it sounded more like a friendly threat.<eos> All right, tell her I'll be back at the Clinica tonight, uh, but I got to go.<eos> Are you proud of yourself?<eos> What I did in there wasn't personal.<eos> It's science.<eos> It's my job as a doctor to tell the truth.<eos> Well, I hope you can sleep tonight.<eos> 'Cause we won't.
I'm a compulsive gambler.<eos> And those dots aren't connected?<eos> Let me explain.<eos> You had a drink.<eos> You gambled.<eos> You lost your company.<eos> I know, it was stupid.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> What I should do is walk through that door and make you live with this.<eos> Well, you won't, will you?
No, th--<eos> - Magnificent. - Superb.<eos> - Riveting.<eos> - Outrageous.<eos> Insulting.<eos> Disgusting.<eos> Don't let it ruin your evening.<eos> - I'm--I mean, I won't.<eos> - No.<eos> - I won't.
I'm doing just fine.<eos> I had nothing.<eos> Are you trying to impress me?<eos> With nothing?<eos> I don't remember you impressing that easily.<eos> I don't remember being impressed at all.<eos> I need copies of last night's poker room security footage.<eos> - I can't give you that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> And you will.
Lucky. Lucky.<eos> You get everything you need?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He was very forthcoming and very sweet.<eos> And had a lot of nice things to say about you.<eos> About me?<eos> You sure?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> You'll have to wait for the article.<eos> All right, I will.
You OK?<eos> It was very cold at the cemetery this morning.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> My dad cried.<eos> It's OK to cry when you're sad.<eos> Did you cry when your mum died?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I wasn't much older than you are now.<eos> Could you wake me up when you come home?<eos> Of course I will.
Chop-chop?<eos> - Here we go...<eos> - Uh yeah, it means hurry?<eos> C'mon, we got a chopper to catch, tie him up!<eos> You do it.<eos> Okay, I see what you're doing here.<eos> Hands behind your back, Calzado.<eos> Make me.<eos> I -- look, she will shoot you!<eos> No I won't.

For now.<eos> Loyalties forged in apprehension and mistrust are tenuous at best...<eos> Easily broken when held up to the unforgiving light of the truth.<eos> But in the darkness of our most desperate hours, it's often these loyalties that lend us the strength to do what we know must be done.<eos> You should have heeded my warning.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What happened on the beach?<eos> The boy was going to expose you.<eos> You won't get away with this, Tyler.<eos> Sure I will, but Emily won't.
Those are private cars, ma'am.<eos> What do you mean, "private?"<eos> I mean they're not -- Not for you to be knocking on!<eos> Now I have to insist that you -- Get yer panties untwisted!<eos> - Damn... Wh-?<eos> I knew it!<eos> I want this train stopped immediately and this stowaway forcibly disembarked!<eos> Afraid I can't do that, ma'am.<eos> You can and you will, or I'll have your job!<eos> No, she won't, George!
- I'm afraid so.<eos> What on earth does he think it will buy him?<eos> Just stop.<eos> I beg you. A Princess does not cry.<eos> - Don't make me go.<eos> - The Prince of Castille is a wealthy man, Joan.<eos> Why can't I marry an Englishman?<eos> Because Spain will give you a crown, and us an ally against France.<eos> I'll never see you again.<eos> Of course you will.
Dr. Sloan...<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> Th-this is sexual harassment. You know that, right?<eos> I think of it as sexual encouragement.<eos> Think about it, Kepner.<eos> Take one for the team.<eos> You got her the grant money.<eos> Look, I know you did.<eos> You have to tell her. It'll help things between you guys.<eos> - No, it won't.

Oh, man.<eos> This is it. You're bringing it.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You're finally taking the big leap in front of the bus.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking, uh...<eos> Yeah, maybe dinner tomorrow night, someplace quiet, romantic...<eos> Look, take it from me.<eos> The where doesn't matter as much as the who.<eos> - Well, if you need me...<eos> - I won't.
Shmuel Meir, son of Abraham Nehemias Helmer.<eos> Learner...<eos> What you could do is get to work. We haven't got all night...<eos> Why are they here?<eos> Two more and we're done...<eos> Βless you, my children.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's going on, Father, is these two Yids here are stealing church property, and we won't have it.<eos> No!<eos> We won't!
But it's not about the money.<eos> I just want to know what he's gotten himself into.<eos> Well, uh, I could talk to him, but, um --<eos> Oh, if you could, that would be amazing.<eos> Yeah, I got this thing with Mike I got to do though, and...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do it -- real fast.<eos> Not that I don't love doing you a solid, Sam.<eos> It's just I told Mike I'd help with the Rebecca thing.<eos> And we will.
So you're not moving, huh?<eos> No, and neither is Shea or Lloyd.<eos> Okay, he was my mentor when I first joined the marshals.<eos> And the only deal I made with him is confidential informant money in exchange for tips.<eos> Your months off are still protected as long as you catch this runner.<eos> Why couldn't he just call you?<eos> Why'd he have to drive down here and see you in person?<eos> I'm saying this in a non-confrontational way.<eos> Well, he wasn't supposed to.<eos> And he won't anymore.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The only thing that matters to me now is that you can have a happy life.... for both of us.<eos> Will you please do that for me?<eos> Tomorrow morning I'll find a new car and then... I'll leave.<eos> I want to come with you.<eos> You can't, Lorraine.<eos> We'll have tonight.<eos> I'll go get some food.<eos> No, I will.
It makes you look a creep.<eos> I don't have strong feelings about vegetables, really.<eos> Oh, you should.<eos> You're at that age.<eos> Surprisingly captivating, agriculture.<eos> I'm not really ready to watch my garden grow just yet.<eos> I was hoping you would say that.<eos> Have you ever had one of those days when you get up, look at everything you've got, and then you panic?<eos> Cos you've got no safety net if everything goes tits up?<eos> It won't.
The Secretary is gonna try to unseat Garcetti in the primary.<eos> Says who?<eos> If you say "high level" source, you can just, you can pack your stuff right now.<eos> First-person... inside the Hammond family.<eos> This is real, Alex.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I haven't been able to get confirmation, but this was the perfect opening.<eos> Tipping her off builds trust, puts me deeper in the inner circle, and gives me a front seat to the political story of the decade.<eos> Unless she takes the spot on the court.<eos> Which... she won't.
12.<eos> It's the golden number.<eos> Does your cult have a name?<eos> Why is there so much ignorance in the world?<eos> You live your lives divorced from the land and its bounty.<eos> You fill your bodies with chemicals and poisons each day.<eos> You worship a Messiah who vanished 2,000 years ago.<eos> Maybe you're the cult.<eos> I think I'll go now.<eos> No, you won't.
Only one day.<eos> I-I-I can't wait that long.<eos> Bring Mr. Morris in.<eos> I want to have a chat with him.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Brenda, you have to go back to work at this hour?<eos> Mama, I am so sorry, but I've got a deadline.<eos> Hmm, I thought since Clay was feeling better, you and I could have a little talk.<eos> And we will.<eos> We will.
His father is a convicted felon, and his guardian is psychologically fragile.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> And I'm not just his guardian, I'm his mother.<eos> Legally, we got married.<eos> When?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Oh.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You still have to tell Abel that I'm his mother.<eos> Or the court will.
It's about you and Peter.<eos> Eli, can we do this later?<eos> We're meeting with Donna Brazile this afternoon.<eos> She is going to decide if Peter is the keynote speaker at the Democratic Convention.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> Hey, I am a good campaign strategist.<eos> But I need to know if you're divorcing Peter.<eos> Donna Brazile will not agree to the keynote - if you are.<eos> - She won't...?
So, um... what do I do?<eos> Well, Julius Cain and I would like you to join us in voting Will out.<eos> I'm embarrassed to say, I used to be a heavy smoker.<eos> I'm embarrassed to say... I still am.<eos> You're kidding, Your Honor.<eos> You're killing yourself.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> My wife says she's kicking me out unless I quit.<eos> Have you tried the patch?<eos> No, but I will.
I... Who is this?<eos> FE Construction.<eos> You wanted me to reissue a check.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I said I'd get back to you, though.<eos> I know, but you didn't.<eos> So I decided to call you.<eos> Okay, um, let me get all my ducks in a row, sir, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Sir?<eos> No, you won't.
Moved to the outskirts of Paris, March 1940.<eos> Died... June the same year.<eos> Killed with both her parents... in an air raid.<eos> Would you forgive me if I asked you to go?<eos> I... I can't move.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, I need you to.<eos> No.<eos> No, Randall, I won't go.<eos> I won't.
George was there.<eos> And where were you after 7:30 last night, Harry?<eos> I was alone.<eos> Contemplating.<eos> These are dark times, Inspector.<eos> The Kali Yoga Cycle.<eos> But it will be followed by the Cycle of Light.<eos> The Age of Aquarius.<eos> Jeremy and Peter won't be here to enjoy it.<eos> Oh yes, they will.
- "Hacked" is such an ugly word.<eos> And we have two more CCs.<eos> Chad Colombo, 40, a welder, unlikely to bear a child.<eos> And Claudia Cruz, 20, receptionist in the head office.<eos> Claudia Cruz.<eos> Checking.<eos> Employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show.<eos> Get me an address.<eos> I'll go and talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.
All right, call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> - It's too much.<eos> - Would you relax!<eos> This is still peanuts.<eos> We could move up to ten million before anyone else starts asking questions.<eos> Well, I'm not so sure.<eos> I think it's all happening too fast.<eos> What if they realise why we buy what we do?<eos> They won't.
Bodies change, honey!<eos> Bodies change.<eos> - Oh no, Mabel.<eos> - Mabel's not here.<eos> - She's in sweater town.<eos> - Are you gonna come out of sweater town?<eos> All right.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> - If you can't break up with Gideon, than I'll do it for you.<eos> - You will?
I am having sex with my husband, Ruby.<eos> What is it?<eos> Walt just called.<eos> There's a situation at The Red Pony.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let him figure it out.<eos> It's your day off.<eos> I'm all he's got.<eos> I flew home especially to see you.<eos> And you will.
I'm gonna find out what happened, Lori.<eos> I'm not gonna give up.<eos> I can see this was a good idea.<eos> You look like you need a drink.<eos> Yeah, or five.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Bottled brew for the lady.<eos> Uh... actually, can I get a double scotch, neat, please?<eos> When do you get the test results for the exhumation?<eos> We won't.
We're waiting for a doctor.<eos> We could use your help over here.<eos> Okay.<eos> LaGuerta knew I was lying, Dex.<eos> Wait, wait, let me think.<eos> What?<eos> This is bad, Deb.<eos> I don't wanna fucking hear you say that.<eos> You always say that you can fix it.<eos> I will.
But that is a good idea, Angela.<eos> I should make a list.<eos> Oh, come on, Pete.<eos> God, that's just sad.<eos> If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years doing nothing.<eos> Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.<eos> Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire?<eos> That means it is literally impossible for anyone to fall off.<eos> So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole,<eos> - I will?

There is no way out of it!<eos> We all know the drill...<eos> You feed or you die.<eos> There is no door number three.<eos> I was ready to die.<eos> I was supposed to die, I don't...<eos> I don't want...<eos> I can't be a vampire!<eos> If there's something that Bonnie can do, we have to try it.<eos> We will.
The whole council knows who we are now.<eos> Everything's about to change.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure Damon has a revenge plan cooked up.<eos> We'll figure out a way to deal with it.<eos> Stefan, you don't have to convince me that everything's going to be OK.<eos> I know.<eos> Wish I could, though.<eos> Wish I could just tell you that you'll never feel pain.<eos> That you'll never crave blood.<eos> But you will.
Oh, don't worry about me, sunshine.<eos> My family came to say their good-byes the first two times.<eos> "We love you.<eos> We'll miss you."<eos> It--it was sweet, but I've heard it.<eos> I told 'em not to bother this time around.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.<eos> I will. Okay.<eos> But I won't.
You know what would be even funnier?<eos> If you and mom raised your own kid.<eos> That'd be hilarious.<eos> Why do you guys need Carmen?<eos> Why does anyone need Carmen?<eos> Because she's amazingly helpful.<eos> Because Carmen can easily do things that exasperate most white people.<eos> Well, I hope I grow up to be like Carmen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You won't.
I didn't mean to kill him.<eos> But you did.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> I watched him die right in front of me.<eos> But I'm gonna spend the rest of my life making up for it.<eos> You know?<eos> If you can help me out, I promise, I'm gonna make it up to you and the whole damn world.<eos> Hand to God.<eos> I will.
You still think I'm using you.<eos> To get to Evans?<eos> I don't care if you are.<eos> We don't know where he is.<eos> So the best way to stop him is to rescue his family.<eos> Except you don't know where they are, either.<eos> Yeah, you got me there.<eos> Why didn't they send you after Knox?<eos> He's our key target.<eos> Maybe they will.
Give us a minute.<eos> Still doesn't make sense.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'll live.<eos> You should be in hospital, Mia.<eos> I've broken more bones and spilt more blood than this before.<eos> I like you a lot, Ben.<eos> But it could never work.<eos> Why?<eos> It just won't.
What are you gonna do?<eos> I am going to zap the tissue and see if the muscle contracts.<eos> We're looking for the four c's in here.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> Contractility, capacity to bleed, consistency, and color.<eos> I'll tell you right now that color is not good.<eos> It's not contracting, either.<eos> All right, local debridement around the abscess<eos> - is not gonna work.<eos> - And what will?
I have to go.<eos> (CELL PHONE RINGING)<eos> No, I have to go.<eos> (CELL PHONE RINGING)<eos> And I don't like your friends, either.<eos> They're not nice.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> They're still my friends.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
I mean, she's gonna find out.<eos> Quinn's not gonna find out because I've destroyed every piece of evidence that you and I were ever a couple.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.<eos> You replaced me with a tiger.<eos> I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you.<eos> But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.
That's the memo that Harvey's been accused of burying.<eos> You know, the fact that you would even accuse me of that makes me sick.<eos> But if you still don't believe me, fine. See for yourself.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> I found it in the file room that day.<eos> It has my date stamp on it--mine.<eos> We have to tell Harvey.<eos> He'll know what to do.<eos> No, he won't.
We're on our way now.<eos> That's not much time.<eos> Come on, man, you're CIA; you don't need time.<eos> You keep us alive.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
This isn't over yet, Pete.<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> Mr. Caffrey, do you deserve to be free?<eos> That's not for me to decide.<eos> I won't sit here and give you some monologue about how reformed I am.<eos> Actions speak louder than words, and, hopefully, my actions while in service to the FBI say more than I can.<eos> And what would you do with your freedom?<eos> Well, I can tell you one thing.<eos> I won't be going anywhere anytime soon.<eos> You won't?
Open the door.<eos> Katie.<eos> You're late.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> I have to.<eos> I am going to kill him.<eos> You said they would call.<eos> D.B.?<eos> You said they'd call.<eos> They will.
Forget about what you cannot do.<eos> Concentrate on what you can do.<eos> And tonight, that should be looking after Amanda, not slagging her off for stepping up to the plate.<eos> Tonight, she needs you.<eos> Took your time!<eos> Am I worth the wait?<eos> Amanda, listen.<eos> I swear I won't say another word about you volunteering.<eos> Yeah, you will.<eos> OK, I probably will.
But now, after this, I really don't give a shit about you anymore.<eos> You might not have my memory, but you better remember that.<eos> What the hell did you say to Daniel?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What matters is I don't ever want to see Mike Ross in this office again.<eos> - Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
That's it.<eos> You got a thing for mommy.<eos> And now it all makes sense.<eos> Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--<eos> Point, Tanner.<eos> I'll see you in court, Harv.<eos> So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny. But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
How do you know I'm going to have a girl?<eos> Just a hunch.<eos> Lily, I'm going to ask you to do something dangerous.<eos> I need you to trust me.<eos> Yes, okay.<eos> He's ready.<eos> Say what you will about Kellog. He's very resourceful.<eos> You know, I could get suspended for pulling a stupid stunt like this.<eos> I'll take the heat if anything goes sideways.<eos> Damn straight you will.
We can take you anywhere you want.<eos> Yeah, I need to go to fucking Arizona.<eos> Are you gonna take me to fucking Arizona?<eos> !<eos> No, I didn't think so.<eos> Now put down the gun, and toss over the keys.<eos> I don't have the keys.<eos> God dammit I am not fucking around here!<eos> I will open this motherfucker up!<eos> No you won't.
I waved him away from this.<eos> Kate Reed waved someone away from the truth?<eos> Leo, I swear to God, I would love to see somebody hand this company their ass on a platter, but I did not tell him to put his life in jeopardy.<eos> Okay, how long?<eos> Uh, he said he'd be out in 30 minutes.<eos> Since he called, it's been 20.<eos> If he steals corporate evidence and gives it to us, does that make us accomplices?<eos> No, Justin said that he's protected by the whistle-blower act once he gets the evidence in authorities' hands, and we would be too.<eos> But he just has to make it out.<eos> He will.
The real Dean never would have expelled us.<eos> He loved us.<eos> Unfortunately, love is not admissible evidence.<eos> Oh... ♪ Love is not admissible evidence ♪<eos> I'm working on a cop opera.<eos> Cop-ra!<eos> Police-ical!<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll get some proof.<eos> No, you won't.
But he'll talk to me.<eos> And as a matter of fact, he wants to do it where he and Carmen met that day.<eos> So he admitted he was with her.<eos> Emilio, he admitted it six years ago.<eos> He made a statement to the California police right after she disappeared.<eos> But his father had it sealed, because he was afraid that it would incriminate him.<eos> He was right to do it, too, with your side pulling out your torches and pitchforks.<eos> Final autopsy results will be in tomorrow.<eos> They'll tell us all we need to know.<eos> No, it won't.
We went out a couple of weeks ago for drinks together.<eos> And he told me... he's worth more dead than alive to his family.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, Dad, I know what you're gonna say.<eos> This kid, he's just looking for answers to why his old man died, and he felt like nobody would listen to him.<eos> I know it looks like an open and shut case of suicide, but I just couldn't say no to the kid, you know?<eos> I wish you'd understand.<eos> As the commissioner, I can't.<eos> As your father, I won't.
Still, it's a reason.<eos> Don't worry, you have another woman protecting you.<eos> I would need a wall of women to be protected from you.<eos> I'm not alone anymore either.<eos> Thanks to them, we can talk again?<eos> And see each other, now that we're well protected.<eos> I won't ask if you're happy with her.<eos> No, don't ask.<eos> - You won't ask me if I...?<eos> - No, I won't.
Is this your excuse for taking extreme measures to keep me from Dylan, because you didn't try hard enough to keep me from Amy?<eos> I don't need an excuse.<eos> At this point you should be able to see that that's not a healthy relationship for you.<eos> I think maybe the problem is that you went from doing nothing and giving me complete freedom to choose who I want to be with to being a prison guard.<eos> I'm trying to smooth things over with you here, so...<eos> So what?<eos> Nothing has changed.<eos> I'm still standing here getting a lecture and I still can't go out with Dylan.<eos> But believe me, I'm gonna find a way to see her.<eos> You probably will.

Mase...<eos> We talked about this.<eos> She's not... she's...<eos> She's not coming home.<eos> She's dying.<eos> That w what you said last time in Seattle, but then the doctors fixed her.<eos> Right, but, Mason...<eos> They can't help your mom there any more.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> Somebody will.
Scrap the segment.<eos> They'll say we didn't have anyone defending it.<eos> Let's prep them the best we can and have Will carry them, okay?<eos> He'll just carry them.<eos> I'll go and tell him.<eos> - I should be the one to tell him.<eos> - Maggie--<eos> - He's gonna fire somebody.<eos> - God knows he should.<eos> - He will.
I'm saying that if you can allow for that possibility, it could keep a family together.<eos> And that is how you can help your son.<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> Maybe Jane is right.<eos> Maybe I'm not the kind of person to start a business. No, no, no!<eos> That's what my mom would call "stinkin' thinkin'."<eos> For the first time since I gave up acting, I finally feel like my life has a direction, a meaning.<eos> We don't need Jane to help us start a business.<eos> You and me, we'll come up with the money.<eos> We will?
He, he could be the murderer, Booth.<eos> He already admitted that Bartlett was suing him.<eos> Just hold my feet.<eos> No.<eos> Fine, then, as previously stated, I will act as the free agent that I am.<eos> I'm not sticking around here to watch her kill herself.<eos> One move and I'll shoot you.<eos> Oh, Bones, no.<eos> Don't drop me.<eos> I won't.
Yeah, you just...<eos> Didn't mention how different he was.<eos> Different than who?<eos> Or is "different" code for "young"?<eos> No. I... I don't have a problem with his age.<eos> Mom, did you tell him yours?<eos> We've been very honest with each other.<eos> Okay. Well... It's a good start, I guess.<eos> We'll talk. We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
He might have mentioned it.<eos> And I might have said that you felt the same way.<eos> Aria!<eos> I'm sorry, but this is new territory for me.<eos> I mean, he basically said he's only got eyes for you.<eos> What I am I supposed to say? "Sorry, buddy, don't get your hopes up. My mom is dating half of Rosewood." Shhh!<eos> He really said that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, I just think that if you see this going somewhere, you should just be straight with him before it's too late.<eos> I will, I will.
It's really dark out.<eos> ( Distant foghorn )<eos> I'll find my way.<eos> You better wear your jacket.<eos> It's cold out there.<eos> ( Gasps )<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You scared me half to death.<eos> Not really...<eos> But I will.
Mr. Ferguson.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mr. Durant don't need you.<eos> Like hell he don't.<eos> He asked for me himself.<eos> And he's paying me.<eos> Just like he pays you.<eos> Only difference being, I don't got to kill nobody.<eos> So when you coming back?<eos> Maybe I won't.
I want to thank you for trusting me with the future of this firm.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Let's get back to work.<eos> Harvey... a word.<eos> I know that we have a rocky history, but I would be a fool not to recognize your value to this firm.<eos> You don't need to blow smoke up my ass.<eos> I'm not blowing smoke.<eos> I told you this from the day I came back, that I was us to find a way to work together.<eos> Why say this to me and not Jessica?<eos> I will.
Hey! Hey, stay away from him!<eos> Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.<eos> This isn't about the money.<eos> I just want justice for my father.<eos> Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed.<eos> Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
Hey, listen.<eos> My guys-- they found the Escalade.<eos> And the dude is there.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll get her home.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't know anybody was in here.<eos> Otto, huh?<eos> We're gonna have to say something to each other - sooner or later.<eos> - No, we won't.
Morning.<eos> What's all this?<eos> That, uh, pediatrics practice in Providence made me an offer yesterday.<eos> Wow.<eos> Are they okay with the hand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd finish the rehab up there.<eos> They need a neonatal specialist.<eos> If... we can get through this Otto mess.<eos> Which we will.
I can help you with that.<eos> When is Agent Cameron coming in?<eos> She said 20 minutes when I talked to her...<eos> That was 35 minutes ago.<eos> It's nice that the boys at Section Six let her come down, work here full time.<eos> It's not their usual protocol.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't know.<eos> And I'd like to know why this Section Six hasn't been filing reports about this task force with my office.<eos> Well you have to ask her when she gets here?<eos> I will...
No, you're absolutely right.<eos> But if you don't cooperate, you're gonna be absolutely dead.<eos> Where's Adanan Al-Ahmadi?<eos> I know no such man.<eos> You recognize these men?<eos> Friends of yours?<eos> I don't think he's taking my threat seriously.<eos> You Americans are very good at making threats.<eos> But you do not know the true meaning of jihad.<eos> Your friends, however, they soon will.
Uh, the "special powers."<eos> "Nature's got a frozen memory."<eos> - Remember?<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> But I didn't think we'd make some sort of connection to a fucking vampire.<eos> The elders are gonna be furious about this.<eos> I don't give a twirly fuck about your elders.<eos> What I care about is this vampire.<eos> So we gotta find him and make him pay for what he did.<eos> And we will.
- Yeah. It's not often you get to see a show where the lead puts the play under her pillow to "absorb" the part...<eos> Which is why I brought this.<eos> You're up, Mike.<eos> Oh. Here we go, buddy. (Gun clicks)<eos> Looks like one hole, but it was five bullets.<eos> All right, I gotta go.<eos> Oh, hey, you can't leave yet.<eos> The kid needs you.<eos> He'll crumble without you.<eos> No, he won't.

Was he married?<eos> No.<eos> But he meant something to you.<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> Why did you come home, Kitty?<eos> I told you already.<eos> I just needed to get away for a bit.<eos> Tell me what you did... to lose your job.<eos> Nothing.<eos> The city of "I will."
Yeah, he's looking good.<eos> You know they found something on his brain?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah. He's had a scan and some tests.<eos> He gets his results tomorrow.<eos> You all right, Bob?<eos> Yeah, better now I'm not in there. Ha-ha! Ta.<eos> It's t'dogs.<eos> What happens if it comes off the wall?<eos> It won't.
Beverages and canapes.<eos> Uh, but, you could stay for dinner.<eos> They could stay for dinner, right, Dad?<eos> We should talk.<eos> We should all talk.<eos> I don't think so, Ben.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, uh, we'll take care of it.<eos> And, uh, I'll get back to you.<eos> One of us will.
The fella next to him didn't even flinch.<eos> Doesn't even break a sweat.<eos> We know he's ex-military, but still...<eos> His name is Matthew Downs.<eos> That's what he told Rossi and he wasn't lying.<eos> History shows dishonorable discharge from USMC in '04.<eos> Hi, Will.<eos> You see that?<eos> I want to do it again.<eos> We will.
I was on the boat, remember?<eos> No.<eos> We were just...<eos> We were part...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... - Winter Olympics. Uh-huh.<eos> - No.<eos> 2006. Bobsled.<eos> Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now, but I promise you, you're going to find someone better.<eos> No! No, I never will.
Can't imagine your wife would be too happy if she found out, so you made sure she didn't.<eos> What are you talking about, affair?<eos> Yeah, I knew Mandy.<eos> So did my wife.<eos> We were friends.<eos> That's all.<eos> You really expect us to believe that, Reggie?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask my wife.<eos> Oh, we will.
What?<eos> Some cops came by the shop looking for you.<eos> - They say what for?<eos> - No, no.<eos> But Marty gave 'em your address.<eos> So what?<eos> We're not there.<eos> Well, they sure as hell know about Hayden, and they knew to look at the shop, so you might want to be a little more concerned.<eos> We have to finish this.<eos> We will.
The trouble is, we just tried that, and he just blew us off.<eos> Eh, I don't mean he was being rude.<eos> I mean he literally blew us off the roof.<eos> There's gotta be some way to get the drop on him.<eos> Actually, it's a little not by the manual, and Artie would be pissed, but--we may have a solution.<eos> Jesse!<eos> Look, I'm unarmed.<eos> Okay, I-I don't want to hurt you, I just-- I just want to talk.<eos> Have they started surgery yet?<eos> They will.
You did me a favour.<eos> I needed an excuse to tell him where to stick it.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I asked a question.<eos> I asked Stuart if he'd help me.<eos> Do what?<eos> We need to talk in private.<eos> Bit difficult, cos this house is becoming like a drop-in centre!<eos> I think I'll just go...<eos> No, you won't.
In the meantime, we'd like you to accompany us down to the station.<eos> What about Stacey?<eos> That's why Philippa's here.<eos> I don't want to leave her.<eos> We could take her to a residential home...<eos> I don't want that!<eos> Or if you have any relatives that live nearby?<eos> I don't have anyone.<eos> We can look after her.<eos> No, we won't.
There's no m-more magic here, and I don't want to spend my last moments this way.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> F... for what?<eos> For being happy?<eos> For finding your true love?<eos> For your happiness, I would gladly give my life.<eos> My only regret is that I won't live to see you marry Snow.<eos> Shh.<eos> Yes, you will.
!<eos> Woman: [ crying ] No, I said I won't.<eos> - I'll kill you.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> - I swear I will.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> Will you tell?<eos> Jane: It's not Artie.<eos> It's Jonathan.<eos> I won't.
- Hey, she's not going anywhere.<eos> - It's a cop.<eos> That's a hell of a way to get out of an interview. Did you hear who it was?<eos> No.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> You saw...<eos> we're not looking good.<eos> - We'll get through it.<eos> - No.<eos> No, we won't.
These rich kids, they're into everything these days.<eos> Drug arrests have doubled in the last six months.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... thanks for your help.<eos> Uh, what about blood spatter?<eos> Did you find any on the beach or on the suspect?<eos> No.<eos> But w-why would I even look?<eos> I mean, we got the guy.<eos> Yeah, I-I'm sure we will.
Where is he?<eos> I told him you were in the cafe.<eos> He's waiting for you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I... I'm not here to threaten you.<eos> You being here is a threat.<eos> Everything's going to be fine, Zoe.<eos> So long as you bring her to me.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> Oh, you will.
I just wonder if there's something they know that they're not telling us.<eos> It's weird, isn't it?<eos> We're really not good at being friends until something goes wrong.<eos> Yeah, we need to learn to be better friends.<eos> Thank you guys for coming.<eos> I'm so glad you guys are here with me.<eos> So, the doctor let Jack's parents go in with him.<eos> I don't know what's going on, but I guess they'll come out and talk to us as soon as they can.<eos> I wish they'd find the guy who did this.<eos> They probably won't.

It's not working, is it?<eos> We're not talking, but we're both still thinking about it.<eos> You heard what Mr Shapiro said, he wouldn't do it if he didn't think you had a chance.<eos> A chance.<eos> What's the percentage, eh?<eos> Nobody wants to talk about that, do they?<eos> You've got to have a positive attitude, love.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> If anything goes wrong...<eos> It won't.
I hope it goes well in Wales.<eos> Thanks, Bob.<eos> I've bought a house and I don't owe anything' to anyone any more.<eos> I suppose it's made me sort my life out though.<eos> I don't think winning the Lottery's changed me... it's the people around me what's changed.<eos> What time's your taxi coming?<eos> I don't know,<eos> I don't care.<eos> Once you get to St Lucia, you'll forget all about me.<eos> I won't.
Suddenly, I was Mayor Lavon Hayes.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, sometimes I feel... adrift... myself.<eos> Well, I,<eos> I better go.<eos> What?<eos> My grandpa has me on a curfew.<eos> I know, it's humiliating, but...<eos> Good night, Lavon.<eos> Don't take these without food, and if it happens again, just give me a call.<eos> Thanks, I will.
You know that's true.<eos> Dad... there are more kids like me out there, kids who had their harnesses removed but still had their spikes, serving with other resistance units.<eos> Someone has to reach out to them, convince them that the Skitter rebellion is the best chance we have --<eos> How can you be so damn sure?<eos> When that Overlord invaded my mind, he couldn't keep his thoughts completely walled off.<eos> He...<eos> Two-way street.<eos> I saw, felt...what these aliens are all about.<eos> We have to beat them.<eos> We will.
- Do you have any cash?<eos> Look at me...<eos> I'm not even wearing any underwear.<eos> - Where would I put cash?<eos> - I'm not wearing any underwear either.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> She'll show you her tits if you give her some ice cream.<eos> - I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
What did they say?<eos> Tanner's done.<eos> I just...<eos> I couldn't let her do it.<eos> If she'd have fallen, I never would have forgiven myself.<eos> It's OK now. OK?<eos> She's at the medical center.<eos> They'll get this all straightened out.<eos> Lauren will never forgive me.<eos> Yes, she will.
But my six hours are up.<eos> And I understand your disappointment.<eos> Now, your arguments for pursuing this course are more than valid, but I'm afraid we're at the point where the risk outweighs the reward.<eos> The risk, Mr. Mayor, is in allowing political considerations to get in the way.<eos> This is not a purely political decision, Frank.<eos> I know it's not.<eos> We'll agree to disagree, Commissioner.<eos> Mr. Mayor... if you go out there on TV and announce this to the public, those three terrorists will burrow so far underground, they will come out on the other side of the world.<eos> Good. And hopefully, they'll stay there.<eos> No, they won't.
But... that doesn't mean I will not get the information out.<eos> It will make it harder to get to it, but it will come out.<eos> Who's the little girl?<eos> Who's the little blonde girl?<eos> She's helping you- the little blonde girl.<eos> How can this small child be helping you?<eos> What is her name?<eos> She's amazing, Peter.<eos> There's just so many things that I want to tell her and so many things that I want to ask her.<eos> You will.
Just go!<eos> - I mean it, go!<eos> - Perhaps you should go.<eos> Oh, Mama.<eos> You are being tested, and do you know what they say, my darling?<eos> Being tested only makes you stronger.<eos> I don't think it's working with me.<eos> - What shall we do now?<eos> - There's nothing we can do beyond removing all signs of a wedding and holding her hand while she recovers.<eos> She will, of course.
I say "weaker" and "less disciplined".<eos> Well, if her Ladyship is prepared to visit Crawley House, I dare say you won't object when I do.<eos> I won't forbid it because I have no right to do so.<eos> But I do object, with every fibre of my being.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> I never thought of you as a woman with no standards.<eos> I wish you'd come back to the drawing room.<eos> I'd only set your mother's teeth on edge.<eos> She'll come through it.<eos> She will.
His grandfather was a farmer.<eos> In a small way.<eos> Which means he has more practical experience than Jarvis ever had.<eos> Think of the child.<eos> You cannot want your only granddaughter to grow up in a garage with that drunken gorilla?<eos> Don't we owe this to Sybil?<eos> I'll do it on one condition.<eos> No, two.<eos> First, Matthew must agree.<eos> He will.
There's not much I don't know about cricket.<eos> You make me quite nervous.<eos> So with you, me, James, Alfred, both you hall boys, that makes six from down here.<eos> I can't play, Mr Carson, but I can keep score.<eos> Good.<eos> Very good.<eos> So, with his lordship, Mr Crawley and MR Branson, we're already ten.<eos> What about you, Mr Barrow?<eos> I think I'll be gone by then.<eos> Yes, you will.
Know what you're going to wear?<eos> Nothing good, that's for sure.<eos> I'll keep an eye on the place.<eos> Oh, don't say you're not coming.<eos> I-I thought you could drive us.<eos> There is no need for impertinence, Edna, thank you.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I'm happy to drive them.<eos> But who'll stay here?<eos> I will.
Well, it appears we'll have a number of questions from the jury this time.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I said shut the door.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You are really pissing me off.<eos> You're so stupid.<eos> Why do you hurt me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Yeah.<eos> See, that's a "c" word.<eos> I've been through this routine before, doc.<eos> I really think we should just leave that one alone.<eos> You need a C.T. scan.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Todd...<eos> Seriously, just-just drop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
- Hey!<eos> This is not okay, doc.<eos> You understand?<eos> I got nothing else in my life.<eos> Nothing!<eos> You need to get back in that bed now.<eos> He's rattled by the surgery.<eos> It's normal.<eos> Would you like me to order restraints, Todd?<eos> Because I will.
Ice cream.<eos> Ice cream.<eos> Ice cream!<eos> So, what was that back there?<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it didn't look like nothing.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight, okay?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> We will.
Brother...<eos> Brother...<eos> Mordred?<eos> Arthur...<eos> Emrys.<eos> Lie still.<eos> Much blood has been shed this day and all for something few wise men would ever want.<eos> You mean the Diamair?<eos> Morgana never found it?<eos> And she never will.
And...<eos> That's the year Montgomery was married-- May of 1981.<eos> How many of these watches could possibly have been sold in five months?<eos> Javi, I can't do what you're asking.<eos> I took a bullet for you, Cass.<eos> You forget that?<eos> I can't tap into the D.O.D. database without authorization.<eos> I'll lose everything, man.<eos> Only if you get caught.<eos> And you won't.
Duck!<eos> Pete!<eos> Get the dagger out of here.<eos> Go, Mykes, go!<eos> I got it.<eos> - I don't wanna shoot you.<eos> - I will kill you if I must.<eos> You missed.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But I won't.
Dad. Dad!<eos> Just get away from him.<eos> How many deaths have been recorded? We don't know.<eos> We think it could be a third of the population.<eos> Kate, I have to find the wormhole. But the attacks could still happen.<eos> Tell the world.<eos> Tell them how to deal this.<eos> The world needs your leadership right now.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Yeah, of course you will.
Thank you.<eos> Coma arousal therapy.<eos> You're the one that suggested it.<eos> Where did you find him, clown school?<eos> Well, he was highly recommended.<eos> You know what? I don't know why I'm explaining myself to you.<eos> You're not the one here every day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> and I am not attacking you... what I see is that Charlie is not waking up.<eos> He will.
Got the gift?<eos> Red John in there? Mm-hmm.<eos> Our fake deaths were a ruse to trap Red John, and it worked.<eos> What if you and I were friends?<eos> Imagine the life we could lead.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> You're gonna break down and you're gonna tell us everything you know about Red John.<eos> You're gonna sing like a bird.<eos> No, lover.<eos> I won't.

She's all yours.<eos> Folded?<eos> Well, that's not like them.<eos> You want her or not?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Uh, we need to go soon.<eos> That's all for now, Nicola.<eos> But I want you to know we're gonna do everything we can to bring whoever did this to justice.<eos> Yes, we sure will.
So, any ideas about Lisa?<eos> I never have any idea what to do for Lisa.<eos> To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument<eos> I don't really care for, it's so hard.<eos> I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, because it doesn't work for me.<eos> Marge...<eos> Marge. Hm... Marge, take it easy.<eos> It's just human contact.<eos> I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
Just kidding, I'm fine.<eos> Nature calls.<eos> Gentlemen, bathroom?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nicholas?<eos> I've got the number.<eos> Text it to me.<eos> Let Carrie go first.<eos> Text me the number, then I will let her go.<eos> No, you won't.
We're so happy that you're here.<eos> What the hell, Steve?<eos> They didn't know I was coming?<eos> We didn't know it was spring break. [Chuckles]<eos> Okay, thanks, everybody, for coming.<eos> I'm so sorry you all have to go home.<eos> Hey, Red Vines anyone?<eos> We're a Twizzlers family.<eos> Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this.<eos> Yes, we will.
What are ex-sisters-in-law for?<eos> Chili cheese fries with jalapenos. Hmm.<eos> That's a cry for help if I've ever seen one.<eos> I don't know what hurts worse, this or getting shot with a curare-laced bullet.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> Definitely the bullet.<eos> You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this, but...<eos> I don't think love is about changing or saving a person.<eos> I think it's about finding the person who's already the right fit.<eos> One day you will.
2006.<eos> Amanda, you need to know these details.<eos> Mason's gonna try to confuse you with these questions.<eos> How am I supposed to tell him I paid for all this?<eos> A generous patron from the club.<eos> I've written down specifics about him, too.<eos> Though hopefully, you won't have to go there.<eos> What if he doesn't buy it?<eos> What if he starts digging deeper?<eos> He won't.
Hmm?<eos> To you, Prince Regent, wouldn't it be fine, as long as you get what you want.<eos> Dr Jin!<eos> Dr Jin!<eos> What happened?<eos> Got hit by an arrow!<eos> One moment.<eos> It's a penetrating wound!<eos> I'm sorry but please bring some water!<eos> I will.
Because you're an angel sent from heaven?<eos> I want to bury my head in the safety of your bosom.<eos> Because Mrs. Buckminster is here.<eos> The search is over.<eos> Mrs. Buckminster, we just need to know your salary.<eos> Oh, delightful!<eos> Well, my weekly fee is...<eos> There, there.<eos> I'm sure you'll find someone you like just as much.<eos> No, we won't!
No, stop!<eos> No, she's my baby!<eos> She's mine!<eos> Dia Nobile, you're under arrest.<eos> You can't arrest me.<eos> I'm her mother.<eos> I put everything together in a folder.<eos> It's on the dresser. Just look at it.<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
People think it's killing that I like, but murder's just an act.<eos> It's all about the anticipation, the planning.<eos> Watching you and your daughter taking a walk, you and Beckett making love...<eos> Standing in your living room, being inside your life,<eos> knowing that I'm gonna take it all away from you... that's what I like.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> What are you gonna do, you gonna tell 'em that I came here?<eos> You think that they're gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?<eos> Beckett will.
You think that I'd let you live after everything you've done?<eos> Castle!<eos> Come on.<eos> I want you to watch.<eos> I want you to watch as I take her life.<eos> Over here.<eos> The water's pretty murky.<eos> Haven't seen anything yet.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
No.<eos> You want someone dead, go ahead.<eos> Kill me.<eos> I'd rather die anyway then end up as one of your sired little bitches.<eos> Don't tempt me, little wolf.<eos> Your existence is to serve me.<eos> To please me.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm sorry. I won't fail you again.<eos> No. You won't.
Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.<eos> What's your excuse this time?<eos> No excuse.<eos> It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath.<eos> So this one's on God.<eos> That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.<eos> My religion's kinda loosey-goosey.<eos> Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.<eos> Howie, you promised you'd move.<eos> And I will.
On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.<eos> Welcome to Long Island, Tex.<eos> Amy deserves better.<eos> You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them.<eos> She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.<eos> Yeah, that she is.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm a callous egomaniac.<eos> She's gonna leave me.<eos> No, she won't.

Oh, displaying some leadership.<eos> Let's let him say 98%.<eos> I take it back!<eos> Take it back!<eos> Put today's bill on Yoon's account.<eos> You capricious...<eos> But why didn't you call Teacher Seo?<eos> Yeah, tell her to come so we can open the liquor she has reserved.<eos> I'll try to call her.<eos> No, I will.
Please have a seat over there.<eos> Why are you sitting here?<eos> Rok Oppa invited me and asked me to make it a better party.<eos> Yea, I did.<eos> Why are you standing? Sit. Sit.<eos> It's been awhile, after we first met.<eos> Yes. Have you been well?<eos> You didn't contact Ji Yeon ssi after that day?<eos> You exchanged numbers that time.<eos> We will after today.
No, we can't.<eos> Game over.<eos> Go home, Liv.<eos> I am not...<eos> You can't just leave.<eos> You can't just disappear forever without saying good-bye.<eos> (Voice breaking) I can't just never see you again.<eos> - Huck.<eos> - I won't leave without saying good-bye...<eos> I won't.
Things don't always happen for a reason, Graham.<eos> I was alone all that time, and you were scared.<eos> And I don't believe that that's the way things were supposed to be.<eos> We were supposed to be together, have our entire lives together.<eos> So I can't just sit back and be okay with you losing the one thing that can get me my 30 years with you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He's just a little scared.<eos> You're damn right I am.<eos> - You don't screw this up.<eos> - We won't.
Marshall, come on now.<eos> I'd like you to do a duet to help bolster the reputation of a fellow Edgehill artist.<eos> Who?<eos> Are you kidding me? !<eos> We've been through this.<eos> The answer's no.<eos> It's not a request.<eos> Well, I don't take orders.<eos> Then I'll be releasing your greatest hits album immediately.<eos> Like hell you will.
No time.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Will and Diane would like us to come back.<eos> It's the Bill Maher thing.<eos> That's what we're thinking.<eos> So sorry, Mr. Agos.<eos> Well, you should, uh, go and... we'll talk soon.<eos> Dad, call me.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will.
Oh, forget it!<eos> Get the dinghy!<eos> Captain, there seems to be a problem with the buffet.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Uh, yup. Ooh, I love this song.<eos> Marilyn?<eos> ! Marilyn...!<eos> Ugh! Marilyn, are you okay?<eos> ! I found your eye, but I couldn't get the money.<eos> But I will.
Biba, I am begging you.<eos> I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing, like I did. Walk away.<eos> I doubt Rex will want to be with you anyway when he finds out you're not even the mother of his child.<eos> He hasn't even got a child.<eos> He'll hate you when he finds out all those years of lies.<eos> It's unforgiveable, darling.<eos> You'll destroy them.<eos> I've worked so hard to keep them safe. Biba, if you care about either one of them, you will not tell them the truth.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I won't.
We're Special Agents David and Gibbs with NCIS.<eos> I want my mom.<eos> Her mother's in an aircraft carrier on the Arabian Sea.<eos> Jenni's Navy...<eos> like Dave.<eos> We'll get her back as soon as possible, okay?<eos> What about our Rosie?<eos> Your Rosie's mom?<eos> You're gonna get her back, right?<eos> Of course they will.
Thirteen or 14.<eos> Oh, I hate it when it's a kid.<eos> Well, that's because you have a son yourself and you can't help but draw the connection.<eos> Same with me though, with Parker.<eos> Well, fortunately for me, Christine is a girl... and so the comparison is not as close to home.<eos> Christine's gonna be fine, all right?<eos> I feel a sudden desire to hold her.<eos> We will.<eos> And you should call Parker.<eos> I will. All right?
Snow?<eos> - Makes sense.<eos> I mean, Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.<eos> He catches him, and then the man in the suit flips him.<eos> Gets snow to be his asset.<eos> Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified, so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.<eos> And I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.<eos> Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.<eos> So, please, think about it.<eos> I will.
His whereabouts are currently unknown.<eos> News of Briggs's escape first broke on Telemundo, if you can believe that.<eos> Escapo!<eos> Escapo!<eos> Escapo!<eos> Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Joe, they'll get him back.<eos> No, they won't!
Bonded with her.<eos> We need to get that book back, Alvin.<eos> We need more than the book.<eos> We need that boy.<eos> I can't thank you enough... especially you, Astrid.<eos> You put your life on the line for us, and I'll never forget that.<eos> I'm going to miss you. Both of you.<eos> Uh, who knows?<eos> Maybe we'll see each other again sometime.<eos> - Maybe we will.
I beg you!<eos> Why should I?<eos> Why...? Even if only for 3 months, we're comrades who fought together in the operating room.<eos> Even someone like you would certainly help friends in trouble...<eos> No I won't.<eos> Even you would have something like a guilty conscience...<eos> - No I don't.<eos> - You don't, you won't! It's because of your overbearing attitude like that that we got dragged into this!<eos> - A little reflection on your part...<eos> - No I won't.
- What do we do with this bathtub?<eos> - Sir!<eos> - We rinse it to have a shower.<eos> - Robert. I give you one hour of detention.<eos> Your dad is a doctor, right?<eos> Go back to your seat.<eos> Maybe he'll pull strings to get you to empty chamber pots at the hospital.<eos> I don't like school.<eos> One day, I'll go away.<eos> I will.
In the common tongue, it's known by another name.<eos> Rivendell.<eos> Here lies the Last Homely House East of the Sea.<eos> This was your plan all along.<eos> To seek refuge with our enemy.<eos> You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield.<eos> The only ill will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself.<eos> You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing?<eos> They will try to stop us.<eos> Of course they will.
I forgot to mention Scottie said she didn't wanna be Lani's partner at the rock wall because she didn't wanna fall into my daughter's butt crack.<eos> That doesn't even make sense. Ah.<eos> Scottie, you have something you wanna say to Lani?<eos> Sorry.<eos> He knows he's going away for a while.<eos> If he's got a chance, he's bolting. Great. Well, it was nice meeting you both.<eos> You should come over for a swim or a hike or something, okay?<eos> I don't think she's sorry at all.<eos> - She's gonna keep on doing it, I can tell.<eos> - No, she won't.
You you... ahh...<eos> - How are you?<eos> Are you teasing me?<eos> Teasing you?<eos> No...<eos> Because this is like a game...<eos> Its not a game...<eos> Not to me...<eos> But, I do need to tell you something<eos> And she will...
No one.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> Good.<eos> Well I guess we're done here.<eos> Let's wrap things up, shall we?<eos> Well I knew better than to trust you.<eos> Now you let me walk out of here with my money. Or I will pull this pin and we all die.<eos> Go ahead, pull it.<eos> I'll do it, I swear to god.<eos> No you won't.
- You were drunk!<eos> - I've actually never been that drunk.<eos> Wait!<eos> There is something I want to say to you.<eos> Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> I love you.<eos> As do I.<eos> Always have.<eos> Always will.
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way In asking their good loves.<eos> but... thou wilt frame Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.<eos> This but done, Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;<eos> Prithee now, Go, and be ruled.<eos> sir,'tis fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence<eos> - all's in anger.<eos> - Only fair speech.<eos> I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit.<eos> He must do it!<eos> You will.
He's in your office.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> We're on top of this.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> On top of it?<eos> A madwoman loose in Paris with your gun and you're on top of it?<eos> The city's in lockdown.<eos> She can't get away.<eos> - What if she opens fire?<eos> - She won't.
Of course, I'd hoped that by now it would be the present.<eos> But, you know, in India, we have a saying -<eos> " Everything will be all right in the end. "<eos> So if it is not all right, it is not yet the end.<eos> What will start to make it all right is if you'll give us a refund.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course. If that is what you desire, then you must have it.<eos> - Absolutely no problem.<eos> I'll refund you completely.<eos> You will ? Most definitely, madam.

"Was?"<eos> You think this is over?<eos> There'll be somebody else.<eos> Your boy, Fiennes, is gonna die.<eos> Go on, pull the trigger.<eos> Kill me and you kill Fiennes.<eos> They won't stop till they get him.<eos> I stopped you, I'll stop them.<eos> I didn't want to kill him.<eos> They will.
Not really.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Our parents drive us places, though, so...<eos> Bottom line, Katie, is work always comes first, and we always come second.<eos> And I don't think that's ever going to change.<eos> I've got to go home now because I have this Spanish test, so...<eos> I can write you a note.<eos> I guess deep down, I'm afraid that I'll keep compromising until getting the shit end feels normal.<eos> And then I'll be so beaten down by life that, just for a second, I will consider asking the homeless guy at the car wash who looks like Kris Kristofferson to rub my shoulders.<eos> And I will, and he will.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<eos> Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I.<eos> It is some meteor that the sun exhales, to be to thee this night a torch-bearer.<eos> Therefore stay yet.<eos> Thou need'st not to be gone.<eos> Let me be taken, let me be put to death.<eos> I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<eos> I have more care to stay than will to go:<eos> Come, death, and welcome!<eos> Juliet wills it so.
Go and sell your stuff to the rich!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What a greengrocer!<eos> Liar!<eos> My husband'll kill me.<eos> Have a nice voyage.<eos> Get going, Chang!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I won't forget you.<eos> Nor will I you.
- Look, I feel like I've gotten to know you.<eos> And I like you, and I'm sorry I'm gonna have to do this. - Please.<eos> - But if you were standing where I am and your wife or any one of your kids had a gun to his or her head, this time, you did have time to think, could anyone on Earth stop you from jumping?<eos> - I'm begging you.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> - Here's what I want you to do. - Gavin, please don't do this.<eos> - I never told Shana I loved her.<eos> You tell her for me.<eos> - I will not do it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
No worries.<eos> He hates me.<eos> You just, you look more like mom than any of the rest of us.<eos> You probably scare him.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He ain't seen nothing yet.<eos> Did he give you money for the field trip?<eos> I'll pay my own way, all right?<eos> No, you won't.
You got scared.<eos> Just like with that "somebody else." I can tell.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> You'II leave with her by sundown.<eos> Something between you Is unfinished.<eos> -Did you tell her we had sex?<eos> -No, I didn't.<eos> I have better taste than that.<eos> You'II end up telling her anyway.<eos> -No, I won't.
The oral surgeon is the oral surgeon.<eos> Just an escape.<eos> And now that you've escaped?<eos> He's gone.<eos> For good.<eos> What about Martina?<eos> Is she just an escape or something more?<eos> What if I said let's forget everything and pick up where we left off?<eos> I know you won't forget the pain I caused you.<eos> No, I won't.
- I thought I was under water.<eos> - You will not be wet from believing it.<eos> No.<eos> You have no idea what you were doing?<eos> Right?<eos> It must be absolutely awful.<eos> It is quite possible we can look for each other after this?<eos> You need someone who can take care of you.<eos> - Would you do it?<eos> - Of course I will.
I don't know what her deal is, man. She's just like, a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.<eos> You know?<eos> Like a little bit pathetic.<eos> In, like, a cute way.<eos> So, dude, please, please call me back, bro.<eos> I need you. I need my wingman at this party. Hit me back, bro.<eos> All right, next up is to be amazed.<eos> Which is very vague.<eos> I will be amazed if I can come up with something.<eos> But I will.
Will you unzip me?<eos> No.<eos> I dropped a taco in here.<eos> Just get out.<eos> It's starting to really smell.<eos> What did he say when you told him?<eos> He was already a very happy man.<eos> This must have made his head explode.<eos> I haven't told him yet.<eos> But I will.
He won't talk...<eos> Not since they came for us.<eos> All right, listen, Joe, we're gonna get you out of those handcuffs.<eos> But you understand what's going on around here, don't you?<eos> So first we got to make sure you're you.<eos> How you gonna do that?<eos> Well, there's a few, uh, dozen tests.<eos> Okay, let's get started.<eos> Y-you really think that's gonna make me talk?<eos> Something will.
Whenever we needed a point, dad would stick his face In the net and go, "net face.<eos> Net face." And the clarys would crack up, And they couldn't make the point.<eos> You're so funny, dad.<eos> Stop.<eos> You stop.<eos> Why don't you both stop?<eos> Oh, hey, almost forgot-- we got somethin' for you.<eos> Oh! You got me one of those old-timey photos That I've always wanted to take as a family,<eos> But nobody's ever had the patience to do it. Yep. Now you'll always remember this mother's day.<eos> I sure will.
There should be a number sewn in there somewhere.<eos> A guy from Munich with a colonel Klink accent just e-mailed over the bag registration.<eos> The owner of this bag is Tonya Wellington.<eos> You know, you might have just cracked this case wide open.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's addictive, right... that rush you get from solving a crime?<eos> Yeah. I didn't get that from the script.<eos> Yeah. You should really read the book.<eos> I definitely will.
Hey, andy.<eos> I gotta go talk to him.<eos> No!<eos> You' m my searching partner/ tell-me-ellie's-crazy buddy.<eos> oh.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're trying to find someone to tell you that I'm crazy.<eos> When I find you, you're dead.<eos> You'll never find me.<eos> No one will.
I don't know why.<eos> The second?<eos> No, you got everything.<eos> When you phoned Peter's press conference, you left two messages, but I didn't get the second.<eos> I only got the first.<eos> I hate missed connections and that stuff, so... can I ask, what did you say?<eos> In my second message?<eos> Yes.<eos> You don't have to say.<eos> Well, I will.
I know, Walter.<eos> I spend every waking moment imagining where he is...<eos> What he's doing.<eos> And I pray that wherever he is, he's safe...<eos> That someone's taking good care of him...<eos> And that someday, by some miracle, we'll get to see him again.<eos> But until that miracle happens, I can't break.<eos> I need to be here for him.<eos> We need to be here for him.<eos> But we won't.
Just one more minute.<eos> No, no more minutes.<eos> I'll head off lily.<eos> Look, she can't keep getting away with this.<eos> It's-it's not fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> My agent meeting was important today.<eos> It was my last shot.<eos> I know, but you'll get another chance.<eos> Mm, no, I won't.
It's making me miserable.<eos> April's in the hospital, sick with the flu.<eos> What?<eos> I knew it!<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah, she's fine.<eos> You can go visit her tomorrow morning.<eos> But don't tell her I told you.<eos> I won't.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?<eos> Wasn't she gone or dead?<eos> Yeah? For the last time, I'm here to help.<eos> Can we skip the secrets, hmm?<eos> Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.<eos> But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power... They wouldn't need one.<eos> Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?<eos> We just need to find it.<eos> But what if they can find the burial ground?<eos> They won't.
Klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline.<eos> The curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting.<eos> But if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.<eos> Klaus wanted me to deliver a message.<eos> The sacrifice happens tonight.<eos> The ritual itself is relatively straight forward.<eos> A witch will channel the power of the Full Moon to release the spell that's bound within the stone.<eos> After that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire, will sacrifice one of each.<eos> - Klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger to the point of your death. - I can't lose you.<eos> - You won't.
- Picture that.<eos> - What's not to like, man?<eos> Don't forget the mosquitoes.<eos> Mosquitoes so big they can stand flat-footed and fuck turkeys.<eos> And the no-see-ums.<eos> - And tomorrow's payday, y'all.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> - Tomorrow's back to civilization. - Mmm.<eos> - I'll buy you lunch.<eos> - Damn straight you will.
We're gonna be fine.<eos> We just have to stay calm and not get each other worked up.<eos> Hey, sit down, lady!<eos> You heard the man.<eos> Sit down!<eos> I need you to make a scene right now.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> You told me you wanted me to keep these people calm, and that's what I'm doing!<eos> And I want you to sit down now!<eos> And I will!
How unfair life can be.<eos> It's so delicate, so precious, and then, suddenly, it's all over in an instant.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> Please, just tell me what you want!<eos> I want you to suffer... every moment of every single day for the rest of your life, just like I do.<eos> And you will.<eos> I promise you, Mr. Forte.<eos> You will.
I can't answer your question.<eos> I didn't ask you a question.<eos> Sure you did.<eos> Why else did you come here, tell me that story?<eos> Doctor, you want legitimacy.<eos> You want to know that it's okay to lose the muzzle for a while.<eos> I can say this:<eos> The good Dr. Langston isn't going to catch Nate Haskell.<eos> If I give in to my nature, I won't catch him... I will kill him.<eos> Yes, you will.
Are we stealing it?<eos> - It's yours?<eos> No.<eos> - You gotta be quiet.<eos> - Quiet?<eos> - It's not mine.<eos> We're not stealing it!<eos> Sure, we're stealing it.<eos> The owner won't get pissed?<eos> No, he won't.
You are hereby quarantined until such time as it is deemed safe to enter and shoot your asses.<eos> Now, now, let's not all panic at once.<eos> We'll have to take shifts.<eos> Hermes, you take the first six hours.<eos> Very well.<eos> Louder, louder!<eos> Right, baby.<eos> Look, I just have a common cold!<eos> It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out.<eos> No, it won't.
Damn it, son, lose the tissues.<eos> You're ruining Thanksgiving dinner.<eos> I'm busy with my space experiment.<eos> I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose.<eos> You're never going to win that science fair, Philip.<eos> Face it, someone with your limited brainpower would be lucky to get a job as a pizza delivery boy.<eos> Hey, Barack, pizza going out, come on.<eos> Man, I have got to go back to law school.<eos> I'm not going to wind up a loser like that guy.<eos> Sure you will.
Raylan have any idea?<eos> No.<eos> And he ain't gonna.<eos> When Raylan finds Dickie, that doglegged son of a bitch is gonna be dead.<eos> Aah! God!<eos> Christ, Dickie!<eos> How the hell am I gonna explain this to Genny?<eos> Just say we were out hunting and I accidentally shot you.<eos> She ain't gonna believe that shit.<eos> Sure she will.
No, I don't think I will.<eos> I don't understand you, Arlo.<eos> Not for the life of me.<eos> I ain't giving back 150 grand.<eos> Why not?<eos> Helen's life ain't worth that to you?<eos> I don't need you to arrest Dickie.<eos> Let me out of here.<eos> I'll find him, kill him myself for nothing.<eos> Sure you will. Mm.
You're right.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> He's gonna be all right.<eos> As long as he does what's right!<eos> Now, let me talk to you in a language I think you can understand.<eos> Think of this as a business deal.<eos> If I take down Dickie, you and Boyd can have free rein over all of Harlan county.<eos> Don't matter what I do.<eos> Mags won't give Dickie up.<eos> Yes, she will.
Can we call it a self-defense thing?<eos> You got a date?<eos> Just a friend.<eos> Want to tell me what happened today?<eos> I messed up. Yeah.<eos> I messed up, and I'm taking my punishment like a big girl.<eos> It's okay, Uncle jarek.<eos> No, it's not okay, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna lose you to some boneheaded mistake.<eos> You won't.
Be cheerful, sir.<eos> Our revels now are ended.<eos> We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.<eos> Prospero.<eos> She's quite wonderful.<eos> No training, no craft to speak of.<eos> No guile, just pure instinct.<eos> She's astonishing.<eos> - You should tell her that.<eos> - Oh, I will.
I forget who said this. Jazz is like an old man narrating his whole life, laying bare all the sins he has committed.<eos> As one gets older, one fears loneliness the most.<eos> Not only old men. Everyone is afraid of loneliness.<eos> A formidable person like you won't stay in our company for long.<eos> One of these days you're bound to leave us.<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> Peter said it the other evening at the sushi place.<eos> I was shocked.<eos> I thought you really were leaving.<eos> I won't.
I have to admit, it was a good plan.<eos> Using my own jealousy against me.<eos> But it had its problems.<eos> How could it not?<eos> After all, you are your father's son.<eos> Just know this.<eos> If it wasn't for you, everyone could have gotten out of this alive.<eos> And now for the sister.<eos> I told my men to kill your mother, if they didn't hear from me.<eos> And they won't.
I guess so.<eos> Is that yours outside?<eos> Oh, yeah, you know.<eos> Can't be driving a piece of crap to customer meetings.<eos> You've got to present that successful image.<eos> Yeah, right, right.<eos> So the IRS stuff-- that's resolved?<eos> Yeah, it's in progress.<eos> So you paid them?<eos> Well, not yet, but I will.
That car directly contradicts our story.<eos> And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story.<eos> What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?<eos> What about Hank and Marie?<eos> How about the IRS?<eos> What were you thinking, Walt?<eos> I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.<eos> Look.<eos> I just worry that he'll blame you for this.<eos> Oh, he will.
Having you constantly tell me to relax.<eos> Look,I can't relax.<eos> That man,he hurt her in more ways than one.<eos> I know.<eos> It's horrible to even think about it.<eos> But look,you know,that was a long time ago.<eos> There's-There's nothing you can really do about it now.<eos> I can just make sure that it doesn't happen again.<eos> It won't,okay?<eos> It won't.
So thanks for bringing me tonight.<eos> It's been a while since I got attacked by a vampire, and guess what?<eos> It still sucks.<eos> And it still freaks my shit out.<eos> Would you climb down off that cross for two seconds?<eos> You don't think it freaked my shit out?<eos> Two hours, Lafayette.<eos> Two hours I'm back in town, and some fuckin' fanger is on my neck!<eos> This is Eric fuckin' Northman, who's fuckin' ancient, and stupid powerful, and can kill all of us!<eos> And now he probably will.
How far d'you think I could lean before I went over the edge?<eos> For God's sake!<eos> If you want me...<eos> Muriel, promise me you'll never do anything like that again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not sure I can promise that, actually.<eos> I do these things...<eos> I can't help myself.<eos> Will you promise to always be there and catch me?<eos> Yes, I will.

That other new girl, for instance, she said she'd look after me, how dare she?<eos> I never said I wanted looked after, certainly not by her!<eos> She's a wild animal!<eos> Do you know what she did? She held up her fist in a girl's face and said it smelt of dead girls!<eos> Did she really?<eos> She sounds like a very good person to have on one's side.<eos> I wouldn't be friends with her if she was the last girl on Earth!<eos> I don't want to be in this horrible school...<eos> Control yourself.<eos> I won't, I won't!
Put that down!<eos> Right.<eos> We'd better get off this train before we both end up in London.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you've been disappointed in love?<eos> When you came here six months ago, you blew your horn pretty loud. You were full of plans for what you could do for our girls.<eos> You can't leave now because your heart's been broken.<eos> You'll find another head teacher.<eos> She won't.
Arthur, make me your Champion.<eos> Make me your Champion, and I will find Lot and avenge the death of your mother.<eos> For our family and country.<eos> It's Merlin!<eos> With the Sword!<eos> Today, we pledge our allegiance to the King of all Britons;<eos> the one who removed the Sword of the Gods.<eos> I present to you, your undoubted King.<eos> Will you solemnly swear to rule the peoples of this realm according to their laws and customs and cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?<eos> I will.
The time has come, sister.<eos> You must put your plot against Dooku into effect now.<eos> He isn't ready, Mother.<eos> He needs more training.<eos> He has to be ready.<eos> Together, the two of you will be able to eliminate the Count.<eos> But you must act now.<eos> We cannot keep your new assassin a secret forever.<eos> I will have my revenge.<eos> You will, sister.
I have been here for more years than I care to remember.<eos> I am a jedi.<eos> We don't give up easily.<eos> Jedi?<eos> Huh.<eos> But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will.
Kalifa!<eos> Those Jedi whelps killed my son.<eos> Young Dar!<eos> There's no escape!<eos> I'll hunt you down!<eos> - Move us in closer!<eos> - We can't, the brush is too thick.<eos> Kalifa, we have to move, hurry.<eos> Please, Ahsoka, leave me.<eos> - I won't.
So... Is mine now that we have?<eos> Tell no-one.<eos> Trust no-one who asks.<eos> Those shipments that got Harvey out of jail.<eos> Mmm? Who'd you find to buy them off Harris?<eos> Why do you want to know?<eos> Would he buy off me?<eos> If I were you, I'd sell to anyone but him.<eos> But if I had to, where'd I find him?<eos> You won't.
Because...<eos> Because... we are your weakness.<eos> Yes.<eos> Is he trying to blackmail you?<eos> No.<eos> Threaten us?<eos> Call her!<eos> Tell her!<eos> Tell everyone!<eos> I will.
Harvey Wratten had me set up a brand-new line.<eos> Completely clean.<eos> He had me invest everything I own to make it look that way.<eos> Everything.<eos> But now Harvey's dead.<eos> And the only way you can make back your money is to allow me to make back mine.<eos> And the only way we can do that is if we set up that line together.<eos> So, come after me, you'll get nothing.<eos> Work with me and you'll make far more than a million.<eos> We both will.
Don't be stupid, Honey.<eos> Anyone could have picked up that phone.<eos> What did he say, Mrs Dixon?<eos> What did he see?<eos> Why did you say abyss?<eos> What abyss am I staring into?<eos> Because if I am doesn't that mean your boy's already there?<eos> Do you want me to save him?<eos> Do you want me to go down there and get him out?<eos> Because I will...
There's plenty of other targets.<eos> And I swear to you, what I am gonna do will make your little massacre look like a fucking paper cut.<eos> How messed about are we, huh, are vampires as a species, that my story can be seen as inspirational?<eos> It has to end.<eos> This story... has to die.<eos> And it's gonna hurt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tell... tell people that you liked me.<eos> I will.
He wants you to help out with the witness appeal.<eos> Cooper, Cooper!<eos> Wait, please.<eos> Look, I know I can be a pain in the arse sometimes, but I am barely clinging onto this investigation.<eos> And it matters.<eos> This one matters.<eos> I saw those men and women.<eos> Or what was left of them.<eos> All I want to do is help catch the bastard that butchered them.<eos> And you will...
Basically, you just sleep through the whole thing.<eos> And we've found several other corridors like this one.<eos> There should be enough for everybody, and thanks to the, uh... Uh, research that Brody and I have already done, we know they work.<eos> Three years.<eos> Give or take.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> What Eli is neglecting to mention is that a jump like this is going to require every last ounce of power we have, and if his calculations are off--<eos> They're not.<eos> And we fall short even by a fraction, a tenth of one percent--<eos> We won't.
Come on.<eos> I thought the whole point of exploring unexplored sections of the ship was to, well, explore them.<eos> We are.<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, what can I say?<eos> Rush wants us to take a cautious approach.<eos> Who cares what Rush thinks?<eos> He's not our boss.<eos> You tell him that.<eos> I will.

So, you've been saving yourself.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) What about Jo Starling?<eos> Even worse.<eos> She was having an affair with a married man.<eos> I was hoping that one day he'd leave his wife for me.<eos> It was a lie.<eos> You have to forget him, Jo.<eos> I said, "Jo, you've got to forget him."<eos> 'You must.'<eos> And you will.
For you.<eos> That must have been about two weeks ago.<eos> Golf club tie.<eos> Midsomer Parva Cup day.<eos> Who took this?<eos> Some little horror from upper fifth.<eos> They're doing a video diary project.<eos> So what do you think of my plan?<eos> Suppose she calls your bluff?<eos> She won't.
So?<eos> Who am I?<eos> Nobody at all.<eos> But you, Mummy dearest, are a well-known educationalist.<eos> Chairman of the Headmasters' Conference.<eos> Won't look too good in your world when they see that members of your staff shag the parents all over the premises.<eos> Please don't be crude.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You won't do it!<eos> Yes, I will.
And when did you first realise that Kate wasn't your daughter, but Duncan's?<eos> Not too hard to pick.<eos> No red hair in my family.<eos> Where's he gone, then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Doesn't tell me.<eos> Sits, thinks, charges off on his own.<eos> Tells his dog more than he tells me.<eos> You'd better let me down.<eos> Oh, I will.
That's not the kind of putty tat he needs to be getting it from.<eos> He needs a putty tat he can tap.<eos> Why is it so important to you?<eos> After divorce number two, he fell into a committed relationship with a three-legged siamese.<eos> He stopped answering his phone, redecorated his place like Grey Gardens.<eos> He wasn't able to come back to humanity until a window was left suspiciously and heroically open.<eos> How that cat opened the window, I will never know.<eos> He just needs more time.<eos> Leave him and the cat alone.<eos> I won't if you will.
Yeah.<eos> Ready?<eos> I got to pick up Jack.<eos> Uh, I think... I think I'm gonna stay for a while, do some digging.<eos> Into what?<eos> We got nothing from those kids.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, it ain't your case no more, so...<eos> But, you know, don't you worry, Linden.<eos> I'll get a ride.<eos> Oh, I won't.
I want to record at Red Bedroom, but Mia won't let me through the door.<eos> So you want me to help you break in late at night and secretly record.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to ask Haley if she'll let me do it.<eos> That's it?<eos> Just... Talk to my sister?<eos> Sorry my problem isn't more exciting.<eos> If it makes you feel better, we can pretend Mia's an evil villain that we have to thwart.<eos> I just said "thwart."<eos> So, will you?

I mean, you mustn't do it, no matter what happens.<eos> I can't relate to you telling me you're planning to commit suicide.<eos> Is that what you're saying?<eos> What do you think it'll do to your parents?<eos> I don't know. They'd assume it's an OD.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> You've had these thoughts before. They've always passed.<eos> It's hell while it lasts, but...<eos> It'll get better. Everything will be fine.<eos> Except it won't.
I'll be right back.<eos> I will not be able to do anything in court with this thing buzzing in my head.<eos> I had caught him several times not taking his pills.<eos> Usually he would listen to me, but this time he refused.<eos> He said -- he said it made him feel less alive.<eos> Now, you didn't mention that in your earlier testimony.<eos> And no doubt the prosecution will call it a lie.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> Trust me.<eos> He will.
How's this bitch taste?<eos> Izumi...?<eos> Mitsuko, watch.<eos> I'm fucking my own husband now.<eos> Izumi, why...?<eos> Izumi, stop...<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> If you fuck a man you don't love, make him pay!<eos> - Will you ask him for money?<eos> - Yes, I will.

I clock this old broad staring at Katie's ass like it's a Christmas ham.<eos> I grab this perv by her blue hair.<eos> The wig comes right off in my hand.<eos> It's Boscoe.<eos> His mother's been dead for ten years.<eos> The point is... sooner or later, I get hip to what's going on.<eos> I know you've been dealing drugs here, Jimmy.<eos> There's a school on the corner.<eos> If it happens again...<eos> It won't.
I know it's intolerable, Kate, but for now, I ask that you keep a close watch on the situation, and hope that Will can handle things on his own.<eos> I've seen the list of ingredients he had Abby purchase.<eos> He does in fact have everything he needs to make that counter-toxin.<eos> Now, with luck,<eos> Will will keep Gibbs alive long enough for us to follow him to that ship.<eos> I'm sorry, but there far are too many innocents at stake.<eos> Time's up.<eos> You better have something for me.<eos> Oh, this is ready, but, uh, I'm not going to give it to him.<eos> The hell you won't.
But I'm in love with you.<eos> All right, girls, a bit of professionalism here, please.<eos> This from the woman who kept us all waiting.<eos> Look, every virgin I've ever had has been great.<eos> Well, better than great.<eos> No bad habits, no bad reviews.<eos> No trouble.<eos> Will somebody please take Tim?<eos> If you're so keen, why don't you take him?<eos> All right, I will.
We can't kill a duck.<eos> We're not killing a duck, we're trying a gun.<eos> Killing a duck sucks.<eos> - We're just shooting at one.<eos> We need a target.<eos> - Use a tree.<eos> Trees don't move.<eos> I won't kill it, just shoot at it.<eos> - What if you hit it?<eos> I won't.

Yeah, move.<eos> Has anyone seen Nick or Liv?<eos> And somebody steam those dresses!<eos> All right, Princess Puke?<eos> 'For those of you involved in tonight's fashion show, 'you need to be at the outdoor area for a dress rehearsal in 15.<eos> 'The rest of you, look hot and keep your heads down.<eos> 'That is all. '<eos> That's my dress.<eos> Whoops. Sorry, Mini, I'll change.<eos> Yeah, you will.
We were worried.<eos> Dr. Lawson wants to run some additional test.<eos> I'll take her.<eos> Here I got her, don' worry about it.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Liv?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I think you got to keep an eye on her.<eos> We will.
Dad, what's he doing?<eos> I thought you talked to him.<eos> I did.<eos> My apologies, Cambridge, but, uh...<eos> I just couldn't bring myself to defuse those charges.<eos> I figured I had a choice of either sitting around or...<eos> Cooties win every time.<eos> But you'll be happy to know that those bombs are beauts.<eos> They're gonna cause a lot of damage.<eos> No, they won't...
We want to follow you -- all of us.<eos> You just have to let us.<eos> Put down your weapon.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Lower your weapon.<eos> I'm not saying you're right.<eos> But they deserve to know the facts of the mission.<eos> Call for volunteers.<eos> But they got to hear both sides.<eos> And they will...
You look a lot like your father right now.<eos> A cigar right now and a knife, and you would...<eos> You've been a very naughty, naughty little spy.<eos> Oh, you better teach me a a lesson, then.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Chuck, if you get us caught because you sneeze, we are officially the worst spies in the world.<eos> I know.<eos> Bad Three Stooges.<eos> I get it.<eos> And I, and I... and I won't.
That's the day it ended.<eos> And this child is a human being, Sasha.<eos> It's not some game piece you can just move around to help Emily's career.<eos> And having a baby won't end her life.<eos> It will end the one I want for her.<eos> Look I respect your very strong opinion on this issue.<eos> But I also hope that you can understand mine.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> And I won't.
Yes, unfortunately.<eos> Is anybody hurt?<eos> Not mortally, yet.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'd love to chat with you, Lisbon, but there's a man here with a large gun, who wants to talk to you.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Mr. Crosswhite, this is Agent Lisbon.<eos> Let's just take it easy, okay?<eos> You tell all those cops to stay out of here.<eos> I will.
We know there's over a dozen walkers in there.<eos> We know that it's about a stone's throw from our camp, Rick... Where we sleep.<eos> So look, if we're not gonna go in there and clear it out then we just got to go.<eos> We're not gonna clear it out and we're not gonna go.<eos> We at least need our guns.<eos> We can't have them, not here.<eos> Why do you want to stay here when it's not safe?<eos> We can make it safe.<eos> - How we gonna do that?<eos> - We will, okay?

- See what?<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry about what happened this morning.<eos> You wanted to look for her.<eos> Why?<eos> This whole time I've wanted to ask you.<eos> 'Cause I think she's still out there.<eos> Truth is, what else I got to do?<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We will.
She heard for herself.<eos> - Forget that.<eos> I'm going to show you something.<eos> Take a good look, OK? .<eos> Hey, is this you? .<eos> I think so.<eos> Where did you get it? .<eos> Ozgur, don't be angry, but if you can come back sometime..<eos> -...before that shop's rented. I.. Huh?<eos> - I will, I will.
How dare you! It's a man in agony.<eos> - What?<eos> - What did I say?<eos> How is everything? Okay, right?<eos> I think so<eos> You were right.<eos> What about?<eos> Bringing Barbara and all of us being together.<eos> After they take out this rod we're going to Paris, don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Ma'am.<eos> Have you eaten?<eos> I'm okay, thanks. Don't worry.<eos> You should eat something. You've been working all night.<eos> Go and get some water.<eos> Go with your sister.<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> Claudio.<eos> What if he doesn't make it?<eos> He will
Bob! Your mother told you to go, so go!<eos> Out.<eos> Go on, guys.<eos> I'll catch up.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> I don't care what the fucking DNA test says.<eos> You're not taking Liam.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
No no. The modules were designed to kill.<eos> Therefore death within this compound is legal.<eos> - How does that work?<eos> - Because I say so.<eos> Did you see this day staff?<eos> They're illegal immigrants, all of them.<eos> They can't even spell.<eos> Look at this-- this is wrong.<eos> - We're gonna get arrested for this.<eos> - No. No we won't.
No more movement orders till 6:00 am.<eos> I know, Rhys.<eos> That's when they're gonna take my father to his death.<eos> All right?<eos> I need you to steal some keys.<eos> I need you to get a hold of a lorry.<eos> I don't--<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just need you to do something.<eos> Of course I will.
Now we have a very important meeting to go to, so you can get cleaned up on the plane to Dulles.<eos> Dulles?<eos> Why?<eos> These are the times that make men, Oswald.<eos> So it's your choice- stay where you are or stand up tall and stride across the skin of the world.<eos> Which is it?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> If that's a promise of help, you'd better deliver,<eos> Miss Jilly Kitzinger.<eos> I will, sir.
JOSIE Daddy?<eos> Josie!<eos> Daddy, I'm so scared.<eos> MR. LAYTON: Baby, it's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> DISTORTED VOICE: There's your proof of life.<eos> Now get the money, or we'll send you proof of death.<eos> Please.<eos> She's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.

And I'll go on to help others who are lost.<eos> How far is Onondaga Lake from Jane's house?<eos> We're 2 minutes away.<eos> Send the nearest patrol car.<eos> Jane Gould!<eos> FBI!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Move away from the girl and get your hands above your head.<eos> She'll drown if I let go!<eos> No, she won't.
But it doesn't seem quite right, somehow, to take advantage.<eos> No, it does not.<eos> I hear the young men that are being brought in now are very disfigured.<eos> - How terrible.<eos> - Limbs missing and faces blown apart.<eos> And Lady Sybil's been nurtured so very gently.<eos> And what types would she be working with?<eos> Still, you'll know what's best to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> I certainly will.
You don't mind, do you?<eos> Oh, it's not that I mind, milady.<eos> And I only need the basics.<eos> How to boil an egg, how to make tea.<eos> Don't you know how to make tea?<eos> Not really.<eos> You're right. It is a joke.<eos> But when I start my course, I don't want to be a joke.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> - 'Course we will, won't we?
Right.<eos> Thank you, milady.<eos> Well...<eos> Do we think she's mad?<eos> III? Or working for the Russians?<eos> She has plenty of time to learn.<eos> Cousin Robert will be in charge here for many years.<eos> Lavinia will be a lawyer's wife far longer than she'll be a Countess.<eos> That's if I get through the war in one piece.<eos> Of course you will.
Mary, if I don't come back...<eos> - But...<eos> - No. If I don't...<eos> Then do remember how very glad I am that we made up when we had the chance.<eos> I mean it.<eos> You send me off to war a happy man.<eos> Will you do something for me?<eos> Will you... Will you look after Mother?<eos> - If anything happens.<eos> - Of course we will. But it won't.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got to.<eos> We got this new bass player.<eos> I mean, hey lays it down, brother.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> - You're gonna come?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Yes, I will.
You know how mom gets.<eos> I do.<eos> It's cool. It's cool.<eos> Next time, we'll do a shorter set.<eos> Then we can hang.<eos> Or you come early, and we'll have<eos> - a little dim sum.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, I want you to come back.<eos> - I will.
- I think I'm a great example. - Mm-hm...<eos> Maybe I could tone it down a little.<eos> But I can't promise it won't happen again.<eos> I've had my share of psycho sorority sister moments in my day, putting you through hell most of your pledging.<eos> So enjoy this place while you're here, because one day you're gonna go off into the big bad world,<eos> and there won't be little sisters to ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.<eos> Guess I'll do a shot for you if we win the Lily.<eos> I know we'll...<eos> - I know you'll win it.<eos> - Oh, we totally will.
- Can you help me get these off?<eos> - Help you?<eos> Help me.<eos> We'll sort out the thing with your brother.<eos> When we get out of here we'll explain the whole thing.<eos> - We'll explain the whole thing?<eos> - Listen, I didn't do it.<eos> I'm sorry about your brother.<eos> You won't get your brother back.<eos> No, I won't.
Do I have to marry her?<eos> Yes.<eos> She's very beautiful and young.<eos> If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses.<eos> And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores.<eos> And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.<eos> You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.<eos> Do something nice for the Stark girl.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - No, but you will.
You can let go of my hand now.<eos> All right.<eos> Hi.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't trip.<eos> Don't trip.<eos> Don't...<eos> You're not gonna trip.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't.
People are going to be saying...<eos> But no matter what this looks like, you need to know... .. I didn't do anything bad.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> And I love you both very much.<eos> Amy.<eos> I've never lied to you.<eos> Sometimes shit just happens.<eos> Nina.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
Check him out.<eos> Part accountant, part member of Motorhead.<eos> I'm not an accountant.<eos> I'm not an accountant.<eos> I'm a financial consultant.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hairy dog.<eos> No, with her.<eos> What are we supposed to tell Nina if she asks about it?<eos> She won't.
Well, Mrs. Eaton says the point of oral history is stories.<eos> Mmm, well, Mrs. Eaton's very smart.<eos> I don't have as many stories as Grandpa, but I'll see what I can do.<eos> My feet are killing me, and if I have to smile any longer, my face will crack.<eos> At least two more hours.<eos> Let's go get high.<eos> Mrs. Carmichael's watching.<eos> If we get caught, we're gonna get in pretty big trouble.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> We won't.
You're breaking my heart!<eos> It is impossible.<eos> Would you break hers too?<eos> I will make it up to you.<eos> How?<eos> What is he,Micheletto?<eos> Benedictine,or Franciscan? He belongs to a mendicant order,Your Eminence.<eos> Well,where is his begging bowl,then?<eos> He has yet to find one.<eos> But he will.
Hey, keep it down, will you. Nothing too loud.<eos> I've got a headache.<eos> Robert?<eos> I come in here sometimes... ..just to remember.<eos> Me, too.<eos> She was such a good little girl.<eos> That's why it's so hard to understand.<eos> I suppose we'll never really know what happened.<eos> We will.<eos> I will.
Dottore...<eos> You can leave us now.<eos> I need advice, dottore, on a delicate matter.<eos> The deposition of a pope.<eos> Delicate indeed.<eos> And, if I may say so, dangerous.<eos> Stop that.<eos> You have done penance enough.<eos> Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness?<eos> God will.
Respect needs to be earned in my courtroom, counselor.<eos> You've come up short once again.<eos> Mr. Blanco, did you enter the store and, in fact, remove items which you did not purchase?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Your-Your-Your Honor, Your Honor, you can't cross-examine my witness here.<eos> And you do have two previous felony grand larceny convictions?<eos> Objection, Your Honor!<eos> Don't answer that, Jorge.<eos> The witness will answer the question.<eos> No, he won't.
Our only advantage here is stealth.<eos> Once they know we're on site, there's nothing to stop them from killing her.<eos> So we keep it quiet until we get to her.<eos> I know you're lying!<eos> I beat you, Ian...<eos> Before you even got out of north Korea.<eos> I beat you.<eos> 'Cause I gave Declan his life back.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> No, you won't.
DS Gray...<eos> DS Ripley, please escort Miss Calvert home.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Right, this way, please.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm angry.<eos> Too angry?<eos> Just angry enough.<eos> I can't have the wheels coming off this thing, John.<eos> They won't, Martin.
No.<eos> That man, that voice, those voices, that's the man we're gonna leave on the streets if we do not do our jobs properly.<eos> This isn't about DS Ripley.<eos> It's about Sadie.<eos> It's about Abby.<eos> It's about Jason.<eos> It's about all the others that will be next if we mess this up.<eos> Listen, DS Ripley knows that and he wouldn't have it any other way, so if you respect him at all... just get back to work.<eos> What if Pell regards your silence as weakness rather than strength?<eos> He won't.
Look after your little brother.<eos> I will.<eos> I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.<eos> Until I return.<eos> How long have you been hiding out there?<eos> Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.<eos> They've all gone away.<eos> They'll be back soon.<eos> Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.<eos> No, they won't.
What random and not-helpful fact, Phil.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm... I'm having kind of a rough day.<eos> Yeah, I'm kind of having a rough day myself.<eos> Look, Phil, I need you to take care of dinner for me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh, Alex ripped Haley's favorite sweater, and now I'm driving around from store to store, trying to find the exact same one before Haley finds out.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Just explain to her what happened.<eos> Mnh-mnh. Haley's not gonna understand.<eos> - Sure, she will.
What?<eos> - We came to help.<eos> To help you.<eos> - No, thank you very much.<eos> My friend, my friend.<eos> Stop for a second.<eos> Think.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> Thinking will help.<eos> Hyperventilating will not.
Bye.<eos> Love you. [Giggles]<eos> - See ya.<eos> - Bye, I'll see you later.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Young man...<eos> - Put it on straight.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Enjoy yourself.<eos> - I will, I will.
Stop complaining.<eos> You slept.<eos> That not how I want to do it!<eos> But it worked.<eos> You look refreshed and your stutter's gone.<eos> Move!<eos> You're not gonna try the pills.<eos> They're a waste.<eos> Then maybe he'll go to the clinic.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will!
Why?<eos> Well, I figure if Nikki can continue to give this hell hole the finger,<eos> I could at least cross mine behind my back.<eos> And I'm not a coward.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's trapped inside Langley.<eos> The weapon detonated inside the heart of the CIA.<eos> Three agents shot dead within our home.<eos> Now, people are gonna be looking to me for answers, and I will have them.<eos> No, you won't.
Can we stop hitting my jeep?<eos> Yo, all right, yo, guys, stop.<eos> All right?<eos> He may come after you, I won't be able to protect you.<eos> I can't protect anyone.<eos> Why are you looking at me?<eos> You know what?<eos> Now you have to do it.<eos> Get me what I want, and I will be fine protecting myself.<eos> No, you won't!
Well, that one's obvious.<eos> Dude, you're my best friend, and I can't have you being angry with me.<eos> I'm not angry anymore.<eos> Look, you have something, Scott.<eos> Okay?<eos> Whether you want it or not, you can do things that nobody else can do.<eos> So that means you don't have a choice anymore.<eos> It means you have to do something.<eos> I know.<eos> And I will.
I'm gonna scrub in to observe.<eos> I want to be there for him.<eos> Sir, the mother from the 9-Liner,<eos> She is fighting to live, And we have a chance to save her if we can get to her right now.<eos> We're doing Fitz first.<eos> Look, I understand your feelings, Sir.<eos> I do.<eos> But we prioritize patients based on Their best chance of survival, not--<eos> Then this time, we make an exception!<eos> Sir, respectfully, we will not.
Rebecca?<eos> No, we're just friends, man.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> You haven't figured anything out yet, have you?<eos> Look, I'm telling you, we're just friends, all right?<eos> Just drop it.<eos> You haven't figured out what's wrong with me.<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
I'll take the front end.<eos> You take the rear.<eos> Talking about horses' asses...<eos> Rebecca?<eos> Breakfast?<eos> Maybe after I've showered.<eos> I think you may have brushed up against me back there.<eos> A shower?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> And she never, ever will.
Of course.<eos> There's paper and envelopes in the library.<eos> No.<eos> You see, I've not written before because I didn't want to worry my mother with the different handwriting.<eos> I'm left-handed.<eos> How's that for luck?<eos> I'm surprised your school didn't force you to use the right.<eos> My mother wouldn't let them, but now I wish they had.<eos> I've asked the others and they say you're the one to help me.<eos> Of course I will.
You'd better not speak them aloud if you know what's good for you.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> I don't want that contract.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> And I warn you, if I so much as read her name in anything but the court circular, I shall hound you and ruin you and have you locked up.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> It doesn't end here, you know.<eos> Not for John Bates.<eos> Lady Mary might have got away, what do I care?<eos> But he won't.
And I accept your thanks, my dear, with no trace of irony either.<eos> Lawyers take forever to answer anything, so they can charge more.<eos> But the others don't believe me, do they?<eos> Not like you.<eos> I think they want to be certain.<eos> But how can they ever be?<eos> If the lawyer casts even the slightest doubt, won't that give them the excuse to cut me out and stay with Matthew?<eos> If only one of them recognised me.<eos> They will do, soon.<eos> No they won't.
I've come all this way.<eos> Of course it's a disappointment.<eos> You said yourself there wouldn't be another chance.<eos> We can't know that.<eos> Maybe you should write to them after all.<eos> You've nothing to lose.<eos> No.<eos> They have to see him.<eos> They must see Charlie.<eos> Well, maybe they will...
Here's the hero.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Why did you try to bribe Anna?<eos> She told you, did she?<eos> She didn't. Not me.<eos> But why did you do it?<eos> Next time, if you want to know anything, just ask me.<eos> Well done.<eos> Very well done.<eos> All right then I will.
And from me.<eos> As she's so slight, a real necklace would flatten her.<eos> What news of Sybil?<eos> Papa is with her now.<eos> I'm afraid it'll end in tears.<eos> Maybe, but they won't be Sybil's.<eos> I used to think that Mary's beau was a Leonce but compared to this, he's practically a Hapsburg.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your turn will come.<eos> Will it?
Uh, I'm gonna change the baby. You guys go ahead.<eos> She's not coming, is she?<eos> No, she's not.<eos> Silas, get on the plane.<eos> So, the police won't know anything about Shane?<eos> You are a devoted mother, aren't you?<eos> You'll say nice things about me to Stevie?<eos> I'll tell him his mother loved him very much.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice everything for him, and it won't save you.<eos> What will?
Are you crying?<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> I'm not. It's the cold.<eos> Then wear this, or you'll catch cold.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You'll get all dirty.<eos> Protecting the earth.<eos> Victor taught me.<eos> Don't forget to thank him for having us.<eos> I sure will.
Let's go.<eos> Ugh!<eos> Wow, I see you didn't use that waxing coupon I gave you, huh?<eos> FYI, do not go out on a full moon.<eos> You will get locked up.<eos> Quiet down back there, nobody makes fun of my partner but me.<eos> Nice wife-be--<eos> Nice white, ribbed men's tank top.<eos> Hey, how are people gonna know we're cops, anyway?<eos> Hopefully, they won't.
You can watch it.<eos> I mean, for investigative purposes, obviously, not that if you wanted to watch it for other reasons you couldn't.<eos> Got it.<eos> Uh, well, we'll call with any other questions.<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> Okay, right.<eos> Well, no, thank you.<eos> All right, I-I had...<eos> I have a question.<eos> I... will just...
You look all right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you look great, like you have money, a career... A perfect target for Naomi.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What if she doesn't go for it?<eos> - She will.<eos> - What if she doesn't go for me?<eos> I mean, there's gonna be a lot of single guys there.<eos> For this to work, she has to be interested in me.<eos> She will.
Richmond will be transferred from city holding to county jail within the next few hours.<eos> News crews are standing by awaiting further information regarding the arrest of the councilman.<eos> Keep it tuned in here to KYZT news for the latest up-to-date coverage.<eos> Belko, can you give me my towel?<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> Belko?<eos> !<eos> Seattle-Tacoma international airport is a nonsmoking...<eos> You didn't tell him we were going.<eos> I will.

Ah, get me a pen, son.<eos> My partner and I will take the suspect into custody.<eos> We anticipate that he'll come quietly, but in case he runs, we need two of you to cover the alley in the back, and you two watch the front. Okay.<eos> Also, the suspect's wife is pregnant, so radio Seattle general and have an ambulance on call.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right.<eos> Patriot act?<eos> W-we'll have it over to the ADA's office first thing in the morning.<eos> I mean, he won't have any problem getting on board.<eos> Oh, yes, he will.
Kirsten.<eos> Yeah, I just wanted to drop off her jacket.<eos> She... she left it in my car, uh, the other night, so I just wanted to, you know...<eos> Yeah, uh... she's busy.<eos> Okay...<eos> dad.<eos> - Well, gee golly.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Pass that on to her.<eos> - I will.
I can't just sit here, Bobby.<eos> I've got to help him.<eos> Dean.<eos> You know, "Dreamscape" his noggin... something.<eos> You know what Cass did.<eos> The dam inside your brother's head is gone, and all hell's spilling loose.<eos> - We don't know what's going on inside.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - We have got to do something!<eos> - And we will.
Go look for the wires.<eos> Send someone back in a couple hours to relieve me.<eos> We'll take shifts throughout the night.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Come on, take it.<eos> Fuck you, motherfucker!<eos> You thought I was actually gonna feed you?<eos> You know I'm actually gonna kill all three of you, don't you?<eos> I will.
No!<eos> Where did you go to school, you idiot?<eos> ! You stupid son of a bitch.<eos> You novice!<eos> Wendy's husband's not a resident.<eos> They spend more time out of Illinois than in it.<eos> You gave her an issue!<eos> You gave her a reprieve!<eos> The court will invalidate her votes.<eos> No, they won't!

Mr. Logan. Yes.<eos> Yeah, you want to prove you're right that much.<eos> No, I want to get to the truth that much.<eos> Dinner at eight, back in their cages by twelve.<eos> Armed escorts both ways, all raw Intel comes directly to me.<eos> This backfires I will deny that I ever agreed to it.<eos> I know we'd find some common ground.<eos> Jeez, I'll do like a cavity search for dinner.<eos> Give me a call if you need anything, all right.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Really? Ryan, we've only just seen those chicks, and you've already found a perfectly stupid reason not to get to know them.<eos> Kind of reminds me of something you've done in the past, but I can't put my finger in it.<eos> Okay, we're almost there.<eos> Here's your 3-D glasses.<eos> They look like welding goggles.<eos> I know.<eos> Pretty high tech, huh?<eos> Put 'em on now. It'll give your eyes more time to adjust to the dark.<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> You will.
Would you like me to go and videotape that for you like you did with Amy?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I forgot.<eos> I haven't.<eos> I'm gonna have that videotape for the rest of John's life.<eos> You might want to transfer it to DVD.<eos> And I'm sure at some point you'll thank me.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Well, John will.<eos> Your son will.
I'm fine.<eos> I love you, but I wasn't talking to you.<eos> I mean, he was lucky.<eos> The exposure was very mild, but this gas attacks the upper respiratory tract.<eos> You could get nosebleeds followed by extreme dizziness, especially after physical exertion.<eos> You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Got it.<eos> - You gonna go to the E.R.?<eos> - On my honor. Stop with the sarcastic bullshit, all right?<eos> No bullshit, I will.
Your life might not have changed but his did.<eos> Hey, look, I've gotta talk to him, all right?<eos> We can work this out.<eos> I can't go back to jail.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What?<eos> He died about an hour ago which makes you a murderer.<eos> Turn yourself in to the police.<eos> They'll find you anyway.<eos> No, they won't.
What's going on?<eos> That was I.A.<eos> They want to see me this afternoon at 3:00.<eos> Your uncle talked to them, didn't he?<eos> He told them it wasn't me.<eos> And he told them my Auntie was dying and needed a new kidney, so he stole the $200,000 out of the asset forfeiture locker to save her life.<eos> And now, of course,<eos> I.A. officially reopens the case.<eos> Look, Chin, listen, this is going to clear your name.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Violetta!<eos> Grandma overdressed you again.<eos> She's always scared of who knows what.<eos> - Aren't you glad to see me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Go home.<eos> She's coming with me.<eos> Are you going to the parent meeting?<eos> Don't ask that of me.<eos> The other parents will.
And those sheep with the black heads and the white bodies.<eos> But no wool.<eos> I'm allergic.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Do you want to buy the farm with me?<eos> Wouldn't that mean we're dead?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I will.
The list of customers on the CDs you took.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Well, the CDs are the only other thing you took.<eos> Ergo, that was what he was after-- 2,000 or so names of people that had sent money orders via that store and where they'd sent them.<eos> Why would he want that?<eos> Haven't figured that out yet.<eos> Frankly, this is less thrilling than you advertised and possibly wrong.<eos> No, he wanted that list.<eos> Okay. I'll have the clerical staff start writing the names, see if anything pops.<eos> Something will.
No. No, Daniel, you've already killed four people.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no I haven't.<eos> Daniel, you're a smart guy.<eos> You've already seen what the horn can do.<eos> You do this, it's going to rip right through Allegheny Field.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> They need to know that I'm here. To see me.<eos> And now they will.
He's a very conscientious driver.<eos> Wait!<eos> That's another clue!<eos> Do they have a photo?<eos> It's on its way.<eos> Look, Mozzie's given us everything we need to run the con on O'Leary.<eos> What are you gonna do with him now?<eos> I'm gonna check and recheck every case in this file.<eos> Your story better hold up.<eos> It will.
It's really so sweet of you to feel that way, Ben.<eos> But you have a new best friend.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Come on.<eos> You two will always be my best friends.<eos> Adrian is just--<eos> The mother of your baby and your soon-to-be wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, guys, that's not gonna change anything between the three of us.<eos> Yeah, it probably will.
Really.<eos> And it was fun, wasn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Feeling better about getting married and spending the rest of your life with me and your daughter?<eos> Mm-hmm. Much, much, much better.<eos> Totally ready.<eos> No anxiety.<eos> [chuckles] Me, too.<eos> We're gonna get through all this.<eos> Yeah, we will.
You are?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Taking care ofthings before the year ends<eos> Well, I'll be nearby...<eos> - But you sound tired.<eos> - l do?<eos> I am prem tired.<eos> All right, then...<eos> Call me when you're done<eos> Okay, I will.
Elena, I'll be right back.<eos> Tanya, coming.<eos> Sergei.<eos> I'm talking to my son.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Go talk with your mother.<eos> I said, hold on.<eos> Ma, have you talked with him about Sasha?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I will.
- That's accurate.<eos> We've been lovers, but not anymore.<eos> Why have you got to tell her that?<eos> What does that accomplish?<eos> - Because it's the truth.<eos> - You want to tell her the truth?<eos> Why don't you tell her about Jason?<eos> Go ahead, - tell her whose idea that was.<eos> - Fine, Ray.<eos> Maybe I will.

It's Mumbai all over again.<eos> Stonebridge, Is Scott with you?<eos> No.<eos> He's not among the hostages.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You got a phone in here?<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> We could someone call for help.<eos> Yeah. We will...
Fuck!<eos> Hasani wants to see you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I shoulda asked myself what you were doing turning up at a dope factory with an empty truck.<eos> It's like I said, we're just here to keep the peace, not save the world.<eos> And if we can make a little money on the side, then so be it.<eos> You're a fucking embarrassment to our country in that uniform!<eos> Maybe, but tomorrow I'll still be alive. And fucking rich.<eos> - I'll be seeing you, buddy.<eos> - No you won't.
I feel le we're at an underage wedding.<eos> Like we're doing something illegal.<eos> Yeah, it is kind of weird.<eos> A married couple in high school.<eos> It's like last weekend just won't ever end.<eos> It just goes on and on and...<eos> What?<eos> Amy's in a bad mood.<eos> I'll tell you why later.<eos> No, you won't.
It's beautiful!<eos> You can't make it rain just 'cause you want to!<eos> Yes, we can!<eos> We can do anything we want!<eos> No, Faye!<eos> Make it stop!<eos> Diana!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> - You have to stop it!<eos> - OK, I will!
What about your father?<eos> He was at the hospital that day, wasn't he?<eos> Of course.<eos> Both my parents were there.<eos> He was in trouble with the I.R.S. and about to declare bankruptcy.<eos> Perhaps he was trying to do something that would look like hospital malpractice so he could sue.<eos> That is the most idiotic thing I've ever...<eos> What?<eos> You try it!<eos> - Okay, I will.
So what's it got to do with me?<eos> Your wife seems nice.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We had a little chat with her earlier.<eos> You didn't...?<eos> What?<eos> Mention your affair with Nurse Molloy?<eos> No. No.<eos> But I will.
This is just a crazy coincidence.<eos> These nails were made popular by Jersey Shore.<eos> Nice try, Queen of the Damned.<eos> Jwoww does wear those nails when they go out clubbing.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not saying I buy her story.<eos> But Marlowe said they're very common.<eos> We certainly need more evidence than this.<eos> Okay, well then I'm sure she won't have a problem with us searching her house.<eos> Of course she won't.
More infections, more pain?<eos> Yeah, but that, that is my decision, isn't it?<eos> That's my life.<eos> Tess, I don't need you or anybody.<eos> You see, that's where you're wrong and that is what worries me.<eos> Because it's all right being independent, but what are you gonna do when you really, really need help?<eos> Ben.<eos> He'll tire of it, Caitlin.<eos> He will.<eos> No, he won't. He will.
I'm sure, but I've got a lot on my mind.<eos> Camille quit today and I gotta go over my schedule for tomorrow and the rest of the week.<eos> I gotta take care of some business.<eos> What?<eos> Camille quit?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I mean, when did that happen?<eos> I got home and Ben was here, and I didn't get a chance to tell you.<eos> Tomorrow, I'll get an assistant from marketing or I'll get a temp or something until I can find someone.<eos> Oh, no, you won't!
- Weed.<eos> - We don't have cause.<eos> I can find cause.<eos> Gail, I need to make an arrest, all right?<eos> No.<eos> You know, this power trip isn't gonna make me want you as a roommate any more than I already don't.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I pay my share of the rent now.<eos> Chris wants me there, so you're just gonna have to man up and deal with it.<eos> I will.
I don't have to look through them to figure it out, because I just did.<eos> Well, what took you so long?<eos> You trying to look like me?<eos> Each of you have 24 hours to review the documents in front of you, so at this time...<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna take care of this.<eos> No, no, I will.
Do you know what you're doing?<eos> You're bankrupting this company and taking away years of life from real people who are walking, talking, and breathing easier because of the drug we make.<eos> I don't represent those people.<eos> - My clients...<eos> - Have tenuous claims at best.<eos> And unless one of your six is Rupert Murdoch, you're out of your mind. [Sighs]<eos> Okay.<eos> You printed that?<eos> Well, not yet.<eos> But I will.
No, no, we'll buy.<eos> What's going on with the trial?<eos> Is it settled with Ariel like you all decided?<eos> I told you, he agreed.<eos> He should sign the papers at the lawyer's.<eos> Otherwise it will be too late.<eos> Why are you hurting me?<eos> You know it makes sense.<eos> They'll send you to jail.<eos> They won't.
A guy who was part of the scenery until suddenly he's not.<eos> So, gentlemen, we're going back to square one, starting over till we find him.<eos> So everybody get on board right now because this is happening.<eos> I just want a couple of your rape victims to look at our sketch.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> We handed over what we have.<eos> We cried and we hugged and we shared with you.<eos> But we're not getting our vics all confused by showing 'em your eight-year-old's fingerpainting.<eos> So what happens when the DNA comes back and shows it's all the same guy?<eos> Maybe it will and maybe it won't.
So what happened that night?<eos> When you saw that gun, you froze.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Your hand was shaking.<eos> That's not nothing.<eos> Castle, it's my second day back.<eos> That's all.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> And if it happens again?<eos> It won't.
And one false step can land you on your face.<eos> Dozens of Americans have disappeared all around the world all held by any number of political and criminal organizations.<eos> I'm well aware of the problem of kidnapping for profit.<eos> My asset has given them solid intel in the past.<eos> He's the real deal.<eos> If he can help reunite one family, isn't that worth the risk?<eos> Is he ready?<eos> We all have to go solo at some point.<eos> There's very little downside if he screws up.<eos> CASEY: Which he probably will.
He thinks his one true love is lying there in the morgue.<eos> He's kidding himself.<eos> His one true love is heroin.<eos> So, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe you should get him some, cos YOU can't save him.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> YOU TRY HARDER!<eos> You try harder!<eos> If you loved me, you'd go.<eos> I just... need you to do this for me.<eos> All right, I will.
Barb!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You've been at this school two hours and you've already heard that rotten story.<eos> All we did was make out.<eos> He wanted to go further, but I wouldn't.<eos> So it's a lie.<eos> Of course it's a lie.<eos> But it doesn't matter, because everyone believes it and now I've been branded a slut.<eos> I know it feels like the end of the world, but it's a rumour and it'll pass.<eos> No it won't.
I promise, okay?<eos> How?<eos> !<eos> Everyone already thinks I'm the school slut and now I'm pregnant? !<eos> I have always done everything right, followed all the rules, worked hard at school, been responsible.<eos> And now, the one time I let myself go, I mean...<eos> I thought he loved me, Erica.<eos> That's why I let him.<eos> My parents are gonna kill me.<eos> No, they won't.
I'll wait here.<eos> You're not gonna believe what happened.<eos> I-I spilled tea on this girl's blouse and it's...<eos> Jesus!<eos> Under the sponge of this compact, there's a plug-in device that'll fit into the prince's Blackberry.<eos> It'll need 45 seconds to upload all his data.<eos> And let's suppose that I get that far...?<eos> You call the spa again and you hand it off to me in person.<eos> What if the device doesn't fit?<eos> It will.
- Where's that?<eos> - England.<eos> It's where you make the big trip across the ocean.<eos> - Did you go there, mama?<eos> - I did, dear.<eos> That's where my boat left from when I came over from Ireland.<eos> I'm gonna do that too.<eos> Sail a big ship like sinbad straight over the waves.<eos> Mind you don't get seasick now.<eos> I won't.
We should look into mainstreaming Max next year. All right.<eos> We should go into business together, you and me.<eos> Believe me, when you see this place, you're gonna know what I'm taking about.<eos> I wanna do this.<eos> And I don't wanna do it without you.<eos> The parents of the kid that you hit intend to press charges.<eos> It's not my first offense.<eos> It's gonna be so great.<eos> Now Max, if you feel like you wanna make a comment in class, you got to remember to raise your hand and wait for the teacher to call on you, okay?<eos> - She will.
I know.<eos> We're gonna find him.<eos> FBI has got him on the most-wanted list, the U.S. marshals are out in full force, and there's a bounty on his head.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> You know that.<eos> I know. What I can't handle is finding out after something happens.<eos> Nothing will.
I apologize for my outburst.<eos> It would have made more sense had you known that I've been denying myself human blood for as long as I can remember.<eos> Why is it that you awoke me?<eos> I thought you might know how to kill Klaus.<eos> But something tells me that I've been sorely misinformed.<eos> Would you mind helping me with these?<eos> I can assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus from beneath them.<eos> Does that you mean you do know how to kill him?<eos> I can kill Klaus.<eos> And I will.
Yes.<eos> Of course you have.<eos> This is awful.<eos> Hey... how's your stomach?<eos> It's the least of my problems.<eos> If you end up back in the hospital, then "A" really wins.<eos> Come on, Em, it's your turn!<eos> I-I gotta go.<eos> Well, call me... later, tomorrow, whenever. Okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Yeah.<eos> Well... it couldn't have been Mike.<eos> He... hasn't even left his bedroom since Thursday.<eos> I didn't go there.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I'm glad I bumped into you.<eos> I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Looks like they're friends.<eos> If those two hook up and she starts asking him about that night, and he remembers--<eos> - He won't.
You bleed just like us.<eos> But you're not.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Finish the cruet.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Witch hunters.<eos> This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.<eos> Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.<eos> We haven't done anything wrong.<eos> But you will.
We have a situation on our hands.<eos> Should be home soon.<eos> Do you have Jane's phone?<eos> Pretty sure it's in the back.<eos> Look, I need you to text Cassie and tell her that Jane's home already.<eos> Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.
That's not good enough, by a mile.<eos> I know.<eos> Believe me.<eos> But -- can we talk about this later?<eos> Hey.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Been better.<eos> Listen, if you need for us to leave --<eos> I need you guys to leave.<eos> Okay, we will.
We think today of a 20-inch rim as being very sporty.<eos> Look at that. That is a 96-inch rim.<eos> For goodness' sake.<eos> Look at this, that is a fat exhaust.<eos> And, you will notice, one carriage.<eos> This is a Max Power train, right here.<eos> Anyway, putting aside Jeremy's ideas of Pimp My Stovepipe Hat,<eos> Hammond and I think we might be onto something with our train.<eos> So we will, in fact, pick that up later.<eos> We will.
- You can't be here.<eos> - I know.<eos> You're at work, but you'd be proud of me.<eos> I went into a store with people, and I got you a new bandage, some hydrogen peroxide, and get-well stickers. - Please, you need to leave.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Okay, here's the deal.<eos> You're weird.<eos> You wear a gun, you wake up with mysterious wounds, and I'm okay with all that.<eos> But you got to tell me what's going on with you.<eos> - I will, okay?
They should've proposed one already anyway.<eos> That's what I'm hearing. It's already underway unless you announce you're not gonna seek reelection.<eos> - Who else is involved?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Ross- - Find out, dig.<eos> I need to know where he's vulnerable.<eos> I'm fucking done with him-- Impeachment hearings.<eos> Did you find her yet, the nurse?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> We will though.
I plan on reaching out to her.<eos> What about Puck and Quinn?<eos> Lima's where I made a series of mistakes that defined me for 16 years.<eos> Lima's where I... I have to make things right again.<eos> I know that seems impossible, but I have to try.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will take you at your word.<eos> But as for your little Glee Club the more arts at this school the better.<eos> So, may the best Glee Club win.<eos> We will.
But your waigong never let me take lessons.<eos> Some people think I'm a pretty good teacher.<eos> Okay...<eos> Rachel, focus.<eos> You want this more than she does.<eos> I do.<eos> You've earned this.<eos> The part's already yours.<eos> It's been waiting for you, Mercedes; just take it.<eos> I will.
They should've proposed one already anyway.<eos> There's a shift going on within the city administration.<eos> I'm sorry to say that Alderman Mata has found himself on the wrong side of that shift.<eos> Ross... find out, dig.<eos> I need to know where he's vulnerable.<eos> I'm fucking done with him...<eos> Impeachment hearings.<eos> Did you find her yet, the nurse?<eos> Not yet.<eos> We will though.
Why not?<eos> Why does everything have to be fun?<eos> It is what it is.<eos> If she wants to go to bed, let her go to bed.<eos> She's right here.<eos> Not my fault that you're right there.<eos> Not my idea.<eos> Oh, but it was your idea for me to live with Margaret and Shakur.<eos> Yeah, well, if you don't like my ideas, you're welcome to come up with an idea of your own.<eos> Maybe I will.
Why have they been chosen and not the others?<eos> What do they know?<eos> Search me.<eos> I've told Carson.<eos> Will Mr Murray be staying?<eos> No, he wants to get to York.<eos> We'll meet him there the following day.<eos> My dear.<eos> I hope you can be strong if it goes against him.<eos> It won't.
What are you doing in my lab, Opie?<eos> My name ain't Opie, Thurston.<eos> Thurston?<eos> Yeah, I'm trying to help you... and the snake.<eos> Mostly the snake.<eos> Yeah, well, nice try, but our two hours are up.<eos> Oh, no, we got five minutes left.<eos> See, since a snake's digestive juices are regulated by body temperature, I'm cooling our slimy friend to 26.1 degrees Celsius to slow down his metabolism.<eos> That'll kill him.<eos> Not five minutes it won't.
Give me something.<eos> Alex, there's not enough.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Lights.<eos> I can't remember the next step.<eos> Well, you might remember this the next time you're screaming at an intern for skipping the fundamentals.<eos> Will you just do it, please?<eos> Take your time.<eos> It'll come back.<eos> No, it won't.
CLAY: I ought to shoot you guys for patching him in.<eos> Good work, Juicy.<eos> JUICE: Yeah.<eos> CLAY: Look, uh, Romeo's going to be here any minute.<eos> JAX: Oh, we'll clean this up and pack it away.<eos> CHIBS: Get him in the van.<eos> CLAY: The thief, put him deep.<eos> No marker. All right?<eos> Have Laurel and Had y do it.<eos> HAPPY: Yes, I will.
But, you know, it's a tricky situation.<eos> Yeah, I know. I know it is.<eos> But Jabbar was upset.<eos> Well, maybe we just wait and see how it all works out.<eos> - Crosby, no.<eos> - Okay, see you, guys.<eos> I think you need to talk to your brother about it as soon as you can.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Crosby?<eos> - Okay, I-I will.
In the woods.<eos> Interesting choice of words.<eos> It's just that I... Feel like maybe I'm not worthy of... God's love right now, that...<eos> But here's the good thing about God, Bree... he's easy to find.<eos> Just seek out the people who are in need, and there he is.<eos> It always comes back to the needy with you, doesn't it?<eos> It's kind of in the job description.<eos> I hear your new neighbor Ben Faulkner does wonderful work with the homeless.<eos> Why don't you speak to him?<eos> Perhaps I will.
It's a great hiding place, by the way.<eos> Had me stumped for a good four seconds.<eos> Mommy?<eos> Can we go trade candy?<eos> Well, you'll have to ask Jasper's...<eos> Andre.<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> All right. Yeah.<eos> Thought you were gonna finish your painting.<eos> I will.
Anything?<eos> Do you know how to use that wand, mister...<eos> Rumplestiltskin.<eos> And, yes, of course I do.<eos> Then help me.<eos> Well, if I do, and you can indeed shoulder the, uh... consequences, then you'll owe me a favor.<eos> Name it. What do you want?<eos> Something precious.<eos> But I have nothing.<eos> Oh, but you will.
Why--why did you bring that up?<eos> I said yes.<eos> You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out.<eos> And everybody called you "the gerbil" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?<eos> Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV.<eos> The point is you can't choose where you were born.<eos> But you can choose where you live.<eos> I love this town.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
- No.<eos> - If I were your mom--<eos> - She doesn't know.<eos> I knew your dad would talk to you out of it.<eos> I'm so overthinking about this.<eos> I just want to go to a movie and bury my face in vat of popcorn.<eos> You committed to this party, Aria.<eos> There's gonna be a gazillion people there.<eos> Nobody's gonna miss me.<eos> I will.
Think on this, that Melville did expose an unguarded flank.<eos> He was most keen I should not explore his interests in the colonies.<eos> Why?<eos> We will search Lord Melville's pockets... and we will find his transgression.<eos> Mr Garrow.<eos> What is this rough treatment?<eos> Sir, I am no fist-fighting man, but neither am I a man whose obligations can be deflected by blows or threats.<eos> Admirable spirit.<eos> I trust a hot head will not cloud your attempts to prosecute Mr Lucas?<eos> It will not.
I had a three-shilling ticket to a box at Sadler's Wells.<eos> This performance is worth foregoing that.<eos> But is it a tragedy of vaulting ambition denied, or a comedy full of fools and mismatched love?<eos> I suppose you as weary of this extended skirmish we conduct, as I am myself.<eos> So be it.<eos> If I hurry I still make the second half.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> But you will miss the opportunity to avenge Lord Melville.<eos> If you have the means, I would have you share it, sir.<eos> I will.
Why, what happened?<eos> His feet were pointed directly at me the whole time.<eos> Did I do this?<eos> Am I dressing too provocatively?<eos> Do I need to get thicker pajamas?<eos> Maybe it's my posture.<eos> I have really sexy posture.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I will talk to him for you.<eos> No, you won't.
Who are you?<eos> Considering they called me When your system was compromised, I'd say I'm the guy that just took your job.<eos> A hospital would be nice about now.<eos> Where's the boy?<eos> I already told you, I don't know.<eos> How about your boss's name?<eos> You know that yet?<eos> I've got a family.<eos> You going to kill them too?<eos> Because he will.
This guy is really careful, so make sure you get everything you can.<eos> Even though she I.D.'d him doesn't mean we don't need forensics.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Okay, he drugs his victims, GHB usually.<eos> If the hospital hasn't already, you should take blood.<eos> He also takes his victims' hands, ties them behind their backs so they can't scratch him and get his DNA underneath their fingernails.<eos> Jo, I got it.<eos> It's all good, okay?<eos> If he left anything behind, I will find it.<eos> Of course you will.
But she's still a prostitute, Mac.<eos> We can get this guy, Jo.<eos> Jo?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanted to apologize for before.<eos> I didn't mean to be presumptuous about what you were feeling.<eos> Don't worry about that, Lindsay.<eos> The trust is, if I were really honest with myself, I do feel a little responsible, so hearing you say that to me, I just lost my cool for a second.<eos> We are gonna get this guy, Jo.<eos> We will.
I-I'm sorry.<eos> Then what are we really talking about?<eos> Is this about Breena perhaps?<eos> Your impending nuptials?<eos> Okay...<eos> I suppose with changes in my personal life, I could always count on a stable work environment.<eos> And now, suddenly, things seem to be changing for you as well, and I...<eos> Change is inevitable and necessary, like the seasons, Mr. Palmer.<eos> I suggest you embrace it.<eos> I will.
And it still is. Still.<eos> You see that, don't you.<eos> I still have to watch out, just so some other woman doesn't lure him away.<eos> Still.<eos> And all those infidelities had their advantages.<eos> There is no man more attentive than the one feeling guilty.<eos> Do you think a man would buy you a Valentino purse just like that? If he didn't feel guilty?<eos> -He got you a Valentino purse?<eos> -Not yet.<eos> But he will.
Is this what they call the "martial arts"?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I came here to see if your claim that I was stabbed was real or just an excuse for sexual harassment.<eos> But this is more important.

Finn, Jackie's early.<eos> She needs to go.<eos> No, no, thi-this is a perfect moment for us to learn about her past.<eos> Tell us about your childhood.<eos> My childhood?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where should I start?<eos> Chicago was very different when I was a girl.<eos> No, Mommy will help you.<eos> No, Mommy will.
And now what? !<eos> Right before retirement.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Go home and think it over.<eos> We'll keep in touch.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> I'd rip his balls off.<eos> Exactly!<eos> And we will, Sobczak.<eos> We will...
I've kept my head down, paid my dues.<eos> And, well, I think I'm ready to make detective.<eos> You've only been here a month.<eos> You really haven't done much of anything.<eos> And there's no such thing as security guard detective.<eos> We don't solve crimes.<eos> We barely prevent them.<eos> You wanna detect something?<eos> Do it on your own time.<eos> Maybe I will.

How did I get that on a booze cruise?<eos> This bacteria is most commonly found in Third World countries.<eos> But anywhere with poor hygiene will do.<eos> Like France.<eos> Like a passenger ferry.<eos> You're not going to close me down?<eos> You're not infectious.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll get back to it, then.<eos> No, you won't.
You want me to take that medication.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't.<eos> I think you should find your own way through this.<eos> With help.<eos> Talk to somebody? Yeah.<eos> My colleague Dr. Flores is a great listener.<eos> And just so you know, this may be the longest conversation I've ever had with a patient that didn't involve cutting their head open.<eos> You did good.<eos> So will you.
No, I only hated what he did for a living.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?<eos> Was he--I don't know-- conducting business?<eos> Mrs. D'agostino...<eos> I know that anger you're feeling right now--<eos> What it's like to lose someone you love.<eos> Help us find the men who did this to your husband.<eos> It doesn't matter if you find them.<eos> Elias will.
And I've noticed that car rides...<eos> It's okay, honey.<eos> I'll take good care of her.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Um, Mom?<eos> Yes?<eos> Going to prom and...<eos> and soccer games and... and... and all those normal things that you wanted for me-- ...will you just make sure that she gets them?<eos> Of course I will.
You made one with her, the-the lady of the house.<eos> Vivien.<eos> That's Violet's mother.<eos> And I can't give you that baby anymore.<eos> Everything's changed, Nora.<eos> I'm in love with Violet.<eos> I see.<eos> I just can't take her brother away.<eos> But I can.<eos> And I will.
Thank you for bringing these.<eos> I'll bring them to the doctor.<eos> I'd like to hear it from the doctor.<eos> Emergency C-section?<eos> I'm sure you're aware that these babies-- well, rather, one of these babies-- has been developing at a rapid rate.<eos> I mean, to the point where he's ready to come out and live on his own.<eos> And the other one seems to be getting weaker.<eos> Sometimes referred to as intrauterine omophagia.<eos> All the necessary nutrients are being devoured by the larger fetus.<eos> The alpha, if you will.
One more big push.<eos> Here she comes.<eos> Come on, push!<eos> Come on, honey, push!<eos> Push!<eos> Push, honey!<eos> God, I love you.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I never wanted to lose you.<eos> You never will.
Go away!<eos> Violet, it's okay.<eos> Calm down, okay?<eos> I feel like I'm totally losing it.<eos> They're from the past.<eos> The ghosts of people who've died here.<eos> They're appearing to you now because you're evolved.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> All you have to do is tell them to go away.<eos> And they will.
What do you mean?<eos> He interrogated us... me, Lynette, and Susan.<eos> He called us down to the station and grilled us one by one.<eos> Why didn't he call me down there?<eos> Good question, given this whole thing is about you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Bree, he wants revenge. He wants to bring you down, and we're all gonna go down with you.<eos> Gaby, please.<eos> I will figure out a way to make things better.<eos> No, you won't.
You all squared away?<eos> I'm set, thanks.<eos> Are you coming, shiv?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Go to bed.<eos> You know, just give me a second.<eos> Of course.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I don't want to mess anything up for you.<eos> You won't.
My husband.<eos> Hi.<eos> Good to meet you, Michael.<eos> Great to meet you.<eos> I don't wear a ring to work.<eos> It actually, uh, it nearly fell down the drain while I was washing up.<eos> Honey, we have a reservation.<eos> Yes.<eos> We'll figure it out tomorrow.<eos> Yep, we will.
I met Anton.<eos> And he really helped clear all the heavy stuff.<eos> That's why I thought he could help your patients.<eos> Look, I get it that it worked for you, but I do real medicine.<eos> Hey, Lucille, you headed home?<eos> Dr. Zeke says I am.<eos> BP's normal, drip worked.<eos> That's good news.<eos> you come in here every day this week so I can check your BP and make sure you're taking your meds.<eos> I will.
He told Charlie he needed his luck to change.<eos> Probably a veiled threat.<eos> What if he kills her?<eos> Nah, he wants his money too much.<eos> Just stick to the plan.<eos> Charlie called Moretti, told him to meet him at the casino, first thing in the morning when the banks open.<eos> Once you turn over the $10 million, he'll turn over Nadine.<eos> And then we'll arrest him for Sam's murder.<eos> And what if he smells a trap?<eos> He won't.
It's coming out either way.<eos> The only thing you can control is when and what it means.<eos> - What it means?<eos> - You're the Facebook generation, sir.<eos> Every candidate under 40 has some dumb photo from some dumb college buddy.<eos> Krystal Ball and the reindeer nose.<eos> - Well, she lost.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But she didn't release it.<eos> You will.
So where the hell are the parkas?<eos> I moved 'em to the center aisle. The storm's coming.<eos> Figured closer to the cash register, we'd sell more of 'em.<eos> Well, I like the fishing vests front and center.<eos> It's not fishing season.<eos> Well, I wasn't aware of that.<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because you also moved the calendars.<eos> Listen, Ed, if you don't like any of this stuff, just make the call.<eos> Oh, I will.
I know.<eos> But you love him, right?<eos> Well, it's just...<eos> You know, it's...<eos> Dads can't help it.<eos> There's no use holding it against them.<eos> Well, Gibbs.<eos> Good luck keeping that head of yours on straight.<eos> Good luck trying to beat my times.<eos> Oh... I will.
- All right.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Thanks very much.<eos> Okay, so I made an appointment with Dr. Pelikan today at 3:00, but I know that you can't make it, so what should I do?<eos> Should I go by myself, or should I just reschedule it or try to go for a different day?<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Why don't you go see Dr. Pelikan yourself, and uh, you know, just see what he has to say.<eos> If that's gonna make you feel better, you know, he might have an opinion about how to handle this.<eos> - So go for it.<eos> - Okay, I will.
I'm sure he's heard about my legal troubles at the agency.<eos> A man in my position might need some place to stash the money.<eos> Well, if he suspects anything, he'll kill us both.<eos> Then you'd better be convincing.<eos> I look forward to meeting your husband.<eos> Does Langley know about this plan?<eos> You mean Joan.<eos> Joan appreciates resourcefulness.<eos> All that matters is whether or not the job gets done.<eos> And it will.
Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lovely.<eos> How nice.<eos> We've been married 25 years this year, haven't we?<eos> You get less for murder.<eos> Imagine that, Paul.<eos> Imagine being married to me for 25 years.<eos> He'll end up killing me.<eos> No, I won't.
But Gia's mother... she's gotta know.<eos> She just--she can't--<eos> Talking to George before-- look, a guy like that, raping a girl, in his own family over and over and--<eos> Do you think I wanted to talk to him?<eos> I wanted to tear his head off.<eos> My old partner, he, uh... there were a few times he came pretty close.<eos> How do you handle it?<eos> You do everything you can to make sure he never sees the light of day again.<eos> If he walks--<eos> He won't.
Has your mom come to see you yet?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't want her to.<eos> I mean, I know I'll have to forgive her to move on, but... not today.<eos> You sound strong.<eos> Dr. Whitmere warned me it's only temporary.<eos> It's gonna be a long road back.<eos> I'll probably screw it up.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Well, you know, I've been in this situation myself more than a couple of times, so...<eos> Tell you what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna lend you the $400, okay, but it's a one-time thing.<eos> - Yes. - I know that you're working<eos> - Of course.<eos> very hard, but it's not cutting it.<eos> So obviously you're going to have to figure something else out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're a smart girl.<eos> You will.
Now.<eos> My money first. Here.<eos> Here.<eos> What is this, man?<eos> What?<eos> Tens, twenties?<eos> There's less than two grand here.<eos> I-I...<eos> I promise I'll get all of it somehow.<eos> I will.
I'm gonna go to the museum.<eos> - Okay, the police are here.<eos> - Haddie, wait.<eos> You got to let 'em know that he's autistic and that he's gonna behave erratically and that he's not used to being alone.<eos> - You got that?<eos> - I know.<eos> - Do you hear me?<eos> - I know.<eos> - Haddie.<eos> - Okay. I will.
Yes?<eos> I can't.<eos> It's too much.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm gonna miss you. - Mm.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> Yep.<eos> She will.
That's non-negotiable.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Where are we at with Grace?<eos> No TV, no computer except homework.<eos> No calls except to us.<eos> And no calling Jimmy Patrick.<eos> That's that Christian kid she was with?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I'll talk to him.<eos> No, I will.
Oh, shit.<eos> You guys ever seen Boys Don't Cry?<eos> When Hilary Swank plays that dude.<eos> That scared the shit out of me.<eos> Wait, Slide.<eos> Sit down and talk with us for a second.<eos> These guys ain't got what it take.<eos> I can look in their eyes and see it.<eos> First sign of trouble, they're gonna be shitting in their pants.<eos> They will not.
The prize is near, Father.<eos> Soon you will have not only the mask, but the blood to fill it.<eos> Marique, how your mother yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.<eos> Imagine the secrets she will bring back from the realm of the dead.<eos> And imagine how indomitable I will become when she's once again by my side.<eos> Father...<eos> If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...<eos> It will not fail.<eos> If it does...<eos> It will not!
My wallet, it's gone.<eos> Come on, Snowy!<eos> Up there! Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Steady on<eos> I've lost him.<eos> You must find my wallet.<eos> It's very important, I have to get it back.<eos> And you will.
You used to say I'm the one who makes use of you to earn money, right?<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'll cancel that.<eos> Thank you very much, Representative Nam.<eos> Hey, Jjangdol, stop calling me 'Representative Nam',<eos> just call me 'hyung'.<eos> I only said I feel like...<eos> who wants to call you 'hyung'?<eos> Trying calling and see.<eos> I won't.
I have a greater chance of being pregnant than being cricketers.<eos> It's time for lunch, so get with you.<eos> Rain Man and Spud, rode my bed.<eos> Spud, do you want all at school must think you're a sissy?<eos> It did not expect to.<eos> And therefore I with a mission.<eos> It becomes dangerous.<eos> We can be kicked out of school. We may even die.<eos> Who is on a prohibited completely mad dip?<eos> I will not.
I did not put her up to this.<eos> - Coke? Diet Coke?<eos> - No, I don't want a Diet Coke. Thank you.<eos> Step aside!<eos> - Jerry, I would like to talk to you.<eos> - Now, you're gonna bust a cap in my ass?<eos> What if I get the ratings up?<eos> We've got six weeks.<eos> What if I move that needle just enough?<eos> - You won't.
No.<eos> No, keep it routine.<eos> - You got an address on this guy?<eos> - Some dump in Long Beach.<eos> Probably good for a week, if that.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Little Tokyo. Let's go.<eos> Now are we going to the museum?<eos> Just a sec, honey.<eos> We will.
Not that way.<eos> This way<eos> America.<eos> Come.<eos> These are all our products and these are the details.<eos> You will be given the names and addresses of all the salons.<eos> You will go to every one of them and sell these.<eos> Understand?<eos> No.<eos> You will.
I couldn't meet him in Washington, so, now I'm going to Santa Fe.<eos> One can achieve everything by trying, Mandira.<eos> Like I found that place.<eos> That day.<eos> Yes, I'm coming, coming.<eos> Khan, thank God.<eos> Where were you all these days?<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> You could have called.<eos> But no, you won't.
And they threatened hurt me.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just really, really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry Mrs..<eos> - Sorry is not good enough.<eos> That's just not good enough.<eos> Thank you for asking for leniency for me.<eos> I didn't do it for you, I did it for your mom.<eos> My mom won't forgive me.<eos> She will.
You don't even know what I was gonna ask.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're gonna ask me if I can do a reading for you.<eos> Look, Melanie, I barely know you... but I like you a lot.<eos> Really, a lot.<eos> Is there any way we could pretend that maybe we go back in time... and just forget about the phone ringing, and my brother's message...<eos> - and we never had this conversation?<eos> - Why?<eos> If we open the door and go down that road... any chance that we had of having something normal will just be gone.<eos> It just will.
Can only be 15 minutes to the top.<eos> I don't want to miss the train.<eos> Yeah, well that's a good point.<eos> Don't miss the train.<eos> No.<eos> Only two and a half hours.<eos> Time is going to fly.<eos> I'll stay here.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I will.
I don't want to not make plans with you.<eos> I want to make plans with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> In all my life, I never thought I'd see you down on one knee.<eos> Yeah, it's getting a bit damp down here, so...<eos> What's it to be, Anna from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
I was cleaning cars.<eos> I picked up his gun! I've never even touched a gun before. You were going to shoot him, him and...<eos> Oh my God, is she--<eos> She's fine. She fainted.<eos> You've never fired a gun before?<eos> Well, just give it to me now.<eos> -Don't.<eos> -Why?<eos> -He'll shoot you.<eos> -I will not.
- You are not.<eos> - I'm 22 years old.<eos> I see fellas like fucking Luciano with a fancy suit with fucking diamonds...<eos> - is that what you want?<eos> - That's what you want too!<eos> That's what... It's what we all want.<eos> At least I got the gumption to take it.<eos> You'd be very foolish to underestimate me, James.<eos> I could have you killed.<eos> Yeah, but you won't.
He's not done yet.<eos> It's the Kensington sniper all over again.<eos> What's a Kensington sniper?<eos> A few years ago, a guy shot four strangers and then his own wife, trying to make a personal killing look like a serial.<eos> The guard works for the woman's husband. I think the two victims were just a decoy.<eos> The guard is gonna kill her.<eos> I need to be in that elevator right now!<eos> Move!<eos> Please don't let him kill me, Ben.<eos> I won't.
That's lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm not stupid, William.<eos> Three dead bodies and a pocket full of money?<eos> Doesn't take a genius to work out what the pair of you have been up to.<eos> I think it's the best bloody idea you've ever had.<eos> One condition-- I want a pound for every body you sell.<eos> A pound? - - Man starts getting fancy clothes... also starts getting fancy ideas.<eos> Just think of it as a tax between a man and a wife.<eos> A kind of nuptial agreement, if you will.
I'll cook you up some eggs.<eos> - I have a boyfriend.<eos> - That's not a problem for me.<eos> I should've just told you about the interview, about everything.<eos> You know, no matter what.<eos> No.<eos> You know, we'll figure it out.<eos> We'll just...we'll just figure it out.<eos> I know that you keep saying that we're gonna figure it out... but we haven't.<eos> But we will.
- Martin has no mother.<eos> So I usually get the letters.<eos> But I have not seen them.<eos> - She was run over by a roadhog.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> We are doing very well alone, ain't we Martin?<eos> - Are you going to the colony?<eos> - Yes, if I may.<eos> Of course you may. Will you?<eos> Sure, I will then!
Mona?<eos> No. ...<eos> Would it be okay if she was?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know what?<eos> You will be in school next summer.<eos> No, I will not.<eos> I will only go to kindergarten.<eos> - Why would you not go to school?<eos> - I just will not.
This is gonna sound really stupid.<eos> It's just that my girlfriends and I... came all the way up from Salem State. I was kind of the dumbass who said that I could pay... for all three of the tickets on my mom's credit card. And then I left her credit card... at the gas station.<eos> - Right.<eos> - No, I mean...<eos> I totally have money. Just not enough for all three, you know?<eos> - How much?<eos> - 50?<eos> I could lose my job.<eos> No no, he's not going for it.<eos> Yes he will.
- Yes, that's her!<eos> Right there!<eos> I thought your parents died.<eos> That's what they told me, but look, I saw the beauty mark!<eos> Didn't his parents sign a release so he could work?<eos> Jorge forged it.<eos> Jorge, please, tell them to play the newsreel again!<eos> Okay, we'll talk to them later.<eos> We can't now.<eos> But you will, right?
Thank you, Anna.<eos> - Let's do each others' hair.<eos> - I have beads and hair clips.<eos> - Really?<eos> - We'll be leaving soon.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To Anna's place.<eos> - Don't go!<eos> - We'll come with you.<eos> No, you won't, you piglets.
MINISTER'S DAUGHTER MISSING<eos> This is what we're going to do.<eos> We'll forget the whole thing.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just keep quiet.<eos> They'll handle it.<eos> - How?<eos> - We'll settle out of court.<eos> - I intend to confess.<eos> - No, you won't.
You want a line?<eos> No.<eos> You wanna blow some smoke?<eos> No.<eos> Then I guess I got nothin' for you.<eos> Go on.<eos> Don't tell nobody it was me who told you this, okay?<eos> But you're going to have to go on up the hill and ask for a talk with Thump Milton.<eos> Now, I hope he'll talk with you.<eos> He generally won't.
- The whole thing hinges on you.<eos> - Dude, I have no idea what she just...<eos> It's kind of intimidating.<eos> I think we're at the back.<eos> I believe we go last.<eos> - Tonight's the night.<eos> - And what night is that?<eos> The night you finally fall for me.<eos> - I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Better work's coming.<eos> You know, a lot of businesses going belly up in this economy.<eos> Tons of shit just sitting there, just waiting to be picked.<eos> And I know you could use the money, especially if you ever want to play pool again.<eos> Not exactly flush.<eos> Well, hell, let's change that.<eos> Hey, can I get a beer for my poor relation?<eos> We'll be seeing you.<eos> You know, Giddons finds out that you and Bo have been chatting, he's gonna send you right back up, you know?<eos> He probably will anyway.
With time itself resurrecting them, to find new ways of dying, over and over again, a travesty of life.<eos> Isn't it better to end it, at last?<eos> Thank you for your opinion.<eos> SHE SCREAMS<eos> I will NOT die!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> !<eos> A billion years of Time Lord history riding on our backs.<eos> I will not let this perish.<eos> I will not!
Shaft walls collapse after about six feet.<eos> Besides, 90 feet vertical is a bloody long way to move water.<eos> We've got electricity down there, don't we?<eos> We propose sinking a shaft down to a gallery beneath the Berlin Sap, right here.<eos> Install electric pumps.<eos> Should free up 60 men at least.<eos> Rutledge?<eos> This is over 90 feet deep.<eos> I shouldn't have thought an electric pump would lift water that high...<eos> The new ones will, sir.
You're the problem.<eos> You have been for a long time.<eos> Tirza, get rid of that lollypop.<eos> It's bad for your teeth.<eos> What have you done, for God's sake?<eos> -l threw that Kraut out.<eos> That's no reason to hit him on the head with a lamp.<eos> My daughter is not included in the rent.<eos> How will you make up for this?<eos> -Yes, daddy, how will you?
-And now?<eos> I have a bag in my suitcase with some sort of blue cloth in it.<eos> A little present for Tirza.<eos> A summer wrap.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Tomorrow I'm going to the consulate and check out the hostels.<eos> Call me when you know something.<eos> And check your e-mail from time to time.<eos> She might write.<eos> I will.
Take off your beanie, Jack.<eos> How'd you go this week, huh?<eos> Did you win?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great!<eos> Now all will know you're aboard.<eos> Crew in place.<eos> We'll sit here at anchor until the storm blows through.<eos> At least I won't get seasick.<eos> No, you won't.
We have missed the target. 20 seconds to reload.<eos> Sir, Bertha's slowing down.<eos> Her rate of volcanic activity is decreasing.<eos> Come on, stay with me.<eos> I have a shot!<eos> Take it!<eos> He was here.<eos> People saw him only a few minutes ago.<eos> I know, I got the same story, and something about a... dancing, and apparently, quite well.<eos> Will dancing?
Alright, bring me something!<eos> That will do fine for you!<eos> I don't take orders from you!<eos> That shit won't cut!<eos> You mean you can't do it?<eos> Not with that, asshole!<eos> I want proper tools.<eos> What tools, you arrogant prick?<eos> Use this!<eos> Fine, I will.
We have been waiting for a long time.<eos> Dormant for more than sixty years.<eos> And we are not trying to scare anyone, Shade.<eos> It's just, what's coming, [chuckling and panting] something is gonna happen that can't be stopped!<eos> And you get to witness the birth firsthand.<eos> I'm so excited! Hm.<eos> Fuck you, you delusional dick, fuck!<eos> Such ugly, ugly words from a pretty, pretty girl.<eos> You are never gonna find a man with a mouth like that, are you, Shade?<eos> Or will ya?
The messenger has been put to grass.<eos> And you will follow, If a word of this transaction parts your lips again.<eos> I shit myself.<eos> [pietros] ashur?<eos> Ashur.<eos> Young pietros!<eos> How does the day find you?<eos> As the night, filled with worry.<eos> Barca never returned.<eos> Nor will he.
Roquefort!<eos> She used to take out the mould.<eos> There wasn't much left but the little there was, she ate it with such pleasure!<eos> She takes the mould out of Roquefort?<eos> - The blue bits?<eos> - Green.<eos> But it's the best bit!<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'll never eat Roquefort again! Ever!<eos> - You will, and your mother too, tonight.
How could you want to chase around some human who would freak the fuck out if he knew what you are?<eos> You really think you can take up with that boy?<eos> We ain't supposed to mix!<eos> -lt's your duty to mate with Felton.<eos> -But I don't love Felton.<eos> You ain't gotta love him.<eos> You lie under him, bear his kids, keep his bloodline going.<eos> -Especially now that you done ruined mine.<eos> -l can't go back there.<eos> I won't.
My-my son's inside.<eos> yeah, her boy.<eos> Above the news agents'.<eos> I don't know how long it's been going.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's all right.<eos> They're on their way.<eos> But it could have been a hell of a lot worse.<eos> Well, I'll you what,
Okay, sweetie, enough.<eos> Hey, I wasn't done.<eos> Nicki?<eos> Do you know how much she's making Selling that tv trading post junk to shut-ins?<eos> - Look what I found.<eos> - It is none of our business.<eos> Oh, my--<eos> You need to tell bill.<eos> Well, you're assuming she hasn't already.<eos> All right, I will.
I just want to go home, okay?<eos> Please?<eos> Oh, god, i just want to go home.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like?<eos> This is all useless garbage.<eos> All right, you need to stop, all right?<eos> Why, because this is gonna mean something?<eos> It won't.
That isn't you lecturing me, is it, liam?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Because I am well aware of all the risk factors In each of these scenarios.<eos> I designed most of them.<eos> But this is an error -- pure and simple.<eos> An error I hold you personally responsible for.<eos> [ keys clacking ] [ indistinct voice over p.A. ] It won't happen again.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
I am sorry.<eos> They're right here.<eos> There you go.<eos> Strawberries.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I need whipped cream.<eos> Unless you think the strawberries are gonna magically stick to the waffles by themselves.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Say "please."<eos> I will not.
Why did it take you so long?<eos> You could have left any time you wanted.<eos> Not empty-handed.<eos> I'm going to take you for everything you've got.<eos> No. No. No!<eos> That's enough!<eos> He would have killed me!<eos> Mr Fincher, what I've just seen constitutes a criminal assault.<eos> If your wife wants to press charges...<eos> She won't.
You must leave...<eos> Now.<eos> All right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> no!<eos> You bastards!<eos> You can't just leave me here!<eos> Man: They can.<eos> And they will.
Right, gentlemen.<eos> Saddle up.<eos> MUSIC: "Beat It" by Michael Jackson<eos> Hoorsten's just arrived.<eos> 'All units sit tight.'<eos> SHAZ: 'Standing by.'<eos> It's nearly 12.<eos> Could have done with Ray and Chris here.<eos> They'll show.<eos> No, they won't.
I don't want it to get screwed up!<eos> This family manages.<eos> We get by.<eos> You just don't know any differently because you think what we have is normal.<eos> I do this with him every night.<eos> I take the urn to bed with me, and I talk to him about my day.<eos> 16 years,<eos> I've been asking him for advice and and waiting to hear his laugh, and for him to tell me that he loves me.<eos> And he never does.<eos> And he never will.
Our people are looking into it.<eos> We will find them.<eos> Good.<eos> And then I'll eviscerate them.<eos> If we cross this line, erica,<eos> And we get into bed with a guy likhobbes,<eos> There is no turning back.<eos> She has my son.<eos> If I have to cross a line to blow that bitch out of the sky,<eos> I will.
Tyler, I need to talk to you about the visitors.<eos> No.<eos> There's something I have to tell you.<eos> Mom, listen.<eos> It's very, very - I<eos> - I joined the peace ambassadors.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of the v's anymore.<eos> I'm not afraid of the visitors, ty.<eos> I'm just afraid of losing you.<eos> You won't.
Sydney won't go to her superiors with his identity until she knows whether she's turned him or burned him.<eos> When Sydney contacts him, he'll do what she says.<eos> Long enough to track her and bring her in.<eos> - I have to do what she says?<eos> - No, you don't. No, he doesn't.<eos> This is my family.<eos> - Come on. - It's the only way to keep him safe.<eos> Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way.<eos> If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you.<eos> I will, Devon.
Or there's that room where it happened.<eos> George said he wouldn't use it again, I could go there.<eos> I mean about telling him.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> Well, it's the full moon tomorrow.<eos> I don't want to go on my own.<eos> Of course, yeah.<eos> Course I will.
Get inside, everyone!<eos> They must be somewhere.<eos> Aliena!<eos> Percy!<eos> Get up!<eos> Da!<eos> No!<eos> Surrender, traitor!<eos> I'd rather die for Maud.<eos> Then so will every man, woman and child in this keep!
He's won his title.<eos> William Hamleigh is a tyrant!<eos> He's attacked Kingsbridge, murdered its citizens, yet freely walks among us whenever he wishes.<eos> King Stephen has seen fit to strip him of his title, but it is up to us to strip him of his lands.<eos> I have soldiers, friends from the crusade who will lead the charge and bear the brunt of the battle, but I need men to back them up.<eos> I will reward you with what gold we capture.<eos> William will be punished for the evil he has done, and the blood of your wives and children will be avenged!<eos> There's not enough of us to take a castle!<eos> We'll never make it inside the gate.<eos> Oh yes, we will.
Perhaps you can send the girl you sent last night.<eos> Uh, you must mean Hannah.<eos> Right.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Absolutely, I think she'd be happy to come back out, and in fact, to make up for the hiccup, it's on the house.<eos> I can even send her supervisor along.<eos> But I... cannot do that actually, um...<eos> He is busy.<eos> I'm sure she'll be able to handle the problem herself.<eos> She-she will indeed, absolutely.
We'll do tests to reassure you and gradually you'll build up your confidence.<eos> I'm not an actress.<eos> In that case, I finish the play.<eos> She performs it in Paris.<eos> V\ﬁthout me on the opening night, of course.<eos> And you take over on tour.<eos> What counts is a strong presence.<eos> What's said is meaningless unless the right person says it.<eos> For me, the only obstacle is being afraid to let me down.<eos> But you won't.
God Damn it!<eos> Christ.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Pick up. Pick up.<eos> Hey, obviously I can't get to the phone right now, so at the beep you know what to do.<eos> Hey...<eos> I guess you're sleeping.<eos> You're not going to believe this.<eos> Actually... You probably will.
Actually... You probably will.<eos> He's coming to meet me at the coffee shop today.<eos> Excellent.<eos> And he thinks you're Cameron.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You want me to come with you?<eos> I would love to see this train-wreck in person because it's so much better than reality tv.<eos> Take my advice on this.<eos> Do this alone.<eos> I will.
No<eos> Ye-jin<eos> Ye-jin<eos> No<eos> Seok-hyun...<eos> Sang-jun...<eos> I think Jung-woo's awake...<eos> He'll go back to sleep<eos> What if he hears him and wakes up?<eos> He won't...
You mean my sister?<eos> What, so you're mad at me?<eos> I'm late, okay?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Just tell me... tell me what's going on.<eos> You were supposed to help me find my mom.<eos> Have you even tried?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, all right?<eos> No excuses.<eos> I will.
The one in the department leading recovery operations at the time was Kozo Aihara, our current governor.<eos> Aihara found a young girl.<eos> A girl parasitized by a green alien.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She escaped.<eos> Finding her will be your job.<eos> I find her and then what?<eos> I reproduce the aliens.<eos> Reproduce?<eos> And the world will...?
And they couldn't find anything to pin on me then either, could they, Edmund?<eos> What are you doing, mummy?<eos> Oh just old clutter.<eos> Lots of things I should have got rid of long ago.<eos> I'd rather you stayed in, Miranda.<eos> You're still off-colour, and besides -<eos> I know what you're going to say.<eos> There really is a maniac on the loose.<eos> Will you stay indoors? For me?<eos> Of course I will.
Do you have more recent pictures of your mother?<eos> We don't own a camera.<eos> No, of course.<eos> Cameras have no optic nerve.<eos> The photos would only show their deformities.<eos> You have to go.<eos> - I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house. - Quite right.<eos> But may I use your bathroom?<eos> You know my mother will be home soon. You should go.<eos> We will.
So you get us all the way back in here, and then you tell us that you're not a guide.<eos> Well no, I'm an engineer.<eos> But this is what I really wanna do.<eos> That's wonderful to hear.<eos> I've always wanted to be a supermodel but I don't think that's actually gonna workout, you know?<eos> Jesus!<eos> What if these things move?<eos> They've been here for millions of years.<eos> They're not gonna move.<eos> - Sure they will!
- Not anymore!<eos> - Please!<eos> You can't just...<eos> - Watch me!<eos> I've got some errands to run.<eos> Will, you're in charge.<eos> And the rest of you had better be fast asleep by the time I get back.<eos> It's OK, Janie.<eos> We'll get it back.<eos> No, we won't.
Or what do you think, Sebbe?<eos> How can you sink so low as to steal some else's jacket?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'll report it to the police.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> You want me to make you something to eat?<eos> Let's forget what happened.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> -Call me a thief, then.<eos> -I won't.
I was an idiot.<eos> I was lost, Dad.<eos> You have to believe me, I'm not that person any more.<eos> You've done nothing wrong.<eos> You've got nothing to hide.<eos> Just tell them what you told me.<eos> Just tell the police everything, and we can get on with our lives.<eos> Look, I believe you.<eos> I do.<eos> And so will they.
It's just that, uh, anyone can check the jacket.<eos> Uh... I'm going with someone else...<eos> Serena, actually.<eos> We're old friends from boarding school.<eos> Serena's with Nate now.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> She's the one who called and asked me, so...<eos> Well, you know she's changed since boarding school, and, uh, there's... there's no way she's gonna go to a state dinner wearing a jacket filled with pills.<eos> I probably won't tell her about that then.<eos> Well, then maybe I will.
It's alright, he has the control, André.<eos> Wait André. Wait, André.<eos> Shit..<eos> Don't shoot, André!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> -He's gonna die, man.<eos> -Put down the gun, Beirada.<eos> I won't put it fucking down.<eos> Put it down because he won't shoot anymore.<eos> -He will, brother.
I'm gonna investigate his death.<eos> I'm gonna find out what happened to André, Fábio.<eos> If you know something, you better tell me now.<eos> Nascimento, André was also my friend.<eos> And I believe in my men.<eos> If you find out something, let me know.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> It will get bad, shit.<eos> -Why it will get bad?<eos> -because it will!
I don't think anyone will bother it.<eos> At about that man in the road?<eos> Was he a...?<eos> From what I could tell. Yeah.<eos> You don't kn him?<eos> If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him.<eos> I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the vamp bar and grill.<eos> You brought me to a bar?<eos> Damon, I'm not old enough. They're not going to let me in.<eos> Sure they will.
There's a box.<eos> And it's Thanksgiving Day.<eos> So, they get ready to eat. What is Ross and Rachel doing?<eos> They're fighting.<eos> So, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are all together.<eos> Although, is Phoebe there?<eos> Yes.<eos> So...<eos> I will now drink eight glasses of milk in three minutes. No.<eos> No, you won't. No, you won't.
Happy's a welcome addition.<eos> Tell them.<eos> Tacoma's growing a little thick.<eos> I was hoping to jump to a smaller charter.<eos> You thinking about coming back to Charming?<eos> Yeah, gonna put in a request to transfer next church.<eos> That in's on Tig, brother.<eos> We'll make it happen.<eos> All right, man.<eos> We will?
Where is he?<eos> Vancouver.<eos> Somewhere.<eos> You're heading up there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We hired a guy to help track him down.<eos> Going to take Gemma, head out after Nate's taken care of.<eos> Did you tell Gemma about Abel?<eos> Not yet.<eos> We will.
Yeah.<eos> That was a great victory.<eos> Well, it almost wasn't.<eos> The D'Harans had us surrounded. We were out of food and water. Our commander deserted us.<eos> You still managed to defeat them.<eos> A rider arrived with news that the Seeker had driven back the D'Harans at the Battle of Rising Ridge.<eos> It was one man against hundreds.<eos> It inspired us to break through the D'Haran line.<eos> I hope you get the chance to tell him that story.<eos> I will.
Amen!<eos> Amen.<eos> How's your hand?<eos> Better than his head.<eos> Thanks for sticking up for me.<eos> You've had to do that a lot lately.<eos> I'm pretty sure nobody thinks I can do this movie.<eos> Since when do you give a crap about what anybody else thinks?<eos> It's just... what if I screw up?<eos> You won't.
Carmichael?<eos> Uh, uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> Hope this doesn't take too long.<eos> Got a date later.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't- that shouldn't be a problem.<eos> This should be... fast.<eos> These are, uh, some photos of some folks that I work with.<eos> Just wanted to see if maybe you recognize any of them.<eos> Uh, yeah, maybe I will.
A court case would be a p.R. Nightmare.<eos> We ave to settle.<eos> You'll take care of it?<eos> Settlements are for the guilty-<eos> Celebrities who run people over, the catholic church.<eos> It's not fair. The historical society is honoring my father tonight.<eos> I can't have this overshadowing the evening Or anything else.<eos> This way, the case will be sealed.<eos> The press won't know.<eos> No one will.
Or... Maybe one guy's a new waiter, the second one's training him and the third's from maintenance, finally off his lazy ass to fix the AC.<eos> Oh. Yeah, I guess that could happen.<eos> Point is, you come out of the john waving this around nobody's gonna bug you for a tip.<eos> Here. It's a gift.<eos> Thanks, wow, that's slippery.<eos> And the safety's off so be careful, it could go off for, like no reason.<eos> Now what're these pills?<eos> Oh, just antihistamines mostly.<eos> You just rest, Ms. Archer. We'll take care of these DD-14s for you.<eos> Damn right you will. Idiot.
Oh, for pete's sake, well, I gotta go talk to her.<eos> I gotta apologize. No!<eos> No!<eos> Don't... yes.<eos> Marshall, I'm just gonna tell her that it happened, That it meant nothing and that I'm sorry.<eos> No, I...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do that.<eos> I will.
Thanks to "coupon privatization" there is hope for a better future.<eos> The Harvard Funds offer us a chance to invest.<eos> Crime has risen by 50% since last year.<eos> The police want to get tougher in the fight against organized crime<eos> - and continue to...<eos> ...to be corrupt.<eos> Shit, fuck...<eos> You pig, I told you not to eat in my car.<eos> - You'll clean it, you hear me?<eos> - Okay, I will.
The popularity of my client has nothing to do with the evidence.<eos> We have new evidence which will lead to reopening the case.<eos> Minister, you put in a request to review Kajínek's case.<eos> What led you to do it?<eos> I don't see a reason not to reopen this case which is tainted by an incredible number of procedural errors.<eos> Everybody in this country deserves a fair trial.<eos> After the pre-recorded studio debate we are returning to the special on the arrest of Jiøí Kajínek.<eos> You pig, I told you not to eat in my car.<eos> - You'll clean it, you hear me?<eos> - Okay, I will.
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her give up.<eos> Does everything always have to be about you?<eos> Do you have to be so selfish all the time?<eos> She's the one that's being selfish.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> She needs us right now.<eos> No, what she needs is to fight.<eos> And you need to stop acting like you know what's best for everyone, because you don't.<eos> If you leave, you're gonna regret this.<eos> Maybe. Maybe I will.
What about all your friends from school?<eos> They'll be anyone's friend... For the night.<eos> I was scared to tell you about N.Y.U.<eos> Because I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.<eos> I did everything to try and fit in, but I hate it there.<eos> My girl.<eos> One of the things that make Waldorf women so special is that we don't fit in everywhere.<eos> But I don't feel like I fit in anywhere.<eos> That's 'cause you haven't found the right place yet.<eos> You will.
- Good game. Good game.<eos> - Not good enough. This whole week was a waste.<eos> And tomorrow, I'm gonna get fired.<eos> I'm really sorry, dude.<eos> But for what it's worth, this week wasn't a waste.<eos> We were all having a really horrible week and you took our minds off it.<eos> Yeah. I had my first student drop my class.<eos> It sucked. I met my soul mate and he never called me back.<eos> I mean, yet.<eos> He will. He will.
She can be, uh, persistent.<eos> Is she hot?<eos> Yeahyeah, but she can be weird.<eos> Hot trumps weird, trust me.<eos> [whispering] he is ridiculously hot!<eos> Shh! He's an ass.<eos> What are you doing with all this stuff?<eos> I thought there might be something About my birth parents.<eos> Have you told jeremy?<eos> I will.
Too much?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thínk I'm seeíng thíngs agaín.<eos> I'm really sory.<eos> I don't care about the íob.<eos> Just l need to know that you're okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Stop by tomorrow and drop off your ID badge and all that, you know.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Let's see you get a new boyfriend after I have a talk with Cyril.<eos> About what, exactly?<eos> How you cried during a two-man threesome?<eos> Wooden spoons are a huge emotional trigger for me, Lana.<eos> Yeah, and now I know.<eos> And when I tell Pam... so will everybody in the office.<eos> - Oh, is that how you wanna play it?<eos> Fine! Keep your stupid bounty, then!<eos> And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.<eos> I will.
You okay, sir?<eos> No, I'm sorry, I'm not.<eos> I didn't think anything could be worse than losing my mother, But here I am again back in new york this way.<eos> She loved it here, didn't she?<eos> Yeah, ever since our first trip, she used to say That, um, this was the place with the tall buildings, And that she was gonna live here someday.<eos> It really doesn't make any sense.<eos> Who would want to hurt her?<eos> That's what we're trying to figure out, ma'am.<eos> You find the person who did this.<eos> We will.
I have marvellous news.<eos> Minnie, my eggs were scrambled to creamy perfection.<eos> And my pillows were so plump last night I slept like a chick.<eos> I cannot seem to sleep at all.<eos> That's excitement at meeting the Bishop hisself.<eos> I am rather bemused, I must confess.<eos> Three days till His Reverend comes to consecrate the new font, and I have not received an invitation to tea at the Rectory.<eos> Oh, I received mine two weeks ago.<eos> I have heard that the Bishop is extremely fond of Queen cake, so I will need you to prepare me some rose water, Minnie.<eos> I surely will, ma'am.
Guess what I am, uh, Looking at right now.<eos> Florida.<eos> I am above you right now.<eos> I wish you were up here, janet.<eos> I know you didn't support this trip.<eos> But maybe it took me coming up here to realize<eos> The only reason this trip means anything to me Is because I get to come home to you.<eos> You're my world, baby.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> I always will.
See you up front.<eos> All righty.<eos> Be careful with that; it's linen.<eos> Yoo hoo!<eos> Ooh, lemonade!<eos> It's for Jessie.<eos> Aw, thanks, Judith.<eos> I'll bring the tray down when I'm done.<eos> Actually, I've been thinking and I want you to have it.<eos> A passing of the tray, if you will.
But not all of life's turning points are so easily navigated.<eos> And turbulent spirits can come in many guises.<eos> Oh, Laura.<eos> You look lovely. And Minnie.<eos> Perfect!<eos> I've never been to a house-warming before.<eos> What do you suppose will happen? We don't know.<eos> Anything could happen.<eos> Isn't that why parties are fun?<eos> And perhaps it will!
You know my ma.<eos> She's probably got thrupence sewn in her bloomers where the bailiffs couldn't find it.<eos> Why aren't you at school? !<eos> I'm not going to school.<eos> Will you speak for me to the farmer?<eos> Ask if I can have a day's work?<eos> Edmund!<eos> Do Ma and Pa know about this?<eos> It was Pa's idea.<eos> Will you?
Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just do me this favor.<eos> Before you quit, make damn sure that quitting is what she wants.<eos> All right, enough of this.<eos> Well, if you two are gonna go, you better go now before the other Interpol team gets here.<eos> Right now?<eos> Now.<eos> We'll hand over Arnaldo. We'll handle it.<eos> Well, I will.
- I think he'll be fine.<eos> - This isn't funny.<eos> Look, should he have asked us? Okay, yeah.<eos> But I think it's healthy.<eos> Hey, better hiking with eddie Than alone in his room with a bottle of pills.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's 19.<eos> Eventually, we gotta let him live a normal life.<eos> He's never gonna have a normal life.<eos> None of us will.
Susan, he's having second thoughts.<eos> I mean, come on, there's not a married man on earth Who didn't have second thoughts before he got married.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Co--I didn't mean...<eos> Okay, I'm done.<eos> Mwah. See ya, boys!<eos> Thanks for driving!<eos> Bye, gaby!<eos> Don't forget to friend us!<eos> Oh, I won't, fernando.
No, it's not.<eos> I've got five more slides.<eos> Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.<eos> He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.<eos> Very well.<eos> Enjoy yourself.<eos> You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades.<eos> I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.<eos> I'll talk to Leonard.<eos> You will?
I touched you!<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh, my goodness, look at this room!<eos> Champagne!<eos> Roses!<eos> Oh!<eos> And little chocolates!<eos> This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.<eos> Yeah, I forgot about all this.<eos> But I never will.
Small amusements to keep the day interesting.<eos> Now, what do you want, caffrey?<eos> I need your expertise.<eos> On this.<eos> The music box.<eos> You're finally admitting you never had it?<eos> You got closer than anyone else.<eos> We got closer,<eos> But that didn't work out.<eos> Maybe it will this time.
I'm bringing you with.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> There are too many of them.<eos> We can't do it alone, and, uh, you're pretty much the only game in town.<eos> Isn't that a bad idea?<eos> Cass and Bobby think so.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Well, they're right.<eos> Because either it's a trap to get me there, to make me say yes, or it's not a trap and I'm gonna say yes anyway.<eos> And I will.

Why were you calling Cate?<eos> I'm in love with her.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I want to tell her how I feel.<eos> What are you trying to do, stop the wedding?<eos> Then what?<eos> Say you guys get involved.<eos> What happens if you decide you made a huge mistake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I won't.
Only she's been wheezing, see.<eos> So have I.<eos> What is it bothering you, Mr Turrill?<eos> She will die.<eos> In fact, we will all die in the end, in our turn.<eos> That ain't the point of it.<eos> What if she dies and I don't?<eos> We must achieve speed, child.<eos> Speed and perfection.<eos> I surely will, ma'am.
Explain truthfully.<eos> Tell him you made a mistake.<eos> The soldier did not send the note.<eos> I will be putting myself entirely at his mercy.<eos> Like it or not, you're already at his mercy.<eos> For the first time in my life, I feel like I want to run.<eos> If my husband hears any of this...<eos> Oh, I can't bear it.<eos> I want to vanish away.<eos> But you won't.
And I love you too.<eos> Whatever you're doing, you can stop.<eos> All you got to do is stop.<eos> And I don't want to see you again.<eos> Understand?<eos> I thought he was with his friends.<eos> He was.<eos> Just not in a good way.<eos> You want to speak to him.<eos> I will.
Don't be upset.<eos> I think...<eos> Maybe it's time.<eos> Do I say thank you?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> But I think...<eos> Yes, you could be something I'm proud of.<eos> I'll never forget you.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
You took long enough getting here.<eos> We're playing Ace of Truth.<eos> And I can tell you we've learned a few things tonight.<eos> - Haven't we, Karen?<eos> - You said it had to be shocking.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Please don't say it.<eos> I'm still feeling queasy.<eos> Who's going to start?<eos> I will.
Thank you for You know.<eos> Can I hear my daughter's heartbeat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You have to live for two now.<eos> You understand?<eos> She was my baby.<eos> She was a bright light in this world.<eos> You have to live for her, too.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
There's something seriously wrong with me.<eos> Please, Chelsea, take me back and turn me into someone else.<eos> That wasn't a very good argument, was it?<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, that's the best I got.<eos> Okay, I guess I should get going.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Say goodbye to your dad for me.<eos> I will.
Dustin Kent was a stand-up partner.<eos> And your client is a gun runner, a killer, and a liar.<eos> I don't know if he has any imagination whatsoever.<eos> This was a huge win for the federal prosecutor in our ongoing war against illegal weapons.<eos> I'm flying back to Washington to brief the president on what an excellent job the U.S. Marshals Service did here today.<eos> Uh, give me a second?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Well, I didn't do it for you.<eos> You take care of them, you hear?<eos> I will.
I will take the land.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you, a developer now?<eos> Well, just maybe I am.<eos> Actually, I hear now is a good time to buy.<eos> What are you, his Realtor?<eos> No, he's right.<eos> Now is a great time - shut up, Gary!<eos> We have been laboring under the impression that you were gonna pay us with a portion of the recovered money.<eos> And I will.
- Well, I'm going to write to Murray.<eos> - He won't say anything different.<eos> Well, we have to start somewhere.<eos> Our duty is to Mary.<eos> Well, give him a date for when Mary's out of mourning.<eos> No one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself.<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
Yeah, like 2,000 bottles.<eos> Wha-can we be real?<eos> I need you and andy to work.<eos> You're the only couple That makes me still believe in marriage, you know?<eos> Ohh. So lame.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Hey, I found some red.<eos> Wait.<eos> You two made up?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
I thought you fell for Alex.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you Katie Ryan?<eos> I met an agent.<eos> He'll either sign me or marry me.<eos> Either way, this just might be the first day of the rest of my life.<eos> I... I can't represent you.<eos> He decided to sign you?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
It was the least I could do.<eos> I needed to let you know that I believe in you too.<eos> Hey, what happened, man?<eos> You were almost finished with this thing.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is Mom still mad at me?<eos> It's not you, buddy.<eos> Your mother really loves you.<eos> She always will. Promise.
Nothing.<eos> Is it Ricky or Ben?<eos> Or the new one?<eos> He said it was my fault.<eos> I don't even know what happened.<eos> And he knows I like wings.<eos> I don't even like pizza that much.<eos> Oh, Amy, you will get through this.<eos> You will.<eos> No, I won't.
You'd be amazed the kinds of places A duke gets you access to.<eos> And I thought you were just using him for a plus-one.<eos> No harm in having a little fun while I'm at it.<eos> Wow.<eos> Your gift to the italians?<eos> It's fancelli's study, "statua di vulcano."<eos> This is beautiful.<eos> Looks like the real thing.<eos> Don't let it fool you.<eos> I won't.
Girls, we must do everything we can to show those boys that it is not extravagance that wins the day, but beauty.<eos> Which boy would like to present the horse?<eos> James, you can be the horse.<eos> And who would like to be the doctor?<eos> Lawrence, you be the doctor.<eos> GLASS SMASHES Oh, Lizzie!<eos> It's all right.<eos> We can mend it. Don't look so fearful.<eos> But you said we must win, Mrs Brown.<eos> We will, girls.
You've stared down the barrel of a gun before.<eos> We're dealing with like 100 Clarks here.<eos> I don't know if I can dodge this speeding bullet.<eos> Well, you're not in it alone.<eos> We're a team, right? You got me?<eos> Hey.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't think talking me off a ledge is gonna help us solve our technical difficulties.<eos> Okay, uh, well, then maybe this will.
I mean, I know she's your wife, so I should keep my mouth shut, but she can't keep hers shut, so why can't you keep your fucking mouth shut, bitch?<eos> Time for a little chitchat.<eos> Um, I get the anger, 'cause we're all angry.<eos> But here's the deal... this thing with Neil, you can't keep hiding stuff from him, 'cause it's not cool.<eos> I mean, the engagement was one thing, but come on... you're having the man's baby.<eos> This isn't a game.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, tell him, please.<eos> I will.
But she wanted to do this, Eddie.<eos> - She wanted to carry these babies.<eos> You know she did.<eos> - She never wanted to live like this.<eos> Listen to that thing.<eos> It shoves air into her and it sucks it out.<eos> She's hooked up to this, this, a... ll this crap.<eos> That's not life.<eos> I want her to have peace.<eos> - She will.
- Yeah, Toni Bernette.<eos> - Oh, she's good. Let me start there.<eos> I'll give Toni a call and she'll bring me up to speed.<eos> I can tell you anything you need to know right now.<eos> - Well, I really... - Daymo was in Orleans parish prison when the storm hit.<eos> That is a fact.<eos> We got a picture of him up on broad street bridge, so...<eos> Ladonna, look, I'm gonna do everything I can to help.<eos> Like I say, it's been crazy around here, But I promise I'll make some calls, See what kind of strings I can pull.<eos> I will.
Henry was going to pick one up on his way home from work, but he's been so busy.<eos> Oh, Betty, he's very ambitious.<eos> He's mad at me.<eos> Why would that be so?<eos> Oh God, if I can make it through this weekend...<eos> It's a two-year-old's birthday party, you'll have help, and no one cares.<eos> Is he coming?<eos> I told him about it.<eos> Now I can only hope he won't show up and ruin it.<eos> Well, he won't.
Oh, my god! Talk about moving backwards.<eos> What are you doing with trista?<eos> Aren't you past that?<eos> That is so completely different.<eos> I have some nail polish remover In the bathroom.<eos> I heard you can get a buzz off that.<eos> Don't go through my things.<eos> Claire's not gonna give me anything.<eos> be patient.<eos> She will.
Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I hate having a secret.<eos> I just--I feel so far away from them.<eos> Does it help that I know?<eos> Yeah. Even bobby, sort of.<eos> Well, that, my friend, is what it feels like When you don't have to keep a secret anymore--<eos> Relief.<eos> I just feel like everything's gonna change.<eos> It will.
That... Have no meaning.<eos> I don't know who I am anymore.<eos> When I was in college...<eos> My family was killed, murdered.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sometimes I still think...<eos> One day I might catch whoever did it.<eos> I was alone for a long time.<eos> But I found my place.<eos> You will too.
Emily Mullins ain't no more than a foolish, feather-haired girl!<eos> (BABY CRIES) Let me tell you what I know - she was waiting.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Emily, you might think you have to protect him, but you don't.<eos> Whoever the man is, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your ma, to speak out.<eos> You are young.<eos> Your whole life hangs on this moment.<eos> - You must find the courage to speak. - You think it will help.<eos> You all think it will mend everything if I say.<eos> It won't.
I must go.<eos> But it's been lovely to see you again, Joe, really.<eos> - And you know what I'm asking?<eos> - You haven't asked anything yet.<eos> But you know what it is, when I do.<eos> I'm going to stop here at the pub, until I hear from you.<eos> Oh, and take your time.<eos> I'd rather wait a week for the right answer than get a wrong one in a hurry.<eos> Think about it carefully.<eos> I will.
You're a kind woman, Mrs Hughes.<eos> I don't know how this house would run without you.<eos> I don't, truly.<eos> Stop flannelling and get on, before I betray you to Mr Carson.<eos> Oh, is there anything more thrilling than a new frock?<eos> I suppose not, my lady.<eos> You shall have one, too.<eos> I thought this would be suitable for your interview.<eos> - I won't be wearing it, my lady.<eos> - Of course you will.
That's ridiculous.<eos> She's gone home now, but she's still very ill.<eos> Clearly the boy should go and see her.<eos> And I assume you would have no objections?<eos> Of course not.<eos> So, do we break a patient's confidence and disobey her orders?<eos> We can't. Lfshe's forbidden it.<eos> - I must say I agree with you.<eos> - Well, I'll tell him.<eos> No, you will not.
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll still finish the record.<eos> I will.<eos> For you.<eos> No.<eos> For you.<eos> For us.<eos> But we are not that far off.<eos> We might just finish this thing by the time you have to leave.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
Might help if you were a little less tense.<eos> Well, he'll be picking up on that.<eos> You think Jamie's just gonna let this go?<eos> The trick with people like Jamie, all the Maguires, is to make them believe they're better than they are, convince them they're more intelligent than you, stronger than you, more ruthless than you.<eos> And whilst they're busy going round thinking they're God's gift...<eos> If he finds out...<eos> I can handle him.<eos> And what about Paddy?<eos> Cos when he hears...<eos> He won't.
How?<eos> I need you to be brave and tell me what you saw in your flash-forward.<eos> Hey, it's okay to be afraid.<eos> It really is.<eos> It's okay.<eos> But if you tell me, you might be able to help me.<eos> You might be able to help daddy, help a whole load of people we don't even know.<eos> If I tell... tell you... Mm-hmm?<eos> S... something bad will happen.<eos> No. No, it won't.
Come on.<eos> Back--back to bed.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Not the other one.<eos> I need my shoes.<eos> Remember? Your shoes didn't fit.<eos> That's why your feet were bleeding.<eos> But I liked those shoes.<eos> I know. We'll get you some more shoes.<eos> We will.
Another guy?<eos> So let's shift to rachel melhan.<eos> Did you come onto her?<eos> I offered to walk her home.<eos> It's a crappy neighborhood.<eos> Just being a gentleman?<eos> Maya left with rachel, not me.<eos> I was on the overnight shift Both nights those girls were here.<eos> You can check the timecards.<eos> We will.
My dad lied to me.<eos> He was gonna send me away.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> He's a liar.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Janey, stop.<eos> I will go anywhere you want.<eos> Just please get away from him.<eos> Please.<eos> No, she won't.
To mess up your Today show thing. Look, you're drunk.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Let's get you back to the hotel.<eos> No, I would never do that to you--<eos> Get you drunk on salmon or any fish!<eos> I thought we cared about each other.<eos> Yeah, I did too.<eos> I thought the only thing keeping us apart Was that you wanted to live in Cleveland,<eos> But you'll move to New York for Kaitlin.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Too fond of you.<eos> Twister's right - you're young.<eos> You find yourself a boy who ain't got so many burdens.<eos> Alfie!<eos> Old Monday's coming up the lane.<eos> I'd best go.<eos> Me and you, Minnie... it just ain't possible.<eos> Minnie, we are going to bake scones and ginger biscuits and lay on herrings and sausages and pastries for tea tomorrow.<eos> I am inviting a guest, and we must excel ourselves.<eos> We surely will, ma'am.
- Your majesty.<eos> My beautiful wife.<eos> Now, I must insist you stay to enjoy the dancing.<eos> Bo<eos> Lady Mary!<eos> I bid you all a good night.<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> [All]: Happy New Year, Your Majesty!<eos> I wonder... will you have some more wine, Lady Anne?<eos> With pleasure, if your Majesty will.
I don't know if I want you to know.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't know.<eos> Why is that?<eos> You know why, Grace.<eos> And I saw you talking to Jack.<eos> If I find out I'm pregnant, then it's my choice as to what I do.<eos> It's not your choice, and it's not Jack's choice.<eos> If you two ever get pregnant, then it'll be your choice.<eos> Adrian, I just want you to do the right thing.<eos> I will, Grace.
All I've ever known is a world where people are held responsible for their actions.<eos> Even children?<eos> How can it be otherwise?<eos> And that little girl that she killed.<eos> And all the others that she would have killed - there has to be justice for them and their families.<eos> Through retribution.<eos> Through retribution, yeah.<eos> Society doesn't have any other way.<eos> Well, that won't give them peace of mind, George.<eos> What will?
What happened between Steven and me... It wasn't love.<eos> What was it?<eos> Just sex? Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes!<eos> I mean...<eos> I-it was just a moment of weakness.<eos> And I promise you, it will never, ever happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
That's a clear violation of his Miranda rights.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> Cherie was cautioned against asking her husband Anything about the murder.<eos> The wire was only there to ensure her safety.<eos> She was nearly strangled to death.<eos> She'll live.<eos> What are you doing here, anyway?<eos> I thought you had some huge announcement to make.<eos> And I'm trying to make sure It doesn't turn into a list of apologies from major crimes.<eos> It won't.
Besides, we can't use them -- not with thousands of armed officers in attendance.<eos> More like thousands of potential victims.<eos> Not only are there 3,000 fire-department employees on that line, but we've got hundreds of police officers, the Mayor, and the Governor.<eos> Chief Johnson, the Memorial begins in 40 minutes.<eos> If you really want to call this off, it's now or never.<eos> Can I have a moment?<eos> Two years ago, Kevin Mason failed because of a dead cellphone, but this time I'm convinced he's better prepared, and it's going to be a catastrophe.<eos> If you cancel this funeral and no bomb is found, you will embarrass the department, and you will never be Chief.<eos> I'll risk it.<eos> No, you won't.
I do.<eos> Good.<eos> It may seem to you like my decision to give this creep immunity was somehow related to this whole "Chief" business... Oh, no, no, no, no. Not at all.<eos> Brenda, let me just get this...<eos> Out of the way.<eos> I would hate for what's gone on between us the past few weeks, you know, my behavior...<eos> To completely cancel out everything we've been through together.<eos> Let me just say... I'm sorry.<eos> And, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
She killed Ellen and Jo.<eos> I know.<eos> But you can't look at this emotionally, Dean.<eos> - We need her. - The hell we do.<eos> That little bitch is gonna screw us over so fast...<eos> Of course.<eos> Which is why we'll screw her first.<eos> Meg and her little posse are dead the second we're done with them.<eos> - Yeah, if they don't kill us.<eos> - Oh, they won't.
It looks like we've explained everything.<eos> Yes, except why he was killed.<eos> Morning, mother.<eos> Morning.<eos> So why is gram on the table and why are you on the floor?<eos> Dad, he's gone.<eos> Theodore?<eos> When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries, I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.<eos> Oh, he's not gonna hate you. He'll understand.<eos> No, he won't.
whatever!<eos> You laugh like a cartoon woodpecker.<eos> you said you'd be here an hour ago.<eos> We had to go buy our fake ratty boat-fixing outfits.<eos> We're sloppy, but adorable.<eos> That's right.<eos> Look, guys, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> What if bobby comes back?<eos> He won't.
Thanks, that's fine.<eos> I hear you eat next to nothing.<eos> Don't let yourself go, Noemie.<eos> Please?<eos> I'm okay, Mom.<eos> There's someone outside who wants to see you.<eos> Priscilla's sister.<eos> Will you see her?<eos> I think it means a lot to her.<eos> Will you?
I said I couldn't trust her, Ty.<eos> What about me?<eos> You left me, too, dad.<eos> What, you feel duped for raising somebody else's kid?<eos> No.<eos> I love you, Ty,<eos> Either way.<eos> Please trust that.<eos> You need to go talk to your mom about this.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Joshua, it's Ryan.<eos> - You found it.<eos> Good.<eos> - Yeah, hey, listen, we have a friend that's up there.<eos> His name is Georgie Sutton.<eos> He went up there looking for me, and they caught him.<eos> - I haven't heard anything.<eos> - Yeah, well, he's up there, okay,<eos> - And I need you to find him, all right?<eos> - I will.
Try not to spend it all in one place.<eos> Chuck, what happened?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> Shaw has won.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't worry, buddy, we'll get Shaw.<eos> No, we won't.
Pinky swear.<eos> You swear that they get my money?<eos> I swear they will.<eos> You think you need ten fingers to do that?<eos> Ah!<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Just we have to do this faster.<eos> - We will.<eos> We will, okay?
So we don't have to worry about it anymore?<eos> It's all done?<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, we both want to thank you.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> It's not nothing.<eos> You said you'd take care of it, and you did, and appreciate that.<eos> So does Jason.<eos> Tell him you're welcome.<eos> I will.
AKA jogging. Wait.<eos> Honey, have you ever run before?<eos> Certainly.<eos> I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens... and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.<eos> You're right.<eos> Penny jogs.<eos> Maybe you guys can run together.<eos> That's an excellent idea.<eos> Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.<eos> No, it won't.
She had complained to management, but when they didn't do anything about it, she dropped it.<eos> The statute of limitations have since passed so can't bring suit.<eos> Will she testify?<eos> She's fragile, but I'm working on it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> There's another masseuse.<eos> The same thing.<eos> Bummer.<eos> I'll go talk to Lara.<eos> No, I will.
We have to get this into evidence.<eos> What's up?<eos> They've been talking a lot.<eos> So?<eos> Something's brewing.<eos> You're being paranoid.<eos> (buzzer sounds) Can you tell them I'm not like that?<eos> Tell the judge it's just an act.<eos> I'm not a bad girl.<eos> I will.
I do not want it.<eos> Have we met?<eos> You don't have to spend it.<eos> Just in case you want to get an apartment.<eos> I feel like I'm on a train in Europe, and you're a little German man, and I'm me, and we're sitting across from each other, and we're talking but neither of us really understands the other one.<eos> I understand that you love shocking people and you think living like this is a good idea right now.<eos> But just do me a favor and take it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll give it to the salvation army.<eos> No, you will not.
- Nothing.<eos> I'll talk to you later, okay, baby?<eos> Okay, bye. Heh.<eos> Oh, eyelash.<eos> Make a wish.<eos> I wish you would stop making things so uncomfortable.<eos> I wish you would accept the fact that Navid is my boyfriend.<eos> That's two.<eos> Things have to change, Javier. I'm serious.<eos> They will.
I'm going to win the Leadership Award, don't worry.<eos> And that's the only one that really counts, because that's the only one that comes with scholarship money.<eos> Well, you better get it.<eos> Otherwise you'll be slinging shoes at the Beverly Center after graduation.<eos> Stop.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Math rules.<eos> I'm going to win it.<eos> I will.
Would you like to wait at the bar until something opens up?<eos> Sure.<eos> We can wait at the bar.<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> Would you ask Andrew Jackson to wait at the bar?<eos> Is he with CAA?<eos> No, he's right here.<eos> With his buddies?<eos> Maybe this will help something open up.<eos> Oh, it will.
No.<eos> Don't take him away.<eos> He didn't do it.<eos> I did it.<eos> Mr. Williams.<eos> I had ink on my hands, I grabbed the bat, I killed her.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Please... just let me be a father to my son, for once.<eos> You have to understand, I have to do something.<eos> And you will.
Frank, it was my first day back.<eos> I was nervous.<eos> I don't think that it's that surprising - that there's a trace... - I can take myself off call.<eos> - Maybe it's not a good time to travel.<eos> - That's not what I want.<eos> Are those avocados?<eos> Where did you get them?<eos> - How much? - Don't worry about that.<eos> - Liv, what if it happens again?<eos> - It won't.
I don't care about dating a prince.<eos> I don't care about dating anyone.<eos> I just care about you.<eos> I really need my friend right now.<eos> I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.<eos> They say it's a broken heart, but...<eos> I hurt in my whole body.<eos> I mean, what if I stay like this forever?<eos> What if I never get over Chuck?<eos> You will.
From the looks of it, you've got a lot to recover from.<eos> Take me back to Ostroff.<eos> Hey.<eos> If I don't remember what happened in this photo, who knows what else I did that I don't remember?<eos> Don't do that to yourself.<eos> Thank you for being the one person who believed in me...<eos> Even though it turns out you were wrong, too.<eos> I wasn't wrong to believe in you.<eos> I still do.<eos> I always will.
B., that's great.<eos> And to prove that I care about more than his title,<eos> I've planned a day of polite interaction with the proletariat.<eos> Think Diana, princess of the people.<eos> Obviously, I'll wear gloves.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> Not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.<eos> Nothing will. Mm.
Do you want me to have meant them?<eos> If they were true, I would want to know.<eos> Of course.<eos> *<eos> They bark and scream out for God and their mothers.<eos> Well... I should get back to Anne.<eos> I meant it, Blair...<eos> With all my heart.<eos> You gonna say something this time?<eos> I will.
I want to help, but I don't know what to do.<eos> there's...<eos> There's nothing you can do.<eos> Aah!<eos> Tyler...<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> No!<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
It was an accident.<eos> I was being stupid.<eos> She's ok, though.<eos> But there I was.<eos> You know, just for a moment,<eos> For a split second, I hoped she'd die.<eos> Look, whatever this is inside me,<eos> I don't want any part of it.<eos> I don't ever want to feel that way again.<eos> I won't.
Where are you going?<eos> Out.<eos> I'll be back!<eos> Where should I put these?<eos> Right there.<eos> Thank you, miss flowers.<eos> You've been such a wonderful help.<eos> Oh, it's my pleasure, dear.<eos> Let me know if there's anything else I can do.<eos> I will.
Ok.<eos> I'll make sure she doesn't leave my sight.<eos> All right.<eos> If anybody wants to back out,<eos> I'll understand.<eos> Yeah, cold feet speak now.<eos> I don't want this going wrong<eos> Because someone chickens out.<eos> Caroline?<eos> I won't.
How are you?<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You're looking good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So are you.<eos> I wish I could stay and talk, but I'm late for the "messiah" at Disney hall.<eos> Uh, will you call me?<eos> Y-yeah, I will.
Um, Luc would you mind helping me in the kitchen?<eos> Of course.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Mm.<eos> I cannot believe you're pulling this off.<eos> You're such a good liar.<eos> She'd have made a great lawyer.<eos> Sarah, this is ridiculous.<eos> You have to tell him the truth about your age.<eos> I will, mom.
- Look, this is not something that we can work out with an apology,<eos> - so let's just drop it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> - But, Justin, that would be a start.<eos> - Mom... look, sweetheart, you have to talk all of this out.<eos> That's what you have to do.<eos> Mom...<eos> - honestly, she... she'll come back.<eos> - No, she won't, mom.
And that will be pretty soon I'm sure.<eos> How do you know, bro?<eos> I was on a series six months ago.<eos> I haven't had an offer since.<eos> Correction... dos equis asked me to be the least interesting man in the world.<eos> Johnny, this town is up and down, up and down.<eos> You know that.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> I was done, but I came back.<eos> - And you will too.
When we got back here, we were told all three were dead.<eos> I think everyone was hoping that we would go down in history as the first team not to lose a man.<eos> Then they showed pictures of those three handsome young men who were smiling, and whose eyes were shining.<eos> They looked happy.<eos> I can't take much more of this, Mads.<eos> - It's really, really hard.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> Come home soon.<eos> I will.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I just thought we should talk.<eos> Oh, is that why you knocked before you came in?<eos> I'll give you credit.<eos> Most people, there'd be a blood stain on my carpet right now.<eos> You made a mistake coming in here.<eos> You'll never find Bailey without my help.<eos> [ Scoffs ] Yeah, I will.
Johnny.<eos> Hey. It's under the fire.<eos> Well, grab shovels and start digging.<eos> Now!<eos> Come on, move it!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Not you.<eos> You leave.<eos> I will not leave.<eos> Oh, yeah, you will.
It's not that.<eos> Dad's not coming back.<eos> But that doesn't mean I can't do anything.<eos> I don't get it...<eos> If we do nothing, the Earth will be destroyed.<eos> All our memories and dreams... our everyday lives...gone.<eos> As if they never existed.<eos> Aren't I right?<eos> But you don't have to be the one to do it.<eos> Somebody else will...
I befriended this woman.<eos> Ella, trust me.<eos> It is over.<eos> Trust you?<eos> ! She means nothing to me, and I'm not gonna let Her take away from me what matters most.<eos> And what is it that matters to you?<eos> Because clearly it is not us.<eos> Do you want me to find another job teaching at a different college?<eos> Do you want to pick up and move again?<eos> Because I will.
- I do not know.<eos> - So we must look for him.<eos> - I will not back!<eos> I am not going back!<eos> Do not go there.<eos> - Wait here, I go in and look.<eos> - No!<eos> I beg you!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - I will not.
Yeah.<eos> He's gonna be all over the news.<eos> Once we unravel his need for darkness, we'll find him.<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.<eos> He can't hurt you again, OK?<eos> How do you know?<eos> You didn't find him.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I will.
This was the time When the whole team walked the walk on hot coals,<eos> And the only one to suffer was our resident redhead.<eos> The rules are exactly the same as for men versus women, And it already seems there's some truth to the rumor.<eos> I hate cold.<eos> [ chuckles ] oh, good.<eos> Okay.<eos> there we go.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Woman: i've heard that redheads have a lower tolerance of pain, But i don't actually know a large enough sample group To confirm or deny that, so we'll see what happens today.<eos> Narrator: we sure will...
- Maybe I tter go.<eos> - Yeah, ybe you better.<eos> - You know, Hank, X months ago, I was pretty happy with my life,<eos> And then my marriage fell apart<eos> And my life fell apa,<eos> And I think it took its toll on me.<eos> - I'm soy to hear that.<eos> - So maybe work is the only place I feel like I have se control.<eos> - Would you reconsider your position on the clinic?<eos> - Oh, no, I won't.
Yes, for certain.<eos> - My Lord.<eos> - Why?<eos> I have received more reports of the Earl's behavior.<eos> It seems that, after his investiture into the Order of the Garter, he ppeared in a tavern in his regalia - and made great fun of the Order and of those belonging to it.<eos> Even before bawds and pimps.<eos> And these are sworn statements of his behavior?<eos> They are, my Lord.<eos> Are you going to investigate further?<eos> Yes, I will.
Maybe she can fend him off.<eos> New kitchen appliances.<eos> Can we track them through work orders?<eos> He'll be gone by then.<eos> Garcia, give us something.<eos> I'm stateside now.<eos> I'm almost to Idaho.<eos> You're not gonna make it.<eos> I just need more time.<eos> Yes, I will.

- Hey, um...<eos> You ever say anything to Eddie about Boris?<eos> - Um, I might have mentioned The mysterious Russo-Czech-talian accent Once or twice, but, no.<eos> Why?<eos> - I went to his house the other day And I found shadow pond letterhead.<eos> - So?<eos> - What if he threw your birthday party To steal the letterhead?<eos> - Are you actually being serious?<eos> So why don't you ask dad about the letterhead?<eos> - I will.
I don't know about all that stuff.<eos> I know I want to do something.<eos> I don't want to take the rest of my life passively lying down.<eos> After my experience in hospital, I realised people's lives are dominated by monolithic institutions and their stupid rules and by petty martinets.<eos> I just want to help people stand up for themselves.<eos> Well put, Mountstuart, yeah.<eos> Good. Yeah. Good.<eos> Well, what you see here is SPK Working Circle - Communication.<eos> We're a small group.<eos> A cell, if you will.
We're gonna make Oswald reveal the Krugerrands and the painting.<eos> Well... How?<eos> Those coins belonged to someone who probably wants them back, right?<eos> Tell me who.<eos> Russell may or... or may not be an old connection from Detroit Of the Don Corleone persuasion.<eos> The Detroit mob?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, I'm gonna have to convince Oswald I'm in with them.<eos> What if he recognizes you?<eos> He won't.
Cenred's army ride for Camelot on my command.<eos> There is nothing you cannot do.<eos> It is you that gives me strength, sister.<eos> How goes the battle for Uther's mind?<eos> When Cenred marches on Camelot, he will find a kingdom without a leader.<eos> Then finally we are ready.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Merlin suspects me.<eos> Has he told Arthur?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
Fuzz, I've never seen you looking so happy, mate, and so I'd like to thank Fiona for bringing us this joy...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> FUZZ: Fi!<eos> Fi, what's wrong? (Door slams)<eos> What happened there?<eos> It will be alright, darling, I promise.<eos> Your mum's right, mate.<eos> It's going to hurt like a bastard for a while.<eos> But it'll get better.<eos> No, it won't.
What do you think these are for?<eos> That's not who I am.<eos> It isn't?<eos> Who told me to get rid of her husband?<eos> He deserved it.<eos> Deserved?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Leave that shit to God and look after business.<eos> She starts shooting her mouth off...<eos> - She won't.
Stop acting like you give a shit.<eos> Oh, come on now, everyone eat your cake.<eos> We still haven't found the surprises.<eos> Anything in there?<eos> No. The ring.<eos> It means I'll be married, right?<eos> May it bring you better luck than it did me.<eos> The first lady of the United States.<eos> What will you do, nan, if he doesn't send for you?<eos> Well, of course he will.
Just get us out of town, and then we can stop.<eos> Sean, I'm taking you to a hospital.<eos> All right?<eos> I am not losing you.<eos> I'm not losing you.<eos> Okay, you're gonna stay here, and I'm gonna be back.<eos> Please, it's not safe for us to be here.<eos> Sean, you're still bleeding, and you need a doctor.<eos> They'll arrest us.<eos> No, they won't.
I could have.<eos> Except for one fact: I don't own a printer, and I fucking hate computers, all kinds.<eos> I come here today, not just to bash on fucking technology but to offer you all a proposition.<eos> Let's face it, y'all fucking suck.<eos> Don't get your feelings hurt.<eos> Don't get sensitive on me.<eos> I fucking suck too right now.<eos> I'm in the darkest Third World hole I've ever been in in my entire life about a thousand hundred million miles from where I should be and the only way for me to get back there is for us to join forces.<eos> If we can make enough noise down here then just maybe, everyone in America will hear us.<eos> Everyone will.
Okay, let's talk about the fence, June rorchek.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Your buddy Liam looks good for it.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> Young lady, this is now a murder investigation, And you are an accomplice.<eos> Just how much jail time do you want to do?<eos> Because every minute of silence Piles on the time!<eos> I want you to think about that.<eos> she'll talk.<eos> No, dad, she won't.
I would even pick them up at the pharmacy for him and bring them to him directly.<eos> Man, he's gonna hear it at the office on Monday.<eos> Actually, your firm just suspended him until he completes a month's stay in a mental health facility.<eos> Wow. Who's gonna get all his cases?<eos> We're available.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Spencer?<eos> Gus here is a whiz at legal zoom, and my cousin has a personal injury law firm called accidentes.<eos> Heard of it?<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - You will. You will.
If you had read the book, you would understand, Shawn.<eos> This man has actual insight to the psyche of a woman.<eos> I saw all the Emmanuelle movies including the one where she changed races.<eos> I think I have plenty of insight into the female psyche.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now will you admit that your book is dated and that I have more game than you?<eos> - I will not.<eos> - All right.<eos> Will you admit that you tried to murder me last night by poisoning my person?<eos> I certainly will not.
I got a whole new level of understanding of what she went through and is going through.<eos> You guys are really good together.<eos> I really hope things work out between the two of you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And you and Ricky?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I know Ricky's never going to forgive me.<eos> Some day.<eos> Some day he will.
But obviously you think it's important.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's important.<eos> Its existence defies the very laws of physics.<eos> Is it a message from God, the almighty creator of the Universe, as I'm sure you would like to believe?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> We'll just have to see, won't we?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't care if the Colonel forgives him.<eos> I never will.
Thanks for coming, Joan.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Is this all right for you here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Best be on the safe side.<eos> See you, flower.<eos> Are you all right, love?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Please, just go home, Mrs Potter.<eos> Yeah, I will.
But this is our family.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It is.<eos> And some of it you get to inherit, and some of it you get to pick, like Marco.<eos> Don't marry him because you're supposed to, because you're already in this far.<eos> Marry him because... you want his face beside yours in a scrapbook your grandkids are looking through, because you can't stand the thought of not waking up next to him when you're 80.<eos> You're making him your life.<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> You're scaring me, like we're not gonna see each other again.<eos> We won't, baby.
That ever mattered to her was more than she could take.<eos> - How do you think she'll take it<eos> When I charge her with accessory?<eos> - She doesn't respond well to threats.<eos> She responds to fairness and honesty.<eos> She needs to be convinced that taking the stand<eos> Equals doing what's right.<eos> - I thought she understood that.<eos> - She does.<eos> She will.
It must seem like all I do is ask you for money, But, you know, it's hard out there for a day trader.<eos> Anyway, this... Is all you need to start your business.<eos> - Um...<eos> Wow.<eos> - Small biz loan application.<eos> - Scott...<eos> - Licensing info.<eos> - Wow, thank you so much for doing all this.<eos> - Consider this a promise that you will get your money back.<eos> And you will.
Sorry.<eos> See you, buddy.<eos> So, things seem to be going really well with you guys.<eos> Yeah, now that Alex is out of the way,<eos> I can finally talk to him again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, look... "knuckle-puss."<eos> Let's put that in the pre-hate file.<eos> We're never gonna find another artist.<eos> Yes, we will.
That is a lot of food.<eos> Seriously, it's just the four of us.<eos> Four and a half, counting the baby.<eos> Five and a half, actually.<eos> I invited Erin. And people always show up.<eos> I'll be happy for leftovers.<eos> I cannot handle any more canned food.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Don't forget to save the wishbone for me.<eos> - I won't.
I cut loose all those people, all those little problems, even 30 million quid, just to get you to come out and play.<eos> So take this as a friendly warning... my dear.<eos> Back off.<eos> Although I have loved this, this little game of ours.<eos> Playing Jim from IT.<eos> Playing gay. Did you like the little touch with the underwear?<eos> - People have died.<eos> - (SHOUTING) That's what people do!<eos> - I will stop you.<eos> - No, you won't.
Yo, man, the girl's not that hot.<eos> She's only gettin' on you 'cause she's a slut.<eos> Cut.<eos> You know, I...<eos> I can do that better.<eos> It's reality.<eos> Rough edges are great.<eos> K.K., you've got visitors.<eos> I love Chelsea.<eos> I always will.
Maybe people shouldn't know.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't know.<eos> If that's what Adrian did today, then it's over.<eos> It's between her and God.<eos> It's not for us to judge.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> So we're too late?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, if she did lie and she was pregnant and she did get an abortion, but we don't know that that's what happened, and if she wants to tell us that that's what happened, then she'll tell us, and if she doesn't tell us, then we leave it at that.<eos> Maybe some day she will.
And that way, you don't have to be involved.<eos> I know that's what you're thinking.<eos> I admitted that's what I'm thinking.<eos> I don't wanna be involved.<eos> And what happens if Adrian decides to have the baby?<eos> You gonna get involved then?<eos> She's not going to do that.<eos> You never know, son.<eos> What if she does?<eos> She won't.
I hope so.<eos> It's time for me to get a job.<eos> In this economy?<eos> [chuckles] I'm just kidding.<eos> I was just repeating your little joke that you made to Jeff.<eos> Jeff told me.<eos> Actually, I thought it was kind of funny, but I'm sure it was much funnier when you said it.<eos> Okay, you know, I think it's great.<eos> You should get a job.<eos> I will.
Thought you'd want to know.<eos> So I only caused the deaths of nine people.<eos> They're having to bring the submersibles up by night, but the Navy divers have examined them and say they're legit.<eos> So nine people died in the EMP, but you saved thousands.<eos> Is it all just maths, Ruth?<eos> I think sometimes it is.<eos> I'm going to offer Beth a job.<eos> We need different kinds of people here.<eos> In fact, I'd like you to tell her.<eos> I will.
So she can become...<eos> - Her own person.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Sometimes it's best in these situations not to linger.<eos> Just drop her into the mix.<eos> Let her...<eos> - Sink or swim?<eos> - Well, we're not gonna let her sink.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> - Of course you won't.
That's going to be enough.<eos> I've got a cauliflower for if a vegetarian comes.<eos> With the barbecue lit, we turned our minds to the guest list.<eos> Well, I've invited Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp...<eos> Oh, you invited Johnny as well?<eos> I invited Johnny Depp.<eos> He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.<eos> I've invited her again.<eos> Look, if you invite Angelina, she won't come.<eos> She will.

Prepare to lock on to my signal."<eos> Doctor, what's happening?<eos> "I saved Christmas.<eos> Don't go away."<eos> Doctor?<eos> Doctor!<eos> We good to go, then?<eos> The controls won't respond.<eos> They're isomorphic, tuned to your brainwaves, they'll only respond to you.<eos> They won't.
Aah!<eos> Ugh.<eos> Tomorrow, you go into your office... and you stop the investigation.<eos> My client dumps his waste wherever he wants...<eos> The ocean, kids' school, your house.<eos> Wherever.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> In the future, when I come here with a case full of money... and I ask you to do something, you say...<eos> "Yes, sir, I will."
She's had erm, an incident, no, hysterectomy, yeah.<eos> Poor thing, man.<eos> I thought your mum had died?<eos> You came here last week, you needed money to identify her body.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Erm, erm, right, yeah, I've run out of petrol and will you give me some money so I can fill this?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Well, will you lend me 25 quid then?<eos> No, I won't.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.<eos> It's me, Vicarage.<eos> Colin!<eos> What on earth are you doing?<eos> I've got to keep a low profile because of this lead gang.<eos> This is the perfect way to hide.<eos> No, it's not right.<eos> Find another way to hide.<eos> Well, the gang might get me.<eos> No, they won't.
Mmm, unless you've got a watertight alibi.<eos> Otherwise it's not looking so good.<eos> I was at a charity auction for Afghanistan... or, er, was it Kurdistan?<eos> One of the "stans".<eos> A drought... or a flood.<eos> You mean the earthquake in Kazakhstan?<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> I bought a luxury weekend for two at a spa.<eos> Here, check with the organisers.<eos> We will.
Yeah, it's alright.<eos> Gonna chuck us one of those drinks, bro?<eos> How could she do this to me?<eos> She knows auditions are tomorrow.<eos> Where's Sammy?<eos> He's busy.<eos> We all are.<eos> Sit down.<eos> But we will see him tonight.<eos> No, we won't.
Don't be mad, Dexter.<eos> They wanted to see where it happened.<eos> Where they lost their mother.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> Astor, I'm sorry.<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> I should have brought you back here, like you asked.<eos> If you want to move back here, then we will.<eos> We'll find a way to make it work.<eos> No, we won't.
Uh, what-what made you change your mind?<eos> I just got to thinking, you know, I'm having a little girl, and... is she ever going to know her grandmother?<eos> Uh, well, I just found a promising lead.<eos> So if it goes anywhere, you'll be the first to know, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's have some champagne.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, I'll have a drink.<eos> You will, for me.
- Gross.<eos> Technically, you can't.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Go!<eos> Nice red leather shoes you're wearing.<eos> Tell me, do you enjoy thinking about the cow that was skinned to make them, or do you just block that part out for the sake of being fashion-forward?<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Curse words were invented by people too stupid to think of an intelligent response.<eos> - You should print that on a T-shirt.<eos> - Yeah, maybe I will, Rebecca.
Of the Fairfields?<eos> Was it serious?<eos> I was 20.<eos> Everything felt serious.<eos> Look at the back of his head.<eos> Yeah, it's common with drowning victims.<eos> Most likely from getting struck against the rocks.<eos> You want to go with me when I notify the family?<eos> No.<eos> But I will.
But it's not far.<eos> Will you tell me if you plan to hurt Jane?<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I plan to kill her.<eos> Psychically kill her...<eos> And... and keep her alive until... I get out of here and finish her with my hands.<eos> I want to feel her blood covering my hands.<eos> I do.<eos> You'll never get out of here.<eos> Oh, yes, I will.
And your breasts... Very firm.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Tell me, Jane...<eos> What would you like to do to me?<eos> I'd like to get my gun And put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It is so much better slowly, to take your time.<eos> You know, all my life, I've been meticulous about finishing what I start.<eos> And that bothers me, because I haven't finished what I started with you.<eos> And you won't, you sick scumbag.
A big, irritating one.<eos> You say that, but last week, the Stig tried to drive the Reliant Robin.<eos> He also rolled over.<eos> Yeah. Yes, so are you stayingthe Stig's a pussy?<eos> No. No.<eos> There you are, you see.<eos> Well, let's have a look because Kenhad a go.<eos> He looks good, doesn't he?<eos> He won't be able to do it.<eos> He will.
Paul...<eos> This isn't... really my style.<eos> Let me be the judge of that.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> You said we could take it slow.<eos> It's been almost a week.<eos> Isn't that slow enough?<eos> Try it.<eos> Maybe it'll put you in the mood.<eos> It won't.
- Yeah.<eos> Will you come up later?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I broke your little finger with a tackle from behind when you were six, so I know how you feel.<eos> But look what I think about it now.<eos> Night night.<eos> Will you come up later?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
In the car!<eos> And it's definitely, especially not fair on them. And what about Rita?<eos> I mean, she's with us all the time, Dave, and she always will be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love Rita, you love Rita.<eos> What's ever changed?<eos> Except she's gone and we're still here.<eos> And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work. "<eos> She would.<eos> And we will.
I'm pathetic? Hey, what do you call a girl who sleeps with a guy for $8 million?<eos> !<eos> Get off! Uhh! Aah!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> You whore!<eos> Uhh! Get off me!<eos> Okay, ladies, please.<eos> Uhh!<eos> I will never forgive you for this!<eos> Sure you will.
'Cause I would have made a pass at you.<eos> I don't think it would have worked.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm pretty high maintenance.<eos> So's my truck. We make it work.<eos> So you can live with it...<eos> Cutshaw, rich guy just gets away with murder?<eos> My deal with him was that his airport went away and he got his pictures back.<eos> I never said I wouldn't come after him for something else.<eos> And I will.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah, and it's not easy to have a baby in high school.<eos> One of the hardest things about it is you lose most your friends.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not that we were ever close friends, but there were a few times when you came up to me and offered to be my friend, and I just want to know if that offer still stands.<eos> The offer to be your friend?<eos> Well, for us to be friends.<eos> I mean, after all, we're neighbors.<eos> And I don't know. Maybe one day our children will play together.<eos> Yeah, maybe they will.
He never hurt you.<eos> You were about to murder the wrong man.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> You see?<eos> This is where it leads.<eos> But it's not too late.<eos> There's still no blood on your hands.<eos> I just want to feel better.<eos> I want all this to go away.<eos> It will.
He'll do that anyway.<eos> This guy's looking for a spark.<eos> Then we'll need a distraction.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's gone back to his old patterns.<eos> He wants to play the game he played with his wife.<eos> Debra Wilson played that game and it got her killed, Prentiss.<eos> All right, keep his focus off the crowd long enough for us to take him down.<eos> You guys better have my back.<eos> We will.
George, this guy's not me.<eos> He's a vigilante.<eos> Which is a fancy-sounding word for what you do.<eos> Hey, I might be fighting crime, but at least I'm not committing them.<eos> I'm playing by the rules here.<eos> Rules that we're making up as we go along, Jim.<eos> Hey, you know what, George?<eos> If I have to explain it to you, maybe it's better if I just handle this one on my own.<eos> I'll pay for it!<eos> Yes, you will!
You are kinda anchor...<eos> There is about 40 km to town.<eos> You surely can't run all day through?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> They will find your rattletrap and realize we're walking.<eos> If they're off after us, we're doomed.<eos> Believe me, fellow, I know this area very well.<eos> We will walk where the car can't access.<eos> They'll quarter around for some time - and go home.<eos> - They won't.
Locked her up?<eos> Like Brian, that kid you've got just in case?<eos> God, it doesn't matter. It's fate.<eos> Right, I can't change anything.<eos> All I have to do is watch.<eos> I can't change anything.<eos> Hey, we just did, at the party just now.<eos> We can make our own fate.<eos> We can stop this.<eos> And we will.
You need to notify her that she is crawling with herpes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Might.<eos> Might be crawling with herpes.<eos> I might have gotten it after her.<eos> You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna do that.<eos> - Then I will.
So, the police won't know anything about Shane?<eos> You are a devoted mother, aren't you?<eos> You'll say nice things about me to Stevie?<eos> I'll tell him his mother loved him very much.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice everything for him.<eos> Even her life.<eos> How about a farewell fuck?<eos> That's crass.<eos> And it won't save you.<eos> - What will? - Nothing.
Pretty cool, huh?<eos> Oh, it's broken.<eos> I don't know, boys, he's in rough shape.<eos> Doctor, you've got to do something for him.<eos> It's Christmas Eve.<eos> Christmas is the problem.<eos> He can't keep this pace up anymore.<eos> If he goes out tonight, he'll die.<eos> Well, then who's gonna deliver all the presents?<eos> We will.
No, it's not the tooth.<eos> It's just, I like your cousin, which is stupid... because I know that she has a boyfriend, but I can't help it.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Well, are-are you mad?<eos> Jimmy, we hooked up at a party two years ago, you live with your parents, you have a baby and you clean pools for a living.<eos> I think I'll get over it.<eos> Does that mean you'll keep watching hope?<eos> 'Cause she really likes you.<eos> In fact, you're the only person she likes.<eos> 'Course, I will... for 60 bucks a week.
Goes by fast.<eos> Make sure you don't miss it.<eos> You and I need to go over some ground rules.<eos> You're in charge, and I'm not.<eos> But you know what they say, lieutenant.<eos> By any means necessary.<eos> Oh, is that what they say?<eos> I overstepped my bounds.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.<eos> How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out?<eos> "Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, "and really rich, but lacks bladder control."<eos> Oh, damn.<eos> What?<eos> That last bump just made me hit send.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.<eos> No, they won't.
You're not using mine.<eos> So...<eos> I was going to tell you.<eos> But instead, you choose to make up this, quite frankly, ridiculous lie about paying your neighbour so that your friends can use his toilet?<eos> Yeah, good work.<eos> You know why I didn't tell you?<eos> It's cos I didn't want to hear your opinion on it.<eos> I'm sure you've got one.<eos> I haven't said a word.<eos> Hmm, you will.
Your proclivity for self-destruction is morbidly fascinating, but why do you set yourself up for failure time and time again?<eos> Shut up, Louis.<eos> Don't talk to me ooh, such anger!<eos> You know, for people like yourself, there have been amazing advancements in brain surgery.<eos> A lobotomy is not the mark of shame it once was.<eos> - How dare you?<eos> Pick it up.<eos> - No, you pick it up.<eos> I will not pick up, for you will be picking it up.<eos> - No I won't.

No I won't.
Yeah, we go way back. Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Let's talk about Kenny Griffin.<eos> And your Uncle Nate...<eos> It's so perfect the way that he fits in there... and he could help us... in his position.<eos> But it can't work.<eos> You're right.<eos> We need to find another way to do that.<eos> Get in.<eos> And we will...
Thanks for reminding me.<eos> Mr. Jane, I am on your side.<eos> You were a victim of violent crime, and now you help others. That's wonderful.<eos> Don't tell me you don't have the psychic stuff.<eos> What are you doing for the CBI if you're not psychic? Are you scamming them, Mr. Jane?<eos> No, Karen, I am not.<eos> Well, prove it.<eos> Identify Dahl's killer.<eos> Well, if I had carte blanche to do things my way, I would do just that, but they don't give me carte blanche.<eos> The CBI won't, but I will. Deputy?
Twins.<eos> When one of them got hurt, the other felt it.<eos> You did that to yourself.<eos> Where did you find it, Venice?<eos> Fort lauderdale.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Myka!<eos> Three times.<eos> Don't let her do it three times.<eos> I won't.
It comes down to a leap of faith.<eos> We do know that bertha shares some connectivity With the rest of the world.<eos> We've seen evidence of this In the abnormals that reacted to her outbursts,<eos> But whether or not she can control the waves Is anyone's guess.<eos> Walk me through it.<eos> We induce cardiac arrest,<eos> But continue to monitor your brain activity<eos> So we can revive you.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
THE 40 DOLLARS YOU TWO CONNED OUT OF ME WITH THAT STUPID KEYBOARD CRAP!<eos> I KNOW YOU STILL GOT IT! NOW GIVE IT BACK!<eos> NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS<eos> OR YOU'RE FIRED!<eos> Can you believe this? !<eos> No!<eos> Dude this sucks!<eos> The hole's still there!<eos> Do you think Benson noticed it?<eos> He won't now!
No, not unless you want to end up like me.<eos> Would that be so bad?<eos> Well, I should, uh, go.<eos> Uu, yeah.<eos> Uh, hold on.<eos> I believe you...<eos> That you're not going to tell anyone.<eos> Which is why I'm going to give you this.<eos> Just don't leave that in the break room.<eos> I won't.
I deserve it all.<eos> Honey, you've never done this before.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is unlike you.<eos> Yeah, it's unlike me, but you know who it isn't like?<eos> The attorney general.<eos> Like the sound of that?<eos> Take me away, Attorney General.<eos> I will.
It's always hard.<eos> Okay, so I made a mistake.<eos> Kelly will make a fine doctor, but she's not ready for the team.<eos> Up to you.<eos> What?<eos> You like her now?<eos> Nope. But she got me to the right answer, which none of the rest of you did.<eos> If you want to give her another shot, go for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
That's believable, right ?<eos> Anyhow, good news for you, bad news for Mr. Silver.<eos> You tricked me.<eos> God didn't break our deal.<eos> I did.<eos> You led me into temptation.<eos> And I followed.<eos> And God will punish you for that.<eos> He has to. 'Cause if he didn't, well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it ?<eos> He will.
Do you know where she is?<eos> I wish I did.<eos> I hear you're in the midst of a Sexual Revolution.<eos> I was reading your posters.<eos> You should jump on board, baby.<eos> You can't make love if you're wearing chains.<eos> Kick the bishop out the bedroom and that old judge goes too.<eos> Everyone is free to do exactly what they feel, whenever they feel like it.<eos> You'll see a totally different world.<eos> Aye, YOU will!
How dare you?<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> Don't you care about me?<eos> We had something... me and you.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Out of my house!<eos> Just leave!<eos> I will.<eos> I will, I'll go and I'll tell the police everything.<eos> No, you won't. Why not?
Don't you care about me?<eos> We had something... me and you.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Out of my house!<eos> Just leave!<eos> I will.<eos> I will, I'll go and I'll tell the police everything.<eos> No, you won't. Why not?<eos> You don't care about me!<eos> You won't!
He is not coming back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Call you later.<eos> Are you gonna tell grandma and grandpa?<eos> About you getting drunk in Miami and shoplifting?<eos> Nah, that's up to you.<eos> We all have our secrets, right?<eos> Thanks.<eos> - But if it ever happens again...<eos> - It won't.
Joshua.<eos> I'm not surprised the others have panicked... but you?<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> No trust anymore?<eos> No faith?<eos> Is that it?<eos> After 50 years of friendship?<eos> Stop the operation.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
Absolutely.<eos> You don't think I can do this.<eos> You don't think I have it in me after...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I am fine now.<eos> Violet, I'm not-- she's a child.<eos> She needs someone. She needs us.<eos> And I am fine.<eos> If we could just get kenny to realize That the rest of his life is not gonna be like this.<eos> Yeah, well, we will.

I came over to invite you over to our house for Thanksgiving.<eos> You could meet your granddaughter. She's pretty cute.<eos> I got her picture here.<eos> Keep it in my wallet next to the condom I always carry with me now. You know.<eos> Fool me once, right?<eos> No?<eos> She's funny.<eos> She has, like...<eos> You know, maybe it is time for Margine to take the next step in her therapeutic process. - We'll be there.<eos> - No, we won't!
Your proposal?<eos> Excellent!<eos> You must make a fuss.<eos> Women like that kind of thing.<eos> Isn't that right, Morgana?<eos> I'm delighted to hear the news, though.<eos> I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> She's a wonderful woman.<eos> She'll make a wonderful wife.<eos> No, she won't.
Dr. Grey?<eos> Shepherd's wife?<eos> - You're with me tonight.<eos> - Yes. Good.<eos> I heard you're good.<eos> Listen, I'm late for dinner, so, um, I made a list of my patients, their protocols.<eos> basically, everybody's stable.<eos> Just try and keep 'em that way.<eos> And if I need to get in touch with you, sir?<eos> You won't...
This isn't gas.<eos> We have to give the medicine a little time to work.<eos> We gave it time to work.<eos> It didn't work...<eos> Which means this is not gas.<eos> I've worked the night shift.<eos> I know what goes on.<eos> I've lived through horror stories of patients falling through the cracks because residents are running around half asleep, and their attendings are nowhere to be found.<eos> - I will not let that happen to my son.<eos> - I won't either.
But what?<eos> Well, this isn't something I normally say on a first date, but my left ass cheek is throbbing.<eos> Oh, you poor baby.<eos> Do you want me to take a look at it?<eos> No, no, that'd just be a pity peek.<eos> I'm-I'm-I'm sure it's fine.<eos> But I- - I should go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I suppose you'll call me, if you want to get together again.<eos> Absolutely, I will.
P.G. Out, lover boy.<eos> What's all that?<eos> Our technical analyst ran background checks on the suspects.<eos> Oh, I could have given you that.<eos> We typically gather our own intelligence.<eos> Out federal databases tend to have more detailed information.<eos> Well, how do you know they're more detailed if you haven't seen ours?<eos> It's nothing personal, chief.<eos> It's just, you could have asked.<eos> Next time I will.
Elisa, what is it?<eos> Life I've watched you dance alone * * to music * * that I can't hear *<eos> Addison.<eos> How long you been out here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Not if violet doesn't talk to charlotte.<eos> She will.
Yeah, Hi - I'm watching your commercial for the Shakeway<eos> All right, I'm out of here.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> What does this look like to you, Berta?<eos> Your brother in the shower?<eos> You hear that?<eos> It's not just me.<eos> Thanks, Berta. I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> No, you won't.
He fooled us all. Mr. President... Should I...?<eos> Eli, how could this happen?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How is he?<eos> Is-is- - Your husband is a fighter.<eos> - I know. I'm so sorry, Erika. Thank you so much for being here for him.<eos> I promise we'll find whomever's responsible.<eos> The Vice President hasn't regained consciousness yet, sir.<eos> Maybe he won't.
Your turn.<eos> It's still viable.<eos> I was worried it might have been damaged during the crash.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Give me the key.<eos> Now turn around.<eos> Turn around!<eos> No, I want you to look at my face when you pull the trigger.<eos> You think that's gonna make it harder for me?<eos> It won't.
Do you have any witness to speak on your behalf?<eos> I will.
At least you have the consolation of knowing that you are not bereft of company yourself.<eos> Arthur...<eos> I understand that any rights of visitation are purely at your discretion.<eos> Then you will understand that also at the discretion of Sir Arthur is to educate the child or not, to remove it to the country with a wet nurse or not, to have an entire and untrammelled control over the child's fate.<eos> Well, I hope that his fate will include a relationship with his mother.<eos> Mr Farmer...<eos> THEY WHISPER<eos> May we no longer speak to each other?<eos> I will go further than most men will allow a wife such as you.<eos> You will?
Yes, I'm coming.<eos> Look at the wonderful painting they've given us.<eos> Ah, it's... it's fabulous, Henri.<eos> You shouldn't have. Are you mad?<eos> He's mad!<eos> My one model provides me with much inspiration.<eos> Your only model.<eos> Did you mention it?<eos> No, not yet, darling.<eos> But I will.
Now she's in big trouble.<eos> So we must relay to the President to say a particular phrase in his New Year speech... - Wait.<eos> - Santa helps those who help themselves.<eos> - Got that?<eos> - Excuse me, who do I relay this to?<eos> The President.<eos> Oh, the President!<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> - Will you get that to him?<eos> - Of course I will.
I want you to look at this.<eos> It's a copy of a letter written to the King by his private secretary.<eos> Who was advised, discreetly, by certain government ministers.<eos> Mr Baldwin and the Cabinet are to meet to discuss action?<eos> Yes.<eos> Meanwhile, we're collating information about Ribbentrop, and his rumoured liaison with the Simpson woman.<eos> But there are rumours she turned tricks in a Peking brothel.<eos> Rumours that she's actually a man!<eos> None of those have put the King off.<eos> Rumours won't.
-Listen...<eos> No one knows where Jonny is.<eos> He's either got a place or he's gone to the city.<eos> -What are you going to do?<eos> -I'm going back to the city.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When are you leaving?<eos> You've got a doctor's appointment at two o'clock.<eos> -No... I'll cancel that.<eos> -Oh, no you won't.
-Look, I had a bad day.<eos> -Had a bad day?<eos> -I had a bad day, okay?<eos> No.<eos> No, that is not okay.<eos> You are never gonna speak to my children again.<eos> We are done.<eos> Carly.<eos> You know what your problem is, Derek? You can't say "what if."<eos> And you never will.
I'm a mess.<eos> And I really never should've started this and I'm sorry.<eos> - I apologise.<eos> - You know what some people say?<eos> They sat that it's hard to imagine why someone would have an affair if there weren't something missing in the marriage.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> You know what else they say?<eos> They also say sometimes it can help.<eos> You know?<eos> Maybe it will.
We can't bring him on board, Your Majesty.<eos> Drinian, you and the others take one boat back.<eos> The rest of us will stay here till morning... and work out what to do.<eos> But you've no provisions, and no means... of staying warm, Your Majesty.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I've never seen these constellations before.<eos> Me neither.<eos> We're a long way from home.<eos> When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing to the end of the world... finding my father there.<eos> Maybe you will.
We have gathered here to pay our final respects to...<eos> Let us reflect on her journey...<eos> "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down"...<eos> Facial recognition software matched Toretto... about 10 minutes after he crossed the border.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I thought he'd show.<eos> I told you not to come.<eos> They're staking the place out.<eos> - If they find you...<eos> - They won't.
Good.<eos> It's when you don't that you need to start being scared.<eos> Talk to me for a second.<eos> Now, I'm not mad at you, Zoona.<eos> You've done a lot of good things for this province.<eos> But right now, we really need your help.<eos> You need to tell us where they are,<eos> what they want.<eos> If you tell us that, he's gonna let you live.<eos> No, he won't.
Andrew.<eos> You two need to stop fighting.<eos> You'll never see eye to eye.<eos> But you're family.<eos> Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.<eos> Even if... if you don't agree with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.

What are you doing with that?<eos> That is a coupon for birthday sex.<eos> - With you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But he doesn't want it because we're not married.<eos> - He'd rather have a pair of socks, right?<eos> Can I have it?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Of course, we'll have to get married to use it.<eos> Well, maybe we just will.
Yeah, that's good but...<eos> I don't know the point of it.<eos> I mean, my face has cleared up but everything else feels the same.<eos> Well you have to stick with it. Do you like the people in your group?<eos> They're ok.<eos> This one girl, she...<eos> You know, I hope you're taking this seriously.<eos> I mean that I hope you are trying with all your might.<eos> I cannot lose you to this.<eos> You won't.
Giving please.<eos> - Release him.<eos> - Calm down!<eos> Dando, no!<eos> It's me.<eos> Release him, please!<eos> Come with me!<eos> Giving please.<eos> - Let me see it.<eos> - I will, soon.
My buddy's the building manager. They're gonna remodel in a couple of months. But for now, got the whole place to ourselves.<eos> This is perfect, Sam.<eos> Looks like your pal's waking up. Just sit tight.<eos> Securing a room isn't about walls.<eos> A determined captive can kick through plasterboard, but he can't bite through steel bars or pry out screws with his fingers- though it might be fun to watch him try.<eos> You're sure about this treatment in Arizona?<eos> I mean, as sure as I can be.<eos> - You go ahead and make the arrangements.<eos> You got the money back?<eos> You serious? Not yet. But I will.
The staging team's ready and waiting on us.<eos> This'll be uploaded in two minutes.<eos> Good.<eos> Jibraan... we're getting ready to move out.<eos> I'm gonna need you to talk to your brother.<eos> Tell him what we discussed.<eos> Go ahead and wake him up.<eos> Please, I can't do this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> And you will.
But I just explained.<eos> See, I met Gavin and we fell in love and...<eos> No, I get that.<eos> I understood all...<eos> I get the ins and outs of it.<eos> What I don't understand is how you could be so cruel.<eos> I mean, we're just married, if you read the...<eos> Yesterday.<eos> And we're supposed to spend the rest of our lives together.<eos> We will, in a way.

I know how to fix it.<eos> I know how to fix myself.<eos> And it will be me.<eos> And we'll be back together.<eos> -You promise me?<eos> -I promise you, baby.<eos> Don't give up on me, okay?<eos> Because I haven't given up on you.<eos> All right?<eos> I won't.
Say, Orin With the kid gone, we can travel light Let's head east together and start over<eos> Start over?<eos> You know what I mean<eos> No thanks I gave up selling myself<eos> What the hell<eos> How the hell are we going to eat?<eos> I'm thinking about it<eos> Maybe I'll become a nun<eos> What?<eos> Of course I won't
Why my name?<eos> - It's a very pretty name. - I don't know.<eos> What does grandma say?<eos> What if she doesn't give you the house to do what you want with?<eos> What?<eos> Doesn't she want to live better, too?<eos> I don't think she'll agree to all this stuff with her house.<eos> She's old and set in her ways.<eos> - She won't agree to it.<eos> - She will.
And if you throw me out and I wind up an Asian prostitute, that's gonna be on your conscience.<eos> I give up.<eos> Sleep on the couch, imbecile.<eos> I'm too tired to prolong this brutal exchange between a bedraggled microbe and a Nobel-level thinker.<eos> -Keep out of my way.<eos> -I will, I promise.<eos> I'm just gonna use the little girl's to freshen up, and then I'm gonna go right to sleep.<eos> Yes, yes, use the little girl's. Freshen up.<eos> Don't forget to tip the attendant.<eos> -I won't.
Sally's mother calls me once a month looking for an update.<eos> Once a month for three years.<eos> And every time I've gotta tell her I've got nothing.<eos> That's why you can't let this go?<eos> Is there a competing theory out there?<eos> They think I'm trying to move up the ladder by getting a conviction on Mr. Clean, get that citation removed from my file, is that right?<eos> They won't anymore.<eos> Next time Sally's mother calls,<eos> - I'm going to have answers.<eos> - Yeah, you will.
Please.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Sam, it might help you to talk about it.<eos> Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?<eos> No, Sam.<eos> What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.<eos> You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?<eos> That's not...<eos> I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.<eos> I will, Sam.
You do want to go home, don't you?<eos> Back to your villa and boyfriend and the diamonds and parties?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do.<eos> Don't come back!<eos> I mean it, don't you ever come back!<eos> Bath night for Fuzzy, Laurel and Fiamma.<eos> - Where is Fiamma Coronna?<eos> - I'll have her bath!<eos> No, you won't, Poppy.
Please don't say anything to Donald, okay?<eos> I'm-I'm-<eos> Don't fuck with me!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Shit. God.<eos> Shit.<eos> Look, I'm a little fucked up right now, okay?<eos> Just please don't tell my brother, and please don't tell Donald about this.<eos> Don't tell anybody about this!<eos> I won't, I won't!
Come on.<eos> You coming or what?<eos> Charlie Currell is one of my oldest and dearest friends.<eos> - What's wrong with him?<eos> - There is nothing wrong with him.<eos> He's handsome as ever, and he's still interested in me.<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> I could live here.<eos> - George? Promise you won't say anything to embarrass me today.<eos> - I won't if you won't.
- What money?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - My mother gave you money?<eos> The money that she got from Massey...<eos> she gave you that? - Some of it. - Most of it, actually.<eos> - Tom, would you keep out of this?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - We're not a charity, George, and taking care...<eos> - of a growing boy is not exactly cheap or easy. - Give it to me.<eos> - I will not.
We got to get out of here! We're sitting ducks!<eos> Everybody run!<eos> Run, run, run!<eos> Go, run!<eos> Serpentine!<eos> Serpentine!<eos> Zigzag!<eos> Hide in here!<eos> What are you doing? We're never going to make it!<eos> Not at a complete stop, we won't!
Come in, come in, come in.<eos> We have a great deal to discuss.<eos> Do you think it's too much?<eos> I want to look my best when I announce my engagement today.<eos> Who could be so unfortunate as to become your bride?<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, she is standing right here in this room.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I will never marry you.<eos> Ever.<eos> Of course you won't.
Not if you tell the truth.<eos> That'll change the whole picture.<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> I have an old friend that can help me.<eos> No one needs to know about this.<eos> So, what will you do?<eos> I know how the media will spin this.<eos> I lied to the world in a book that sold 30,000 copies.<eos> - People will understand.<eos> - No, they won't!
Come in, if it's not the Direktor.<eos> - Excuse me, Mr. Gumberger.<eos> The class speaker assembly is not around 12, but rather now.<eos> We are missing only Hubert.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> - The class speaker assembly?<eos> All the others are already waiting for you.<eos> - Well, go on.<eos> Are you bringing the right tone with you?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Gumberger. I will.
I felt this way for a long time.<eos> Long before you used your power on me.<eos> It's about the things I did, fighting for Darken Rahl.<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> First,<eos> I haven't sent any of my pay back to my wife in Azarith.<eos> I gambled it away at dice.<eos> You'll need to make up for that.<eos> Yes, Confessor, I will.
No, you're not.<eos> It meant something to you, too.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's nice.<eos> It is, isn't it?<eos> I thought you were supposed to be the crazy one.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You can come home.<eos> - The doctors-<eos> - I will.
What does that mean, you're sorry?<eos> Are you saying that he's dead?<eos> No. No, he's not saying that he's dead. You're not saying that, are you?<eos> We were in the walls, and she attacked.<eos> And I couldn't get to him in time.<eos> Uncle Ted is dead?<eos> I shouldn't have left him alone.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> We'll find him, Suse.<eos> We will.
It's not up to me to decide.<eos> Mortgages are dangerous.<eos> Can you at least give me a couple of days?<eos> How many days?<eos> Five days.<eos> Please, I beg you.<eos> Okay, I'll postpone the payment, but please don't fail me or we're both going to have serious problems.<eos> I won't fail you.<eos> And pay as soon as possible.<eos> I will.
Look where we are.<eos> - We're almost in France. - Hey.<eos> They've got money, this lot.<eos> Get a lungful of that air, eh?<eos> Be good for me health.<eos> You can't manage a team that's not your own people.<eos> Not what you know.<eos> Anyway, the protest movement in Derby is still in full flow.<eos> - We can still get our jobs back.<eos> - No, we won't.
- Changing his name doesn't matter.<eos> Do you think he's reallycalled Ice Man? Huh?<eos> "To Mr and Mrs Man, a son...<eos> Ice."<eos> - So, change it to another name. (on CD): # Sonata for Violin and Piano<eos> What's the name of the fuck with the fiddle?<eos> - This happens to be Debussy.<eos> - Debussy.<eos> - Well, we'll change it to Debussy, then.<eos> - No, we will not!
He's running for his life.<eos> This game was over in the second quarter.<eos> They should have just stayed in the locker room and gotten on the bus and gone to the airport.<eos> They had no chance in the second half against Bishop and that defense. Hello.<eos> You calling?<eos> In a minute.<eos> You know what you're gonna say?<eos> Oh, I'll probably just, uh, wing it as usual.<eos> Dude, I can't wait to hear you put that douche bag in his place.<eos> Oh, I will.
We're sorry. Aren't we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We're going to get you a good lawyer.<eos> Just don't bring them into this.<eos> I don't want to see the circus die because of me.<eos> What you're going to have to explain, is why you wrapped them in a sheet because that's something a woman would do out of respect.<eos> You'll also have to explain how you forged their handwriting on a note.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
Like at a fast food restaurant.<eos> Last night, when we collared Clive, his son was wearing a Happiburger uniform.<eos> Explains why Clive came up in the system.<eos> His son shares half his DNA.<eos> Wow.<eos> That was fun.<eos> I never rode in a police car before.<eos> Empty.<eos> I have to throw it away.<eos> Here. I will.
Olivia Benson, from Special Victims Unit.<eos> What can I do for the Finest today?<eos> I'm wondering if you keep statistics on judges.<eos> Sure, we do. Who are you interested in?<eos> Hilda Marsden.<eos> What kind of stats you looking for?<eos> Decisions?<eos> Sentences? Whatever you have, we want it.<eos> Shouldn't take too long to put something together for you.<eos> Actually, it will.

Was she a patient of yours?<eos> Actually, I, I can't, uh, I can't discuss my other patients.<eos> - Not even with me?<eos> - No.<eos> She says you saved her life.<eos> You should go look at the page.<eos> She has a lot of nice things to say about you.<eos> She's in college.<eos> She sounds happy.<eos> Well, I will.
Well, remember Kurt?<eos> Your ex-boyfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.<eos> - What?<eos> - He was drunk.<eos> I would hope so.<eos> Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.<eos> Did he pay you back?<eos> No, but he will.

What?<eos> Do you think they'll want a little brother or a sister?<eos> You've been spying on us?<eos> I've been looking for an opportunity to get what I deserve - lands of my own.<eos> You will give me yours, lady, unless you want everyone to know your little secret.<eos> Very well.<eos> Go to Nottingham, have the deeds drawn up.<eos> Thank you, my lord.<eos> Malcolm, the lands have to pass to Guy.<eos> And they will.
No-one can help me.<eos> Take him.<eos> Shouldn't we be looking for Tuck?<eos> I don't trust that monk.<eos> He can look after himself.<eos> We've important work here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We just wanted to make sure you were provided for.<eos> I can't accept it.<eos> And nor will anyone else.

I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> - Because you told me there was.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Well... you will.
Desmond didn't know you when he first came out of there.<eos> That means you never met. Which means you can't meet.<eos> This'd be fascinating if I was listening.<eos> How do you know Desmond is even in there?<eos> It could be anybody.<eos> I don't care who's in there.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Open the damn door!<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - Sure it will.
But you got to tell me what's really going on.<eos> It's not like I'm not writing.<eos> It's like I can'T.The first record -- well, honey, your first record --that was a lifetime of work.<eos> But you can do this.<eos> You have so many songs in you.I could see that year ago.<eos> And I still see it now.<eos> So, here's the plan --<eos> I'm going to buy some time with our label partners, and you are going to go write some kick-ass songs, okay?<eos> That is, if you ever want to get on that ranky tour bus again.<eos> I will.
What, I can't go in?<eos> So much the better.<eos> *********<eos> *********<eos> *************<eos> ********<eos> ************<eos> I will see you both later?<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Are you feeling sorry for me?<eos> "And they will obey the Stone Princess, untill the day that stone cries, and a human being feels sorry for the stone."<eos> Vanya!<eos> And now, when everything has ended so happily...<eos> I want!<eos> I want to get married!<eos> Then get married!<eos> But to the person who will marry you of his own free will!<eos> - And who'll do that? !<eos> - I will!
Rest well, my lords.<eos> Rest well.<eos> Do not say it!<eos> I will not be parted from you.<eos> Yet it is wise counsel.<eos> If danger closes in on us once again, you and Aragorn must be protected.<eos> All the Chieftains of the Dúnedain have been fostered for a time in Elrond's halls.<eos> I myself spent years there as a child.<eos> I will not leave you.<eos> I will not!
You men with me!<eos> I will come back to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Then Arathorn, son of Arador, Lord of the Dúnedain, led his people in a great and valiant onslaught, and the servants of the Enemy quailed.<eos> Arathorn, wait!<eos> Now the line of Kings ends!<eos> The line is not broken.<eos> There is still hope!<eos> They will return, Gilraen.<eos> They will.
I don't know.<eos> I don't know what to think anymore.<eos> Choose carefully.<eos> Memories are all we end up with.<eos> At least pick the nice ones.<eos> But there's one thing... I know I'll never forget.<eos> The last thing Pablo said to me the night they killed him.<eos> "Don't worry, Benjamin.<eos> We'll catch that son of a bitch."<eos> And I will.
It was the tap, it's not piss.<eos> Loic's granddad died.<eos> His granddad!<eos> I thought... Are your grandparents dead?<eos> Yeah, in a crash when I was tiny.<eos> I don't remember them. Crushed, all four in one go.<eos> Mine are alive.<eos> It'd be weird if they died.<eos> I love them. Don't worry, they won't die.<eos> They will one day but not yet.
Lady Redbush? Griffin!<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> I'm so horny.<eos> Kiss my hand.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was just walking off the rotted goose anus I had for breakfast, and I thought I'd come by and ask you a little question.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God, yes!<eos> Yes, I will, Griffin!
Lex already took care of that.<eos> Did you talk to dr. Groll?<eos> Can he help us?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna do everything i can to fix this, lana.<eos> I will find a way for us to be together.<eos> Clark, he tried everything.<eos> He can't reverse the process.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Alright?<eos> Bye.<eos> Yes!<eos> We should have like a diner or something.<eos> No. Diner.<eos> - No, you're gonna love her.<eos> - You'll love her.<eos> I'm sure I am.<eos> You two are so excited about her.<eos> Definitively I will.
But every baby has a genetic imprint.<eos> You know?<eos> Whether we like it or not.<eos> And the fact is we don't know anything about Marcy.<eos> Not really.<eos> We don't know anything about this baby's father.<eos> And without that family history, I just don't wanna be inviting that into, yeah, I don't wanna be exposing Angelica to that way of thinking.<eos> This will be our baby.<eos> I think we'll have a great influence on its life.<eos> Of course, we will.
- Beckett.<eos> - Oh, that's right.<eos> The nikki heat thing was about incinerating a body In a self-Cleaning oven.<eos> Mm-Hmm.<eos> I mean, you put things in a freezer To keep 'em for later, But once they're there, you rarely ever go back.<eos> If i was putting a body in a freezer, It'd be because i was trying to hide it.<eos> Until you stopped paying for the storage space.<eos> Did i stop, or did something stop me?<eos> It's family moments like these I will never forget.<eos> with a good therapist, Hopefully i will.
Matty, please just give me that.<eos> No.<eos> Game over.<eos> Cops, Janet, and when the sun comes up, heads off.<eos> Matty!<eos> I will shoot you.<eos> Joey, don't.<eos> Matty, I'll shoot you.<eos> Joey?<eos> No, you won't.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.<eos> I'm sorry they offend you, heartily.<eos> Yes, 'faith heartily.<eos> There's no offence, my lord.<eos> Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, and much offence too.<eos> Touching this vision here, it is an honest ghost, that let me tell you for your desire to know what is between us,<eos> O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends, as you are friends, scholars and soldiers, give me one poor request.<eos> What is't, my lord? We will.<eos> Never make known what you have seen tonight.<eos> BOTH: My lord, we will not.
Maybe,maybe not.<eos> But either way,she had sex with Ricky and Ben's reading a lot into that.<eos> Maybe she should have sex with Ben.<eos> You're right.<eos> Bad idea.<eos> Amy,you can't afford to take a day off of school.<eos> You're gonna be missing days when the baby comes.<eos> I can't stand being at school knowing Ben is there ignoring me.<eos> You and Ben will work things out.<eos> No,we won't.
Never kissing you again.<eos> We're dreamin' the same dream baby.<eos> Come.<eos> Let's go. Not the clubs!<eos> Not the clubs!<eos> If you still wanna marry me.<eos> I can't wait to marry you.<eos> Would you guys knock it off?<eos> We'll just go wait in the car.<eos> No, you won't.
She was the face i looked at when i was on trial.<eos> So what's gonna happen now?<eos> They're gonna charge you with murder, and they will find you guilty.<eos> Evidence, motive, your record.<eos> You will be found guilty, john, and you will spend the rest of your life in prison.<eos> That true?<eos> So she's working out?<eos> Yeah, she's doing okay.<eos> - Well, don't forget about me.<eos> - I won't.
Hold on.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We "stayed"?<eos> We're not traveling through time anymore?<eos> You saying it's over? Of course it's over.<eos> Wherever we are now...<eos> Whenever we are now...<eos> We're here for good.<eos> - I won't do it.<eos> - Okay. Okay. - I won't.
What's wrong with an Indian bus?<eos> Sure it's no Mercedes, but it doesn't cost like a Mercedes does.<eos> What?<eos> Cut it out, Gershon.<eos> He'll be right back.<eos> Gershon, lay off about that now.<eos> Don't talk nonsense, his suitcase is here...<eos> OK.<eos> He will come back.<eos> He will.
Much better.<eos> Your left hand is still heavy.<eos> Do you want a break?<eos> Five minutes.<eos> No more than that.<eos> Well?<eos> - She's almost ready.<eos> It's in less than a week.<eos> She must practice all the time.<eos> - We will.
SHE LAUGHS.. things could be worse.<eos> Don't try nothing clever.<eos> Do what it says if you want to keep your head!<eos> Ramblers!<eos> There's something fishy going on here.<eos> Thank you, God.<eos> It's still Sadie's money.<eos> She should have had insurance.<eos> Ellie, what if Sadie finds out?<eos> She won't!
- Drive lead?<eos> - Lead truck in the convoy.<eos> It's the most vulnerable to a roadside bomb.<eos> I had a friend die that way.<eos> I knew from the first time he came into my tent that if I said no, I'd be riving lead for a month.<eos> So you just took it.<eos> You never said no?<eos> Well, that's what you'll tell major harris.<eos> He'll never believe me.<eos> Sure he will.
colours with colours.<eos> I always sleep on the Ieft side, with my glass of water on the night table, on the Ieft.<eos> I have lots of little hang-ups like that.<eos> Thank you for asking me here.<eos> It's good to get out. Change perspectives.<eos> GisèIe?<eos> I know that Fred's body isn't even cold yet.<eos> I don't want to take advantage of the situation.<eos> But...<eos> I will, just a little, to...
This is my whole life at Aerodytech.<eos> It's everything I've ever worked on, every memo, every file, every project.<eos> Mommy, can we have our kisses now?<eos> Of course.<eos> Mm-mmm! And you.<eos> All right, you little, little sweet things, go on, go to bed.<eos> I'll be in in a minute.<eos> - Okay, Mom.<eos> - Oh, and brush, brush your teeth.<eos> - I will.

You'll never get me.<eos> I'm way out of your league!<eos> I thought that, too, but I was wrong.<eos> You were right.<eos> Nah, I'm pretty cool.<eos> I don't take any smeg.<eos> And even though I'm disgusting, sometimes I can be quite brave.<eos> You'll never get me.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I will.
No, really!<eos> She's coming.<eos> If you don't believe me, come and look.<eos> - Why is she back?<eos> It is mum!<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Why is she back?<eos> She only just left.<eos> She'll go straight home.<eos> - Too right she will.
Tell me who the Intersect is by three or I inject Agent Walker with enough ricin to kill an army.<eos> One, two...<eos> It's me.<eos> Freeze!<eos> CIA!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Hands, now!<eos> Our turn now.<eos> We get to find out everything you know about FULCRUM.<eos> No, you won't.
I don't trust anybody else.<eos> You shouldn't trust me either.<eos> They didn't catch you?<eos> I took a sedative to relax my face, and I know every word she listens for.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> You got to tell them.<eos> It's the only chance you have of not getting fired.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> They won't find out.<eos> Lightman will.
Come on. Let's go, chop-chop.<eos> I thought I'd go shoot a round with Nate and Jamie.<eos> Think you'll be okay?<eos> Honey, you don't have to check up on me every five minutes, even though I do love you for it.<eos> I know.<eos> I guess it's just 'cause, well, I'm the only one who knows.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I should tell Brooke -- the whole "no secrets" thing.<eos> Maybe I will.
Ha!<eos> You've got cash cards, credit cards, expense accounts.<eos> Cash.<eos> - (Frank) Come on, Liam. - Come on.<eos> The doctor said, as far as Stan's concerned, he's locked in the moment of discovering you hanging.<eos> So what's the next move?<eos> If I can get him to stop crying for long enough, I might be able to start talking him round, but until then...<eos> Tell him I'm really sorry, Yvonne.<eos> I went too far.<eos> I will.
But you know, having a fake relationship, that's one thing.<eos> But living together is...<eos> I mean, every day being around each other and-and...<eos> And that's why I can't do it.<eos> And I hope you understand.<eos> I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and, uh, just so you know,<eos> I am going to get this thing out of my head one day.<eos> I will.
And that's why I can't do it.<eos> And I hope you understand.<eos> I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and, uh, just so you know,<eos> I am going to get this thing out of my head one day.<eos> I will.<eos> And when I do, I'm going to live the life that I want with the girl that I love.<eos> Because I'm not going to let this thing rob me of that.<eos> I won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> I just want to go home now.<eos> She said no.<eos> She's had enough.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> I can't believe that bastard's walking.<eos> We'll get him.<eos> One day.<eos> No, we won't, Bolly.
His last conviction is ten years old.<eos> My Lord, he is the sole carer for his elderly mother.<eos> I am reluctantly granting bail on the following strict conditions.<eos> Residence at his mother's address in Deptford.<eos> An electronic tag and curfew between 6pm and 6am.<eos> And twice daily reporting to Deptford Police Station.<eos> They bailed the bastard.<eos> Lennie, I am so sorry.<eos> We'll get him at the trial.<eos> Will you?
Perhaps a different strategy.<eos> We need to take more time and plan.<eos> No!<eos> We don't have any more time!<eos> Master Skywalker needs me now!<eos> He needs us now.<eos> The Commander is right.<eos> I know this strategy is very bold, but these circumstances call for drastic measures.<eos> Then, the strategy will work, sir?<eos> Well, will it?
We need to take more time and plan.<eos> No!<eos> We don't have any more time!<eos> Master Skywalker needs me now!<eos> He needs us now.<eos> The Commander is right.<eos> I know this strategy is very bold, but these circumstances call for drastic measures.<eos> Then, the strategy will work, sir?<eos> Well, will it?<eos> Yes, it will.
Just keep heading east.<eos> No, no, no, you have to come with us.<eos> Not with Wakefield still out there.<eos> Then we all stay.<eos> I mean, what about Trish?<eos> I can't just leave her here.<eos> Your priority is to get your little girl off this island.<eos> Now, Shea, crank that sucker. Thank you...<eos> and tell Trish that I...<eos> I will.
I want another chance.<eos> Well, then, you're wasting your time.<eos> I mean, what, did you really expect me to get all swoony just because you showed up?<eos> No, but I thought you might at least...<eos> What, still care?<eos> Look...<eos> Hunter, you had your chance, okay?<eos> Three years ago, I was yours.<eos> Now I want you to go.<eos> Yeah, and what if I won't, Trish?
I'm afraid that no one else is going to believe me.<eos> Please?<eos> Look, I need your help.<eos> The sheriff's on his way over To talk to us.<eos> Does he know anything?<eos> I'm not sure, But... Before he gets here, let's all just...<eos> Okay, we're all upset.<eos> But no matter what happens, let's not forget we have Each other.<eos> We are a family And we will get through this.<eos> No, we won't.
Don't you worry about Eric.<eos> We'll do the job and go home.<eos> A deal's a deal.<eos> Sookie, you know what he's like.<eos> What's it to him to break a contract with a girl?<eos> A woman.<eos> He needs me.<eos> He won't want to make me mad.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You never will.
Instead, what do you do?<eos> You cook him dinner, you fluff his pillow, you rock him to sleep.<eos> Okay, look, i understand what it looked like from the outside, but trust me, i had the whole thing under control.<eos> Chloe, you didn't have anything under control!<eos> Speaking as davis' next victim, i can tell you, your plan was seriously flawed!<eos> How did you think this was gonna end, chloe?<eos> I'll find him, okay?<eos> I'll fix this.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
I'm okay.<eos> That's not what lucas said.<eos> He told you?<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I was going to, but i wanted you to go to l.a. With julian.<eos> And i knew that you wouldn't go if you knew.<eos> You suck for not telling me.<eos> And i'm not going anywhere, so... what are we gonna do, p.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.
- No.<eos> - soldiers?<eos> Neither bandits, nor soldiers.<eos> I'd call them knights.<eos> will they win?<eos> - They won't.<eos> - will they lose?<eos> They won't either.<eos> Promise me you will forget all that you've seen here.<eos> I won't.
The store doesn't need any more trouble than it's already got.<eos> What is it, sir?<eos> Rumors, mostly.<eos> There's been some talk about a store in the area closing.<eos> People being fired.<eos> Times are tough.<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, we can't let that happen, you know?<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> We won't.
I'm gonna separate Davis from the beast... and use this crystal to send Doomsday to the Phantom Zone.<eos> Spare me the Kryptonian mumbo jumbo.<eos> You have to bend the rules on this one.<eos> When I took Davis to the fortress, you stopped me from sending him away.<eos> You knew he was worth saving.<eos> - I was wrong.<eos> - No, you weren't wrong, Chloe.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through, but there's still a side of Davis that's human.<eos> So, then what if the plan fails?<eos> It won't.
If anything happens to me make sure L.J. and Sofia...<eos> You got it.<eos> - Same for me? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, put your head down, let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You know, someday, weeks will go by.<eos> Maybe even years.<eos> It won't even cross our minds.<eos> Yeah, all we gotta do is survive.<eos> We will.
Not till this is done.<eos> Linc. Linc.<eos> I need your phone.<eos> Dial Kellerman's number.<eos> - Don't tell me you're getting cold feet.<eos> - Just dial it, please.<eos> It's a voice mail.<eos> You better be telling the truth.<eos> And you better come through for us in the end.<eos> He will.
Richard?<eos> Richard...<eos> What is happening?<eos> What's happening is that you're bleeding to death.<eos> I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> Because you told me there was, John.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well... You will.
You will someday.<eos> I'll probably do like a michael douglas thing, ya know?<eos> Grab some young hottie.<eos> Ah, so you're an actor.<eos> But not really a michael douglas type.<eos> I'm more of a colin farrell, ya know?<eos> Dangerous, yet vulnerable.<eos> Well, if doesn't work out-- uh, it'll work out.<eos> But if it doesn'T.<eos> It will.
Bear with me.<eos> OK.<eos> And we are ready.<eos> OK.<eos> Do this for me.<eos> Connor!<eos> Connor...<eos> I thought you said this was going to work?<eos> It does.<eos> It will.
Just wanted to stop by before class.<eos> Oohh I didn't know you had a visitor.<eos> He's not a visitor.<eos> He's a health inspector looking for something unhealthy.<eos> Perhaps he should start with that gut of his, man looks like he ate an Oompa-Loompa.<eos> Oh well I can tell him he won't find anything wrong in your kitchen.<eos> Especially not in your legendary noodle casserole!<eos> Oh yes.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
What matters is how glad I am you surprised me.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm not done.<eos> I know you're nervous about us being far apart next year, So I got something.<eos> - It's a 1-bedroom in Murray Hill.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> Will you move in with me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yes, of course I will.
No.<eos> I never asked for this.<eos> Never opened it.<eos> Well... let's see what the CIA's got on Leon Vance.<eos> I thought we shredded all these.<eos> How does this thing keep finding its way into the open?<eos> It's not even real.<eos> Lucky you didn't read this.<eos> Wouldn't give you the whole picture anyway.<eos> And you will?
Look at your car!<eos> it's in the middle of the street!<eos> look at it!<eos> and you're getting in my face?<eos> !<eos> It is supposed to only be six inches from the curb!<eos> Say it's eight inches from the curb!<eos> say it!<eos> Get off me, man!<eos> i will!
Try to keep up, honey.<eos> Notes in the margins. Now, I learned about the leak because Brad found out about the leak.<eos> He was hunting them.<eos> Why he didn't share this news, I don't know. - But he sure did get himself killed.<eos> - What do the notes say?<eos> He wanted to look at the SCI F access logs.<eos> - Now I do.<eos> - That's eyes only.<eos> I'm not gonna show you that.<eos> You absolutely will.
These -- these things could be used by other cats.<eos> Good morning, sergeant gabriel.<eos> Morning, chief.<eos> We just landed a body at the crenshaw community center.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Isn't that father jack's place?<eos> Yeah.You want me to come by and pick you up or give you directions or --<eos> I know where it is.<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> I'll, um -
Sam is not gonna bring me back bunny.<eos> I'm sorry because you made the mistake.<eos> Not me.<eos> You were late.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You were early.<eos> They targeted me too when you got yourself killed.<eos> I love you. Sam.<eos> I always will.
And teacher.<eos> You're a doer, remember?<eos> You know exactly what you have to do.<eos> Come in.<eos> You can do it.<eos> You can cut into my brain again.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can do it, but...<eos> I don't want to end up a vegetable.<eos> Izzie, you won't.
But if something goes wrong,<eos> I don't want to end up on a ventilator.<eos> So i'm signing a d.n.r.<eos> Please. alex--<eos> Look, you went crazy.<eos> When denny signed that d.n.r., you went crazy.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> you want me cutting l-vads?<eos> No, i-- you want to wreck my career?<eos> 'cause i will.
What?<eos> Look at you, you're a wreck.<eos> No, I'm not, see I'm really.<eos> Yeah, I will pull myself together.<eos> My mascara's not even running, see?<eos> I want you remember me like his, go, go now, go now, Ralphie.<eos> No, no, no, no, no way.<eos> I will go live with my grandma.<eos> -No, you won't!<eos> -Sure I will!
Wetbacks with a baby.<eos> Probably got nine more at home.<eos> Whole town's gone brown, man.<eos> Police!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Drop to the ground with your hands up!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Take another step, and I'll blow your brains out!<eos> No, you won't.
You have saved my... everything.<eos> Without Lizzie there would have been no painting.<eos> Well, that's true.<eos> However can I repay you?<eos> Simple.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> You've to promise me that you will never, ever, take Lizzie away from me again.<eos> Welcome back into the fold, Johnny.<eos> I'm not sure I see it like that.<eos> The Academy will.
I have to go. The car is already here.<eos> I have a briefing with the commissioner.<eos> They sent someone?<eos> No, it's Sokolowski.<eos> Sokolowski?<eos> But he's just a captain.<eos> Clearly, he's more than that.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> - You were supposed to give it back.<eos> - All right, I will.
- Yeah, but they're different!<eos> How's this one?<eos> Let me see...<eos> Not bad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where the fuck is he? !<eos> What if he doesn't come?<eos> He will come.<eos> What if not?<eos> He will!
Not very.<eos> There's still another house I can check on the way home.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott Smith?<eos> Me and my kids got nowhere else to be.<eos> My babies just need a place to feel safe at night.<eos> We don't make a mess or nothin'.<eos> You ain't gonna tell?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
We don't have any proof.<eos> Come on, quinn.<eos> You're a detective.<eos> What does your gut say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're too close to this.<eos> I'm not the only one too close.<eos> She say anything yet?<eos> Nope.<eos> She won't.
Guys, if I could interject briefly here... And this is me speaking from my own experience...<eos> That feels a little rash.<eos> You're both under a great deal of stress, and I don't think now is the time to make important life decisions.<eos> I'll tell you what works for me, and maybe it's... it's just me.<eos> Draw a hot bath.<eos> It doesn't matter who goes first.<eos> You got a smart mouth, huh?<eos> Look, I got it under control.<eos> You want me to shoot him right now?<eos> I will.
- You're an asshole.<eos> - Okay, look...<eos> The truth of the matter is, you're cursed with schmuckness.<eos> You want my help?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Fine, I will help you.<eos> My gosh! Thank you.<eos> After I slam his dick in this drawer.<eos> - Let's go, he's not gonna help.<eos> - No, I will.
Your mother has to take you.<eos> I'm showing the house.<eos> - To?<eos> - Someone who wants to buy it.<eos> Dad, you cannot sell this house to Adrian's parents.<eos> I can sell this house to whomever I want.<eos> I'm not sure Mom'll let you back in.<eos> - Where are you gonna go?<eos> - She'll let me back in.<eos> - No, she won't.
Well, good.<eos> Thank you, Adrian.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course, now I'm too tired to go over there.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I rarely miss going over there.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> Of course she will.
You, me, and Agent Farnsworth-<eos> But each one slightly different...<eos> Changed over time based on the accumulation of our choices.<eos> So... in this reality-<eos> Walter.<eos> We've had this conversation before, haven't we?<eos> I know that I went somewhere.<eos> I think I met with someone.<eos> But the rest is like a dream that I... I just can't quite remember.<eos> Perhaps you will... in time.
Thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're giving up?<eos> I tell you he met a girl and moved away, and you're just gonna give up?<eos> You're Sam.<eos> Nina Sharp said you'd be coming by.<eos> Have the headaches started yet?<eos> No.<eos> They will.
If I only wanted a roof over my head your dad and Esther already let me stay at the farm, don't they?<eos> But I don't know you love me?<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> Just the same as I trust you.<eos> All I know is I love you.<eos> And all I've ever wanted was to marry you, Billy Finch.<eos> I'll always know that I made the right choice even if you don't.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> Ever since the first time I saw you smile.<eos> And I always will.
Good night, Emily.<eos> Good night.<eos> You know, if you don't marry him, I will.<eos> He's young enough to be your son.<eos> He is not!<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> I was just kidding.<eos> Aw... Honey!<eos> If dad finds out about tonight I¡¦m dead.<eos> - He won't.
But now that she knows, it'll be easier when you talk to her.<eos> Me talk to her?<eos> Uh, why?<eos> Why? Why?<eos> I... you're the one who was dating her, I'm... I just...<eos> I don't...<eos> I think we're good now.<eos> Honey, you're gonna have to deal with her at some point.<eos> Fine.<eos> Yes, I will. I will.
Wait for Colonel Volton's order.<eos> Roger out.<eos> You came all this way to win REDLINE, right?<eos> I'm only halfway there.<eos> I didn't get to see the finish line.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Not much room, but you don't mind, right?<eos> It'll be too heavy.<eos> You can't win.<eos> Yes, I will!
Have to watch Don Draper accept an award for his humanity?<eos> - Don is important.<eos> - You know, I found that guy working in a fur company--<eos> Night school.<eos> And that girl Betty.<eos> I remember Mona said they looked like they were on top of our wedding cake.<eos> Screw him.<eos> Have the party without me.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
Let me remind you, there's millions in alimony at stake.<eos> I'm well aware of the terms of your prenup.<eos> I'm telling you, conclusively, your wife never violated the fidelity clause, or however you put it.<eos> Maybe if I increase your fee, you can run another one of your tests.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me just stop you right there.<eos> The truth's the truth.<eos> Send me the bill.<eos> I will.<eos> I definitely will.
This isn't even about saving my job anymore.<eos> Most likely, that's gone. I've accepted that.<eos> But if go in there and drag this guy out in front of 15 people, this whole under-the-radar thing is done.<eos> Now, come on, Gillian.<eos> I mean, we gave it a shot. It's time to call this thing in.<eos> Ben, n... no.<eos> What?<eos> There's one thing Matheson said today that I believe is absolutely true.<eos> If he sees the cops... he will pull the trigger.<eos> He will.
What do you mean?<eos> All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.<eos> What is Damon doing here?<eos> Why did he come home?<eos> 'Cause I came home.<eos> He wants to make my life miserable.<eos> That's how he enjoys his.<eos> Well, he's putting us all at risk.<eos> This girl in the hospital could talk.<eos> She won't.
You heard about that?<eos> - A cheerleader in texas gets her head sawed off At the homecoming game?<eos> Yeah, I've heard about that.<eos> - You know, I kind of want to keep the whole<eos> Murder at Union wells on the D-L.<eos> No kidding.<eos> I mean, if I were you, I would change my name.<eos> Like now.<eos> They'd probably let you do it over the phone.<eos> - No, they won't.
Call off your guards.<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't harm them.<eos> Give me the quillion.<eos> You spared my life even when your friends told you not to.<eos> You can thank me if this works.<eos> If it does, you'll be the last Confessor.<eos> You'll have to take a mate.<eos> Yes.<eos> Someday I will.
Which, for the record, I do have a problem with, but you don't, so it doesn't matter.<eos> You go after what you want and you don't take no for an answer.<eos> What the...?<eos> ! MAN: Sorry about that.<eos> You have a good arm.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right!<eos> I'm not going to let some college counselor, who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings, get in my way.<eos> I just have to find a way to get into CU.<eos> And I will.
And we can use that to force her to release Mum.<eos> You're going to bargain with her?<eos> It's a nice idea, kid.<eos> But I don't do deals.<eos> Not while I'm packing heat.<eos> Go fetch.<eos> If you fire that blaster at us, you'll destroy the puzzle-lock.<eos> That's why I'm not going to fire it then.<eos> Unless you do something stupid like smash the puzzle.<eos> Which you won't.
She promises to love and honour her husband, the wedding ring goes on and then she's agreed to it, and she's under the Trickster's power!<eos> Marital bliss, but she forgets all about this.<eos> She starts living a new life.<eos> Forgetting about her old life.<eos> Protecting the Earth.<eos> And the planet's wide open.<eos> so aliens can just barge in!<eos> Without Sarah, without you lot saving the world from your attic in Ealing, there'll be chaos and destruction, meat and drink to the Trickster!<eos> As if she's gonna say yes.<eos> But she will, won't she?
Is it possible that she's just run away?<eos> Lieutenant...<eos> I know my daughter.<eos> She would never,ever do anything to leave me to wonder.<eos> She would never do that.<eos> Okay,what kind of a car was she driving?<eos> A Nissan.<eos> There's the license number right there.<eos> Tell me you'll help me.<eos> I will.
They'd put on the needle, it wouldn't come up, and they couldn't work out what was going on.<eos> We didn't tell anybody what we had done, and eventually it was discovered.<eos> But the records were great fun because we could really play, and we did.<eos> With me now is Norman St John Polevaulter, who has been contradicting people.<eos> St John Polevaulter, why do you contradict people?<eos> I don't!<eos> But you told me that you did.<eos> I most certainly did not!<eos> Oh, I see. I'll start again.<eos> - No, you won't!
Once we get there, how do we get Zedd to drink the potion?<eos> You won't be able to get near him.<eos> Shota.<eos> He thinks you're his enemies.<eos> He'll obliterate you.<eos> I don't know what you did to him, or why, but I'm gonna stop him before he hurts somebody or himself.<eos> Oh, just because you have flowers and roots and a Shadrin's horn, that doesn't mean you can reverse my spell.<eos> No, what I have done, only I can undo.<eos> Then do it.<eos> Oh, heh, I will.
He doesn't care.<eos> He says he loves me.<eos> Oh, honey, you're smart enough to know that that's a lie.<eos> Right?<eos> I keep trying to get over him, But then he comes over here and he says all this stuff, And I...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I will handle this.<eos> Really?<eos> And you...you won't tell my mom?<eos> No, I won't.
He's still in a coma from his tractor accident.<eos> - Oh, I wanna go see Francis.<eos> - Don't be such a baby.<eos> Fine, I'll do it, but not today.<eos> I mean, how heartless would it be to break up With someone five months before their birthday?<eos> - Jules!<eos> - Okay!<eos> The follow-through is looking much better, Gladys.<eos> You go, Gladys, you're gonna get it in one day.<eos> - She never will.
He's got my job, he's got my house.<eos> You could come and stay with me.<eos> With you?<eos> There's plenty of room and I could help look after the baby.<eos> Oh. Oh, my dear.<eos> Oh, it's extraordinary.<eos> You're very kind, Joan.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> You think about it.<eos> I will.
Oh, my God!<eos> (exhales)<eos> Crap.<eos> I thought your grandfather lived in a nursing home.<eos> It's a retirement community, it's not a prison.<eos> He can leave anytime that he wants.<eos> I think it's nice he wants to stay with you for a while.<eos> Did something happen in the nursing home?<eos> You know what, if I tell you, you're just gonna read into it all sorts of stuff.<eos> I won't.
Look, you should call Nathan and talk to him.<eos> You know that he loves you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Antwon, it's 3:00 a.m.<eos> I know, baby.<eos> I was checking to see if Julian called.<eos> He said he was gonna hook me up with his sports-coordinating contacts.<eos> I know that's what he said, and I'm sure he will, but nobody's gonna call at 3:00 in the morning.<eos> - He could.<eos> - He won't.
Don't call me a bitch.<eos> You need to stop doing cocaine.<eos> And you know I say that with no judgment and a lot of experience because it's my cocaine you've been doing.<eos> - Alex...<eos> - That you took out of my closet with all of my clothes Miss "I've been up all night and I have my own key to your room."<eos> So don't lie to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have you ever done coke before this?<eos> Then trust me... it's time to stop.<eos> I will.
How you doing?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> No, I suppose I don't.<eos> But I want you to know something...<eos> I know that I've talked about slowing down and taking our time... but I want you to know that whenever we do get pregnant,<eos> That's gonna be a great day. And I'll be more than okay with it.<eos> We're not gonna have that day.<eos> Baby, we will.
You bought breakfast for everyone,so i got lunch for everyone.<eos> Okay,well,allow me.<eos> You know what-- gosh,these tacos are awfully complicated to make.<eos> I will make everyone's tacos.<eos> So we should get the check?<eos> - What about your gift,michael?<eos> - Oh,no,no,no.<eos> No,it's stupid.You'd hate it.I hate it.<eos> - I'm sure i won't.<eos> - Yes,you will.
Were there any military manoeuvres going on at Langley at that time?<eos> The annual air show, but nothing as big as this.<eos> he's killed again, hasn't he?<eos> Luckily for me.<eos> Luckily?<eos> Now we're alone.<eos> You stated that the families don't know the killer. why?<eos> Now we wait, right?<eos> you and I, See if my... admirer contacts me.<eos> He will.
Which brings me to my last condition.<eos> I want to be your agent, Nate, but if you're gonna sign with me, you need to know that I plan on falling completely and insanely in love with Quinn.<eos> All right.<eos> I got to go to work.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This doesn't mean that I don't love you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> 'Cause I do love you, Lauren...<eos> And I always will.
Talk to me.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I can't stop it.<eos> I want to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I can't stop it.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
Oh, my god.<eos> I can't stop it.<eos> I want to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I can't stop it.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> I will.
She's lying. when she says she's sorry, she means it.<eos> She cares about reynolds, but just not enough to tell the whole truth.<eos> We need to up the stakes on her, Make it more clear how her actions are affecting reynolds.<eos> How much pull you got with the justice department?<eos> It depends.<eos> what are you asking for?<eos> I need to call in a favor.<eos> I'm gonna take run at her.<eos> She's not gonna simply crack under pressure.<eos> Under the right kind of pressure, she will.
Yeah, she is.<eos> Hey, look, uh, you know, they pulled me away so fast, I never got a chance to tnank you--<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> Family doesn't need to stand on ceremony, all right?<eos> Court's in session.<eos> It's time, agent reynolds.<eos> All right.<eos> Here goes.<eos> You'll get it done.<eos> That i will.
But that isn't all.<eos> There are other things to worry about.<eos> Do you know what the villagers call us?<eos> A family of spies.<eos> Spies!<eos> I beg of you, let me stay.<eos> I was his wife.<eos> Please!<eos> I won't go home.<eos> I won't!
You keep it small.<eos> FRIEDMAN:<eos> Hi. - Hi, how are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Hey, can Matthew come out and play?<eos> No, Matthew's getting ready for bed.<eos> - Just tell him Ruxin's here.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> You know, I'll hook up with him online.<eos> No, you won't.

This is just getting started.<eos> Okay, who's that?<eos> Some guy Robin knows.<eos> He says I owe him for this weed I didn't buy like two weeks ago.<eos> Robin, what kind of world do you live in?<eos> This is our house.<eos> It's okay, Erica.<eos> Just have a beer and enjoy yourself.<eos> Leo, what if it's not? I mean, what if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
did they die in the last six months?<eos> No.<eos> Then who cares?<eos> hand me my drink.<eos> You don't have to fish for an invite. i'd love you to come.<eos> I guess i could probably come.<eos> did you just slap me in the face with a "probably"?<eos> Now if you wanna come, you're gonna have to beg for it.<eos> Yeah, i'll never do that.<eos> Yes, he will.
!<eos> It is my fault.<eos> However...<eos> A single princess's escape is all that happened.<eos> I still remain in the palace, so all authority belongs to me.<eos> We shall move onto our second phase.<eos> You are calling for a court meeting in the morrow?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hence, Misaeng and Hajong, make sure not a single courtier misses this meeting.<eos> Yes... We will.
?<eos> I wanna know ?<eos> But then again, these elevators can take forever.<eos> ?<eos> Baby ?<eos> (Laughs) cyrus, enough.<eos> Yes, enough.<eos> I will.<eos> I will tell her.<eos> I will.
Amen.<eos> Dance with me?<eos> Teddy...<eos> Come on, one dance.<eos> Between friends.<eos> Fine, between friends.<eos> You know, I probably shouldn't leave Naomi for too long since she's my date and all.<eos> I'm sure she'll survive.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Of course she will.
Nobody sits like this at home.<eos> People don't come round to your house. "Do take a seat."<eos> I tried a bed, and you lie on the bed.<eos> Not how you'd normally sleep, it's like this...<eos> Next to my wife, as well.<eos> "I like this bed.<eos> Do you like the bed?" "Oh, I love it.<eos> It's a really good bed."<eos> "Will we be using it as a coffin?"<eos> "Evidently we will, darling."
Let's just say there's Squirt in it<eos> Squirt?<eos> Is that not the favorite drink of one Harry Potter?<eos> Is it? I had no idea<eos> Well, we better be going<eos> We? I...<eos> I better be going<eos> Loud music hurts my ears<eos> Okay well I'll see you later then<eos> Or maybe you won't

Each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species.<eos> Anyway, I think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us that might just give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew and letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is.<eos> I don't know, it's just a thought.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> Cheers, everyone.<eos> Let's eat!<eos> What?<eos> I was just playing along with the bit he was doing.<eos> Will you join me?<eos> I will.
People don't usually recognize me. Not on the subway, anyway.<eos> My name's Henry.<eos> How funny.<eos> I have a son named Henry.<eos> But he's just 3.<eos> I met a girl.<eos> And since I've been with her, I feel safe.<eos> I haven't felt that way for a long time. Not since I was a kid.<eos> I wish she could hear you sing.<eos> Maybe she will one day.
Paid the last round of bills, this month's mortgage.<eos> Today. Like doc says, attitude.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just love you so much.<eos> Mom, love hurts.<eos> Mom, just--<eos> Look, I want you to know that if-- lf what?<eos> -That if I die--<eos> -You won't.
But you?<eos> You can give your poor daddy everything he ever wanted.<eos> Come on, Tiana.<eos> You're almost there.<eos> My daddy never did get what he wanted.<eos> But he had what he needed.<eos> He had love. He never lost sight of what was really important.<eos> - Easy with that.<eos> Careful.<eos> - And neither will I!
No, what we're talking about here is your basic secondary type of fella, the fella that thinks he's a great lover, your sensitive male smoothie type.<eos> Now, what they're into is a woman's pleasure.<eos> And giving the woman pleasure, that's this type's whole trip.<eos> And I'm guessing from looking at you over here right now that you've been up against a smoothie a time or two, who runs down to Barnes and Noble's for all the latest female sexuality-type books,<eos> huh, right?<eos> With the pheromone aftershave and holding and touching, and you know, about the earlobe and the back side of the knee and, and all that, with the strawberry oil and the hand massages.<eos> But, but, will he let the little lady replicate?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Will he allow her to give him so much as a backrub?<eos> No, sir, he will not,
You don't want me to come under there and get you, do you? - No.<eos> - I'm going to count to three.<eos> - One, two...<eos> - No.<eos> Two and a half, two and three quarters, three.<eos> Here I come.<eos> - No! What do you want?<eos> - What you wanted from your mother.<eos> I want you to love me.<eos> Okay. I will.
What we call it isn't important.<eos> It's what gives all matter mass.<eos> The thing without which we could not exist.<eos> You're talking about the moment of creation.<eos> Yes. In a way, I am.<eos> The antimatter is suspended there in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets in each end.<eos> If it were to fall out of suspension and come in contact with matter say, the bottom of the canister, the two opposing forces would annihilate one another violently.<eos> And what might cause it to fall out of suspension?<eos> The battery going dead.<eos> - Which it will, just before midnight.
They're hardly disguised.<eos> - It's what I have.<eos> - Fine. I'll go in.<eos> You don't have communication.<eos> You can't carry a walkie talkie.<eos> - Tourists have cell phones.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You can't send her in there alone.<eos> All right.<eos> I won't.
-Bye.<eos> We stayed the whole night awake, making plans.<eos> I thought that I would never happen.<eos> It's crazy, but I swear that never I was so sure in my entire life.<eos> We married.<eos> Yes, Bubu and I will marry.<eos> -But ...<eos> -No, but no.<eos> I love her and we married.<eos> Yes, we will.
Yes, in fact, Milliken was the author of the most authoritative book on the subject.<eos> This man did not commit these crimes.<eos> The case has not been solved.<eos> But, look, there's the wound from 10 years ago.<eos> -I stake my reputation on it.<eos> -Well, that's not much.<eos> -The media are outside.<eos> -Then I will announce -that we have solved the case.<eos> -I wouldn't.<eos> -I will.
No therapist can know as much about you as I do.<eos> It hurts. I know.<eos> There's no way around it.<eos> I want to talk to...<eos> Nah, I'm not gonna let you do that.<eos> Will it just go on and on?<eos> No.<eos> No, it'll change.<eos> Will it get any worse?<eos> Yes, it will.
- And you eat at all these places for free?<eos> All you want.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> What do y'all do with all the leftover food from the restaurant?<eos> We have to throw some out, what's already cooked.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> - Yeah, I'd rather sell it.<eos> Seems like you could give it away or something.<eos> - You should check into that, Daddy.<eos> All right, I will, SJ.
I was thinking about the afternoon I delivered my statement to the House. Do you remember?<eos> We came back here for tea.<eos> There were some people on the pavement outside... not many, five or six.<eos> - I remember.<eos> One of them was a middle-aged man... a shopkeeper perhaps, or a bus driver.<eos> He was full of hope and trust.<eos> "Good luck, Winnie," he said.<eos> "God bless you."<eos> I mustn't let him down.<eos> - You won't.
I need to talk. - What?<eos> I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and...<eos> Is this something we really wanna do?<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> You guys, it's Big. I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.<eos> Get some sleep, groomie.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - It's just everything is great as it is.<eos> I don't wanna screw it up.<eos> - You won't.
I can take care of myself.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Mack could have cut you up last night.<eos> - How do you know what he'd have done?<eos> - You setting' up a date with a vampire?<eos> What do you have, a death wish?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> I happen to think judging an entire group of people based on the actions of a few individuals within that group is morally wrong.<eos> I will not let you put yourself or this bar in danger.<eos> I won't.
How different?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just feel it.<eos> And its not just because she's beautiful.<eos> It is a marriage of true souls.<eos> I'm sure you can understand that.<eos> Oh, sun, go away.<eos> Leave us to our own devices.<eos> I love you, Anne Boleyn.<eos> I always will.
"Hey, um, you're poor."<eos> "Well, hey, your mama's dead."<eos> That's what friends do.<eos> It's...<eos> You're so white.<eos> All right.<eos> Well...<eos> If you really believe that Stanley was joking...<eos> - Why don't we go ask him that?<eos> - Okay, I will.
- and ponder what you've said?<eos> - No.<eos> My poor maiden is being tormented by a terrible monster.<eos> She grows weaker by the minute.<eos> A monster?<eos> I mean, she looks ill, but I think it's a bit of a leap to say it's the work of a monster.<eos> There's a monster in there.<eos> J.d., she's febrile, her liver's enlarged, and her kidney's are shutting down.<eos> Are you gonna help me, or not?<eos> I will.
I'm on it, slick.<eos> You don't remember where you left that cup of pee, do you?<eos> No clue. We have to find it or he's gonna kill us.<eos> Us? Try you.<eos> He's not killing me.<eos> Why is it getting harder to walk?<eos> That was lucky.<eos> So, have you killed anyone yet?<eos> What?<eos> Well, you will.
There is medicine in the Stankiewcze police station, yes?<eos> Tuvia and I grew up there.<eos> The Bielski Otriad can destroy the transmitter.<eos> You are too sick.<eos> Stay in the truck. Make sure it's in gear when we get back.<eos> - No. I'm coming with you.<eos> - I give the orders tonight. You don't have to do this.<eos> - I don't?<eos> What about the typhus? - So more die.<eos> They will anyway. Zus!
/ - Have a good time tonight.<eos> /Come on, you.<eos> This is Tim.<eos> He's coming with us today.<eos> - Just joking.<eos> - Ooh, can't win them all.<eos> - Apparently not.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> - Will you? - Yeah.
Shut up.<eos> - Thank you, Sookie.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> - Bud, let's roll before I melt in here.<eos> Stop.<eos> Mama, I don't need any sunblock.<eos> Oh, please, Hoyt, if anyone needs sun block, it's you.<eos> Your skin's whiter than Desitin.<eos> Mama, I'm gonna move out. I swear it, I will.<eos> No, you won't.
Mmm. I see.<eos> Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.<eos> No, it's nothing like that.<eos> It's just that I am worried about him.<eos> He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons Dragons.<eos> Dungeons ... Good God!<eos> Hasn't he seen the Aferschool Special?<eos> You've got to talk to him, Fry.<eos> Make him quit now, before he completely loses his mind.<eos> -Okay, I will.
What are you, like 16 years old?<eos> Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Skyler...<eos> I just... haven't quite been myself lately.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> Thanks for noticing.<eos> I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.<eos> Nothing about that has changed.<eos> Nothing ever will.
Marie.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Hey, turn around and look at me.<eos> This...<eos> This here...<eos> I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.<eos> This is degrading.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You hope I'll make it easy on you and just drop dead, don't you?<eos> Well, I won't.
- What is it?<eos> Aunt is a bit strange, no?<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> I do not know.<eos> She says almost nothing.<eos> You should give her time to get used to us.<eos> have a nice day.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> And look if you can find your pink beret.<eos> - I will.
Eat at the diner every night?<eos> Steak and cobbler?<eos> Dad, that's you.<eos> That's not me.<eos> Bella, come on, I just...<eos> I just got you back.<eos> Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now, then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.<eos> Your father's gonna forgive you.<eos> Why don't you let me drive?<eos> He won't.
- Oh, I'm gonna have nightmares! - Quiet.<eos> Come along, Jezzabelle.<eos> Hey, are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Definitely.<eos> There we go.<eos> Perfecto.<eos> This is not at all what I was thinking.<eos> - This'll never work.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sure it will.
it says i'm sorry.<eos> for what?<eos> dad,if you've relapsed, it's okay. we'll get you help.<eos> chuck saw you earlier.<eos> i wasn't buying drugs.<eos> a passport?<eos> you're skipping town?<eos> i'm gonna be a much better father to you from dominica than i will be from jail.<eos> no,dad. i know you're scared, but we'll get through the trial.<eos> no,we won't.
And he's still afraid of the dark,<eos> But he thinks he's too old to admit it,<eos> So I have to pretend To forget to turn off the light at bedtime.<eos> And he likes to read.<eos> And all he wants for his 8th birthday Is to never go to a hospital again.<eos> He-He's a wonderful boy.<eos> I can see that, but, mrs. Madison, I can't.<eos> In good conscience, I can't deliver your baby early Because I'm sure she's wonderful, too.<eos> We are good people and-And we didn't go into this lightly- Having this baby- And we will love her.<eos> We will.
Cooper.<eos> Dean's parents are here...<eos> Thanks.<eos> And everyone else.<eos> There's a lobby full of patients... In case anyone is interested in working here Or running this place.<eos> There's a girl dean likes, but sex is a long way off.<eos> I've had pregnant 13 year olds Whose parents have said the same thing.<eos> Dean needs to know his h.I.V. Status<eos> Before he starts experimenting.<eos> And he will.
It's a big day tomorrow.<eos> The biggest day.<eos> I'll get back to you, Molly.<eos> What did Evan get you for your birthday?<eos> A Blackberry.<eos> We'll get you some more and you can make a birthday crumble.<eos> Have we met before, Alex?<eos> I was scared and I was so alone, and you took my hand.<eos> What would you do if your goddaughter found out?<eos> She won't.
Flynn?<eos> Flynn?<eos> I'm out of time.<eos> We gotta get you going.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> My legs are too slow. You go.<eos> I will...
Okay, so turn so you're facing each other.<eos> Oh, Gina.<eos> Well, we're definitely doing it now, so...<eos> Okay, face each other.<eos> Paul, would you --<eos> Okay, fine, fine, fine.<eos> We'll do an imago.<eos> Okay, move in a little closer.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> Me, I will.
I understand that you would be viewing this with...<eos> - With caution.<eos> - Don't explain to me what I'm doing.<eos> So what changed?<eos> I guess I just realized what...<eos> What I was gonna lose.<eos> I haven't seen you for two weeks...<eos> I haven't spoken to you or seen you, heard from you.<eos> - No, that'll pass.<eos> - No, it won't.

Now ask him where the money is.<eos> Now we have to turn this house upside down, damn it.<eos> Did it bite you?<eos> No, no, stop pissing that animal off.<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing?<eos> Look, son, this is the address.<eos> Hotel El Corso.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I won't, sir.
The way he looks at me sometimes.<eos> As if he's scared of what he feels for me, I love him.<eos> But not in the way I love you.<eos> Take this.<eos> Knowing there has to be more to life than this.<eos> Knowing I'm special, waiting for someone to see it.<eos> I saw it.<eos> You save one life, 100 lives but it's never enough.<eos> Who'll save me?<eos> I will.
- If we'd been one minute later<eos> We weren't.<eos> - We stopped him.<eos> - What happens when you have to stop me?<eos> - If the freezing doesn't work?<eos> - It won't come to that.<eos> I can feel it coming. It's pushing me out.<eos> What will you do when I lose my last bit of me?<eos> We will figure something out, Beth.<eos> No, we won't.
My cock is tired of your mouth!<eos> I'm losing my erection.<eos> I am afraid of it asks me to do.<eos> I got it.<eos> It's fun!<eos> Uncle Joe!<eos> No!<eos> Uncle Joe!<eos> Let's put a little of this...<eos> I will not!
- I'll tell you if I've done it.<eos> - Erm, a flower.<eos> Yeah, I've done flowers, I've done fruit, cakes. - (Laughs)<eos> I do women sometimes.<eos> I actually did, like...<eos> It weren't awesome but it was an OK drawing of the Eiffel Tower.<eos> - The Eiffel Tower?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Show it to me.<eos> - Yeah, of course I will.
I've seen you in the-- I've seen you in the papers.<eos> Seen him in the papers?<eos> Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> Oh, I'll have some champagne.<eos> Yes, congratulations to Signore Valentino Garavani.<eos> We all feel that Valentino so deserves this award, as you do too.<eos> I got half of it, I'm sure.<eos> Everybody is asking if you can cut those off.<eos> - But what if it rains again?<eos> - No, it won't.
- Cover for me.<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause you're wasting time.<eos> Ten minutes.<eos> Hey!<eos> So what's going on?<eos> I know you.<eos> You know that guy that hit you...<eos> - What if he comes back?<eos> - He won't.
Helena...<eos> Helena...<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> But when did beauty ever pay the rent?<eos> I am sorry, Em.<eos> I just got caught up in the passion of it.<eos> It was like it was waiting, calling to me.<eos> I suppose you can't leave the poor thing unfinished.<eos> - I can and I will.<eos> - Oh, no, you won't.
However, I cannot deny you in your hour of need.<eos> I never could and you know that.<eos> But I have to tell you, I fear for us all in this.<eos> What are we to make of this?<eos> The Squire bringing a child to Miss Lane in the dead of night.<eos> We are to make of it that Sir Timothy is in dire straits and it is not in our business to turn him away.<eos> That was my meaning, ma'am.<eos> If somebody could bring us up some port?<eos> - Sir Timothy is quite shaken.<eos> - I will, ma'am.
No scar.<eos> The past, right?<eos> Which means, to you, I'm the boogeyman.<eos> It's a hell of a thing.<eos> You coming here to find out That you and I are brothers.<eos> Brothers?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that you've come all this way, peter,<eos> But I can't help you.<eos> Can't?<eos> I won't.
Thank you.<eos> For everything.<eos> It's what I'm here for.<eos> You take care.<eos> Well, it's been... interesting.<eos> Oh, it's been fun.<eos> You know it has.<eos> Well, everyone else has had a go.<eos> You can so come back any time!<eos> Well, maybe I will.
And put your phone on vibrate.<eos> Whatever happened to "Not being intimidated by strong women"<eos> "Harnessing that dynamo"?<eos> She's trying to take over U-Sag.<eos> She emails me at least a dozen times a day.<eos> She put her email on all the flyers.<eos> Now she's even got Ted and Sanjay including a prayer for a greater U-Sag profile on campus in their daily intercessions.<eos> Well, dale, you just can't hide out here.<eos> You're eventually going to have to talk to her.<eos> No, I won't.
Just as I thought.<eos> - Please leave.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> You are a skeptic.<eos> Therefore, you must wait in the hall preferably at the end.<eos> You're killing all of my jubes.<eos> Jubes are candies. Exactly.<eos> You better take off that robe.<eos> I will.
Jonah's asked me to bring Nikki here.<eos> No.<eos> She has a right to know.<eos> No way.<eos> She said not knowing is the worst part.<eos> How are you going to tell her her child has aged 40 years in seven months?<eos> That he's scarred, that he can't look after himself...<eos> We don't have the right to hide it from her!<eos> If you tell her, you have to tell her about the rift and Torchwood.<eos> Then I will.
Appendicitis<eos> -you're kidding -Awesome!<eos> -And God exists<eos> -Gotta go<eos> Ciao.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Easy with the meds mum I'm just going to England<eos> That's for bellyaches.<eos> Will you remember ?<eos> I will
Maybe she went away for Christmas.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll go out tomorrow.<eos> I'll walk into town.<eos> There's got to be work.<eos> Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> Just you wait, Mum.<eos> - What if it never gets better?<eos> - Of course it will.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> You talk all the time, but you don't say anything.<eos> I know.<eos> Just...<eos> When I look at her now, I can see them, the hole they left, all the pain that filled it.<eos> Just don't know if I can face that every day.<eos> It won't stay like that.<eos> She'll help you.<eos> We both will.
They're converting the atmosphere, changing the planet into a clone world.<eos> Earth becomes a very big hatchery 'cause the Sontarans are clones.<eos> That's how they reproduce.<eos> Give them a planet this big, they'll create billions of new soldiers.<eos> The gas isn't poison, it's food!<eos> My heart, it's getting slower.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> In your mind, you've got so many plans.<eos> There's so much that you want to do.<eos> And I will.
Ritchie's doing the fox-trot with a giant.<eos> You see there,christine? He found a girl.<eos> There's a lid for every pot.<eos> Even a pot in a cheap little suit.<eos> I'm on testosterone right now,and I could kill you.<eos> Marly!<eos> chriE. Stin.<eos> I've taken their crap for three years,richard. For three years.<eos> You didn't stop taking that cream.<eos> No,and I never will.
Open it.<eos> New York?<eos> Why would I want to go to New York?<eos> She's thin, she's blonde, she says "Wow" a lot.<eos> It's over, Tone.<eos> Me and Cassie are done.<eos> You said so yourself.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> You'll find her.<eos> You just will.
I can't sleep.<eos> I hate the waterbed.<eos> I actually kind of like it.<eos> No,it's awful.<eos> We're returning it tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm glad you got it though.<eos> Me too.<eos> I hope they'll take it back.<eos> They will.
Oh, he won't lie for you, not any more.<eos> In fact, he'll be glad I found out.<eos> What?<eos> Forget it.<eos> When did you speak to Rob?<eos> You've been doing more than just speaking to him, haven't you?<eos> I knew there was someone, but...<eos> Christ!<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> No, you won't.
That so?<eos> I know ain't no pea shooter gonna save you.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> Because that's the job, kid.<eos> Even if you manage to scrape out of this one there's just gonna be something else down the road.<eos> Folks like us there ain't no happy ending.<eos> We all got it coming.<eos> Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine.<eos> I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive.<eos> Which you won't.
What about the first wall?<eos> What's gonna stop me, huh?<eos> The minefield?<eos> Please. Don't tell them.<eos> Sweep the area.<eos> There's a dirt road at the bottom of the hill.<eos> - Your husband...<eos> Just go.<eos> He won't help you.<eos> That will.
How 'bout now, you punk?<eos> How 'bout now?<eos> !<eos> Okay! Okay! They bought a phone, man.<eos> I want the receipt.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> On their way.<eos> You have any idea who the buyer is?<eos> No. And we never will.
It'll do.<eos> Can he see me?<eos> No.<eos> He'll find a way out of this.<eos> He always does.<eos> Well, if that's your evidence...<eos> I mean, it could be me...<eos> it could be Martin Bormann.<eos> I'll see you in court, Detective.<eos> You will.
Where's the wool?<eos> - Forgive me, please.<eos> - No problem.<eos> A little patience here, please.<eos> It's over, it's over.<eos> Don't bother, everything will be fine.<eos> We won't tell the father.<eos> I can tell him it's me who dumped fish.<eos> - You really won't tell him?<eos> - No, I won't, I won't.
- Yay, disco!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Listen, I have an awesome idea.<eos> We call a taxi which will take you to school. And no fuck can get you out of there!<eos> - Zhanna, I love you so much.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - Can I skip the school tomorrow?<eos> - Well, you can.<eos> Mum won't turn you in.<eos> She won't.
- Yeah.<eos> She's our new hair stylist.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - You were very helpful.<eos> - Oh, I try.<eos> You know, actually, if you, um... if you think of anything else,<eos> - you give me a call.<eos> - Oh, okay, I will.
Everybody should try that sometime.<eos> It's not just about shooting, it's about being out in nature.<eos> Sitting by a lake in the forest in the early morning, drinking tea and Underberg.<eos> Then at some point the ducks fly by. And then you shoot, that's why you're there.<eos> I think my parents really like you.<eos> They asked us to go with them to the summer house this weekend.<eos> - Okay. What did you say?<eos> - No of course.<eos> Then we'll have the house to ourselves. If you want to come over mean.<eos> Of course I will.
He wrote back.<eos> "I am traveling in Taiwan this week.<eos> Please e-mail me the report as arranged."<eos> Okay.<eos> Send him back a message.<eos> Just say everything's fine.<eos> Nothing suspicious.<eos> We can keep him online that way.<eos> But I thought you were supposed to contact Bailey the second this guy contacted you.<eos> I will.
Thanks.<eos> I got it.<eos> That's Andrew calling about lunch today.<eos> You want to join us?<eos> Yeah, uh, honey, Andrew, um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Tell him...<eos> Tell him I said hi.<eos> I will.
What's miguel prado doing here?<eos> He is pulling his brother ramon out of some deep doody.<eos> We bust him for kidnap and torture And he's just gonna walk right outta here.<eos> Fucker's lucky he's got an a.d.a. in the family.<eos> It was an off-the-grid investigation.<eos> Is that what you call, "false imprisonment"?<eos> I'm not gonna get railroaded for doing your department's job. Ramon, if you don't take this offer<eos> You're looking at jail time here, okay?<eos> The prick isn't even pressing charges, miguel.<eos> My detectives will!
I've got these giant clown feet that aren't always under my control.<eos> Giant feet.<eos> How about let my flip flop make it up to yours.<eos> - How did you... do that?<eos> - It's my secret weapon.<eos> Double-fisting tonight, huh?<eos> Just single-fisting. I mean, I'm single.<eos> Just an FYI.<eos> I hope to see you around.<eos> You will.
And it's even harder being a beautiful woman.<eos> Everyone assumes I don't try in bed.<eos> - It's discrimination.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> You couldn't last one day in my shoes, maroney.<eos> Right, Toof?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I could totally be black.<eos> You should try being a white woman.<eos> Okay, I will.
Fine.<eos> If you knew your sister was in trouble, you should've told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess I also should've told you your marriage was in trouble.<eos> Ashley, wait.<eos> Look, I know you blame me for your dad leaving, but maybe it's not my fault.<eos> Or maybe it is.<eos> I'm gonna sit on the steps and wait for him.<eos> Your dad hasn't called me back yet.<eos> He will.
It's the truth.<eos> She said she'd help me if I told her the truth.<eos> Ben, it's really nice of you to wanna marry me, but this is not your problem.<eos> This is my problem.<eos> Yeah, well, now it's also Ricky's problem.<eos> He's not going to marry you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Ricky will never marry you.<eos> Yes, Adrian, I know that.<eos> But I will.
Somewhere in spain.<eos> Oh!<eos> Gotta go.<eos> Slow song.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> It's barney.<eos> So?<eos> For all the years heather's been visiting new york,<eos> Ted's never let barney meet her.<eos> And I never will.
You think he'd like to see her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> because Melissa's in the lobby and she wants to see him.<eos> How did she know that we found him?<eos> Well,she might have figured it out when I called her and told her.<eos> Abby,what,what are you doing?<eos> You called her?<eos> Gibbs,Gibbs is gonna kill you!<eos> No,he won't.
It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want.<eos> In a joke.<eos> "Bogeyman with a teleprompter."<eos> Classic.<eos> Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?<eos> I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right.<eos> But I can't tell you what it is.<eos> I should tell you, but I can't!<eos> I have to.<eos> I never will!
A big one.<eos> Don't you, darling?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I'm sorry. What's going on here?<eos> Are you married, dr. Cominis?<eos> No, but I just moved in with someone. Well, over time, you'll learn That there's a balance of power in relationships,<eos> Then the balance of power shifts to you, And then you can demand they prove their love By, say, undergoing surgery.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Not really.<eos> You will.
Karen Darling only wants what she can't have.<eos> Am I right?<eos> My guess is, right about now, she's missing the hell out of me.<eos> In about a day or so, if I ignore all of her phone calls and her texts, she'll be ready to beg me to take her back.<eos> Now when she comes crawling-- and we both know she will-- I'll marry her, take all the shares she has of Darling enterprises, combine them with the shares I've been steadily acquiring, and,uh,take over Tripp Darling's company.<eos> Okay.<eos> uh,so why are you telling me this?<eos> well, because, Nick, I trust that you'll take the information I've just given you, and you will put it to good use.<eos> And--and--and don't forget to vote.<eos> I won't.
You're angry.<eos> I get it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> because now I understand how Tripp Darling lives, works, operates.<eos> fully.<eos> Victories have costs.<eos> Maybe I should take a little less patrick darling down to Washington and, uh. a little more Tripp.<eos> Well, that'll make your father happy.<eos> Oh, no, it won't.
No matter what they do to you, bette, you don't kill people.<eos> Sometimes i don't have a choice!<eos> Chloe, i'm sorry,<eos> But i can't risk you turning on me, too.<eos> Goodbye, chloe!<eos> No!<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> I'll hurt you!<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
I was surprised to find his unsigned statement in his file... about Alicia Perez.<eos> You had agreed to keep it aside till the suspect's arrest.<eos> You misunderstood me.<eos> I said to follow procedure.<eos> Now Rachid's dead.<eos> Smart move, wasn't it?<eos> Your Honour, I don't think the file was leaked.<eos> You can sit down, Pierre.<eos> I'd like to discuss this matter further.<eos> - We most certainly will.
Jenny-- sorry, uh...<eos> You--did you do something with your hair?<eos> Uh, yeah. shorter, blonder.<eos> I was--i was bored.<eos> I like it. it looks-- it looks good.<eos> Oh, go ahead and use the bathroom.<eos> I'm sorry. oh, no.<eos> I didn't mean to-- no, no, no.<eos> I'm gonna go. it's fine.<eos> I'll just...
Damn it! Somebody get in here!<eos> What did you do?<eos> Well done.<eos> Your patient called his lawyer, threatened to sue us.<eos> He's now heading home completely undiagnosed.<eos> He'll soon be on his way back.<eos> He's sick.<eos> He'll crash. He'll lose consciousness.<eos> I'll declare an emergency, bring him back in.<eos> Not anymore you won't.
You know?<eos> And it's important.<eos> Naomi?<eos> Hi,ethan.<eos> Oh,my god.<eos> Look at yourself!<eos> The guys are going to fall all over themselves when they see you tonight.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> at least my daddy will.
Ah, yes.<eos> Treacher.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> No, you say it sat down.<eos> I knew Elsie for almost 20 years.<eos> She was like a sister to me.<eos> She was... Oh!<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Your gran will be spinning in her grave.<eos> No, she won't.
Fractured cheek, broken nose...<eos> - left nut swinging solo.<eos> - Yes, it was beautiful!<eos> Yeah, he's lucky to be breathing.<eos> Any luck up north?<eos> Tacoma could help with the Glocks, but there's no M-4s anywhere.<eos> Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man.<eos> We'll have all the Mayan intel by the morning.<eos> We'll get our guns back.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
.<eos> - Another beer?<eos> . - No, thanks.<eos> What's up? .<eos> I tried calling her.<eos> She hung up on me.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She'll come back.<eos> She won't.
I've waited a long time to do this.<eos> Fuck a real live whore.<eos> Untie me now.<eos> No.<eos> I've paid for you.<eos> I'll do what I want.<eos> This isn't funny.<eos> Unlock it, or I'll scream.<eos> You said we'd spend the night together.<eos> And we will.
I don't like the look of those air quotes.<eos> So now Bart is on his way to Aspen, where they're going to try to kill him.<eos> Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us.<eos> Boy, Aspen sure is ritzy.<eos> Even the winos look better.<eos> Uh, we're champagnos.<eos> Who wants a mimosa?<eos> Uh... this trail is for experienced skiers.<eos> Which is what you'll be if you make it to the bottom.<eos> Which you won't.
You know,there are other waysyou can look after francesand take care of yourself. Oh,no,sam.<eos> I told you.<eos> I'm not gonna put herin a nursing home.<eos> I promised herthat I wouldn't years ago. We promised each other.<eos> Circumstanceswere different then.<eos> -You didn't knowabout the alzheimer'S.<eos> -Sam,I promised her.<eos> When she dies,she dies in my arms--not with strangers,in my arms.<eos> She's the love of my life.<eos> I will not putthe love of my life... in a home.
Did you enjoy my little game?<eos> If it was supposed to frighten me, it did not.<eos> Madame... we have played for long enough.<eos> It is time for the reckoning, I think.<eos> You say you have power over me.<eos> Prove it.<eos> - Affery, old woman, take yourself away!<eos> - No, I shan't, Jeremiah.<eos> I shall stay and learn all I don't know, even if I have to die for it!<eos> - I will!

I want to go back to being weird.<eos> I like being weird, weird's all I've got.<eos> That and my sweet style.<eos> OK, look here, we'll make our excuses when the match is over.<eos> How long do football matches last?<eos> A billion hours apparently.<eos> Gonna play poker tonight, you game?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Moss?<eos> (GRUFF): I won't Dan, no.
I'm going to repark it.<eos> I'm not sure how far I can actually drive before the engine realizes there's no key.<eos> But I think if I push it, I don't know, about here, perfect.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - (Horn sounds) - With that factual test completed, we enjoyed a light breakfast and chatted about our road trip.<eos> How much are you looking forward to Bonneville?<eos> More than I've looked forward to anything pretty much forever.<eos> - (Horn sounds) - I've wanted to go there since I was a boy. (Horn sounds)<eos> - I'm going to buy a Corvette in England.<eos> - (James) You won't.
You pushed it, April?<eos> Never in those 22 years since working here.<eos> What have you done another child is it very seriously.<eos> Understand?<eos> Gina? April?<eos> I am.<eos> It'll be fine, you know. Everything.<eos> Gina ...<eos> - If you send me here?<eos> - I will.
Ah, my Lady Fanshawe.<eos> Master joliffe sits in the Parliament tending the nation's wounds.<eos> He is leaving.<eos> A delight to meet you, madam.<eos> And yet, I swear I have looked upon your face before.<eos> At court, perhaps?<eos> Of course.<eos> In the court.<eos> I never could forget such a face.<eos> And I never will.
The law says you own me.<eos> Live as you please.<eos> You are free.<eos> But there is no freedom.<eos> Except that which comes with money and power.<eos> If you know of any other kind, then you must run after it.<eos> GO!<eos> Where is Christian?<eos> She must not escape a third time.<eos> She'll not, sir.
Oh, no, this isn't right.<eos> Holiday homes for sale.<eos> Burgers...<eos> Traffic.<eos> The car's still brilliant, but the world's changed.<eos> I was just 15 miles from the finish line.<eos> 15 miles at 45 knots is 20 minutes.<eos> Mini golf.<eos> If this car overheats...<eos> Well, it will.
What if something happens to you?<eos> It's alright uncle.<eos> How many people are so duty conscious like your son?<eos> feel proud of him.<eos> Sir, you're really great.<eos> You will catch that thief.<eos> Looking at the fire in you, if you catch him, he will see his worst nightmare.<eos> You are his perfect partner.<eos> You will catch him for sure.<eos> He won't.

Hello?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> - They found the missing newspaper photo.<eos> There are schnitzels in the freezer and mashed potatoes in the fridge.<eos> Mommy, but you promised to make like a monkey.<eos> Daddy will, okay?
Let's hope it works.<eos> Very well written, brilliantly constructed.<eos> Jeremiah wouldn't take money for doing a good deed.<eos> Uh... I know Jeremiah a lot better than you guys.<eos> And believe me, he'd be all over that. He loves money.<eos> Mmm!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.<eos> Gentlemen don't get paid.<eos> Will you just...
You need a nuke to kill me!<eos> Bitch.<eos> Our satellites have spotted two vehicles leaving the compound.<eos> - It's too late to intercept them.<eos> - I'm sick and tired of your damn excuses.<eos> Hello, my dear.<eos> It's lovely to see you.<eos> - Where's my daughter?<eos> - I see you haven't found her.<eos> And you never will.
I love you.<eos> This is what our families do, you know that?<eos> This is what happens.<eos> My mother makes me crazy every time I talk to her.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Here's all we got to do.<eos> We just gotta get through these, Four Christmases... as quickly and as painlessly as possible.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Promise me that no matter what happens today... we'll still have each other, right.<eos> - Honey, of course we will.
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.<eos> This one.<eos> I refuse.<eos> Tony!<eos> He wants to know what you think.<eos> I think you got a lot of my weapons.<eos> He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile.<eos> He wants you to make the list of materials.<eos> He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.<eos> -No, he won't.

You are not a superhero...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Mittens!<eos> Mittens, take my paw!<eos> I need you alive!<eos> You're crazy!<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> Take my paw.<eos> I'll save you.<eos> No, you won't!
We're gonna draw him out.<eos> How?<eos> I copied the data from the tablet before you left.<eos> Joy's been going through it.<eos> Bakuto has been transferring the money that Gao was hiding in Rand to his own account.<eos> And now that we've been reinstated in the company, I have access to the same accounts Bakuto's been draining.<eos> - And I can close them.<eos> - And when that happens...<eos> - you think Bakuto will come here?<eos> - Well, hell, I would.
Hey.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I'm trying to decide whether I'm happy or sad.<eos> People usually know.<eos> I'm sad because... because my husband doubts my love for him.<eos> And happy...?<eos> I'm happy because the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful. For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you, look into your eyes, be in love with you, and feel you being in love with me.<eos> Would you?
Just... (BANG)<eos> I don't know.<eos> HANNAH: I had to do something.<eos> I had to make him stop.<eos> The fuck out of here, man!<eos> But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
You know, I believed I could be brave, that I could be a survivor like Abraham was, and ridin' that RV into the sunset was... some of the greatest 37 minutes of my existence.<eos> But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.<eos> I have never in my life been as scared as I was that night in the woods, kit to the grit, fully believing my number's about to be called, then seeing it happen to someone brave to a survivor.<eos> And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event --<eos> I just... I couldn't.<eos> Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.
I've gone off on vacation somewhere, off the grid.<eos> They need to reach me immediately.<eos> Do I have a favorite place I like to go, somewhere I've always dreamed of going?<eos> And then, it will get uglier.<eos> "Uglier"?<eos> The less you tell them.<eos> They'll call me a traitor, want to know if I ever talked of going over to the other side, selling secrets to the highest bidder.<eos> For Christ's sakes, that's absurd, Saul.<eos> Harry and Leo would never believe that.<eos> No one would.
Can't picture it.<eos> We come from the same place.<eos> Greco's been around for 2,000 years.<eos> It has outlived other grapes.<eos> The wine drunk to toast the end of the world... this will also be Greco.<eos> I like beer.<eos> - Beer for the Berliner.<eos> - Right away.<eos> - Would she really attack him in public?<eos> - I would.
Did you see anything before the explosion?<eos> I know you're in pain, but the detectives will be here soon.<eos> Good.<eos> I want to tell them who did it.<eos> - Frank.<eos> - No.<eos> Where is he, then?<eos> I want to ask him to his face.<eos> You know he would never hurt any of us.<eos> Of course he would.
I nel ed you... in my life...<eos> In ways that I...<eos> I could never even dare to imagine.<eos> I just don't want there to be any more secrets between us.<eos> Well, in that spirit, I suppose I should tell you that I am one half of a nuclear powered superhero called Firestorm.<eos> So not funny, Dad.<eos> Anyway, as fun as this was, I probably should be getting home.<eos> You're sure you can't stay?<eos> I...<eos> I would.
Now, why don't you grow a pair and tell me why you're here.<eos> Tell me about Fred Johnson.<eos> When he joined the opa and everyone lined up to stone him, you stayed quiet.<eos> Why?<eos> There was plenty said about him.<eos> I understand it's hard to watch a war hero...<eos> You don't understand shit about Fred Johnson.<eos> -Enlighten me.<eos> -Oh, then you want<eos> -the real story? -Yes, I would.
Yeah, I gotta call you back.<eos> Hey, hey, listen. Look... you need to back away, okay?<eos> She's not gonna listen to you.<eos> None of them will.<eos> Sybil's controlling them.<eos> Help me untie 'em, now.<eos> Not seeing anything bell-shaped.<eos> Looks like you haven't even bothered to open half these boxes.<eos> I didn't have the heart to, but you wouldn't understand that, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
- No, I'm just a bloke.<eos> I like sex.<eos> - How old was she?<eos> Dunno. 19, 20.<eos> Where did you have sex with her?<eos> In the woods.<eos> Up against a tree.<eos> Don't you look at me like that.<eos> Cos you'd have done the same, if it was offered to you.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
The marbling of the veins.<eos> Signs of scavenger activity.<eos> Ligature marks on both wrists.<eos> And a hint of cryo-necrotic preservation.<eos> Small bills, right?<eos> So, what did Moose want?<eos> Oh, my God, I don't even think he knows.<eos> I mean, I am devastatingly handsome in that classic, pre-accident Montgomery Clift kind of way, and sexuality is fluid, but can someone named Moose actually be that fluid?<eos> Okay, well, I ship it.<eos> Well, of course you would.
Well, of course you would.<eos> You're a big city girl with loose morals.<eos> I just meant that Moose has an official girlfriend, Midge.<eos> Anyway, it's terrible to say, but part of me wishes he would just stay in the darn closet.<eos> Obviously, I didn't mean literal closet.<eos> Archie!<eos> Any new material you wanna try out on a very forgiving audience?<eos> I...<eos> Please?<eos> Would you?
Vengeance boils in Harry Bosch's blood.<eos> It all gives me the chills.<eos> But like any good villain, Bosch sees this world through the narrow filter of his broken childhood.<eos> He wants to save his mother.<eos> He wants to punish her killer.<eos> He sees in me all the things that roil him: Success and sexuality and... and a healthy disregard for his tenuous authority.<eos> Are you thinking this could be your next film?<eos> It's so trope-y.<eos> Who'd believe it?<eos> I would.
And it burned.<eos> Every place I'd been punched burned.<eos> But then I understood.<eos> I understood because the Secret Service agent standing next to me erupted in a spray of blood.<eos> I saw the bullet hit him, and I knew what was happening to me.<eos> And then I got hit here.<eos> I don't remember anything at all after that.<eos> So, yes.<eos> If it were up to me, if canceling this inauguration meant that I could spare the mother of my children experiencing any of that, or worse...<eos> I would.
You think you can trust him, Nick?<eos> No, but I trust his need to destroy me.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> Well, you've done enough.<eos> Why don't you just go back home?<eos> Okay, okay, but if you need me, I'm willing to spend the rest of my life down here in this tunnel, if that's what it takes.<eos> - Uh, what about your wife?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, she probably wouldn't like living down here that much.<eos> But the kids sure would.
Miss Morwenna!<eos> Proper waves, these?<eos> 'Twill not be new to you, young master, but to I, the discoveries I've made!<eos> Course, ye'll know all about the Holy Well?<eos> No.<eos> What is it?<eos> 'Tis a hollow in the rocks by the sea, but the water's pure an' sweet, on account of it was consecrated a thousand year gone by Saint Sawle himself.<eos> Would 'ee care to see it?<eos> - No, I don't think...<eos> - Of course she would!
Patroclus has just been slain by Hector, and now there is a terrible fight about his body.<eos> For as you know, Vicar, it is of great importance to the Greeks that the funeral rites be performed in full upon the body.<eos> The body, y-yes...<eos> Why do I not think you're very interested in this story, Vicar?<eos> Call me Osborne, would you?<eos> Should you like to sit down, Vicar?<eos> Oh, er... I think you would.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> But of course you would.
Then deny it, lie if necessary.<eos> He has no proof that Valentine is mine.<eos> Do you not love him?<eos> I must find a way.<eos> Close your eyes and submit.<eos> - Of course I've resumed the marital relations!<eos> - Then you must cease forthwith.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> Of course you would.
I can come with, if you want.<eos> Unless there's something you're not telling me.<eos> There's plenty, but you're needed here.<eos> Ward can't be the only one leading the fight.<eos> And just because Mace is gone doesn't mean The Patriot has to be.<eos> What're you saying?<eos> Maybe it's your turn to suit up.<eos> The people could use another Patriot to look up to.<eos> Not gonna lie, I'd look pretty damn fine in that suit.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Going somewhere?<eos> London.<eos> Flying visit.<eos> But you've only just got back.<eos> I know, but something came up.<eos> Something, or someone?<eos> I know what you're thinking, but you couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> Well, then, why all this secrecy?<eos> Believe me, if I could tell you, I would.<eos> Oh, yes, of course you would(! )
Plus, that shit was dark.<eos> - Oops. - Wow.<eos> You girls have been busy.<eos> So, now, tell me, was this murder also part of your nonviolent protest?<eos> The murder ain't the point.<eos> The point is our education program ain't never been no education program, even before it was put on hold for some alleged murder.<eos> Manual labor without instruction ain't an education, and it damn sure ain't no life skills.<eos> You think she'd be sayin' "ain't" so much if we had an education program?<eos> I'd like to believe you.<eos> Really, I would.
I just wanna say thank you so much for bringing me in for this.<eos> There aren't roles like this for women right now.<eos> It's really... ooh. It's really great.<eos> You were reading the man's part.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Uh...<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's... 'cause I just thought Mel was short for Melanie, and then the other part was...<eos> - Would you like to start over?<eos> - Yes, I would.
It would not!<eos> To prove them wrong again...<eos> Gentlemen, people are examining...<eos> Yeah, they are the organisers.<eos> They're wondering about their carpet.<eos> "Handcrafted by a renowned British atelier... sympathetically marries the chassis with..."<eos> - Did you write this?<eos> - Course I wrote it.<eos> "The interior would benefit from some minor attention."<eos> - Well, it would.
- We haven't got time! - Get on with it!<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Let's look at the time.<eos> Time for Jeremy's Alfa Quadriplogio.<eos> That's not quick, mate!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's rubbish!<eos> In the dry, it would have done a 1:15.<eos> - No, it wouldn't. - Yes, it would.<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
I earned this death and you deny me?<eos> No, no, kill me, now!<eos> I couldn't let him do it, partner.<eos> You've got a promise to keep.<eos> Sorry it had to be this way, but nothing's gonna stop me from getting to my family.<eos> And that may be sooner than you think.<eos> This blade is our ticket out of here.<eos> I can't wait to see nos's face.<eos> You'd take my sword?<eos> Yeah, yeah I would.
Isn't that funny?<eos> Not "Vince Vaughn doing drama" funny, but what is?<eos> Wow, Barbara got so big while we were gone.<eos> Oh, shh!<eos> You got to give her a break, 'cause she got her Uncle Fatso's genes.<eos> By the way, Sophie, thank you for watching our horse while we were gone.<eos> He's my favorite roommate.<eos> Aww, well, you know what, that's what friends are for.<eos> And I'm sure you would do the same for me if I needed a favor.<eos> - Of course we would.
- Does Geordie know about this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He left a couple of hours ago.<eos> Around the same time as er...<eos> Margaret.<eos> He told me he was working late.<eos> Well, it's a serious case, the poisoning.<eos> It's not the first time, recently.<eos> Sidney, you'd tell me if you knew something, wouldn't you?<eos> Of course I would.
Welcome to show business!<eos> Mrs McCarthy.<eos> I was hoping to have a word about next week's confirmation class.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I'm on a very tight schedule.<eos> I thought you said you had a day off.<eos> Something about jam-making.<eos> Yes, well, change of plan.<eos> Actually, I'm seeing a gentleman from the British Broadcasting Corporation.<eos> Would that have anything to do with the quiz coming to Kembleford?<eos> Yes, it would.
Look on the Web site.<eos> It's all there.<eos> Why'd you buy so much water, then?<eos> Because I could.<eos> That, and it's gonna take years for that plant to get up and running.<eos> I told you, they're complicated.<eos> This one's gonna take three or four years at least.<eos> Meantime,<eos> I don't want my kids drinking anything out of a tap.<eos> No, you wouldn't.

There are rules.<eos> And friends to help me break them.<eos> - Okay, so wait, so where do they keep the shades?<eos> - Sorry, we don't know that yet.<eos> - So we're flying blind?<eos> - Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.<eos> - No, look, I had an incident when I was a kid.<eos> - My fingers got stuck in the...<eos> - oh, get over it.<eos> Your girl would.
Would you relax?<eos> I've done hundreds of these arraignments.<eos> You don't know what's about to go down, do you?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> First of all, forgive me for earlier.<eos> And this is just a formality, so just try to keep it friendly.<eos> Okay?<eos> Martin, would you like to come over to dinner tonight?<eos> No.<eos> He would not.
I mean, look at that.<eos> You think, "How do they do that with all those fountains?"<eos> Well, I'll let you into a little secret.<eos> It's Perrier water.<eos> Flinging it up into the air.<eos> I heard another one the other day.<eos> A taxi driver clearing out his cab after a hard day at work-- umbrella, mobile phone, usual stuff--<eos> £800,000 gold bar.<eos> Someone had left it in there - and not even noticed.<eos> - You would.
No worries.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Okay, so you're eating floor chips and you sent a uni to retrieve your pants?<eos> A wool cap.<eos> It is getting chilly outside.<eos> Duke!<eos> This is looking like a pretty clear cry for help.<eos> Well, as usual, you're not wrong.<eos> Would you like to help me out?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
I saw the light leave her eyes!<eos> Hey, Dad, who put tulips on Margaret's grave?<eos> Clearly someone who wants to torture me.<eos> Okay, don't be paranoid.<eos> I'm sure it's just a simple mistake.<eos> I chose tulips specifically to torture Larry Henderson.<eos> After all, he killed my baby sister.<eos> Plus, tulips are my wife's favorite flower.<eos> Before we unveil the headstone, would a loved one of Margaret's like to say a few words?<eos> - I would.

He's right in there.<eos> You know, according to your journal, he's Rittenhouse.<eos> In a decade he becomes a monumental ass, spews his hate across America.<eos> The way you feel about Rittenhouse now? Can't tell me it wouldn't be at least a little bit satisfying taking him out.<eos> You can't just kill Charles Lindbergh.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Look, I will go in there, I will talk to him, and I will convince him to leave Rittenhouse and not become the monster he's supposed to become.<eos> And you think he's gonna just, what, give up all that fame, the power, the legacy?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
These are people we're talking about, not cheap political props.<eos> It wasn't my choice.<eos> I hated Russia, what they do to their people.<eos> I got out as soon as I could, but my parents are still there.<eos> They're too poor to leave, too weak to protect themselves.<eos> All I have to do is help the FSB with a little information from time to time and they stay safe.<eos> That's all.<eos> Did you tell them about me?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I would never.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry you've been having such a hard time.<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> I really don't know, Sam.<eos> Do you think he could have done it himself?<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Well, we both know it wasn't you.<eos> You'd never do anything like that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wouldn't.
- Thank you.<eos> Mr. Sims?<eos> - Mr. O'Bryan?<eos> My name's Jimmy Harrell.<eos> Offshore Installation Manager on Deepwater.<eos> Buddy, thank you very much for taking us out today.<eos> I know you guys are swamped and you didn't have to.<eos> No, I had to.<eos> Listen, you mind losing that tie?<eos> I would.
It was the crawl.<eos> I thought you'd win.<eos> So I bet on the winner.<eos> If I'd asked you, would you have betrayed me, too?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I guess betrayal runs in my family.<eos> I...<eos> I wouldn't have betrayed you.<eos> I wonder...<eos> Yes, you would.
Not that you're ever gonna find out.<eos> Because you will never be invited into my basement.<eos> I don't wanna see your basement!<eos> Yes, you do!<eos> And by the way, Claire works for me.<eos> Actually, Michelle, I can't work for you anymore.<eos> I got a new job.<eos> I just came to tell you as a courtesy.<eos> I would think a courtesy would be you sticking with me through my tough times, Claire.<eos> I would.
No, I know.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> Just about individuals.<eos> Probably.<eos> I think we have a lot of people willing to fight to support people who want to be free.<eos> And Americans love a cause.<eos> So if I start a democratic revolution here, you would support me?<eos> - Oh, is this your plan?<eos> - No, I'm just asking.<eos> Would you?
We tell the stories of our elders In a never-ending chain<eos> We know the way<eos> Shiny<eos> I'm so shiny<eos> Didn't help me though, did it?<eos> Still upside down here.<eos> Just need a little push.<eos> Can we be real?<eos> If my name was Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent... you'd totally help me.<eos> You would.
You're not here to sleep with or perform jobs of any type on my Marines.<eos> Clear copy, Miss Baker?<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - Good.<eos> We'll get you out to a FOB as soon as we find a ride for you.<eos> In the meantime, Captain Stern here will see to it that you get a wet hootch.<eos> A what?<eos> It's a tent with a shower.<eos> Unless you'd prefer a dry hootch.<eos> I would not, sir.
Maybe he found out the batch was dodgy, dumped it and did a runner.<eos> Maybe somebody else found out and didn't like the fact that he'd come back with dodgy goods.<eos> So what next?<eos> Go and join Tosh.<eos> I'll catch you up later.<eos> I've got a call make first.<eos> Andrew... it's a social call.<eos> How are they doing?<eos> Oh, aye, they're loving it.<eos> America... who wouldn't?
Well, I had to take you 'cause the first thing you'd be doing, you'd be scuttling around and yodelling the news that you were actually seeing a giant.<eos> And then, there would be a great rumple dumpus, wouldn't there?<eos> And all the human beans would be rummaging and whiffling for the giant what you saw, and getting wildly excited.<eos> And then they'd be locking me up in a cage to be looked at with all the squiggling, you know...<eos> Hippodumplings, and crocadowndillies, and jiggyraffes.<eos> And then, there would a gigantous look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> No one would listen to me anyway.<eos> I'm an untrustworthy child.<eos> Yes, you would.

Good girl.<eos> If you want to play with all the new toys and be safe you pay the price of admission.<eos> But the people, they don't even know they've made that bargain.<eos> Where's the battlefield, soldier?<eos> Everywhere.<eos> -What's the first rule of battle?<eos> Never reveal your position.<eos> And if one unauthorized person knew?<eos> If Congress knew?<eos> So would the enemy.
Doctor's going to help your baby to be born, dear.<eos> Sister Julienne!<eos> - Mrs Cottingham!<eos> - It's all gone wrong, Sister!<eos> Cervix not fully dilated.<eos> I can't get my fingers between the cervix and the head.<eos> It's so swollen.<eos> It's all right, Ruby...<eos> I'd be screaming my head off if you weren't here.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Told you it was weird.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nygma's waiting for us.<eos> Frozen.<eos> Interesting.<eos> It took nearly five seconds to freeze this rose in liquid nitrogen.<eos> So?<eos> Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass - and body fat, of course.<eos> - So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.
- Oh, boy.<eos> All right, listen. The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> Um... I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> - You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> - I did. I did. I did.<eos> But said chatter may have been fudged.<eos> - So you lied to me?<eos> Out of pity. You pity me.<eos> - I wouldn't put it that way.<eos> - I would.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Actually...<eos> Why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby<eos> - if they want an ice cream as well, huh?<eos> - Would you like an ice cream?<eos> - No.<eos> - Really?<eos> Would you?
- How does she know what to do? - It's in the blood.<eos> He looked just like an ordinary man, like an officer, but it was him!<eos> Now, what she should have done was keep him talking, but she got so frightened and she tried to run away, and he grabbed her!<eos> You don't need to worry about him here now.<eos> But you can tell your fortune..<eos> ...if you go out to the barn at night.<eos> - How? What do you do?<eos> You stand and you listen... and if you hear knocking, that's bad, but if you hear grain pouring, it's good.<eos> But I don't suppose any of you would go out there.<eos> I would.
But not for eight years.<eos> Less.<eos> Much less.<eos> You see what I'm getting at?<eos> Not really.<eos> The gun charge, that's eight years he's going away, maybe 10.<eos> Aggravated assault, the gun, plus, he got your wallet.<eos> That's right.<eos> I would like for you to tell the police that the gun was yours.<eos> Would you?
Give my regards to your ladies at tea.<eos> They're not my ladies.<eos> I can't marry a Frenchman!<eos> Why, is there something wrong with Frenchmen?<eos> You don't know about Frenchmen?<eos> How they...<eos> You are English.<eos> Do you know what she's talking about?<eos> I'm afraid I don't.<eos> Well, of course you wouldn't.
You know in Oklahoma, we weren't even allowed to mingle with Jews growing up.<eos> Really!<eos> You guys are money lenders.<eos> No, we control everything, actually.<eos> I didn't even see a Jew until I moved to New York.<eos> No... no horns.<eos> No.<eos> I find Jews exotic and mysterious.<eos> It wouldn't mind, if you had horns.<eos> You wouldn't? Nah.
He's in hospital.<eos> He's where?<eos> In the General Hospital, I think.<eos> I really need you to go there, - find out how he is.<eos> - Me? Why?<eos> Why can't you?<eos> You know why.<eos> The fucking bail conditions!<eos> - Why would they let me in?<eos> - They wouldn't.
- 'Yeah, I do, I do.<eos> 'Well, there are 11 million homeless children in Africa,' 12% of whom are very likely to die before they reach the age of 13.<eos> It was the name of a charity drive we were considering, but then dropped.<eos> Really?<eos> It doesn't sound very likely.<eos> - Are you suggesting that I'm lying to you?<eos> - Why did you drop it?<eos> - Because it wasn't memorable enough.<eos> - You remembered it.<eos> Well, I would, wouldn't I?
They're still making payments every month to one person.<eos> Who's Henry Williams?<eos> I'm sorry. He's not in.<eos> What did you say this was all about?<eos> I'm not sure I did say, Mrs Williams.<eos> We just want to talk to him.<eos> That's all.<eos> I... Is he in some sort of trouble?<eos> Now, why would you think that?<eos> I wouldn't.
- What did I tell you?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Well, but you gotta hand it to him. This was the best voice-mail ever!<eos> It would've been.<eos> - It would've been.<eos> - Ocho!<eos> Mas tequila, pendejo!<eos> Then we're gonna go have us a long talk with Miss Daisy and the Jew.<eos> So, would you say it's serious?<eos> Ugh! I would, Alan.
Bet she could teach me a thing or two, like, how to finish an article in the New Yorker.<eos> I think I would marry her.<eos> Wiccan wedding.<eos> First dance to Wicked Wisdom.<eos> Fist!<eos> Uhh, you know...<eos> Okay, I would eat that baby.<eos> - Is that terrible of me?<eos> - No.<eos> - I just would.
When he's around, everything just works.<eos> There's food in the fridge.<eos> I get to camp on time.<eos> Mom is a whole lot calmer.<eos> What's she like now?<eos> Kind of just all over the place.<eos> And I know this is a weird thing to say because you and Mom were married and everything.<eos> But Reggie's a good guy.<eos> And I wouldn't want him to, you know, leave us for good.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
Just make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.<eos> - Please, I need you.<eos> - No, Nick.<eos> It's a right and a privilege.<eos> In South Africa, they don't even have juries.<eos> They have a-a judge and two assessors.<eos> God, I would have bullied you as a kid.<eos> Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.<eos> Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Are you serious?<eos> What?<eos> You want to find this thing and take another photo?<eos> Yell at it?<eos> This is a terrible idea.<eos> Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.<eos> What?<eos> You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your mom would.
Matron Brannan, how can I help you?<eos> What is corporal Kilner's status?<eos> Been here three days, and we're short on beds.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I... You're to be the queen of all nurses, you'll need to keep up.<eos> I'm waiting on Dr. Hale.<eos> Dr. Hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.

Because it is exactly this experience that makes me want to make our state safer.<eos> It is this experience that has informed and strengthened me for that fight.<eos> And anyone who looks at the violent-crime statistics in this country knows that a fight is exactly what we have on our hands.<eos> You think we're not doing enough as a nation to fight crime?<eos> No, I know we're not.<eos> Um, there are monsters all around us every day, and we need to protect ourselves.<eos> Monsters?<eos> Would you consider your neighbor Hank Asher a monster?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Yes, yes, I would.
I couldn't wait to see my baby.<eos> - Aww. - Both my babies.<eos> I am announcing my candidacy for governor.<eos> Could I have a minute alone?<eos> Just a minute?<eos> Bridey: The older brother's not totally sure Adam is Adam.<eos> How the hell did you get that?<eos> Julia: Would you consider your neighbor Hank Asher a monster?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Yes, yes, I would.
But how does that work?<eos> Talk about Shadow World enemies.<eos> Seelies and vampires don't really speak to each other unless they have to.<eos> How do you two manage it?<eos> So do you go to her place?<eos> Sometimes...<eos> Mmm, that's so brave.<eos> A Seelie can't exactly walk in the front door.<eos> So how would you get in to the Hotel DuMort?<eos> How would you?
You got to a window. You looked in. Am I right?<eos> I don't think I should talk to you.<eos> I don't think you should, either, especially if you're thinking of testifying against me.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't know what Detective Kellaher of<eos> Internal Affairs said would happen to you if you testify against a brother officer, -contradict his sworn statement...<eos> -Get off of me.<eos> ...and challenge the public pronouncements of our beloved commissioner, but let me give you a preview.<eos> You would not believe the day that I have had.<eos> I probably would.
That's not true.<eos> - You weren't a killer when I married you.<eos> - I know. I know that now.<eos> And a little of him is in me all the time ... that was him talking.<eos> And there's some of you in him.<eos> That allowed you to talk me down? Yes.<eos> But this time, when I turn, I...<eos> I'm afraid I'll be gone... forever.<eos> If you could fix it, if you could change the past,<eos> - would you?
Unfortunately...<eos> I think that's something else.<eos> My God.<eos> What is she walking into?<eos> Would I change things if I could?<eos> You weren't asking about becoming Inhuman.<eos> I was talking about us.<eos> Every terrible thing that has happened to you could have been avoided if you'd never met me.<eos> I wouldn't change a thing.<eos> - I would.
Think about it.<eos> I think that we could do great things for this city if we worked together.<eos> Take care.<eos> Listen.<eos> Reiter's men outnumber us.<eos> We have guns, but so do they, so when we get up there, we cannot hesitate to kill, do you understand?<eos> Taiana?<eos> Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.<eos> Couldn't dream of taking a life.<eos> I wouldn't.
I could say one thing with absolute certainty.<eos> And what's that, Ramse?<eos> James Cole is loyal.<eos> To a fault.<eos> That's a rare thing.<eos> He beats himself up for what he turned you into, and you want to hate him for it.<eos> I don't hate him.<eos> Forgive him.<eos> Like he did me.<eos> Like he would for you.
Rankin, Otero, he got 'em all.<eos> I barely made it.<eos> They... they came out of nowhere.<eos> Four of my guys, who are stronger, faster, and smarter than you, they got grabbed and you got away?<eos> I got lucky, man.<eos> You made a deal.<eos> No way, man.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> To save your own skin?<eos> Sure you would.
I think I remember you promising me my own horse.<eos> You ever think about that anymore?<eos> - The mountains? - Hm.<eos> Yeah, I think everybody in this city fantasizes about escaping now.<eos> Would you really do it?<eos> If it meant we could be together again?<eos> All the kids, you and me?<eos> What's going on, Will?<eos> I just really want to know if you'd leave all of this behind if it meant we could get back to the way things were.<eos> Of course I would.
You don't interrupt a meeting with the Secretary of State.<eos> I can end Dunbar's campaign.<eos> We can end it today.<eos> How?<eos> If I deliver, will you keep me on?<eos> You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.
That's not what happened, okay?<eos> This principal is evil.<eos> And he suspended the whole class even after I told him that I'm the one that bent the rules.<eos> Bent?<eos> Rafe, I think you did a little more than bend the rules.<eos> You're the one that told me to think outside the box.<eos> But there's a big difference between thinking outside the box and totally demolishing it.<eos> If you were having problems with the principal, why didn't you talk to me first?<eos> Because who'd believe the word of some kid over the head of the whole school?<eos> Honey, I would.
I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.<eos> All right. We'll call it event one.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's event two.<eos> God, it's weird being here.<eos> It looks just like your old place.<eos> Yeah, I kind of like it here.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.<eos> Hey, you don't have mine, do you?<eos> I'd like to see who came to my funeral.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Guys, we got to go get her now.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Cece, let's go!<eos> - Ah, son of a...<eos> - Schmidt, I'm coming!<eos> Let's get her!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Uh, you coming?<eos> Oh, I would.
We're not turning our backs on another Earth.<eos> We're not gonna let Zoom get away with everything that he's done.<eos> Right now, there is no way to another Earth, Allen.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> We're getting back to Earth-2.<eos> With or without his help.<eos> Let's go to work.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> We could use your help.<eos> Yeah, I would.
You're looking for gratitude?<eos> I'm sorry I've disappointed you.<eos> Though I do admire your courage.<eos> Still, this experiment of yours doesn't work without my blessing and participation.<eos> I'm going to inherit my husband's support without even asking.<eos> That's 25% of the country, at least.<eos> That's exactly why I expect you'll work with me towards this election... self-interest.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Ahmed wants to follow in his father's footsteps.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Why did they want Conway?<eos> That's the real question.<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Because I would've done exactly the same thing if it had been me.<eos> It undermines my authority.<eos> Throws me off balance.<eos> Pits me against my rival.<eos> And because I don't have children, and he does.<eos> They know I won't compromise.<eos> No president would.
I'm not a traitor.<eos> I was forced into this.<eos> They threatened my family.<eos> There's stuff you don't know about.<eos> - So much of it.<eos> - You better tell me.<eos> Or we can get an interrogation room down at the FBI.<eos> What, like, from the very beginning?<eos> I would love to.<eos> I would.
Do it again.<eos> What would you do differently?<eos> I would fight back.<eos> What if you still could?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The bullet that we removed is evidence.<eos> With it and your testimony, you could put that guy away for a long time.<eos> Everyone will know what I did.<eos> It's true.<eos> They would.
I think everybody in this courtroom knows how they would feel.<eos> No more questions, Your Honor.<eos> I wouldn't have cared what a piece of paper had to say, because Mr. Ross is the only lawyer I ever ran into that ever gave a damn about my son.<eos> Mr. Ross, would you care to call your next witness?<eos> I can't imagine anyone being more eloquent than that, Your Honor.<eos> Defense rests.<eos> -DIFUNDE LA CULTURA- Having trouble with your closing?<eos> No, it's just part of the process.<eos> Would it make you feel better if I told you that I have never felt more proud of my future husband than I did watching you up there today?<eos> Yes, it would.
Well, I got her to admit that she was lying and I recorded it.<eos> When I told her I wasn't going to let her get away with it, she told me that if I ruined her life that she would ruin mine.<eos> Okay, so wait, what does this have to do with you getting adopted?<eos> Carmen knew that I was seeing Brandon while I was at GU.<eos> Wait, after the restraining order?<eos> So when I thought that<eos> Rita was going to lose her license and her career and everything, I sent her the recording of what Carmen had said, and I figured that that meant<eos> Carmen was going to blow up my adoption by telling my social workers everything Brandon and I had done, and I figured if for whatever reason she didn't,<eos> - that for sure...<eos> - Rita would.
Thank you.<eos> You might extend the same apology to my husband the next time you see him.<eos> - Oh, is he struggling?<eos> - A little.<eos> Well, it'd be odd if he weren't.<eos> Anyway, if I am to succeed, then he and I are going to need all the help we can get.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're surrounded by good people offering it.<eos> Not if they're always off in Paris or New York, or wherever it is you spend your time.<eos> Y-You would take my advice?<eos> I would.
Mmm. You put a little butter in that... forget about it.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> Never mind.<eos> No, no, no, I think this...<eos> might be just what we need.<eos> How much money are we talking about?<eos> If we each kick in $500, we clear five grand apiece.<eos> Wow.<eos> That kind of money would really solve a lot of problems.<eos> Sure would.
We have heightened the security for the safe!<eos> Please worry not!<eos> Not good enough-ehhh!<eos> I cannot possibly trust you people-ehhhh!<eos> So all of you get away from my safe this instant-ehhh!<eos> What an insolent tongue!<eos> Then you people must be allies with the thieves-amasu!<eos> Or are you suggesting we have no right to watch it ourselves?<eos> N-No!<eos> W-We would never!
Do you think you can do that?<eos> - Huh? - No, I don't think I could do that.<eos> But I already have the paperwork.<eos> All you have to do is fill it out.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Listen, lady, I'm nervous enough already, and you're a fucking yapper.<eos> I don't do good with yappers, so--<eos> You don't want to try to fuck over your old firm?<eos> Really?<eos> I would.
It was a joke.<eos> When I got there, they all threw flour at me.<eos> They antiqued you?<eos> Yeah, and they used to call me "Grandma Billie" because they thought...<eos> - [laughs] Sorry.<eos> I was, like, buttoned-up and boring, which is, like, totes cray, right?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Plus, it didn't help that I had foot surgery freshman year, so I had to walk with a cane.<eos> Well, I wouldn't go to Deborah Denise's stupid slumber party if she paid me to.<eos> - I would.
And thank you for letting me do this here.<eos> It seemed like you didn't want to answer our questions in front of your husband.<eos> Can you blame me?<eos> Grace's book is about me.<eos> I told her about my flings because I felt bad for her.<eos> They were the only sex life she had.<eos> Only?<eos> You mean Andy couldn't?<eos> Worse.<eos> Wouldn't.
Darcy said I was her favorite customer.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> Might've been "one of" her favorites.<eos> But she's your destiny, Ravi.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Little test here, Liv.<eos> Jennifer Lawrence.<eos> In my league?<eos> She'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Of course she would.
And then screaming at her mum because she wouldn't foot the bill for her Paris boondoggle with her boyfriend.<eos> I saw a teenager upset with a parent.<eos> That's all.<eos> I bet Cher's inheritance would more than cover for art school or a pied-a-terre for two.<eos> When they come outside, let's find out if she has an alibi.<eos> She just lost her mother.<eos> She was letting poor Pam take the blame for her thievery.<eos> You won't do it.<eos> You won't ask a poor orphaned girl for her alibi?<eos> Clive would.
My advice is, get out of my chair.<eos> Okay. Look, uh, I have a problem.<eos> No, you have no problems.<eos> That girl up there?<eos> She had problems.<eos> - You have challenges. - Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.
Okay. Look, uh, I have a problem.<eos> No, you have no problems.<eos> That girl up there?<eos> She had problems.<eos> - You have challenges. - Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> I would, though.
Why are you here?<eos> Your dad's fine. Your dad's fine, okay?<eos> He had a little bit of a panic attack.<eos> Panic attack?<eos> Like a heart attack?<eos> - Is he in the hospital?<eos> - Like an anxiety attack.<eos> He's fine, though.<eos> He wouldn't go to the hospital.<eos> Of course he wouldn't.
Are you in there, Father?<eos> This door's always left open.<eos> Doubtless why Father Brown is so prone to distraction.<eos> He's writing his homily and under strict instructions not to be disturbed.<eos> Yeah, well, her ladyship's been trying to get hold of him.<eos> Last night, a nurse at St Luke's was murdered and she needs to see him urgently.<eos> Whatever for?<eos> He's not a policeman.<eos> Trust me, he'll want to know.<eos> No doubt he would.
I'm sorry, we must be, uh, at the wrong place.<eos> We're looking for Men Now.<eos> Congratulations, you've found us.<eos> I'm Karen.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> But y-you're a woman.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Yes, well, lots of us support the men's rights movement.<eos> Perhaps you would like to see our brochures?<eos> No, I would not.
I asked you here today because there is something I wish to discuss.<eos> It's no use, Victoria.<eos> I am not going to change my mind.<eos> Lord knows... my life has not been a happy one but I am the son of a King and I will not give up my birthright.<eos> I want to talk to you about your wife, Uncle.<eos> You want to talk about Cecilia?<eos> If you are going to tell me that my marriage is illegal because I did not have the sovereign's consent, then I believe you are nine years too late.<eos> I was thinking...<eos> I should like to meet your wife.<eos> - You would?
And what was that?<eos> We were working undercover at the time when a judge we had turned told us about a case...<eos> Hey, what are they doing with the drywall here?<eos> What'd you say?<eos> What are they doing with the drywall here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They haven't said anything about it.<eos> - What do we do?<eos> Just leave it?<eos> - I would.
It was my mistake, and now I'm gonna make it right.<eos> Judge is waiting.<eos> Your Honor, the prosecution will dismiss the charges against Mrs. Johnson if Dr. Masters will agree to plead guilty to the charge of sexual deviance and to pay a fine of $500.<eos> Your Honor, I will plead guilty to the charge.<eos> You're a public figure, Dr. Masters, so I must point out that if you accept this plea, you will be required to go into that courtroom and stand in front of a jury and the press, and admit to being a sexual deviant.<eos> Sexual deviant.<eos> I'm a scientist who's spent decades of my life researching sex.<eos> Even I don't know what that means.<eos> How can something deviate when there is no norm?<eos> No two humans would...
It's all sanded and spackled.<eos> I mean, CSU can undo it so we can at least confirm the make of the weapons, but that's about it.<eos> What?<eos> Something on my tie?<eos> No, I was just thinking you look... different.<eos> Oh, lost a few pounds.<eos> I mean, you look different than you did when you were standing over here.<eos> There's something weird about the light.<eos> Aside from the fact it casts a cooler hue, you'd never know there's a tiny little spy camera in there.<eos> Yes, I would.
Yeah.<eos> Unless you hold office, sit in that chair, you can't understand.<eos> Well... after all, I tried my best.<eos> Under the circumstances.<eos> And what circumstances were those?<eos> The way my father raised me.<eos> How is she?<eos> How's Molly?<eos> I'd kill Ihab bin Rashid myself if they would give me the chance.<eos> Of course you would.
Louis!<eos> Oh, is it really you?<eos> Now, steady on, old girl!<eos> Don't squeeze me to death, or else you'll have no-one left to keep you company.<eos> It is good of you to come.<eos> It's wonderful to see you.<eos> I say.<eos> That looks pretty scrappy, guvnor.<eos> Wouldn't you rather have something stronger?<eos> I would, Louis, boy.
See, now you've told me how long you're in for.<eos> Starts there, ends with you telling me you were born a poor black child.<eos> - You know "The Jerk"?<eos> - Yeah, you know "The Jerk"?<eos> Yeah, I watched a lot of movies growing up.<eos> Ah, we watch a lot of movies in here.<eos> All right, you want to know my story?<eos> It starts long before I did what I did, because I wasn't born a poor black child, but I was born poor, which made me susceptible to wanting to be rich.<eos> Of course I'm thinking about myself.<eos> What, you wouldn't?
This...<eos> Apparently, the high road is paved with restraining orders.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be quiet.<eos> The restraining order actually works for us.<eos> When we take her to court to have it lifted, she won't be able to prove any of these allegations, and her character will be called into question, which is exactly where we want to be.<eos> - Because? - Because once that baby is born, you will have a very good shot at obtaining full custody.<eos> Full custody?<eos> No.<eos> He would never.
But it'll have to do.<eos> I'm waiting him out.<eos> Well, I don't think we have to.<eos> He's 75 with a bum heart, high blood pressure, and a cracked skull.<eos> He probably won't even wake up.<eos> Right, Dr. Shepherd?<eos> We...<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> You wouldn't screw with me, would you?<eos> Oh, Gayle, I wouldn't.
- Philip and Debbie.<eos> - Hi. Your mother came in unresponsive.<eos> We made every attempt to revive her but we were unsuccessful.<eos> So she's dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Drug overdose?<eos> No, she died from a massive cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> A blood vessel in her brain burst.<eos> Would you like to see her?<eos> I would.
- That's different.<eos> - How so?<eos> - I'm your mother.<eos> - Ma. Come on!<eos> If you wanna pass the test, you gotta do the math.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Nobody can figure out these equations.<eos> I bet the Chief Medical Examiner of the Commonwealth could.<eos> Okay, Maura does not want to tutor me.<eos> Sure, she would!
- [Sighs] You needed a little help.<eos> - How is that helping?<eos> All these years, I thought those guys were really my friends.<eos> They became your friends once they got to know you.<eos> You just needed a chance.<eos> So you think I should tell Kent to join the Cub Scouts?<eos> [Chuckles] Kent gave you a generous offer.<eos> Go. Enjoy it.<eos> You wouldn't be saying that if you had to go.<eos> I would, too.
All clear.<eos> I'll be right outside if you need anything.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> You should really call this woman.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> And you honestly don't remember anything about being dead?<eos> Really don't.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Who gets a second chance like that and just goes to work the next morning?<eos> I would.
I wasn't expecting Jim Gordon to stop by.<eos> You aren't supposed to be here, are you?<eos> How come you're not in jail?<eos> I agreed to testify against Professor Strange.<eos> In case you're about to ask, I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.<eos> I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
I became a better man.<eos> W-Why am I telling you this?<eos> Right.<eos> But these feelings make you vulnerable.<eos> Surely, you must see that.<eos> Yeah, well, what's the alternative, to be like you, a man alone without empathy?<eos> She's the reason you are on this table.<eos> If you never met her, you'd most likely have a very long life ahead of you.<eos> Surely, you would take a do-over if offered.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You're just afraid.<eos> Why am I going again?<eos> Because you have a job there with health insurance and, uh, a sister, a-a mother, family there for you.<eos> What if I just stayed here?<eos> You'd have to unpack.<eos> No, seriously, what if I just pulled a Chloe on the whole plan, just stayed here in bohemia?<eos> Run away before I ever went to where I'm running from.<eos> What if, Daniel?<eos> I would love for you to stay, Chloe.<eos> I really would.
He made that clear.<eos> If innocent civilians die, it will not be your doing.<eos> When they die... it will be because I failed to prevent it.<eos> We'd just be camping over the weekend.<eos> Half the class is going.<eos> I really, really want to go.<eos> Mom said to ask you, since there were girls coming.<eos> But... But Bobby's parents are chaperoning them, and I would never do anything to shame our family.<eos> No, I know that.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
You had fun, didn't you?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I have work to do.<eos> You can go.<eos> I wasn't totally faking it.<eos> Like when I strangled psycho chick for the win.<eos> That was genuine.<eos> Gee, thanks.<eos> You know, I wouldn't just kick ass for anyone.<eos> Okay, fine, I would.
I'll sign a court order freezing Empire's assets for 30 days. It'll be up to you to gather enough evidence to bring about a federal murder indictment against Lucious Lyon.<eos> This smells personal, Agent Cousins.<eos> - It better not be. - No, I assure you, sir,<eos> I thought I felt a certain chill in the air.<eos> So, you're unhappy about my son's relationship with your ex.<eos> Cookie and I have what you call history. We share three sons.<eos> She's the co-chair of my company.<eos> So I watch her back.<eos> But, lady... don't ever try to read me.<eos> I would never.
Hey. Dryer ate my quarters.<eos> I put two bucks in.<eos> Thing won't start.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Prove it?<eos> Machine doesn't give you a damn receipt.<eos> Go tell it to someone who gives a shit.<eos> - What if you could stay?<eos> - Well, they won't let me.<eos> I would.
Yeah, thank you.<eos> Or you could always come along.<eos> You'd need to pretend that you were my owner.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I probably would.<eos> Is that...<eos> If that's the case, should we not?<eos> No, I'd still like to.<eos> Would you still like me to?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Oh, who's poor?<eos> All I see is happy Tali.<eos> Smart Tali.<eos> Strong Tali.<eos> You got to keep it positive, Tony.<eos> It really matters.<eos> Okay.<eos> Positive.<eos> She positively seems to have no appetite.<eos> Well, would you?
What do you make of all this, Tali, huh?<eos> Daddy taking care of you?<eos> She doesn't know Daddy.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I just met her.<eos> And if Ziva never told me about Tali, maybe she never told Tali about me.<eos> Were you and Ziva an item the whole time?<eos> Timothy Farragut McGee, how indiscreet.<eos> You know I would never kiss and tell.<eos> Sure you would.
When you say this little world is dead.<eos> You guys are going to go and have a baby and you're gonna stop being friends with me.<eos> Whoa, whoa!<eos> We're not having a baby.<eos> Absolutely, absolutely, you're going to get pregnant, because you're lousy with condoms, and you're going to realise that your whole life has been building up to what's really important, which is your baby.<eos> Matilda.<eos> Probably Matilda.<eos> What am I gonna have?<eos> We're not going to stop being friends with you if we have a baby.<eos> Absolutely, 100% you would.
Is this your house?<eos> I've been here for hours.<eos> I wanted to confirm that this wasn't a waste of my time.<eos> Well, what about my time?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> My time is much more valuable than yours.<eos> Speaking of, I've only allotted 28 minutes for this conversation, which is very generous of me.<eos> So we should begin.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
Why?<eos> She asked me to annul my marriage.<eos> But it's a little late for that now, I'm afraid.<eos> She wanted you to end your marriage?<eos> For what reason?<eos> She said she was in love with me.<eos> I said I was sorry;<eos> she told me these shocking lies about Elizabeth.<eos> - Would you care to share those?<eos> - I would not.
I do.<eos> The carrot?<eos> R-Right.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Well, I like this music. I've been listening to it all afternoon.<eos> I wouldn't mind seeing a documentary about it.<eos> I wonder if you know of someone who might be interested.<eos> My caucus has a $2 million fund to invest in such a documentary.<eos> You wouldn't do that.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
He's not coming back. He's not, right?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Anyway, I'm grateful to be sober.<eos> And, sorry Soledad wrote that really mean comment about the baby's melon head.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, who else would like to share?<eos> Mom?<eos> Yes, Christy?<eos> I thought maybe you'd like to share what's going on with you.<eos> No, I would not.
Because I'm not comfortable leaving him here alone.<eos> Why?<eos> There's nothing in the house.<eos> What's he gonna do, smoke a bowl of Grape-Nuts?<eos> Don't give him ideas.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Let me finish putting my shoes on.<eos> Slower.<eos> - Would anyone else like to share?<eos> - I would.
He was cute.<eos> What about this man?<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Yeah, I've seen him.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Liam.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> You too.<eos> Mr Hampton, we'd like to have a look at your CCTV footage for Monday night.<eos> Would you?
You got a key?<eos> No.<eos> I don't go in there.<eos> He likes his privacy.<eos> Boys and their boy antics.<eos> (Bishop and Miss Frimkes chuckle)<eos> What a tragic ending.<eos> But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder.<eos> I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him.<eos> Or why anyone would at all, for that matter.
Marcus is inviting her to the station as we speak.<eos> So, make yourself an alternate breakfast.<eos> We should have Joaquin Pereya's murder solved by the time you get dressed.<eos> We get that you never expected anyone to connect you to these murders, but... it still would have been a good idea not to keep so much evidence in your apartment.<eos> Our search turned up building plans, travel receipts and this coded log book that Mr. Holmes here cracked in no time.<eos> I mean, it's really quite easy to break a cipher if you know what it's going to say.<eos> Feds are picking up your dad in Miami, and a whole bunch of other cities are gonna want to talk to you, but we get you first.<eos> And our D.A. is gonna want to close this quick, before the FBI takes over.<eos> So... help us wrap up Joaquin Pereya, and you're in a strong position to make a deal.<eos> I would, honestly.
- Please.<eos> - Look, there's a field down there. - Oh, hey.<eos> - Whose property is that?<eos> - That's city property.<eos> That's a good place for a brushfire.<eos> You have to try to like this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Would you like to see the upstairs?<eos> Yes, I would.
I just think... maybe I did.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've only been thinking about myself, you know?<eos> I wanted to change the routine, and go on exotic trips and...<eos> Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.<eos> I was crazy to think I could make us closer by locking us in a car for a week.<eos> No, but you were doing that for us.<eos> You have been trying so hard to make this trip memorable for me and the kids...<eos> - and I didn't appreciate that.<eos> - But why would you?
- But I'm sorry, Brad.<eos> I can't. I can't do it, man.<eos> You made a promise to Megan, and you're gonna keep it.<eos> Did you just punch me in the face, Brad?<eos> Yes.<eos> Knowing full well I got no choice but to bust you up now?<eos> I really wish you wouldn't.<eos> If I did, you'd take that beatdown for those kids, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would.
How much more?<eos> You've only met her once.<eos> How could you know anything about her?<eos> You told me you knew right away when you met Mother.<eos> That's different.<eos> Your mother was a princess.<eos> You would have loved her anyway.<eos> I would never have seen her, because it wouldn't have been appropriate.<eos> And my father would have told me what I'm telling you and I would have listened.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.

Then what is your basis for knowing?<eos> - It's a hypothetical.<eos> - It's a stupid hypothetical.<eos> Just use your imagination.<eos> All right?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's accept that there is a world where I know, with absolute certainty, the exact time of your death.<eos> Now, you want me to tell you or not?<eos> Yeah, of course I would.
So, now I guess I get to ask you to dance.<eos> And apparently, you're not allowed to say no.<eos> Thank you, Dad.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Julie?<eos> Yes?<eos> My grandmother made it.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Here, would you?
Yes, but before that, you has made your mistake.<eos> And many mistakes before that.<eos> - Wait, I have not--<eos> - Many, many, many, many!<eos> Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.

Will the other girls not mind? Oh, I expect so.<eos> What don't they mind?<eos> Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?<eos> There's a dance?<eos> At the parish hall.<eos> There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it. Um...<eos> Patty and I aren't going this week.<eos> We're going to see a movie instead.<eos> Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.<eos> I would, very much.
I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding if I could be one without getting a husband.<eos> That's stupid talk.<eos> You are better off than I, Mr. Oak.<eos> I have an education and nothing more.<eos> - You could do much, much better than me.<eos> - That's not the reason.<eos> I'm too independent for you.<eos> If I ever were to marry, I'd want somebody to tame me and you'd never be able to do it.<eos> You'd grow to despise me.<eos> I would not.
You go home now, sweetie.<eos> Say hi to your mum Tell her you need new shoes.<eos> What's that all over them?<eos> Todd spilled ink on them.<eos> Ink?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mrs. Oickle says to say hi.<eos> She said to tell you I need a new pair of shoes.<eos> She would, that one.
- The attention?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> What would be so wrong with that?<eos> Become one of these hideous, like,<eos> "Yet another publication party.<eos> "Hey, there's Dave, sticking his head in the back of the photo."<eos> Rather be dead.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't wanna be seen that way.<eos> Why, would you?
Even de Gaulle and the Free French.<eos> They would have closed us down in the blink of an eye.<eos> ~ If they'd found out.<eos> ~ It wasn't just that.<eos> We wanted the same thing, you and I.<eos> We had to make it to D-Day.<eos> If they had known our circuits in France had been compromised, our role in the war would have been over.<eos> But you never told me!<eos> Because you would have stopped me!<eos> Of course I would!
You have great taste.<eos> And, um, I lost my virginity after watching "Into the Fire."<eos> Well, that's the highest compliment you could possibly...<eos> I'm glad I could in some small way contribute to your life-changing event.<eos> - It was last week.<eos> - My work is done.<eos> It wasn't last week.<eos> I'm... I know.<eos> Would you and your friend like to join me?<eos> We really would.
Yes. [laughs] My amazing husband. Yeah.<eos> This place is great, right?<eos> I really love it, and I'm so impressed that you found it, and...<eos> I did my research. planned... I looked online. You know, there's even, like, a hotel here.<eos> - Oh my god.<eos> - Yeah, it goes all the way up.<eos> - I bet it's so pretty.<eos> - We should plan an overnight trip.<eos> We should put the kids with Peggy for the night, we should get a room and sleep in, and we can watch "The Bachelor" if you want. - I'll totally watch "The Bachelor" with you.<eos> - Would you?
Why would they say you did if you did not?<eos> His Lordship walked into the room where I was working, pulled me onto the bed, would have raped me but for his wife happening on the scene.<eos> I thought, "Thank God."<eos> But... instead of turning on him, she turned on me, had me arrested.<eos> I swear it is the truth, boss.<eos> They stood me on the scaffold but reprieved me.<eos> Told me I was coming here instead.<eos> I said, "Hang me now, "for I do not wish to leave my family."<eos> But they would not hang me.<eos> I would.
They laughed a lot.<eos> He was forever making these jokes I didn't get.<eos> - Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> They were walking up ahead, more than they needed to perhaps, or... maybe I just let them, I don't know.<eos> We were on a track round this rock, and the glacier was on the right, below us.<eos> Way down.<eos> Beautiful thing, it was.<eos> You'd love the landscape out there, Kate.<eos> - You really would.
I promise, Angela, one day I will answer that, but not today.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> I'm afraid of losing you.<eos> Marcus.<eos> Angela's gonna come with us.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Don't say anything stupid.<eos> When would we ever?
Do you trust her?<eos> Of course.<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> No reason.<eos> What would you do if...<eos> She was cheating on you?<eos> What are you trying to discover?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You want to know if I'd break up with her.<eos> Would you?
I had a drink.<eos> Then I couldn't stop.<eos> I used to hear my father telling the whole world he didn't have a problem with drink.<eos> ~ Have you spoken to Mr Hereward about this?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Please.<eos> He mustn't find out.<eos> Are you sure that's how you want your marriage to begin - with a deception, a secret?<eos> He won't want to marry me if he found out.<eos> What man would?
What, like Julia Roberts from My Best Friend's Wedding?<eos> I never saw it.<eos> (TIRES SCREECHING) Richard Hendricks.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Russ Hanneman.<eos> True pleasure to meet you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I think I recognize you from TV.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Uh, how do you know who I am?<eos> Good question. No reason I would.
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<eos> We're not friends.<eos> We've never been friends.<eos> We won't become friends today.<eos> This isn't about friendship.<eos> This is about survival.<eos> This is about putting a 700-foot wall between you and what's out there.<eos> You built that wall to keep us out.<eos> Since when do the crows give two shits if we live?<eos> In normal times we wouldn't.
The Germans besieged us.<eos> We ran out of food and water and... .. only eight of us came out alive.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> If there's anything I can do.<eos> I can't be in the store any more, not after what happened.<eos> We need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> But if I can't trust myself, how can you trust me?<eos> - Anyway, Mrs. Leclair wouldn't want to work beside me.<eos> - Of course she would.
It's right in her sweet spot.<eos> "I regret that I squandered my high school career,"<eos> getting involved with an older guy.<eos> I was robbed of all the rituals that my classmates enjoyed.<eos> This secret relationship kept me in a fishbowl,<eos> "separating me from my family, my friends, even myself."<eos> Okay, I don't need a dramatic reading,<eos> Emily, I wrote it.<eos> If Ezra saw this, he'd be so hurt.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
The line between grief and guilt is a thin one.<eos> Sometimes, death is preferable to the agony of life.<eos> Tracker's in there.<eos> Looks like a VIP area.<eos> Probably where they're holding Tatsu.<eos> There's a lot of muscle in front of that door.<eos> This club is a Triad front.<eos> It will be heavily guarded.<eos> But will you do anything to get her back?<eos> Yes, I would.
I was right as rain with that shooting.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Take yes for an answer, Harry.<eos> Will ya?<eos> The jury's made a statement.<eos> Yeah, that I fucked up.<eos> No, that you got a bad guy off the street, you just bent the rules a little too far.<eos> Well, I can appeal if you want me to.<eos> Come on. You're not serious.<eos> You wouldn't.
Well, it won't be boring if I'm with you.<eos> And besides, it'll be good to spend some time together.<eos> We spend a lot of time together. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Mm. I want this to be more than just sex.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Well, I just -- I figured a guy your age would wanna keep things casual.<eos> Well, I'm not like most guys my age.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> So, Mrs. Powell, you'd like to adopt a child.<eos> Yes, I would.
This court has reviewed your probation report.<eos> Does either counsel wish to be heard?<eos> Your Honor, defense would like to reiterate that this is defendant's first arrest he has never been in trouble before and that he has an IQ of barely functional intelligence.<eos> Would the defendant like to say anything?<eos> Charles?<eos> - Chuckie.<eos> - What?<eos> Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Stupid Humphrey!<eos> ~ Letting yourself get led by the nose...<eos> ~ OK, stop! ~ What's going on?<eos> ~ Why move a body if you don't have to?<eos> To conceal or to remove the evidence.<eos> Or... to provide an alibi!<eos> The car keys, did we find them?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> ~ It was important, you would've told me.<eos> ~ Of course I would.
This abomination.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get on with it.<eos> An eye-witness at the wedding further stated that a Grimm was present, and I will shortly call forth that witness.<eos> Hey, Jessie.<eos> - How's it going? - Hey.<eos> I still feel pretty bad about messing up.<eos> You know, that guy getting taken?<eos> Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.<eos> I would too.
I was promised a walk in the garden.<eos> We're in a garden now.<eos> So we are.<eos> Brother?<eos> Brother.<eos> On the field, I saw a man, young like we were.<eos> He carried his brother in a sack over his shoulder.<eos> He told me he had promised their mother to take him home.<eos> Would you do that for me?<eos> I would, but you?
Oh, baby.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> There you are.<eos> And it's you.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> I almost didn't get in, because my license is expired.<eos> They thought I was a Muslim spy or something.<eos> I'm glad you came, you know.<eos> I wasn't sure you would when I called you.<eos> Of course I would.
Thank God.<eos> Why'd you have to pull me out like that?<eos> You scared the life out of me.<eos> It's time, Liza.<eos> I'm gonna make my move on Falcone.<eos> And don't be scared, baby girl.<eos> I got this.<eos> Mr. Falcone, we have your girl, Liza.<eos> Would you like to see her again?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Any idea where I can find her?<eos> - If I did, it'd be on the front page.<eos> The Russian that Blake shot in interrogation, there was a Chinese man in the back of his cab in an alley.<eos> Blind, carried a backpack.<eos> I've seen those guys around town.<eos> Drugs in the pack?<eos> Little busy to check.<eos> Would make sense.<eos> Nobody'd look at a blind man twice.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
But serving the American people is not about what you say, it's about what you do.<eos> And I would ask: what have you ever done?<eos> I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's lack of experience is a concern.<eos> I find it ironic that the president talks about the importance of experience, given the fact that he appointed his wife UN ambassador<eos> - despite her utter lack of credentials.<eos> - That's a sexist comment.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You wouldn't be making that argument if a female president had appointed her husband.<eos> A husband with the same lack of international affairs experience as Claire Underwood?<eos> Yes, I would.
- _ - ♪ These arms of mine ♪<eos> Where are you right now... somewhere warm, safe... next to someone you love?<eos> Now, what if all that was gone and the only thing you could do is survive?<eos> You would, right?
I'm buying John a drink this evening to celebrate his promotion to Inspector.<eos> ~ Oh, congratulations, Sarge.<eos> ~ Thank you very much.<eos> Inspector.<eos> Not before time.<eos> So, join us.<eos> ~ Oh, well, I think I'm...<eos> ~ Oh, no.<eos> She wouldn't want to.<eos> Of course she would.

No, Walter, she doesn't like me 'cause I'm Jewish.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> No, I like to tease you.<eos> I love that you're Jewish.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I have issues.<eos> What kind of issues?<eos> If I told you, you wouldn't like me.<eos> Nobody would.
- Yeah.<eos> - Oh, it's a little cradle cap.<eos> Cradle cap. Nothing to worry about.<eos> It should clear up in a week or two with baby shampoo and warm water, but not too warm, Daddy.<eos> Don't make it too warm.<eos> Hey. There you are.<eos> Isn't this a cute baby?<eos> You know who'd love to pinch this little guy's cheeks?<eos> Pearl.<eos> Yes, she would. Yes, she would. Oh...
You did it.<eos> You made a zombie rat.<eos> Where are you going, little buddy?<eos> Uh, I believe he was on his way to murder me and eat my brains.<eos> Why isn't he tearing into you?<eos> Oh, it's a zombie thing.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Zombie brains are nasty.<eos> You wouldn't want those.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- That is not true.<eos> - He could've hurt any one of those kids.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Is there any documentation as to the injuries sustained by young Hugo Weshler?<eos> Your Honor, it's too soon.<eos> He's still feeling the effects.<eos> Okay.<eos> Miss Saltire, would the prosecution consider accepting some sort of compromise, pleading this down to violation?<eos> It would go on his record.<eos> My client would not, not under any circumstances.
What the [bleep] is going on?<eos> Is it your goal to seduce every guy in my life?<eos> Just when I thought I could trust you again.<eos> You can.<eos> I was just exposing Felix for the fraud that he is.<eos> He's straight.<eos> He was only pretending to be gay - so he could seduce you. - Whoa!<eos> I am straight, yeah.<eos> But I would never do something like that.<eos> What kind of person would?
MATT:<eos> No, no, it's me. She already almost fired me.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The PR on this is a nightmare with a hair stuck to it, and she almost fired me, too.<eos> She almost fired me first.<eos> Oh, no need to cherry pick.<eos> The smart thing to do is fire us all.<eos> She can't do that.<eos> Can she?<eos> I would.
Dude looks like a raisin.<eos> It's not just about growing old.<eos> It's that... we didn't get to do it together.<eos> We lost so many years.<eos> Okay. How 'bout this?<eos> We forget about what we don't have and we focus on what we do have.<eos> What do we have?<eos> The future.<eos> I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> - You would?
He's still in love with her.<eos> He keeps boxes of her old stuff lying around.<eos> - Ooh, can we look at, smell, and handle them?<eos> I mean, you know, for the investigation.<eos> We're cops.<eos> - Please, take the boxes.<eos> I want them out of here.<eos> - Oh, okay, great.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you?<eos> - Actually, I would.
I'm fine.<eos> No panic.<eos> I am perfectly fine.<eos> All right.<eos> ~ Ah.<eos> Ah. ~ Oh!<eos> You could have got yourself killed!<eos> How could I go to Paris?<eos> You wouldn't survive a week.<eos> No, I very probably wouldn't.
Or was it all part of the same betrayal, eating you up inside?<eos> Do you think it was easy being the king's mistress?<eos> Hmm?<eos> A position easily gained.<eos> But held?<eos> For decades?<eos> Say it was an accident, Mother, please.<eos> Say that you only left those nursery windows open to get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.
I was in the studio when Stevie was killed.<eos> Of course you were.<eos> Rock-solid alibi, same as everyone else.<eos> And Jim.<eos> Stevie deprived you of the one thing you wanted in life.<eos> A family.<eos> I told you, Stevie was my brother.<eos> I wouldn't have hurt him.<eos> No.<eos> No, but Pete would.
Well, with that group, would've been a race to the finish line.<eos> So, obviously I did not become a sober companion to be a detective.<eos> I didn't even know I wanted to be a detective until I actually started doing it. I mean,<eos> I resisted it for a long time, but I'm really glad I made the switch.<eos> So... surgeon... sober companion... detective.<eos> I-I know it sounds meandering when I describe it, but I promise you it all felt very organic while it was actually happening.<eos> That's a rather perfect description of most people's lives.<eos> I find your story inspiring, actually.<eos> Wow. I think my mother would say "flighty," but... thanks.<eos> Well, of course she would.
So, just sign right here...<eos> There's Sara.<eos> Brunette.<eos> Mark blew up a bridge?<eos> He seemed sweet, laid-back.<eos> Uh, watch that top hand, Katy!<eos> I mean, I only knew him for a couple of months, but he just seemed like one of those extreme sports dudes.<eos> He was extreme, all right.<eos> Uh, you know, I'd be happy to hand over all our records if that helps.<eos> Yeah, it would.
The Absaroka County Sheriff's Department did, seeking any and all information about her identity.<eos> You just couldn't wait, could you?<eos> You just had to sabotage my opening weekend.<eos> What do you mean, you released that information to the press?<eos> Well, the autopsy didn't give us anything, and you weren't coming up with anything.<eos> Okay, Walt, maybe we should have checked with you first, but since you've been gone, we've gotten used to do doing things a different way.<eos> Well, I'm back.<eos> And you had no business going around me.<eos> [Eamonn] In Cumberland, when we hit a dead end, we do whatever we can to identify our victim.<eos> And frankly, any department would.
Oh.<eos> So... you're saying I was right.<eos> Essentially, yes.<eos> I-I... I'm six months pregnant.<eos> I have to be.<eos> I just didn't... just didn't want to be.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna argue with that.<eos> I tried to convince myself that maybe I was having twins.<eos> But the doctor would know if I were having twins.<eos> Yes, she would.
Word to the wise.<eos> Pink, nothing but pink!<eos> Pink, Laura?<eos> Come on.<eos> Once a year, she just lets that girly freak flag fly.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And you're gonna do it at her house, right?<eos> Actually, I was thinking about a bar.<eos> I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.
- Amelia.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Robbins, you're not gonna hear this from me too often, so savor it.<eos> You did very, very well in there.<eos> Oh, I'm so touched, I could cry.<eos> Ugh. I am exhausted.<eos> You'd think a tumor would give you extra energy or something.<eos> Mm, I wouldn't.
So what if he were a budding psychopath?<eos> We should check homicides going back to his teens.<eos> Lily, cross with juvenile custody worldwide, and check which countries have blue and orange in their flags, or sports teams.<eos> There's a reason he chose those colors.<eos> We just haven't found it yet.<eos> - You don't think he's American?<eos> - He has some sort of connection to the States.<eos> That's why he's attacking American families.<eos> Now that we feel he may have committed murder, it's doubtful - that State would grant him a passport.<eos> - What country would?
Homer...<eos> I think we should take down Everscream Terrors.<eos> Wha-<eos> - W-We... we can't!<eos> I'm the Mozart of Halloween decorations, and tonight is the Super Bowl.<eos> Lisa's in a bad place.<eos> You know how sensitive she is.<eos> We don't want her to go back to...<eos> Tailee.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Snickers?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Nobody likes a drum solo.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just really nervous.<eos> I did something horrible.<eos> So did most of the people in this room.<eos> Do you think she's gonna ask about the money?<eos> I would.
Better make it quick, though.<eos> I'm not letting this kid out of my sight again.<eos> Oh, son of a...<eos> Wait, wait, hang on.<eos> Before you run off.<eos> Uh... I could be totally off base here, but you and I maybe had...<eos> Hmm. Would you like to maybe hang out sometime?<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I mean, you'd really want to?<eos> Yeah. I would.
Thank you, Sir Arthur.<eos> If we need any more amateur speculation, we will be in touch.<eos> Good day.<eos> Those speculations will soon take the form of a report in the Telegraph.<eos> ~ I'll look forward to reading it.<eos> ~ I doubt it. This case has reeked of race prejudice from the start.<eos> Your professional future might not be as you imagined it<eos> ~ when I've finished with you.<eos> ~ I'd guard against turning this into a vendetta.<eos> Aye, you would.
- Exactly.<eos> But you did it, William.<eos> You freed George.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wasn't meant to be, I suppose.<eos> I just hope they're alright.<eos> You did everything you could for them, George.<eos> More than any man would.
That should get him moving again.<eos> Now, I really do think we ought to put the cadaver back where we found it.<eos> Cadaver?<eos> He was a human being, you know?<eos> Sorry?<eos> He had a family.<eos> He's not a piece of meat.<eos> Ah, yes, of course...<eos> Would anyone like to say a few words?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Pa-aark.<eos> Parked.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nooorse.<eos> Bull's-eye.<eos> Oh, no, the double tuck.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You wouldn't kick out a hopeless romantic who's only here in the name of love, would you?<eos> Ooh, you would.
I extended my tour for you, because I heard that you could be the best team in Afghan.<eos> Potential operator.<eos> Potential chief bleep.<eos> Potential Army 100.<eos> Special Forces.<eos> Very tidy.<eos> But in order to do that, you have to work at it, hard.<eos> So can we forget about the stupid fridge?<eos> Nick would've got it back.<eos> No, he wouldn't!
'Anyway, I'm devastated, to be honest.<eos> 'I just don't see how I can go on day-to-day.<eos> 'There's such a hole without him.<eos> 'It's like a terrible ache.'<eos> Oh, well, he's just a cat.<eos> 'I beg your pardon? '<eos> It's just a cat.<eos> It sounds like you've got other ones, have you?<eos> 'Yes...but nothing will replace Picasso!<eos> Well, another cat would.
It's the sin I have to bear for the rest of my days, not you.<eos> Your hands are clean.<eos> Your calling is true.<eos> Aah! And as for the scoundrel, his devices are evil!<eos> He makes wicked plans to ruin the poor with his lying words!<eos> Let me prove it to you!<eos> I know where the book is!<eos> God revealed it to me.<eos> If I could... if I could bring you the book, would you believe me?<eos> I would.
She would've come herself, but she's in London.<eos> So you're happy to enter them for the show?<eos> Very happy.<eos> Where's Mrs Drewe?<eos> She's gone into town, but she'll be back soon.<eos> We should probably get home.<eos> Well, there's no great rush.<eos> Won't Mrs Drewe want to see Marigold?<eos> Well<eos> - Yes, I would.
And you canvassed the touchscreen voting machines<eos> - in Cook County?<eos> - Yes. And did you find any more of these hacking devices, these "man in the middle" devices?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Forty. 40 devices.<eos> 40 machines compromised.<eos> Even if just a couple of hundred votes were changed in each, that would be more than enough for Mrs. Florrick - to steal this election.<eos> - That is correct.<eos> So you would advocate for a recount in those precincts?<eos> Of course I would.
We need someone whose behaviour is more suited to a King, someone who is his own man.<eos> I hope I make myself clear.<eos> Perfectly.<eos> Her Majesty and Monsieur Colbert would, to my mind, ensure a resilient transition.<eos> Then it is settled.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Rumors make me giddy.<eos> I'm going to Paris for a few days to un-giddy myself.<eos> You said I'd make a great King.<eos> And you would.
When we're focused on our feet, we're distracted from our brains.<eos> The body is spinning, the mind is still.<eos> My wife doesn't need waltzing lessons.<eos> It's been three months.<eos> I've yet to hear a diagnosis, much less a prognosis.<eos> It's fascinating, really.<eos> - The science is so new.<eos> - Psychiatry, is it a science?<eos> Dr. Winter, would you like to discuss this privately?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
Not a minute later.<eos> You will not get another chance.<eos> I'll be here two hours early and the floors will be mopped.<eos> Thank you, Chief.<eos> Good.<eos> That was a good shift, Dallas.<eos> Thank you, Sir.<eos> So, how's everything going with Severide?<eos> Well, he's handling it.<eos> Better than I probably would.
De Luca, will you escort Warren out of my surgery, please?<eos> - But...<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, don't even think about it.<eos> You do not know me.<eos> Miranda, you are rolling over.<eos> You are quitting in the middle of the race, and that is not okay.<eos> Would you let me quit?<eos> Would you let Tuck quit?<eos> Would you?
I don't believe it.<eos> Why would Father entrust you with such...<eos> Power?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> Gabriel, what are you doing?<eos> All we have to do is crack the seventh seal.<eos> The skies will open.<eos> Our kind will descend to cure this world of a dreadful disease: humanity.<eos> You'll start a war pitting humans against angels.<eos> You wouldn't.
I ought to shoot you for bad parenting.<eos> Listen.<eos> Ummm<eos> I have an idea.<eos> I can't take her back to the group.<eos> And I can't take her with me where I'm going.<eos> You seem like good people.<eos> You got a nice safe setup here.<eos> It's a real home.<eos> Would you
I think we should both start dating again, don't you?<eos> I've already met somebody online, who I think I can get really serious with.<eos> Do you know anything about him?<eos> I know he owns a computer.<eos> At this point, that's enough.<eos> I don't think I'll be ready to date again for a long time.<eos> Well, I have some news that might cheer you up, Ash.<eos> How would you like to be my best man?<eos> I'd love to, Freddie.<eos> Oh, would you?
You check out the delivery guy?<eos> I know the guy.<eos> He's from Vito's Neapolitan over on 12th.<eos> Delivers to my desk sergeant every day.<eos> - Neapolitan?<eos> - Are you ever not hungry?<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> No, the mom said that they're gluten free.<eos> Why would they order a dough-laden pizza?<eos> They wouldn't.
25%.<eos> You know, you're not exactly the Harvey Specter I was expecting.<eos> Is that a good thing or a bad thing?<eos> A good thing.<eos> You're not exactly the Louis's sister I was expecting.<eos> Is that a good thing or a bad thing?<eos> A good thing.<eos> Definitely a good thing.<eos> Would you like to take me home tonight?<eos> I would.
The Darkness...<eos> It's been locked away since the dawn of creation.<eos> And now it's free.<eos> Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.<eos> God help us.<eos> I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
He betrayed me.<eos> Humiliated me.<eos> And after I finally confronted him about it, he tells me... that I got what I always wanted.<eos> So, Jack, believe me, if you think this man cares about you, he doesn't.<eos> I know what kind of man he is, Louis.<eos> Then why are you siding with him?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> He promised to do something Jessica never would.<eos> Put my name on the wall.<eos> What if she would?
- I have a cell phone?<eos> - You do and if you'd check it, you'd know that Daniel Hardman topped our bid by 20%.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Because the dollar took a dive against the yen and it turns out his client is Japanese.<eos> God damn it, we are not losing to that son of a bitch.<eos> Why the hell did you think I'm here?<eos> We need to go back to Gianopolous and get more money.<eos> Jessica, he's not going to pay that much.<eos> No one in his right mind would.
We're free to go?<eos> Take yes for an answer, kid.<eos> Doc!<eos> Thanks for volunteering to be our early warning alarm.<eos> This is crazy! Let us go! You'll never see us again!<eos> You got that right.<eos> Look.<eos> You and I both know what happens if I let you go.<eos> You'll find your party and then turn around and come right after me and my family.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Well, that makes sense.<eos> If he was willing to kill Justin, he'd already have the Van Gogh and he wouldn't have asked me to steal the fake one.<eos> Hold on.<eos> The Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?<eos> How do you know about the forgery?<eos> Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.<eos> But he wouldn't.
All right. Let me guess, that applies only to purchases made between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.<eos> Nah, brah, all day.<eos> I just asked that you guys consider wearing these T-shirts I got made up.<eos> Got them sized out perfect.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> No.<eos> It's cotton.<eos> I can't.... It absorbs water, slows me down.<eos> You know?<eos> No, I-I would.
Hey! Keep your hands off of her.<eos> - Where's Rebecca?<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> - I don't.<eos> Yeah, like we can believe anything either of you two say.<eos> Rebecca's dead.<eos> Levi never heard from her again after the 911 text, so we think someone killed her.<eos> Not someone. Annalise and Frank.<eos> No, Frank would never do that.<eos> Of course he would.
I'll tell you what you're staring at.<eos> A mirror.<eos> No matter what you do, you'll end up just like me.<eos> Just like me.<eos> For months after that I would check my face in the mirror every day to see if it was happening yet.<eos> You were just a child.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> But the old man was right.<eos> I knew unless I did something, I'd end up like that.<eos> Everybody would.
He said he's "very attracted" to you, and we know what that means.<eos> Oh, God, don't even get me started.<eos> I don't even know what that means anymore.<eos> I do.<eos> A guy says something like that, it means his current relationship is about ready to bite the dust.<eos> He's putting out feelers.<eos> If you could go to his house for the holiday...<eos> I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?<eos> Would I like to be surrounded by the unconditional love of a hundred Filipinos?<eos> Of course I would.
Wait a minute. That is the courier.<eos> Talk about a low profile.<eos> He came in with the cargo payload.<eos> He's unit EG-86.<eos> Nice to meet you, EG.<eos> I don't get why they'd hide such important information in this binary box brain.<eos> Well, would you suspect that thing of being a spy full of secrets?<eos> Mmm, no. I guess not.<eos> That's too bad...<eos> Because I would.
That guy.<eos> Can't breathe in this.<eos> Tony...<eos> That's better.<eos> ...the case.<eos> The case, yes.<eos> Well, two days before Meyers was shot, his neighbor witnessed a heated argument between Meyers and a woman outside his apartment.<eos> The woman threw a mean left hook at Meyers before threatening to kill him.<eos> Explains Meyers' busted tooth.<eos> Yes, it would.
! That they get along well and there's chemistry.<eos> - Hilarious.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> Well, these two have gotten chummy.<eos> I know, I can't be weird about it.<eos> I have to rise above it.<eos> You're human and he's hot.<eos> But let me ask you this.<eos> If you were with Michael, would you care who your baby daddy was dating?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Frances, no.<eos> She has a right to know.<eos> Know what?<eos> We are facing ruin.<eos> All is not lost.<eos> There may still be some stock.<eos> We have no money.<eos> Our Christmas was purchased with a loan from Scrooge and Marley.<eos> Father had hoped to protect you, but I'm sure that you'd like to share the burden.<eos> Well, of course I would!
And I'm going to get it out of you.<eos> Ooh!<eos> - Juice him, baby, juice him good.<eos> - What are you going to do?<eos> Oh no, don't sing a song.<eos> Oh, I won't sing.<eos> I won't sing a song.<eos> But I will sing "Everything I Do" like - at the Broadway musical.<eos> - You wouldn't dare.<eos> ♪ Yes, I would ♪
Gloria, thank you.<eos> I'm glad you said that.<eos> You're welcome. At least somebody's helping.<eos> Because that kind of language is counterproductive.<eos> Oh, snap.<eos> [ Snaps fingers ] This next exercise will teach us how to communicate our needs in a constructive and non-threatening manner.<eos> We do that all the time.<eos> Very constructively communicated.<eos> Would one of my couples like to help me demonstrate for the rest of the group?<eos> Yes, we would.
A mate of mine got into a bit of trouble here a few nights back.<eos> Did you see him around?<eos> I'm not the bloomin' missing persons bureau.<eos> If you're not buying, then...<eos> How much for just the bat?<eos> I was asleep. I didn't see anyone.<eos> He was looking for something.<eos> Something I need to find.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Who would?
Miss Barbary?<eos> Miss Frances.<eos> Sir Leicester.<eos> What a surprise!<eos> This sounds important, Jaggers.<eos> It is.<eos> Let me guess - the shareholders refuse to trust my sister with their money, as I told you they would.<eos> I am ready to take my rightful place.<eos> Arthur, the New Year reception is going ahead and I would very much like you to be there.<eos> Oh, of course you would.
- Okay. Um...<eos> His name is Jareth, and he's auditing my psych class, but he is a graduate student doing applied physics.<eos> He's a total brainiac.<eos> He's British.<eos> And he's nice.<eos> He's got big eyes and a really cute butt.<eos> He's tall...<eos> Hey. I just got off the phone with Dmitri Petrov.<eos> He'd like to know why we're hanging him out to dry.<eos> - And so would I.
Forty-two years.<eos> How many violent crimes have you ruled on in that time?<eos> Objection.<eos> The defendant's history as a judge is not relevant.<eos> Your Honor, the state has introduced evidence that suggests a motive... for the alleged crime related to the judge's duties.<eos> I'm entitled to rebut that laughable presumption.<eos> Overruled.<eos> It's not something I keep track of.<eos> Would it surprise you to learn... that you presided over 17 murder trials... 434 assaults... 12,942 civil cases?<eos> It would not.
Call the goddamn plumber!<eos> - This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave?<eos> - Without fail, Frau Liebling.<eos> - What in hell is this?<eos> - Not now.<eos> Family?<eos> Zero.<eos> Six, Igor.<eos> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?<eos> Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir?
- Well enough.<eos> Listen, we had to!<eos> You were gonna send those dogs off to dog Auschwitz!<eos> So you stole orphan's money And used it to buy rescue dogs, a fabulous house in Silver Lake?<eos> - Oh, I wouldn't describe it like that.<eos> - Well how would you describe?<eos> What I would say is that we temporarily-<eos> - We don't have to explain anything to you.<eos> - You wouldn't dare...<eos> - Oh, yes, they would.
They must have had a lot of sex.<eos> They couldn't help themselves.<eos> They were in love.<eos> Or it was just instinct.<eos> Same thing, I guess.<eos> I'd have babies with you.<eos> I mean, not right away, but... we should, you know?<eos> What? I never said never.<eos> I said, "Don't marry me if you want to have children."<eos> But you would?

What isn't, George?<eos> Promotion.<eos> Increased responsibility?<eos> Advancement?<eos> Traffic.<eos> I spent 15 years in traffic.<eos> There comes a time when it is unseemly for senior officers to still be rocking the boat, ignoring orders, getting themselves shot, you know the sort of thing.<eos> Are you saying I'm an embarrassment, sir?<eos> I'm saying I'd hate to see you embarrass yourself.<eos> Who would?
"Semblance of order", huh?<eos> She's only been here two minutes, man, she's fiddling around with everything.<eos> Calm down.<eos> She's a good copper.<eos> Aye, so everyone keeps telling us.<eos> I don't see it, myself.<eos> I mean, it's nice to have somebody here to make a cup of tea, she'd be good for that, granted. I wanted her here.<eos> We don't need her.<eos> Well, I say we do, John.<eos> Oh, well, you would.
Yes, I know, OK.<eos> And am I a man?<eos> Yep.<eos> Tall?<eos> Not as tall as people think.<eos> Hmm. Nice?<eos> Ish.<eos> Clever?<eos> I would say so.<eos> You would.
I want to know who you was with in that pub. Do you understand?<eos> I want to know his fucking name!<eos> Because, I swear, I'll rip your head off.<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - I don't know what you're fucking on about!<eos> Just tell him, Eggsy!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Fuck off, Michelle!<eos> I could kill you right now... and no one in the whole world will notice!<eos> But I would.
I can't go there!<eos> I can't go back there!<eos> I can't go back to that part of my life! I can't do it!<eos> I gotta just let it go.<eos> The man I married... I don't think he would let his own grief, even if it was overwhelming... get in the way of what could potentially be... the greatest scientific discovery the world has ever seen.<eos> This is bigger than you.<eos> It's bigger than me.<eos> It's bigger than Sofi.<eos> Then maybe you should go.<eos> I would, but I...
Let's go get him.<eos> Lassie, we're gonna need a ride.<eos> Shotgun!<eos> Damn it!<eos> What can you say about John?<eos> Number-one sales rep.<eos> Reliably efficient.<eos> He will be missed.<eos> Would anyone else like to speak?<eos> I would.
So it would seem.<eos> How long have I been asleep?<eos> A week more or less.<eos> Though you do wake up and get feisty every now and then.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> Is there water?<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> It gets pretty rough sometimes.<eos> Our friend, the doctor, thinks we might have to restrain you to keep you from hurting yourself.<eos> He would, wouldn't he?
No, I haven't.<eos> Get off my property.<eos> No.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Not until I know where you were when Jerry Markham's car got run off the road.<eos> Right here - with Evie.<eos> Aye, you see, she's not so sure about that.<eos> She was stealing money from the fund.<eos> My daughter would never take what wasn't hers.<eos> Yes, she would.
Put Jeanne down!<eos> Jeanne!<eos> Dan?<eos> It's okay, Tom.<eos> It's nothing. I just...<eos> Oh. I... go back to sleep.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> See, I knew there was something special about Jeanne those flying things wanted.<eos> But I begged them to take me.<eos> They wouldn't.
You couldn't even be my brother.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> All this big "World Stage Reconciliation" stuff - why don't you take a good, hard look at yourself first?<eos> Get that from your therapist?<eos> Well, tell me it isn't true.<eos> What would you do if you met the man who ordered Papa's death?<eos> Would you just give him a big hug, Nessa?<eos> I certainly wouldn't stick a knife in his neck.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Would you?
Enough to buy a new house with.<eos> And a car.<eos> If you can't give us a name, perhaps you can tell us where we can find the brand-new red Malibu that you bought five weeks ago.<eos> The Malibu?<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> You tell me who's driving it, and I will tell you why it's important.<eos> Is it the father of your little girl?<eos> The man you're talking about, he doesn't...<eos> He doesn't know that Ellie's his daughter, and he wouldn't do anything to my kids.<eos> - He wouldn't.
You are not a hero.<eos> To become a knight and win the hand of the princess, you must become a hero.<eos> Okay.<eos> How?<eos> The cards will show the way.<eos> All right, well, let's see what else Madame Dooriya has to say.<eos> Wow.<eos> How many bags did we bring?<eos> Madame D really wouldn't like this.<eos> No, she really, really wouldn't.
Oh, Mrs. Peri, I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> Me too.<eos> I really... Really thought you were deported.<eos> I was in a detention center for three months.<eos> But I applied for asylum, and so I got to stay.<eos> Who knew that was an option?<eos> Well, thanks for stopping by.<eos> Is Mr. Spence here?<eos> - I'd like to see him, too.<eos> - Of course you would.
No!<eos> And there's no way that Kevin's getting out of this intact, is there?<eos> You're gonna have to trust me.<eos> I always trust you.<eos> And I always end up screwed.<eos> You didn't save me for me. You did it for you.<eos> You didn't want to be alone.<eos> If the situation were reversed and I was dying, you'd do the same thing.<eos> No, Dean.<eos> I wouldn't.
No, that's not true!<eos> You didn't kill her.<eos> It's okay, Janie.<eos> They know I did it.<eos> Everything's going to be okay.<eos> You don't actually believe his lies, do you?<eos> He just confesses to killing his mother in cold blood?<eos> A woman who would have walked through fire for him?<eos> I would like to hear what the other kids have to say.<eos> - So would I.
I mean, guys sitting behind desks, making decisions about other people's lives without being a part of those lives on a daily basis.<eos> It's not me.<eos> Well, hon, if-- then of course I'm okay.<eos> Maybe I'll just-- I'll commute back and forth.<eos> We could talk every night, and it could be fun to catch up on weekends.<eos> If that's what you feel you need to do.<eos> Babe, it's the National Gallery.<eos> I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<eos> You wouldn't expect me not to take the job just because you changed your mind.<eos> I wouldn't.
He should go! Why's it you who has to leave?<eos> What I'm trying to say is, if I'm not around, it's important that you have a good relationship with the Watch.<eos> Build some bridges.<eos> You're always shooting out the door at the end of a shift, never stick around for a drink.<eos> Things have been a bit... hectic.<eos> Guv, can I sleep in the dorm here for a bit?<eos> Not if you're not on duty.<eos> You could always stay at mine for a bit, if you like.<eos> I'd love that, guv.<eos> I would.
I don't think you're insane.<eos> I think you've been through a lot.<eos> You're trying to make sense of it all.<eos> - I know I'm right.<eos> - I'm sure you believe you are.<eos> It's a fact that he helped cover up the DUI.<eos> Imagine if one of your reporters came to you with this story.<eos> - Could you print a word of it?<eos> - No, but I'd have them keep digging.<eos> Would you?
How did you get here?<eos> You know that big scrap hold, the one on K deck?<eos> You built that from scrap?<eos> I kind of rebuilt it.<eos> Please.<eos> Like that's hard.<eos> It just needed a couple parts and some love.<eos> You're insane.<eos> I'd do more for you and worse.<eos> Just like you would for me.
Well, so long as you're getting your five a day.<eos> Lovely out there, boss.<eos> Quiet place to think, Ken.<eos> And a cheeseburger with onions, please.<eos> And one of those skewers with pitta bread for Michael.<eos> Right.<eos> -What?<eos> -You suit an apron.<eos> Are you trying to do small talk, Helen?<eos> Would I?
My instructions are that on 27th December, Mrs Chandler was watching the cricket with her mother in Rose Bay.<eos> Ken, it's an insult to the court.<eos> Well, Nadia, if you've got the evidence against her, why haven't you charged her?<eos> Do I have to do your job for you as well?<eos> When he gets in the box, I'll ask him about her, and if he's lying, Cleave, I'll have him for perjury as well.<eos> My instructions are that doctor and Mrs Chandler love their daughter Rebecca very much and wish her a long and happy life.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Give the kid a break.<eos> So Dr D'Antonio, do you equate the act my client is accused of with the act of paedophilia?<eos> Yes, I would, as a matter of fact.
Cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well, have a good day.<eos> - No, wait.<eos> It's also possible I don't want friends because I've never had any as good as the ones that you've got.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, those guys are pretty great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'd take a bullet for me.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
But we're not her.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> Feed me to these creatures tonight, tomorrow you will be no better off than you are today.<eos> But you hold me to ransom, and the reward that I'll fetch will fill your bellies for years to come.<eos> I'm worth more alive than I am dead.<eos> All right.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay to save your life?<eos> I'm the Queen!<eos> Surely somebody would!
Dad!<eos> You've made a terrible mistake.<eos> That is not my mother!<eos> Settle down, Burt.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> I was doing this for your mother.<eos> I don't see how lip-wrestling with the editor of Casserole Today could be for her.<eos> See, I throw the judges a little sugar so your mother wins.<eos> I think she'd prefer you kept your sugar to yourself.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Whichever one happens next.<eos> Forward thinking, I guess, then.<eos> Or corruption.<eos> Can I interest anyone in a dose of reality?<eos> Some mac and cheese ball fried and truffoiled.<eos> Oh, yeah. I am saying yes to that.<eos> Just now a child in South America died of starvation.<eos> Would you like another?<eos> You know what?<eos> I would.
The filler is typical, but the wiring is very sophisticated...<eos> multiple decoys.<eos> I'm still trying to reconstruct it.<eos> This charger is an insult, Dr. Lom.<eos> Well, at least it will give you a jolt of energy, like an espresso shot.<eos> Dude, I think you're picking Radio Korea.<eos> You'll be tip-top once the damage from solar flare is dealt with.<eos> I want to move out.<eos> He doesn't want to sleep with MXes.<eos> Well, who would, really?
FBI!<eos> Get on your knees right now!<eos> Cuff him, guys.<eos> We got one.<eos> Kidnapping, theft of government property, attempted murder.<eos> Wh... attempted murder?<eos> March 16, 2013.<eos> You pointed a weapon at a private security contractor during the kidnapping of Bo Adams.<eos> I have his statement here if you'd like me to read it.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I understand.<eos> You don't want to jump into something that might solve all your financial problems in one fell swoop.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I could, too.<eos> I could totally torch this place.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I mean, it's a lot of money.<eos> I do like that part.<eos> I mean, it would mean me giving up my writing.<eos> Sure would.
Unfortunately, we don't have that choice.<eos> We need to watch it to see how Corbin took down the demon.<eos> We think the same one that came for you is back.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - We cannot be certain.<eos> But surely it is connected to Moloch's greater plan.<eos> It wants something from us.<eos> Washington's Bible.<eos> - So give it the Bible.<eos> - We would...
Stand by.<eos> - According to valdes, This meeting's supposed to start in an hour.<eos> - Yeah, and anibal's still up in his house Eating pints of cherry fucking garcia.<eos> How the hell are they gonna have a meeting without him?<eos> - That's because there is no meeting.<eos> Valdes is full of shit.<eos> - Who'd you rather bang, valdes or frankie?<eos> - Frankie don't take dick. - I know!<eos> But let's just say she does.<eos> Or she would.
Here.<eos> Waiting. Just like you.<eos> You think they'll succeed?<eos> Richard's soul is pure.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> Richard -- he's quite a find.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> Richard thinks I'm in love with him.<eos> He would go to the end of the world for me.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Are you sleeping?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Yeah-- I-I don't know.<eos> But you're comfortable here?<eos> The Advocacy Center is committed to giving you anything that you need.<eos> You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> To school?<eos> No one expects you to.<eos> My parents would.
No.<eos> You are worlds apart from those men in the desert.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> I know you value me no more than those bikers back there.<eos> - The truth is... I don't care.<eos> - Because of what you feel?<eos> I've felt something before for someone on my team.<eos> It seems foolish now.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> Any man would.
What are you doing?<eos> I should've known you -- you'd try to get out of it.<eos> Put your name in and sneak back and take it out, see?<eos> There's a word for people like you.<eos> Yeah, what's that?<eos> Coward?<eos> Please.<eos> I'm the one saying we should get off our ass, round up some men and some weapons, and frag these cockroaches.<eos> Yeah, why don't you quit complaining and go do that?<eos> I would.
We're all reeling.<eos> I choreographed this piece with her in mind.<eos> She was dancing the lead?<eos> Unfortunately, during auditions, she never quite connected with the role.<eos> Didn't give it her full focus.<eos> So I had to cast a more established dancer.<eos> Bisection.<eos> It's been a while since I've seen one of these.<eos> You'd think there'd be more blood.<eos> You would.
They're not easily come by, nor in common use.<eos> There's a fellow in Jamaica.<eos> Charlie Rider could easily acquire it for you.<eos> No.<eos> I need Rider to know about this like I need... a hole in the head?<eos> Hmm. I could improvise a device.<eos> I could have James Balfour's clock-making tools repurposed.<eos> You'd open my skull with clockmaker's tools?<eos> If you'd have me do so.<eos> I most certainly would not.
The recordings of the girls talking?<eos> Do you have anything to do with that?<eos> I heard Mrs. Hoving hired a private investigator.<eos> I paid money to make him and the evidence disappear.<eos> So, you "took care of it."<eos> I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
- Dr. Ludwig?<eos> - I'll show myself out.<eos> Goddamn it, Stackhouse.<eos> Get your fucking eyes off her.<eos> I should've been here.<eos> Maybe I could've saved her. At least just-- Just been here for her when it happened or something.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
I do, but is everyone we need still on the train?<eos> - Hell yes.<eos> - Even Judge Harris?<eos> We heard he missed a few days of work last week.<eos> Didn't tell anybody.<eos> Heard how they found him yesterday too.<eos> The man's son shot himself in the head.<eos> If he had a few bad days, I think he gets a pass.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> Any man would.
How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> I'll turn the camera off.<eos> I think you know the Doctor's very powerful, and you can imagine he has many people in many places to help him.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Finn, I know you care about this girl.<eos> You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her--<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously.<eos> Fine, Sheldon.<eos> You have my undivided attention.<eos> Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.<eos> No way.<eos> Yeah, well, it's true.<eos> But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.<eos> Well, you wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat.<eos> No, see?<eos> Well, you absolutely would not.
Am I bad for your brand?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I was just kidding.<eos> About what...<eos> My integrity?<eos> Relax.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> - Not to me.<eos> - I don't understand...<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you?
Hey, Bridg, what's wrong?<eos> Why would you want me when you can have girls like her?<eos> Who'd I give that earring to? Her or you?<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> Where you taking me, back to my shithole?<eos> - No, we gotta do something first.<eos> - I stood by you, Ray.<eos> Didn't give you up.<eos> You know I would never do that.<eos> Sure you would.
Did you, by chance, spend any time with him alone in your car?<eos> This is crazy!<eos> I'm a married woman and a-a marriage counselor.<eos> Is... is that what this man told you?<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> It's nonsense.<eos> I don't know that man.<eos> I had a few drinks, I paid my bill, and I was at home on the phone with my husband by 8:00 P.M.<eos> Okay, so, then if we got a warrant to search your car, we wouldn't find any of Mr. Strauss' hair or fluids... you know, DNA?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Okay.<eos> Sure. [chuckles]<eos> Hmph.<eos> There you are.<eos> Ah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um...<eos> Is there any chance you might want to lie still and let me drag you across the apparatus floor?<eos> I think you're, like, just about dummy weight. No.<eos> I'd rather not.
- Who's Haylee?<eos> - My daughter.<eos> She just left.<eos> She went back to New York this morning.<eos> New York?<eos> [ Gasps ] How does she like it?<eos> I mean, based on the t-shirts I've seen, people seem to really love that place.<eos> Why wouldn't you introduce us?<eos> - I didn't know you'd want to meet her.<eos> - Well, of course I would!
Because he wanted to know what was fundamental in the thing.<eos> They make one of these for a person yet?<eos> Your benefactor, Miss Hart, for example... You distil her, what do you find?<eos> Much of my life would be impossible, were it not for her commitment and support.<eos> In her heart, fundamentally Dr. Frayn, you say she is good?<eos> I do.<eos> You see, now I always would have agreed with you...<eos> I mean, she cuts her cloth with the world the way we all must... but, I trusted her always, when pushed... to fall the right way.<eos> You would hope that those that love you, would say the same.<eos> I would.
Huh? Kim:<eos> Yes. Oh. Lina:<eos> Can they hear us not having sex?<eos> Oh, look. It's the screamers. Lina:<eos> Oh, man.<eos> - Her ass is so tiny.<eos> - Russ: Mm-hmm. It is.<eos> Lina:<eos> Does that get you hard? Russ:<eos> It probably would. Lina:
Is anybody home?<eos> Nick?<eos> This will work.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I came to talk to Juliette.<eos> About what?<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> No, no you don't.<eos> I've never seen this before.<eos> No, why would you?
"Lester Kanopf"?<eos> Come on, guys, get it together.<eos> That's mine.<eos> - Sorry, Lester.<eos> - Yours is right here.<eos> Grant, hi.<eos> Yeah, I saw you were gonna be here, and since you've been ducking my calls, I just thought that I'd drop in.<eos> - Care to join me for lunch?<eos> - I...<eos> I would...
You want to stay in Vega.<eos> I get it.<eos> Really?<eos> We'll work it out together.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They are so beautiful.<eos> This one looks almost Aramaic.<eos> Aren't you even curious?<eos> I'd burn 'em off if I could.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Yes.<eos> Look, I recognize the boy's mother's name.<eos> Cindy Hatcher lived in our apartment complex.<eos> She was close with my brother, but he's not the father.<eos> If you don't believe me, check with the Veterans' Board.<eos> Tessa, any chance you may remember who Cindy was dating when she got pregnant?<eos> Um... pretty sure it was a guy named Eddie Davis.<eos> My mom knows his mom.<eos> I can probably get you his contact info, if that would help.<eos> Yeah, it would, actually.
- What?<eos> - So, you did fucking nick it!<eos> - No, we never.<eos> - So, what was that?<eos> - We found it.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> - Why didn't you just give it to me?<eos> - Cos you don't trust us.<eos> If we just handed it over, you'd say we'd stolen It.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Weren't you always saying you wanted to get out of this town?<eos> That's what I always say too.<eos> But Two Horns, he's like the mayor.<eos> He's the guy we have to answer to.<eos> Maybe this isn't my last job for Two Horns, but it'll be hers.<eos> Then she can start a new life, just like she wants.<eos> Deunan?<eos> No way.<eos> She'd never go without you.<eos> Maybe she would.
It was danny, chloe, and myself.<eos> And we got three bass, and we took 'em home for dinner.<eos> But danny was messing around, And he snagged the end of the line To the bottom of his foot, and it gashed it open.<eos> And he was bleeding and hopping around, yelling.<eos> Why are you lying about where you were Thursday night?<eos> How is keeping me here helping you find danny's killer?<eos> We can't rule you out until you tell us where you were.<eos> Where I was doesn't matter.<eos> Yeah. My kid dies, I'd do whatever I could to help the police.<eos> I just would.
Who are you? !<eos> I know. You're right.<eos> I-I-it's not because of you.<eos> None of it is because of you, Jack.<eos> None of it is you. It's me.<eos> It's -- it's because of me.<eos> I need to become who I'm meant to be.<eos> Oh, god. I'm so sorry.<eos> You just told me you would never leave me.<eos> I wouldn't.
[Clears throat]<eos> There's a group of us that all sleep around together.<eos> You can only play so much mah-jongg, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, uh, they should all come in to be examined.<eos> Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, I-I would not.
Okay, Mikey, I'm here, I'm here!<eos> Charlie!<eos> Hey, is that crazy dude gonna die?<eos> Hey... just hold still, sir.<eos> And I... I don't know.<eos> I can't go to jail.<eos> I'd never make it there.<eos> I saw every episode of "Oz."<eos> - They eat guys like me alive.<eos> - Yeah, they would.
Catherine's been in the military half her life.<eos> She's doing what she was trained to do.<eos> She's not coming home until the job is done.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You've been quiet all day.<eos> am brought up the M-word last night.<eos> What did you say?<eos> He didn't officially propose.<eos> Just wondering would I consider it.<eos> And would you?
These people are often very...<eos> very highly organised.<eos> For months!<eos> Following me. Following Ann! -Jesus!<eos> -We can...<eos> I can look into how much you can take out of the business if that's...<eos> I've got maybe 200 grand I can lay my hands on immediately, but even then, are they going to let me withdraw that amount in cash, without asking bloody questions?<eos> Well, it's your money.<eos> Yeah, but they're going to think I'm laundering money, then they're going to tell the police!<eos> -Really? -Well, I would!
Work related?<eos> The call.<eos> Was the call...<eos> No, it was my daughter, as a matter of fact.<eos> So we've met and now we're here and I'm looking forward to talking.<eos> As I understand it, you're our last best hope for the network to stay on the air.<eos> If I was a man with no choices, I'd kill myself.<eos> Well, I guess that means I have a choice, so...<eos> Would you like to talk about my intentions for the network?<eos> Yes, sir, I would.
- After dark?<eos> - In theory. Well, in theory, I'm having a party tonight.<eos> My address is on the card.<eos> So, if you're intrigued by the wild, weird, and wonderful...<eos> Okay, can't guarantee the "wonderful."<eos> But the others... Oh, good Lord God.<eos> Anyway, you'd be more than welcome.<eos> Why would you invite me to your home?<eos> You want me to be honest?<eos> I would, yes.
I think, on Category C murders, detective sergeants should be able to be the senior investigating officer.<eos> Category Cs are generally pretty straightforward, so you could have a small team, headed by a DS.<eos> You could even run the investigation on paper.<eos> So that would save you time and money.<eos> And the DCIs would have a bit less on their plate.<eos> That's definitely something I'd do.<eos> Sergeants are very busy already.<eos> Yeah, but like you said, there's a 20% budget cut so we're all gonna be working our socks off, anyway.<eos> I think sergeants would rise to the responsibility.<eos> I would.
Well, that's bullshit, Abby.<eos> Frank Winter's had it out for me ever since we got here 'cause he's jealous 'cause I've accomplished more in a few months than he has in almost a year.<eos> Tell me exactly what he said.<eos> Um... he was talking to his father.<eos> But he said he might go to Oppenheimer.<eos> He said one conversation and you're career would be finished.<eos> And I was so upset I had to come home.<eos> He wasn't talking to his father.<eos> He was talking to you trying to get in my head.<eos> - So you would never...
Shit.<eos> Who knows what he'll do?<eos> He let a man piss on him.<eos> Where is George goddamn Melton, Carl?<eos> Are you sure you want to find him?<eos> But you still see Holden as a threat.<eos> To who?<eos> The community.<eos> I wouldn't want to live next to him.<eos> Would you?
Come here, honey.<eos> You have my full support, now, sondra.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> That means a lot, senator.<eos> I wasn't sure holden would go for banishment.<eos> You must've been very persuasive.<eos> Well, he hasn't signed off on it yet.<eos> Did you threaten to revoke his bond if he doesn't?<eos> I did.<eos> Would you?
You have your appointment, you bring your hardware.<eos> Hardware.<eos> That's brand-new. It's not broken.<eos> Smart counter appointments are for hardware that is broken.<eos> Fill out this form.<eos> Your phone will be ready in three days.<eos> I planned the funeral.<eos> I think it's going to be nice.<eos> Harrison would like it.<eos> Well, he wouldn't.
The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
That's not very generous, considering you're an organ donor from the great state of New Hampshire.<eos> - Forget you saw this, understand?<eos> - No can do.<eos> I have a pornographic memory.<eos> I want in.<eos> No way.<eos> You can't handle a fake I.D.<eos> You'll immediately get caught and ruin it for everyone.<eos> Well, if you don't help me get one, I'm telling dad.<eos> - You wouldn't.
And then?<eos> And then...<eos> She overworked herself.<eos> I was all alone after that.<eos> I had no place to live anymore.<eos> Kaneki!<eos> How long are you gonna stay home? !<eos> yeah... There was just one place where I could go... would you eat Yoshikawa in Class 2?<eos> The one you like so much?<eos> I wouldn't!
WOMAN: Boy.<eos> WINNIE: Hello, Albert. ALBERT:<eos> Hello, Winnie.<eos> Lovely to see you.<eos> (WHISPERS) Boy.<eos> What would you do for love?<eos> Sir?<eos> Would you hazard everything you held dear?<eos> Family, friends, respect, judgment in the eyes of an all-seeing God, and call it a price worth paying?<eos> I would.
I see.<eos> Yes, in our culture...<eos> The Jewish culture?<eos> That's right... kind of allowed.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with an age difference.<eos> I once went out with a lady who was 35 years older than me.<eos> Did you?<eos> Oh, no, I'm getting confused with my mother.<eos> Would you like to meet her?<eos> Oh, yes, we would.
Hi.<eos> What?<eos> You know who I could hire without having to give an interview?<eos> I thought you didn't hire first-years.<eos> We don't.<eos> 'Cause they're never as smart as you.<eos> Uh...<eos> I know. I know...<eos> You would never leave Keating.<eos> I wouldn't?
And that's all we need to be sure of.<eos> I've been hearing about Edith's plan.<eos> How marvellous of her.<eos> If you ask me, it's absolutely crackers.<eos> Cora seems pleased.<eos> What idea is this?<eos> Edith has taken in a motherless child and is giving her a home here.<eos> I should have thought an orphan an uncomfortable piece of baggage for an unmarried woman.<eos> You mean a man might not want to take the child on?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
I kept you together.<eos> Who put that advert in the paper?<eos> Who gave you my number?<eos> The woman - the woman in the shop.<eos> Then there's a woman out there who's very keen that we stay together.<eos> Why?<eos> Cos she's perfect, innit?<eos> The control freak and the man who should never be controlled.<eos> You'd go to hell, if she asked.<eos> And she would.
David! Well, he's probably working, that's my husband, he's a writer.<eos> I invited Max to stay for a couple of days.<eos> You did? Yes, I thought you'd enjoy it.<eos> You cleared it with your folks, right?<eos> Yeah, I don't think they believe me, though.<eos> Cops don't usually bring me home.<eos> To their home... they don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
- You did?<eos> - Yes, I thought you'd enjoy it.<eos> You cleared it with your folks, right?<eos> Yeah, I don't think they believe me, though.<eos> Cops don't usually bring me home.<eos> To their home...<eos> They don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
Elodie loves Josephine Baker.<eos> - Mmm. - Oh. But I think, she couldn't cut it in the States, so she hops across the pond and kisses the frogs.<eos> I want to taste you.<eos> Mmm, sweetheart.<eos> Why don't you fish out that bottle of sherry we've been saving, hmm?<eos> - You're burning up.<eos> - Am I?<eos> I'd like to know you better.<eos> Is that strange to say? No.<eos> Well, I would.
Just returning the favor.<eos> How many Zs we kill that day?<eos> Not enough.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Stand down.<eos> You're the first person I've seen from before.<eos> How the hell you end up here?<eos> I'm actually on a mission for the government, if you can believe that.<eos> If it was anybody but you,<eos> I wouldn't.
I know my son.<eos> He didn't do this.<eos> Mrs. Bidwell, we know the truth about Johnny.<eos> We know about the dead animals.<eos> We know you had to call the police to get him out of your own house.<eos> He's always been different, hasn't he?<eos> Isolated, not many friends.<eos> And it got really bad when he hit puberty.<eos> Look, if it were my son, I would try to protect him, too.<eos> I would.
Or offer up a deal.<eos> Whatever suits you best.<eos> But if you decline, I'd be careful.<eos> There it is.<eos> There's the warning.<eos> You want something out of me?<eos> Why don't you just ask for it?<eos> If I wanted something out of you, dearie, Believe me, I'd take it.<eos> But you can't, can you?<eos> Otherwise you would.
Kevin is just a little anxious.<eos> Maybe about going to bed.<eos> Well, did you give him his bedtime nuggets?<eos> - His what? - His bedtime nuggets.<eos> I told you... he needs two or three of those before he can go to sleep.<eos> His bedtime nuggets, of course.<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> Hey, Kevin, would you like some bedtime nuggets?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - I would.
The teachers are colleagues.<eos> He's support staff.<eos> ..and a friend... OK, someone that we know very well... ~ I don't know him well.<eos> ~ .. who we've met... ~ Mm.<eos> ~ .. who desperately needs our help.<eos> Otherwise he will end up begging on the streets.<eos> I read in the Daily Mail that some of these beggars make over a quarter of a million pounds a year.<eos> Look, all Gareth needs is a place to sleep.<eos> I mean, if he had somewhere to live, you wouldn't sack him, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't, Miss Chakrabarti.
No, they don't.<eos> Not the ladies.<eos> Unless the ladies want to.<eos> Why can't a lady have a mustache?<eos> She can.<eos> And it would look sexy.<eos> Would you like a green grape shoved in your... given to your mouth?<eos> Handed to your mouth?<eos> I'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.<eos> - No, he-he would.

'Cause you can't hack analog.<eos> MAN: Um, hi, this message is for Paige Dineen.<eos> This is Drew Baker.<eos> I know it's been a long time, Paige,<eos> I got your info from the diner.<eos> I was hoping that we could talk.<eos> No... no, no, no.<eos> - I'd really like to see you guys.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Really would.
Contact the Hamilton school.<eos> They may keep DNA swabs of their students.<eos> Some elite schools do as part of their abduction precautionary measures.<eos> We may find a match.<eos> Right.<eos> Wow, don't think anybody at my high school would notice if I was abducted.<eos> Well, look how far you've come.<eos> You're now someone whose abduction... would be noticed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It would.
Now, just er, put it in there now.<eos> ~ Drop the gun!<eos> ~ Yes, Phil!<eos> Ha, you forgot I had this, didn't you?<eos> It isn't loaded.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Who gave it to you?<eos> You did.<eos> Stop or I'll drop it.<eos> You wouldn't.
Hmm.<eos> And you?<eos> Well, I'll become stronger, powerful.<eos> Ah. Power you seek.<eos> I'd make the Empire suffer for everything it did, for everything it took, for my parents!<eos> I...<eos> I wouldn't be helpless anymore!<eos> Ah. Jedi way is revenge?<eos> Teach you this, your Master did?<eos> No. Kanan would never.
So, that's it.<eos> I left the restaurant.<eos> I walked out.<eos> Thing is, though, if I don't broach the subject with my dad, he will.<eos> And then what?<eos> Well, look, either he is or he isn't.<eos> And if he isn't, he'll just laugh, surely.<eos> And if he is, well... it's not going to come as a surprise to him, is it?<eos> He knows whether or not he had a fling.<eos> Yeah, but he just wouldn't.
And what makes you say that?<eos> I don't believe you mother-in-law is a music lover.<eos> My father gave that piano to me.<eos> - Do you play?<eos> - I do.<eos> But Madame doesn't want any music in the house until my husband's home to hear it.<eos> You mind if I sit?<eos> The piece you keep playing...<eos> - I don't recognise it.<eos> - You wouldn't.
- She was 16. 16.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> I think it's an acquired taste, you know?<eos> - Marriage?<eos> - Matzo ball soup.<eos> We should go one day, you know?<eos> - Go to Canter's and try it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Do you wanna try it?<eos> - Yeah, I would.
Do you remember when we used to come here?<eos> You always insisted on a Lion King balloon.<eos> And then you'd hold on to it for two minutes, and... you'd let it go.<eos> I liked to see it fly away.<eos> I wish everything could just be the way it was back then.<eos> You, me.<eos> Your dad.<eos> I'd do anything for you, Fay.<eos> Anything.<eos> I would.

It's just down here.<eos> Ow!<eos> Here, I'll put it in the car.<eos> What age are you?<eos> 14.<eos> -14? You've got a license?<eos> No, but I've been driving since I was six.<eos> You expect me to get in this thing?<eos> With you? Well, you could get a bus if you'd rather.<eos> Fine yeah, I would.
But not in the way you imagine it.<eos> How should I imagine?<eos> You should imagine thousands upon thousands of your people dead.<eos> This town of yours reduced to ashes.<eos> Imagine it gone. Made radioactive. Buried under dirt as if it had never existed, like District 13.<eos> You fought very hard in The Games, Miss Everdeen. But they were games.<eos> Would you like to be in a real war?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Neither would I.
Captain Hastings.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Came by the 3.40, eh?<eos> We bought this place in a fit of madness.<eos> Guest house keepers at our age!<eos> Still, needs must these days... ..and at least one of us has a good business head.<eos> Don't I, Toby? Chop, chop!<eos> Take the captain up to his room.<eos> Unless, of course, you'd prefer to see Monsieur Poirot first.<eos> Yes, I would.
The Germans executed them.<eos> We were very angry.<eos> You remember his name?<eos> My memory isn't what it was.<eos> Was it Per Lungstad?<eos> It might have been.<eos> Cos you boys meted out some rough justice, or so they say.<eos> I wouldn't know about that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
It's not getting any easier, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> Every time I come back, I'm a bit less.<eos> Pieces of you get chipped away.<eos> Could you bring back a man without a head?<eos> Not six times. Just once.<eos> I don't think it works that way, child.<eos> He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere.<eos> I would never wish my life upon him.<eos> I would.
- Want to give it a try?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> So, um, you're not re-envisioning the song.<eos> You're actually just directing it differently.<eos> And, oh, guess what.<eos> That's my job.<eos> Just trying to save the song.<eos> You can do it if you want.<eos> Oh, I would.
Damn right she could.<eos> I think she's already made you proud.<eos> Guilty, my friend.<eos> Oh, guys, it goes so fast.<eos> Like a freight train on the track, clickety-clack.<eos> Now she's got a boyfriend... a guy you'll like, hopefully.<eos> Clickety-clack, she's married.<eos> Clickety-clack, she's putting you in a home!<eos> She would do it, too.<eos> She would.
We have your brother.<eos> Which?<eos> Victor?<eos> There is another?<eos> She must know where these girls are kept.<eos> Reid, there's a strategy that I'd like to put to you.<eos> It's going to require Drake, here.<eos> Go on.<eos> I would see Victor.<eos> Would you?
Checkmate.<eos> You can't go here because of the rook and you can't go here...<eos> - I know what checkmate is.<eos> It's one of Kasparov's tricks, you have to know when to sacrifice your queen.<eos> When I got up for tea did he move the pieces?<eos> I didn't cheat, I never do.<eos> You're stupid.<eos> I'd cheat if I could.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, he would.
You go on ahead.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> Marty.<eos> Frank.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Take your marks.<eos> Congressman, would you like to respond to that?<eos> Yes, I would.
Triple expansion.<eos> To drive a triple screw propeller.<eos> That type of power inside us and the journey time to New York,<eos> Buenos Aries, Cape Town would have been reduced by days and our competitors nothing more than a sail on the horizon.<eos> Mrs Fanthorpe!<eos> Martha.<eos> What?<eos> Would you allow us a moment, Mr Bruton?<eos> Martha, would you have me...?<eos> No, Ezekiel Bruton, I would not.
That'll teach ya!<eos> My thanks to our jury for the speedy delivery of sound verdict.<eos> However, given the boy's barely comprehensible and continued silence, does counsel wish to speak for him before I pass sentence on his guilt?<eos> My Lord, I do.<eos> This is a child stood here.<eos> I would hope that you might recognise that as an opportunity to assert the sanctity of that childhood and to be merciful.<eos> This boy and the others like him who we would blame for the violence on our streets, it is not they who we should punish, but the Fagins who stand behind them, directing that violence.<eos> These innocents, we should protect.<eos> You would urge an attempt at reformation?<eos> I would.
The way's...<eos> The way's barricaded.<eos> You, man!<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait there, Thomas.<eos> No, Thomas. You're to wait inside.<eos> Thomas Gower!<eos> The love we bear you.<eos> Does that not mean nothing to you?<eos> Squeal, would ya?
I just can't work for other people.<eos> I guess I need my independence.<eos> If that makes any sense.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> That makes perfect sense.<eos> I'm sorry for ruining your Friday night.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> This is great.<eos> I'd do this for free.<eos> I really would.
Hello?<eos> I had her.<eos> She was ready to give up.<eos> She said that?<eos> I could just tell.<eos> But she hung up on you.<eos> I think the phone died.<eos> Power outage?<eos> Why would she turn off the power?<eos> She wouldn't.
So how do you want to do this?<eos> By answering a few questions first.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Did you know Paul was married?<eos> When I checked him into the hotel I used to work at, I did notice that he was wearing a wedding band.<eos> I also noticed that he wasn't wearing it when he took me to dinner that night.<eos> And how long were you two having an affair?<eos> At first, we would just get together whenever he came to town.<eos> I don't even know that I would call it an affair.<eos> I would.
I'm sorry.<eos> That sucks.<eos> But I guess on the bright side, that really means they might be getting back together.<eos> I'm not sure that's a bright side.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Don't you want them to?<eos> You heard what I just told you, right?<eos> That's what it's always like when they're together.<eos> So, no, not really.<eos> Would you?
- Does West know?<eos> - I haven't told him.<eos> But I'm sure he'll understand.<eos> So none of us are going to the prom?<eos> Maybe we could still go- the three of us.<eos> It could still be fun.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Like a trouple.<eos> We'd make a very cute trouple.<eos> We would.
To help with Rebecca?<eos> I can't... live like this anymore.<eos> Well, that depends... on what your intentions are.<eos> Is this just about Rebecca or is this about Maddie?<eos> Well, as long as Rebecca keeps making me do all this crazy crap,<eos> Mads will never give me another chance.<eos> So, yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> If I help you and you hurt Maddie...<eos> I wouldn't.
Ten thousand men.<eos> It would take considerable coin and effort to raise such a force.<eos> And in return you will be offered a command.<eos> Under Cossinius and Furius, of course.<eos> An offer better received from the men themselves.<eos> They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria, within short ride of what remains of their legion to the north.<eos> Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania<eos> You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it.<eos> No.<eos> You would not.
It was my idea.<eos> Yes, thank you, Tina.<eos> And every girl will sing to whoever they want to take to the dance.<eos> Well, I, for one, love this lesson.<eos> I've got a song I want to sing to somebody.<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> Kurt, he's still sleeping.<eos> ♪ Would you like some tea?<eos> ♪ Yes, I would, but shh.
♪ Tell him that you're always gonna love him ♪<eos> ♪ Tell him, tell him, tell him ♪<eos> ♪ Tell him right now ♪<eos> ♪ Just take his hand in yours and tell ♪<eos> ♪ Tell him, tell him ♪<eos> ♪ Tell him, tell him right now. ♪<eos> Jake!<eos> I mean, I mean Jake, would you like to go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Yep.<eos> He found her the night of the gala.<eos> And killed her after spending the night with me.<eos> I know how to pick 'em, don't I?<eos> You know, I haven't even gone near a man in months, and the first guy I like turns out to be a murderer.<eos> - Maybe multiple murderer.<eos> - What?<eos> Sorry. Tatyana said that two other girls with the same mark have gone missing in the last two weeks.<eos> - They haven't turned up here.<eos> - No, they wouldn't.
Indogene.<eos> Castithan.<eos> Liberata.<eos> Sensoth.<eos> Gulanee.<eos> Even Volge.<eos> All the Votan races represented.<eos> Almost.<eos> If you'd like to contribute an Irathient item...<eos> I would not.
So, Herb, the garden party's on, right?<eos> Sure, but don't ruin the lawn again and don't throw the sofa in the pool.<eos> But if I pass away by then, you can do whatever you like.<eos> - Herb?<eos> - Yes?<eos> If you really die...<eos> Then I'll have to deal with all that burial crap.<eos> Maybe you don't care, but my parents will show up.<eos> - You wouldn't do that to me, would you?<eos> - I'd rather not.
I'm going to walk.<eos> I think that the air will be good for me.<eos> Hey. I've had these days.<eos> I promise you things will look different in the morning.<eos> Spencer: How many times did she visit her?<eos> What is that?<eos> Mona kept souvenirs.<eos> How many times did Cece visit her?<eos> - I wouldn't know.<eos> - Yes, you would, Wren.
I'd smack him out!<eos> I'd talk to her.<eos> I'd confront them both, and then I'd divorce her.<eos> Right. So, you wouldn't kill James or Simon?<eos> I wouldn't need to.<eos> Danny, James and Simon got you kicked out of school.<eos> Now you're doomed to work in a repair shop for the rest of your life.<eos> OK, I'm really pissed off.<eos> Mm-hm. You kill them?<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you?
You're a "bummer brother."<eos> So... yeah.<eos> Whatever.<eos> This whole thing is lame.<eos> Except kitchen floor hoops, which I just invented, and is totally awesome.<eos> I know you fancy yourself some kind of rebel, Axl, but sometimes in life, you just have to follow the rules.<eos> I put on sunscreen an hour before going outside.<eos> I wait till the bus comes to a complete stop before standing.<eos> You don't think I would love to fill up on bread?<eos> I would.
I know she's on the back foot, but just playing devil's advocate for a second, just supposing it is Joe who found the stamina to do this thing -<eos> It's her! Shh!<eos> Shh! Shh! I'm thinking!<eos> If it was him, whatever he used to clunk her on the head, can't have gone very far, can it?<eos> He might not be bedridden but he didn't go out of the house.<eos> He probably doesn't go downstairs.<eos> Has Denise's lot not found anything that fits the bill as regards a weapon?<eos> How would you get rid of something if you couldn't leave the house?<eos> Lob it out the window.<eos> I would.
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You know, I was only helping Bradley because some of her dad's stuff was at work.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> It doesn't matter to me.<eos> I'm over her.<eos> If you want to go out with her, go for it.<eos> I'm not going out with her.<eos> No, but you want to.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Hey, Silver.<eos> Uh, how was your big day?<eos> Not as good as yours.<eos> I spent all day on a truck and I got one interview.<eos> You just found your new recording star.<eos> Oh, uh, look, I... I can explain.<eos> No, you don't have to, 'cause I get it.<eos> Michaela's my surrogate, but you decided to talk her into a singing career, because, I don't know, what could be better for my unborn child than long nights on a tour bus going from club to club?<eos> Silver, I wouldn't do that.<eos> Yes, you would, Dixon.
Can I be honest with you?<eos> With the results of my efficiency list,<eos> I keep arriving at the same conclusion.<eos> There's no room for both of us.<eos> Unless...<eos> We made room for each other.<eos> I leave you off my list.<eos> And I leave you off mine.<eos> Well, would you be willing to sacrifice the integrity of your list?<eos> I would...
Wintergreen.<eos> - I knew it, I knew it.<eos> - Yeah, good nose. I looked at you coming around, and I said, "wintergreen."<eos> I can't hire Clark.<eos> Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.<eos> Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.<eos> You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.<eos> That's just a classic no-win situation.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.
Don't pull!<eos> Don't pull.<eos> (muffled murmuring) No, no, no.<eos> That's gonna hurt!<eos> JIMMY: So we started checking TheNatesvilleCourier.<eos> After the ten pages of escort services, there were listings for a dozen old cars in our price range, which was exactly $830 or under.<eos> What is with your guys' irrational fear of credit?<eos> Everybody uses it.<eos> But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?<eos> I would.
Cold as the grave.<eos> Cold as the night.<eos> Please, baby, please don't go.<eos> Please, Lord, don't take her.<eos> Oh, sweet Heavenly Father!<eos> Thank you for seeing me.<eos> I just wanted to bring one small thing to your attention, if you have some time.<eos> I always have time for you, Elsbeth.<eos> Oh, would you like a biscotti?<eos> Why, yes, I would.
Look at Wilson's face.<eos> And that is not my fault!<eos> Tell that to his dad.<eos> Because she doesn't have him, by the way.<eos> Tell us the truth.<eos> All of it, not bits, not pieces, all.<eos> Or I leave.<eos> Would you at least like to sit down first, Becky?<eos> No, Jessica.<eos> I fucking wouldn't.
I can't see a thing.<eos> It's like trying to operate in The Black Hole of Calcutta.<eos> Oh, slightly better.<eos> Ah, you're operating on her...<eos> Right.<eos> Good.<eos> Not sure this is quite the...<eos> Beautiful woman, perfectly equipped.<eos> Now, you tell me, are these too small?<eos> Well, I wouldn't...
The remains were found in an abattoir?<eos> "Slaughterhouse" is fine, okay?<eos> French doesn't make murder any classier.<eos> It is a very good place to dispose of a body;<eos> the equipment's all there.<eos> It's amazing, you know.<eos> You always look on the bright side of life, don't you?<eos> I try. Yeah.<eos> Oh, Christine's baby group is later this morning, if you want to take her.<eos> I would, but, I, uh...
I mean, she tells me everything.<eos> I just thought, you know, since you and Booth were close, that...<eos> No, he hasn't said anything to me.<eos> I mean, why the secrecy if he's okay, right?<eos> Oh, God, I hate it when he gets all stoic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But he has Dr. Brennan.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And-and I'm sure, if they needed anything, they would ask.<eos> No, they wouldn't.

I am not leaving you.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Where am I going to go?<eos> Wherever that ghastly woman sends you.<eos> Thanks, Joe, for making me feel like a parcel!<eos> You're meant to be keeping calm.<eos> He won't do as he's told, Frankie.<eos> Never has.<eos> Joseph, would you go into cardiac care if it was just for the day?<eos> Yes, he would.
Pain killers.<eos> So if he were to take them all...<eos> It could be fatal.<eos> Robbie's in bed. I said you'd go up.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Let me make you a cup of tea.<eos> You're not attending my patients, remember?<eos> Grow up, Zoe.<eos> You don't think that he would take them, do you?<eos> Well, he wouldn't, would he?
Any weird patients recently?<eos> No more than usual.<eos> Don't get angry, I'm just putting this out there.<eos> What?<eos> You know I like Ian and...<eos> No.<eos> You read about these things, it's nearly always the ex.<eos> Ian wouldn't do this.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> He just wouldn't.
Elena, stop it.<eos> Why, because you want me to not be in denial?<eos> You want me to face the truth?<eos> This is the truth, Stefan.<eos> I don't want to live here anymore.<eos> I don't want these sketches.<eos> I don't want this Xbox.<eos> Not gonna need this bourbon anymore.<eos> Alaric is not here to drink it, I mean, unless you guys are willing to bring back every supernatural creature on the other side to get him hick.<eos> Would you?
We'll see what your mother has to say about it.<eos> Do not call her. I swear to God, I'll-- Wait, hang on, are you wearing Kevlar?<eos> Yeah, because I'm not an id- - Oh, no. [GUNSHOTS]<eos> Sorry, I know that hurt. Uh...<eos> There, just like The Defiant Ones.<eos> Now, then, I believe there was some mention of a thank-you drink?<eos> So just so I'm clear, you expect me to believe that Sterling beat both of you up then shot Cyril? Uh...<eos> Come on, for some haggard Mexican?<eos> I wouldn't really describe her as haggard.<eos> I would.
No, I think I'm really dying. [KRIEGER LAUGHS]<eos> KRIEGER:<eos> I know. Hey, there's Archer.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> [GROANING] Whoever that was, I'm serious, I'm pretty sure you've got Giardia.<eos> I'm serious, please, thank you, but we need to get back into Mexico.<eos> [ALL MUTTERING IN SPANISH] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]<eos> What the hell kind of plan is this?<eos> I don't know if I'd call it a plan.<eos> No one would.
You know, it's really fun to talk about sex all day.<eos> I don't know about you, but I enjoy sex.<eos> I like sex.<eos> I'm not... Uh-huh.<eos> Doc Johnson is my family legacy we're talking about.<eos> Sent me to private school.<eos> Sent me to brown, it sent me to wharton.<eos> I'm not about to apologize for it because some China doll has a stick up her ass.<eos> Stick up her ass would be a very good product for your guys.<eos> It would.
- Are you going, Bea?<eos> - I'm off to bed.<eos> See you soon.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We're emotional.<eos> - 'Night.<eos> - Nighty-night.<eos> Tommy, Tommy, don't do anything I wouldn't do.<eos> - Oh. - No, I'm jok-<eos> - I would.
We have to stop this thing.<eos> This thing kept your son alive.<eos> And only now...<eos> Now you're asking me to sacrifice my family?<eos> My son is not alive.<eos> I did awful things for him, and... he's dead.<eos> Non... none of it mattered.<eos> And you're saying to save him, you wouldn't have done it all again?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
Okay, I was going to rip into you, Mom, but... we're talking tomorrow because... you can't use the truth to undercut me with my kids.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Good.<eos> There you are.<eos> Oh, I had to step away.<eos> - Peter.<eos> - Hi, Veronica.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> I would.
Yeah, what he's done, he's gone for a Mustang.<eos> A Ford Mustang.<eos> There they are.<eos> He looks pleased with himself.<eos> Dear, dear.<eos> What do you think of that?<eos> Well, you do know, don't you, that just because a car has go-faster stripes on it, it doesn't actually mean it goes faster?<eos> I know.<eos> You wouldn't go through Europe in a Stetson with chaps on, would you?<eos> He would.
Pembroke Castle belongs to my son!<eos> I'm afraid that is no longer true, Lady Margaret.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Bray will show you to the stables.<eos> Men!<eos> Why are you like this?<eos> Quiet, Margaret.<eos> Do something.<eos> For once, do something!<eos> Jasper would.
Yeah.<eos> Seems to be.<eos> What's that, then?<eos> Lager beer, is it?<eos> Double Diamond.<eos> - The wonder is anyone buys the stuff.<eos> Pour me one while you're there.<eos> Pour it yourself.<eos> You'd pour him one.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Oh, loved it.<eos> Mm. "If I Were a Rich Man" was in perfect pitch, but I thought Tevye was a little flat with "Tradition."<eos> Daddy is a baritone in the church choir.<eos> We're Lutherans.<eos> Right. How were you raised, Clark?<eos> Uh... Protestant.<eos> Presbyterian.<eos> Yeah, that's not so far off, hm?<eos> So, would anyone like coffee?<eos> I would.
You mean... these pants?<eos> Uh-oh. Uh-oh.<eos> Here it comes. Oh, sweetheart.<eos> - Those boys ain't got nothing on your husband.<eos> [ Laughing I Yeah.<eos> Where did you play?<eos> I played around the country for about 20 years.<eos> Yeah. You know, I actually did a gig at the Carlyle Hotel.<eos> Daily News loved me.<eos> Well, why wouldn't they, Mom?
Just tell the truth.<eos> Nobody's going to be mad at you.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> You're both so handsome.<eos> Yes.<eos> But if someone put a gun to your head and you had to pick?<eos> Who would it be?<eos> Is someone going to put a gun to my head?<eos> Just pick, Violet.<eos> I'd rather not.
I got this.<eos> I got this.<eos> The... the universe wants this to happen.<eos> Okay. Uh...<eos> Hey, uh, I... I will give you... 18 bucks for that sweet tie of yours.<eos> As a surrogate, what is it you do?<eos> I work with people who are having a hard time reaching their sexual potential.<eos> Well, Mr. Hewett would say that that's what a prostitute does.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah, I would, actually.
Are there any new lines of inquiry on Red John?<eos> We've had some leads, but...<eos> I hate to admit it-- we're kind of stuck.<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> What about Jane?<eos> I don't think he has anything.<eos> But he'd tell you if he did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he would.
Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry for what?<eos> Where's Caitlyn?<eos> You know Roddy, don't you?<eos> Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
Casey, Casey.<eos> What's up?<eos> - I know that you're really Christian.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - But let's say someone killed me...<eos> - No. In a really horrible, horrible way.<eos> - What?<eos> - You would kill the murderer to avenge my death, right?<eos> - I would want to kill them... - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Very badly, but I would not.
Hey, knock that off!<eos> Thanks a million, Doc.<eos> We owe you.<eos> If you ever need me to set you up with a set of tires, say--<eos> What do you think of Nicholas?<eos> Andrew. We're calling him Andrew.<eos> Stan's brother.<eos> Have you held him yet?<eos> I told him, I says, "You're gonna drop him."<eos> I wouldn't.
I'm afraid we can't be interrupted.<eos> - You don't mind if I get comfortable?<eos> You'll realise there are protocols protecting this place.<eos> Osgood?<eos> In the event of alien incursion, the contents of this room are deemed so dangerous, it will self-destruct in... Five minutes.<eos> There's a nuclear warhead 20 feet beneath us.<eos> Are you sitting comfortably?<eos> - You would destroy London?<eos> - To save the world?<eos> Yes, I would.
To what end?<eos> We may not strike at Jedediah Shine or Silas Duggan through him.<eos> We may not strike at those men at all.<eos> What, then?<eos> Say, imagine, we might, you and I, walk into a chophouse on the Commercial Road and in that chophouse we... lay our hands up on the shoulder of the man the world made<eos> The Ripper, know him unequivocally for that killer, what would we do?<eos> There is what I would like to do.<eos> And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.

- They found a stash of syringes.<eos> - Well, I'm diabetic.<eos> Those are perfectly legal for me to have.<eos> Black market drugs.<eos> Pretty common in India, right?<eos> They think that you snuck some home, used one of your perfectly legal needles to kill your cheating girlfriend.<eos> Look, I'm not denying that we had troubles, but I would never hurt Mia.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I'd like to.<eos> I really would, Ben.
My father just died.<eos> I don't know, life's short, huh?<eos> It just kind of...<eos> I got to start doing things, Tran.<eos> Making moves, grown-up moves.<eos> I don't know, I want things.<eos> I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.<eos> What's my move with Jess?<eos> What would you do?<eos> Of course you would, you dirty dog.
I've got to go meet Caroline.<eos> Are they still keeping Elena trapped in the Salvatore mansion?<eos> I happen to like her just the way she is.<eos> It's tragic that they're trying so desperately to fix something that isn't broken.<eos> Elena was my friend long before she was your mean-girl sidekick.<eos> So if you're upset that you lost the cure and your brothers ditched you, why are you still in Mystic Falls?<eos> Some of us don't have the option of leaving.<eos> Some of us are broke and failing all of our classes and stuck here.<eos> So why don't you take your freedom and get the hell out of town?<eos> I would.
On this side... Dianne, I'm so sorry, but I just... I...<eos> I really do have to find her. I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep looking down here and then...<eos> Well, you let me know if you can't find her here on the property.<eos> I certainly will and I'm... I'm sure we'll see you - on the way out.<eos> - I'll drive you around if you like.<eos> Oh, no, don't worry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> - Emily?<eos> - Yes? Edgar would like to say hi to you.<eos> Edgar would?
Look who's here!<eos> Yeah, look who's here.<eos> I was going to come by your fancy new restaurant but I went to a meeting instead.<eos> Just felt like an extra one this week for some reason.<eos> - Willowdine there?<eos> - Oh.<eos> I haven't seen much of her lately.<eos> Guess she's spending some time down in Palm Springs.<eos> - Wouldn't know.<eos> - Neither would I.
Wait a minute.<eos> I think I'm may have peed my pants.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I peed!<eos> Hey, Van, listen.<eos> Before we take this upstairs, I think we should go over your files.<eos> You know, maybe let me take home what you got so I can get familiar.<eos> I'd rather keep them in my safe.<eos> All right, then at least give me the tapes.<eos> I'd rather not.
Well, outside Vienna.<eos> Um, in a castle on a lake.<eos> Wow. Pastry must be serious business in Austria. Oh, yeah.<eos> How long would you be gone?<eos> Less than a year.<eos> Well, that sounds like an incredible opportunity.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is. They only chose five Americans.<eos> So... would you like to come with me?<eos> Would I what?
Prom night. 2000.<eos> - What was the theme?<eos> - Yeah, who cares about the theme?<eos> - What were you wearing?<eos> - I want to know the theme.<eos> ♪ Who's that girl?<eos> ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪ It was after prom.<eos> Cece and I were both 18, and we'd rented a hotel room.<eos> So... would you like to freak?<eos> Yes, I would.
First of all, I cannot mix work with mudding, okay?<eos> Let's hit the showers.<eos> I can't wait to stick it to opposing counsel.<eos> Do you need me to give you a hand out of there?<eos> [Sighs] I know who you are.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> No, Nick.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I'd like you to go.<eos> No. You wouldn't.
Sorry.<eos> Gus had a crush on you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You knew that?<eos> He bought me chocolates.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I told him you wouldn't like that.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - If we dated.<eos> Nope, I would not.
Uh, talking to Adrian.<eos> - Oh, at school?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, if you don't love me and you don't want to marry me and you want to go off to school on your own, you should tell me.<eos> That's what Adrian said that you said.<eos> Jack, that's just a ridiculous lie.<eos> That's just a horrible, horrible, mean, vicious lie!<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Why would she make up something like that?<eos> - Yeah, why would she?
Hi, Mr. Glass.<eos> I'm Dr. Dani Santino.<eos> Connor McClane sent me.<eos> Hey, y-you know, you got a-a lot of packages out here.<eos> I'll get to them later.<eos> Mr. Glass, Connor is worried about you, so he sent me here to see if you're okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm just under deadline pressure.<eos> I'd like to take your word for that.<eos> Um, I would.
It was an order.<eos> She wants you to live your life, Han.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Come on, giddy-up, little doggie.<eos> ( Sighs )<eos> ( Sighs )<eos> ( Sighs )<eos> It was in Hanna's locker.<eos> Why would Cece use an envelope from the place where she used to work?<eos> She wouldn't.
I already knew.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I ask you to keep living.<eos> Comrade Won Ryu Hwan.<eos> Promise me one thing<eos> Here.<eos> About who the true leader of the 5446?<eos> Let's define it over!<eos> If we're lucky, Some of us could stay alive.<eos> Or only you would.
You've given me so many things.<eos> And I've never given you anything.<eos> Well, anything like this.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm surprised you don't recognize it.<eos> It's a copy of Colonel Mariga's deposition.<eos> My copy count didn't reconcile with the machine.<eos> It was off by seven pages, the exact amount of that.<eos> You thought I wouldn't notice.<eos> I would.
Handles?<eos> Handles?<eos> Thank you, Handles. And well done.<eos> Well done, mate.<eos> What do you think of my new place?<eos> Come up here once a day for a few minutes to remind myself of what it is I'm protecting.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Why did you send me away?<eos> Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Charlie, we got agents following Quinn right now.<eos> Yeah, but Quinn shut it down until the heat's off.<eos> We gotta start over again, trying to get Odin.<eos> Then let me do it.<eos> Johnny, I shot heroin twice.<eos> I'm never going to do it again.<eos> Yo, what was it like?<eos> I've seen a guy trying to kill his best friend for a fix.<eos> And I always wondered, if I tried it, would I understand?<eos> You would.
It gets worse, look at that one!<eos> That is The Archers as a postage stamp.<eos> Why don't they put something modern on it?<eos> You could put the McLaren or the Bentley Mulsanne on it, that would be fantastic on a stamp.<eos> I mean, the French wouldn't do a stamp that had an old bloke on a bicycle and a stripy T-shirt with some onions, would they?<eos> That's what that is!<eos> The Germans wouldn't do a stamp with a half-track just outside Warsaw.<eos> Exactly. No, they really wouldn't.<eos> No, Jeremy, definitely, they wouldn't do that.<eos> They wouldn't, would they?
Yeah.<eos> Except when a bear is chasing you.<eos> Then you get the hell out of the way.<eos> Get enough to eat?<eos> Oh. That t-bone was like something out of "The Flintstones".<eos> I'm very proud of you, son.<eos> Maybe I haven't given you enough responsibility.<eos> I'm gonna fix that.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah, I would.
- in front of your mother's portrait, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Tandy, Daphne...<eos> Come on.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Maddie?<eos> Can you come join us?<eos> We're gonna take a picture.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - Would you, please?
Live it.<eos> And then strap in because right...<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Artie.<eos> We're not doing this for Glee Club.<eos> We're doing this in front of the entire school.<eos> And, yes,<eos> Penny the school nurse will be in attendance.<eos> (gasps) Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go guarantee a sold-out show.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> The same way Gaga would:
[Phone chimes] Uh, no, no, no, no.<eos> Don't reach for that.<eos> It's probably just an Amber alert.<eos> Why are you acting weird?<eos> Oh, are you jealous of my new pants?<eos> No, but I may have texted something about you that I didn't mean, so just please don't look at your phone.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> If it's something bad, I don't want to see it anyway.<eos> She's gonna look at it, isn't she, Earl?<eos> I would.
- Kitty Fisher, for such was her name.<eos> - Kitty Fisher?<eos> Kitty Fisher.<eos> She went commando, and she exploited it enormously.<eos> And there were snuff boxes produced with pictures of her in them, and...<eos> Muff boxes?<eos> - Just for her.<eos> - And there were watches, called montres lubriques, lubricous watches, which used the clockwork to show her doing rather pornographical things, in a sort of like a sort of automaton kind of thing, a little movement.<eos> Oh, God, you wouldn't want the grandfather clock with a pendulum version, would you?<eos> No, you certainly wouldn't.
- Oh, that's me. - Thank you.<eos> Let's see, and I got the short stack ass-clap pancakes.<eos> You want to switch?<eos> - Schmidt, you want a taco?<eos> - No, I'm gonna take one of Winston's.<eos> - Take it if you want it, dude.<eos> - I was just thinking maybe-maybe you guys could chip in a little bit.<eos> - 'Cause it was expensive. - You want one of Winston's tacos?<eos> I'll take 50 cents on the dollar, I really would.<eos> I really would.
Nobody move.<eos> - I don't see it.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> What?<eos> See what?<eos> Both: A sturgeon dressed like Stoick.<eos> Aha! That's everything.<eos> Now, let me in!<eos> Yeah, we would love to, Snotlout.<eos> Really, we would.
Harassed by whom?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, it does matter.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't say.<eos> Stacey, tell him right now.<eos> No! I...<eos> I promised Amy.<eos> And I am telling you that Amy would want you to tell.<eos> No, she really wouldn't.
You were afraid of what your father was gonna do, right?<eos> I did everything I could.<eos> All it did was...<eos> I drove her to those tracks.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You just tried to help.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> My father would've wanted it this way.<eos> No, he would not.
I don't blame you for hating me, Susy.<eos> It has to be the worst crime in the world to give your child away.<eos> I know you don't believe me, but I did it for you.<eos> The reasons you use to blame me are the reasons that I had to give you away.<eos> What kind of life would you have with a ma like me?<eos> Every day I promise myself I won't be drunk, and then every day I find meself with a glass in me hand.<eos> I had to free you from me and the only way that I could do that was to have another drink inside me.<eos> I have lied to you, yes.<eos> But you tell me, if you can tell the truth, would it've been a better life if you'd stayed with me than the one that you've had?<eos> No. No, it wouldn't.
Let's just...<eos> Go home.<eos> Yeah, let's do that.<eos> Just once...<eos> Just once I wish my father would apologize and be on my side...<eos> Just once.<eos> (Scoffs) If he did that...<eos> If he just admitted...<eos> I think I'd make a hell of a governor.<eos> Yeah, you would.
We gonna find out who you are, and everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> She's just a hired staff doctor at the hospital, which is how come they can make her fill in and cover over here.<eos> A crucifix and a rosary.<eos> Oh, and save that cake for Sandy.<eos> Poor thing went through a lot of trouble to make that.<eos> She should get that back.<eos> You really think she wants to eat her dead sister's birthday cake?<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Did you?<eos> That's Young Do's hotel?<eos> Are you out of your mind? Where did you think you were going?<eos> Hey! I even went to your place in America when you could've been a drug dealer.<eos> It's not like I did something stupid.<eos> That was stupid.<eos> That was.<eos> Why did you trust me, stupid?<eos> What if something happened?<eos> But you wouldn't.
Thanks to that, my brother and I will receive more money than your love.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Your mom is the chairwoman of the board.<eos> Don't ever do something that will make people talk about you.<eos> My mom is not the chairwoman.<eos> She's your mistress.<eos> Good night.<eos> What were you doing in there?<eos> Did Mom say something to you?<eos> Of course she would.
- Maybe this time you should have.<eos> What are you looking over there for?<eos> You afraid of the doctor?<eos> Is that who hired you?<eos> Is he the one who arranges the sale of the hearts?<eos> You think you saved me from something?<eos> You killed me.<eos> Amelia... if you had gotten that heart, they would have doubled the payment and then tripled it, till you couldn't pay it, and then they would have turned yours off, too.<eos> I just want more time with my family.<eos> Wouldn't you?
I know what Antonia and I had.<eos> This is what we had.<eos> Peep, peep.<eos> That's what we had.<eos> Well, that's a lot.<eos> But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that, and it's a shame too, because I had a great eulogy.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Would you like me to share it with you?<eos> I most certainly would.
Is it true they used to fall over during the Falklands?<eos> Is that true?<eos> Lots of planes came over, which they hadn't seen before, and they went, "Whoa!"<eos> - It's unfortunately a myth.<eos> It's not true.<eos> - Oh, it's a lovely story.<eos> It's a nice story, but it's not true.<eos> Can you imagine in the bird world if you introduced postcodes?<eos> Penguins would move.<eos> - Yes, they would!
Oh, that's a dinner you'd want to go to.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Definitely.<eos> But the fact is, it seems to be an aberration, it's very rare.<eos> Most people when they're kidnapped, have nothing but feelings of complete hostility towards their captors.<eos> As you would expect.<eos> I would feel, as a clergyman, sort of bound to sort of...<eos> Are you a clergyman?<eos> - I would sort of feel obliged to kind of be nice to them.<eos> - Oh, you would.
He got passing grades.<eos> He hoped one day to become an architect, like his father.<eos> But that dream is gone.<eos> Snuffed out because like so many typical teenagers,<eos> Parker decided to try something that he saw on TV.<eos> On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
Packed lunch?<eos> Is there anything in there besides your soccer ball?<eos> I miss my dad.<eos> I don't even know if he's alive.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> I want to grow up before I die.<eos> So did my brother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Who would?
- Heaven isn't too far away - Heaven isn't too far away<eos> - Closer to it every day - Closer to it every day<eos> No matter what your friends say<eos> - I know we're gonna find a way - More than words<eos> - Is all you have to do to make it real - You have to do to make it real<eos> - Then you wouldn't have to say<eos> - Heaven isn't too far away - Heaven isn't too far away<eos> Heaven isn't too far away<eos> Yeah, heaven isn't too far away<eos> 'Cause I'd already
Have you ever heard the like of it?<eos> My family thought I was mad, wasting my time on him.<eos> - Ah, feck them.<eos> - Ah, feck you, Brian.<eos> - Same again?<eos> - Pour on.<eos> - What is it, Paddy?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know.<eos> - Not really, no.<eos> - You would, though.
Get off my block!<eos> Our eye now is to the future... to shine the bright light of accountability.<eos> Can I get you a Bud?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bottle or draft?<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> They always do that.<eos> Pain in the ass.<eos> Wouldn't come in here I know I got to go through shit like that.<eos> Shit, I would.
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.<eos> It was a matter of honor, defending a woman's honor.<eos> Sounds like barbarism to me.<eos> What if the lover had killed the husband?<eos> Would that have preserved the wife's honor, too?<eos> Still, not many of us can say our lover died for love.<eos> Love?<eos> "Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife."<eos> Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrievich?<eos> I would.
Then go to the other room and watch some TV.<eos> Would you stop staring?<eos> You're driving me crazy.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> Stop clinging!<eos> Want a beer?<eos> As long as it's cold.<eos> You seeing someone?<eos> Would you like to see my new tattoo?<eos> Would you?
Hello.<eos> I don't think we've met.<eos> I'm Father Brendan.<eos> I'm Mark O'Brien.<eos> I knew Father Seamus very well.<eos> I'm sorry that he's not here any more.<eos> As are many others.<eos> I'll do my best to fill his shoes.<eos> You'd like me to hear your confession?<eos> Yes, I would.
I mean, what's your story.<eos> I'm a golf pro.<eos> You mean... you're no Tiger Woods.<eos> Actually, Mike, I've won quite a few prestigious<eos> But to tell you the truth, life on the road is wearing me down, so I'm taking a gig.<eos> Resident pro at a course in Terre Haute, Indiana.<eos> Were are you going, anyway?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you like a ride to Terre Haute?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Don't spoil it.<eos> So what have I done that's so bloody stimulating?<eos> Yeah?<eos> What if it's not a word, what if it is individual letters?<eos> You think it's an acronym?<eos> Absolutely no idea, but...<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> ! - Nice to see you too<eos> I'm on holiday, would you believe?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You know what? You're hitting on a married woman.<eos> - I know.<eos> What's your point?<eos> You really want me to sic my husband on you in the state he's in?<eos> You're right.<eos> That kind of thing could lead a man to drink.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And then his glorious mangina might make an appearance.<eos> Wouldn't want to see that happen, would we?<eos> Actually, I would.
Aren't you like 30?<eos> Closed!<eos> What in Gaia's name are you doing?<eos> Going for nuance.<eos> No--<eos> You cannot touch the sacred tree.<eos> Ahhhhhhhhh!<eos> I guess my bite is worse than your bark.<eos> You, you wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, yes I would.
And being sired is...<eos> It's like faith.<eos> You do something because you believe it's the right thing.<eos> So, you believe that serving Klaus is the right thing.<eos> I don't serve him.<eos> Klaus released me from a curse that was ruining my life.<eos> I owe him for that.<eos> What if he asked you to...<eos> Jump off a bridge?<eos> He wouldn't.
I owe him for that.<eos> What if he asked you to...<eos> Jump off a bridge?<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> And even if he did,<eos> I'd be fine.<eos> I'm a hybrid.<eos> Ok.<eos> So what if he asked you to rip your own heart out?<eos> Again, he wouldn't.
Uh, the potatoes are fine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> So, have you always been a vegetarian?<eos> Most of my life, yes.<eos> Long time.<eos> I just can't imagine eating...<eos> I think... that we have just found our first opportunity to award some money tonight.<eos> Iris.<eos> I would like for you to eat the steak and the foie gras.<eos> I really would.
It's Mrs Stromming now.<eos> Ah...<eos> Well, I can't say I've all, but I've very many of your recordings, certainly.<eos> Good heavens.<eos> Yeah, your Butterfly in '54.<eos> If I had to save one disc on my desert island from the waves, that would...<eos> You are very kind.<eos> Well...<eos> Look, I'm sure Rowan won't be long.<eos> Would you, um...
It's all going to work out.<eos> And I'm going to be awesome.<eos> Where'd you get that thing?<eos> Oh, wow, that was...<eos> Mom's.<eos> She was wearing it in that old picture, right?<eos> The one dad had in his wallet.<eos> He would be really proud of you, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He would.
I love tack-os!<eos> Especially on a corn tor-tilla.<eos> Oh!<eos> I love tack-os on a corn tor-tilla!<eos> Boy, they're really against socialism.<eos> That's right.<eos> The Tea Party is all about self-reliance.<eos> Look, there's even a Tunnel of Self-Love.<eos> Would you like to buy a photo of yourself on the ride, sir?<eos> No, I would not.
Good.<eos> It needs to be passed. Still, there should be limits.<eos> We're political animals.<eos> We're not animals. Sometimes I think he's too willing to go to extremes.<eos> Tom, hal, would you come here, please?<eos> Tom?<eos> Yes, ma'am?<eos> You would take a bullet for the president, wouldn't you?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hal? Yes, ma'am, I would.
Night, night, be good for Nanny.<eos> Fatherhood suits him.<eos> At the moment it's the only thing that brings him any solace.<eos> He's convinced that Chamberlain is wrong, but feels powerless to influence a change.<eos> It's as though he's being stifled.<eos> Kept at arm's length, because his views don't fit.<eos> Does he suspect that?<eos> I suspect it. He may ruin his career.<eos> Your mother-in-law would be proud of you.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience.<eos> But this is Stannis Baratheon.<eos> I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.<eos> Have I shocked you, little dove?<eos> Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.<eos> The best one's between your legs.<eos> Learn how to use it.<eos> Drink.<eos> Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked?<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you?
You're a king.<eos> That's not the kind of king I want to be.<eos> What kind do you want to be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The good kind.<eos> Most kings grew up as princes.<eos> They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.<eos> I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell. to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.<eos> I'd like to hear you play the harp.<eos> you would not.
Uncool.<eos> You psyched to get out of here?<eos> Oh, totally.<eos> We cannot thank you enough...<eos> Dr. Gazelian.<eos> You remembered.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll never forget.<eos> Would you like to say it again?<eos> I would not.
- to all the patients' rooms.<eos> - Carl?<eos> I guess he's an orderly.<eos> It's part of his job.<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's something about Carl I don't trust.<eos> - He's got really shifty eyes.<eos> - They're not shifty; he suffers from mild sensory exotropia.<eos> Well, that would make what I just said incredibly insensitive, then, wouldn't it?<eos> - Yes, it would.
There's a story I heard once about a creature-- hey.<eos> Aren't we awfully close to the cottage?<eos> Who's gone to your window, Red?<eos> (Sighs) Is it Peter?<eos> Red, has he been at your window?<eos> Last night.<eos> Before the killings.<eos> And he never joined the guys to hunt the wolf.<eos> But I'm sure he wouldn't have killed them.<eos> He wouldn't.
Duncan.<eos> Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.<eos> I was born in 1953 at 6:00 in the morning... on...<eos> We got some lunch set up for you up ahead.<eos> Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.<eos> I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding<eos> Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining.<eos> This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls.<eos> Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?<eos> I certainly would!
Wow. I can't believe I'm about to date a rock star.<eos> I wrote fan letters to Justin Timberlake when I was 14, but he never responded.<eos> "Sexy back"?<eos> How about manners back?<eos> Luke is such a gentleman.<eos> You're going to have the best time.<eos> Ooh! Oh, remember how I've been working on origami?<eos> This is my new favorite.<eos> Do you think I should show Luke my goose?<eos> Well, I would.
Ashur?<eos> He must have been there that night, when your brother fell.<eos> Yet the villain moves only upon command of Gaius Claudius Glaber.<eos> Much has been lost.<eos> The ones we have loved.<eos> The ones we thought would forever be at our side.<eos> But in their passing, the chains that bound us to desires not our own have been struck.<eos> And without such a blow, we would not find ourselves in each other's arms.<eos> No.<eos> We would not.
I have a suspicion.<eos> That leaves us with an LR-ZK interactive proof system construction based on standard general assumptions.<eos> And we'll have to leave it at that, because I have someone here who wants to question me.<eos> Yep.<eos> Someone ghosted your laptop a few days ago.<eos> Here's the aftereffect. Good.<eos> Can you tell who did it?<eos> No, but I can tell you where it was done.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> I would.
We're not talking about a criminal here.<eos> We're talking about a... a hardworking man whose family was attacked, and he-he stood up for them.<eos> We should all be able to do that.<eos> No, we shouldn't.<eos> What Ortiz lost was replaceable.<eos> What Daelman lost is not.<eos> Well, given the circumstances, I'd make the same choice Ortiz did.<eos> Run after them and shoot? No.<eos> Mm-mmm.<eos> Neither would I.
I think I do, too.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> But why?<eos> Why can't you do the surgery?<eos> Uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing the... it.<eos> Uh, I mean, I can.<eos> I would.
Will you?<eos> I said I would.<eos> Then I imagine, if you do that, then the police are going to want to taito Ben.<eos> I know that, so...<eos> Are you sure this is something you want me to say now?<eos> If I give the police an excuse to blame this on our children, they might just do that.<eos> Why don't we just let this play itself out, see how it goes.<eos> Do you want Ben to go to prison for something he didn't do?<eos> He wouldn't last two minutes in prison.<eos> Oh, and Dylan would?
- Good question.<eos> Agents down the hall say they heard the screams.<eos> By the time they opened the door, they say it was on the floor, writhing in pain, and then it just died.<eos> On the case we worked before, he was working with a partner.<eos> He was infected too, but he didn't know it.<eos> Almost transformed a couple of days later.<eos> - Then we should find him.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been trying to think of his name, but I can't remember it.<eos> Olivia would, though.
A vacant home helps no one.<eos> We have a situation where people are in need of places to live and your banks, which hold title on hundreds of foreclosures, are in need of financial relief.<eos> Fair market value's off the table if we turn foreclosures into rentals.<eos> Fair market values mean nothing in this economy.<eos> Even if we agree to this, your monthly numbers are way too low.<eos> We're talking homes that are worth 300k and up.<eos> She wants you to help, wants you.<eos> Homes that currently get zero dollars per month while you wait for real estate to recover.<eos> Would a $500 a month subsidy for families make it easier for your banks to bite?<eos> It would, for a single year.
No.<eos> Your break is over!<eos> Yeah, she's a real charmer, isn't she?<eos> Maybe you should get a nicer boss.<eos> You know what? I would if I could.<eos> Hey, man, maybe you could help me out.<eos> Yeah, look, I don't know, man.<eos> It'd piss her off if I did, you know?<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
And then hating me all the more when they realise I have no use for their treasured rubbish.<eos> No more he and she for me.<eos> I owe it to myself to be fair to Christopher.<eos> He's up in Yorkshire again, seeing Michael.<eos> The move to Gray's Inn has been a success.<eos> He knows his stuff with furniture and pictures.<eos> He'll walk into a saleroom and sniff out what everybody else has missed.<eos> He just knows... everything!<eos> Of course, he wants to make me suffer.<eos> What man wouldn't?
He's a country-club member, he's got a society wife, and he loves to, you know, par-tay.<eos> Yeah, but setting up a play like that could take time.<eos> I'm way ahead of you.<eos> He's gonna be an at industry conference in Jacksonville.<eos> I'll head up there, get all buddy-buddy with him, take him out clubbing, snap a few racy photos -- he'll tell me about the gun.<eos> I'm not sure I could talk my way out of that one if the C.I.A. ever found out.<eos> Right.<eos> I said, "I," not "we."<eos> I'd be doing it alone.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I got him various toys, got him shots, got him groomed, and gave him plenty of exercise.<eos> He's healthier than ever.<eos> Wait, did his leg grow back?<eos> Aw, no, no.<eos> That's okay.<eos> - Andy, if I may--<eos> - Yes.<eos> Dogs tend to take on the personalities - of their owners-- - Mm-hmm.<eos> So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Now I'm gonna get the club to sign off on your cash, but I need Trager outside.<eos> Him knowing I saved his life gives me an internal advantage I'm gonna need.<eos> And when I'm done... you can send him out the same way you did his kid.<eos> 'Cause I really don't give a shit.<eos> There you go.<eos> Finding the hidden advantage in an unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Using pain to take you to the next level.<eos> Those are the things that turn players into kings.<eos> Yeah, I guess you would know.<eos> Yes, I would.
Your house.<eos> My?<eos> The people who bought your old house in Highland Park, they're upside down on it and very, very motivated.<eos> - No. - Well, that's what I thought.<eos> It is a little out of your range anyway.<eos> And weird.<eos> I mean, it would be weird.<eos> You had 15 happy years there.<eos> Why would it be weird?<eos> Because it would.
It's walking away money?<eos> If you want to call it that.<eos> That's it, then?<eos> One last job and we're finished, huh?<eos> I've always thought it was a good idea to quit while you're ahead.<eos> I think ten million qualifies as being ahead.<eos> This is the question.<eos> If you didn't take this break, would you still do the job?<eos> If I'm honest.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
That and the only other girl I really know at school is Amy.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Fine!<eos> I'll get out of here.<eos> I'm not some kind of hooker.<eos> I mean, I'm just naturally sexy which doesn't mean I have sex with every guy I go out with.<eos> It must be the blonde hair.<eos> You won't believe what that Ethan guy just asked me!<eos> Maybe I would.
"What are you rascals up to?"<eos> Theodore looks at Patrick, and Patrick looks at Theodore.<eos> And they both say,<eos> "We better scramble."<eos> - Who's next?<eos> - That's great.<eos> Margaret?<eos> I wouldn't dare follow that.<eos> I'd like to see what's up your sleeve.<eos> You would, would you?
Of course, she didn't know who he was, but I just happened to see you with him now.<eos> It's that obvious?<eos> I didn't mean for it to happen.<eos> I-I... didn't even like him at first.<eos> Look, I understand how attractions like this happen.<eos> But it's impossible.<eos> You know that.<eos> Fraternization between ranks isn't just inappropriate, it's illegal.<eos> You won't tell, will you?<eos> Of course not, but others would.
Meeting you.<eos> You're trying out car doors.<eos> You can see me watching you and you're still doing it.<eos> Why? I don't know.<eos> Habit?<eos> And what if one was open?<eos> You're your own worst enemy.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> I wouldn't have taken anything.<eos> Yes, you would.
I said I would, didn't I?<eos> I'm a citizen.<eos> I've got sisters.<eos> You're a good lad, Kyle.<eos> So when are you gonna stop the thieving?<eos> Ah, I dunno.<eos> I think I'm flawed.<eos> HE LAUGHS Hey, have you done it with her yet?<eos> See you later.<eos> I would!
It's where I raised my first family in.<eos> Really, it's still the only place I feel at home.<eos> Those are my memories, Mitchell.<eos> Clorera has the strength to clean up life's messes.<eos> May I?<eos> Hey, Kat, it's your old buddy, Cam Hicks.<eos> And I just wanted to say, for the record, thanks for saving my life today, but you are the most annoying person in the world to take a road trip with.<eos> Hey.<eos> What I said before, about if I could help you forget, I would?<eos> I wouldn't.
Don't even wanna tell me your side of the story?<eos> I just had a few quick questions.<eos> Jim's the one who's all "get out of here or I'll call the police".<eos> Wait, you went over there as a reporter, not as a friend?<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> Come on, what?<eos> Is this an election story?<eos> Something about Jim's campaign?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Of course I wouldn't.
Mackenzie-- line up any 10 people, eight of them will tell you she's the best EP in the business and the other two will be stupid!<eos> I'm one of the eight, but it's not gonna happen.<eos> - It's happened.<eos> - No.<eos> She's coming up from DC today with one of her people.<eos> No, listen to what I'm telling you-- I can't give my approval.<eos> The deal's a day away from being signed-- three years.<eos> I have approval over my executive producer.<eos> - You would think so, wouldn't you?<eos> - I would, yeah.
I really want to get that wedding going.<eos> I want a wedding.<eos> Absolutely. If that's what you want then that's what you'll have.<eos> When?<eos> The sooner the better.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Just needed to talk to someone.<eos> All right, let's go somewhere and talk.<eos> Want to get a bite to eat?<eos> Yeah, I would.
- Those were his words.<eos> I see no receipt for payment.<eos> We assert Mr. Kaswell pre-paid Mr. Rollins his rent in the form of a $34,000 judgment that Mr. Rollins' company owes him.<eos> Come on!<eos> The man's a trespasser!<eos> Simmer down.<eos> Ms. Kaswell, while I find EVK's actions contemptible, I can't justify calling Mr. Kaswell a tenant.<eos> One minute, Your Honor.<eos> We would like to amend Mr. Kaswell's motion.<eos> We would?
But...<eos> So are you not talking to Romi anymore?<eos> No, we have abandoned negative people in our lives.<eos> Romi is one of them.<eos> She has done shady things.<eos> Even last Dinah, what happened was, we were supposed to be friends at that time, and me and Whitney had gotten into a fight, but she knew how much I loved Whitney.<eos> Even if we weren't, like, perfect, you know.<eos> And she made out with her in the pool and looked right at me, and was like... you're on your own and... if she could push me off a cliff and nobody knew about it,<eos> - she would.<eos> - She would.
Look, can I say something?<eos> As your friend, don't do this.<eos> You'll get a reputation for being litigious.<eos> No one will ever hire you.<eos> No one will hire me now.<eos> There's nothing out there.<eos> It's really depressing.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> If I can get Merc to say yes... would you come back?<eos> Like he ever would!
The truth is, she wouldn't have a choice.<eos> But I spoke with her, too.<eos> You did?<eos> Just to play the good cop.<eos> You being--<eos> Me being the bad cop.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I've hired Mona Fredricks to replace Ezra Stone.<eos> I'd like you to stay on as well.<eos> You would?
And you better be 100% sure you kill her, 'cause Chaplin's got eyes now.<eos> And once the "Colorado's" tridents are airborne, there is not a thing in this world that stops them 'cause somebody kept my daddy from building star wars<eos> 20 years ago.<eos> So tell me exactly how you would take out that submarine?<eos> Linus.<eos> What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie.<eos> - Relax.<eos> I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.
But...?<eos> It's our opinion...<eos> Alden, you took her home.<eos> The sex-- at least the beginning of it-- was consensual.<eos> I think you need to let this one go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Would you say that to a woman?<eos> By starting to get physical, she loses the right to say "Stop"?<eos> You would never say that.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You're gonna have to jump through some hoops.<eos> And the new foreman is here.<eos> Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay?<eos> So I need you to show her your utmost respect.<eos> Make sure that she feels welcome and at home, okay?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - That's some pretty blatant complimenting you're doing there, man.<eos> I don't even talk to her like that.<eos> - Uh, Brandon?<eos> - I would.
Dr. Goran, you've done this procedure before?<eos> Yes.<eos> - And it worked?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And in your opinion, it will work again?<eos> I have no reason to think that it won't.<eos> This is what she does.<eos> You see, she browbeats.<eos> Dr. Goran, so what you're saying is if it was you, you'd have the surgery?<eos> Yes, I would.
Till they finish that new highway, we're the last gas till Staten Island.<eos> What's he got in there?<eos> - The truck?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I... fish?<eos> Says fish.<eos> Could be something else.<eos> That come off the ocean, right?<eos> I wouldn't have a clue about that.<eos> Who would?
The one you really loved.<eos> Well, look, uh... if you ever, you know... feel the need to talk, uh...<eos> I've heard there are people that do that sort of thing.<eos> Off you go, now.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> We sue the DA's Office for slander, defamation of character, and we also go after Odom personally.<eos> He's the handling DA.<eos> He'd have qualified immunity.<eos> We can't.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
You know, everything was really, really good, and I had a couple of notes, but they were small.<eos> Well, thank you for coming.<eos> Means a lot to me.<eos> Believe me, the whole time I was directing it, I was basically thinking, what would Rachel do?<eos> You're kind of my moose.<eos> It's... it's "muse."<eos> I know.<eos> Just wanted to see you smile.<eos> Will you tell me what you're so upset about?<eos> I'd rather not.
Anything beats having Georgina watch me sleep.<eos> I'm just grateful for a place to crash.<eos> Well, as your roommate and publisher, I am pleased to report that "The Spectator"<eos> is finally ready to post its very first Humphrey original.<eos> (Chuckles) Hey, it's a good day, and it's only 9:00 a.m.<eos> Before I publish, would you wanna warn the subject of this week's serial?<eos> You know, let 'em know that they're about to be totally skewered?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, yeah, no.<eos> No, I'd rather not.
Now take your quack and get.<eos> Well, at least we proved he's beyond eccentric.<eos> - Statement of support. Do it fast.<eos> - You knew this was happening?<eos> Statement of support.<eos> (Beep) Is there a stakeout set up?<eos> There's one in the crypt.<eos> Why? Senator Davis, what's your response to the majority leader stepping down?<eos> Should senator Schumann resign his seat?<eos> - I would.
Leave him out of it.<eos> Why would I do that, Bruce?<eos> We're all family here, aren't we?<eos> I mean, I trusted you.<eos> That is, until you shot your big mouth off about me to your pals.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You wanted privacy; I gave it to you.<eos> I didn't even know who you really were until today.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Bruce.<eos> I really would.
All you have to do is read three pages.<eos> Just read three pages in the next hour and... if you don't want to keep reading, I'll give you back the advance.<eos> OK.<eos> - OK, Eddie.<eos> - OK.<eos> Eddie, give me a call when you get in.<eos> Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.<eos> It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.<eos> OK, how did you do this?<eos> I 'd really like...
Now I need to get on with mine.<eos> Gina.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's more than I need.<eos> It's less than you deserve.<eos> For everything you've been through.<eos> Go on, take it.<eos> What if she told them where you were going?<eos> Liz?<eos> She wouldn't.
I know that you have issues with your dad, and that's cool, but he really likes you and he definitely likes me, and we were just jamming ideas and goofing around and tripping our balls off.<eos> Hey. So... I really feel like it needs to be more ghetto.<eos> You know, like, more crunk?<eos> Can you work it out?<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Nice moves.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know you were trying really hard out there, but it just didn't work.<eos> Hey, would you ever?
If they're not gonna pay for them, somebody's gonna have to pay the price.<eos> I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch, never touch me like that again.<eos> -Let go of my balls.<eos> -Shut up.<eos> Muffins are on me. I quit.<eos> Put some honey butter on them muffins. They'll taste an awful lot better that way.<eos> Oh! Motherfuck!<eos> Now, that's not so bad.<eos> I can fix that if you'd like.<eos> I would.
Palmer met some tennis player her own age on the plane ride home, who's an even bigger fan of 'N Sync.<eos> And Maggie's about to start a three-week acting class with the actual Dolph Lundgren.<eos> And what happened for me?<eos> Well, I'm finally wearing my wedding ring for real.<eos> And now when women ask me about it, I'm gonna tell them I'm married to a woman who doesn't beat me, doesn't cheat on me, doesn't drink...<eos> Well, doesn't drink that much.<eos> And who I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.<eos> A woman named Katherine.<eos> Would you like to dance with your wife, Doctor Maccabee?<eos> Yes, I would, Mrs. Maccabee.
What do we do now?<eos> Get married?<eos> No, you'd better not answer that.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> So it's like we're both involved.<eos> So it's mutual.<eos> You don't believe in taking things slowly, do you?<eos> Imagine I'm going to die in two days and I ask you to spend them with me, both going all out.<eos> would you do it?<eos> Of course I would.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I-I ju...<eos> I...<eos> You know, I was scared.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of you.<eos> You know, I thought you would kick me out 'cause you didn't want to be with a guy without a job.<eos> I don't.<eos> Who would?
All right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I just love this baby so much already.<eos> Me, too.<eos> But the baby is fine.<eos> Will you please tell your mama, "Don't worry"?<eos> You realize that's pointless advice to give a mother, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> wouldn't you hate it if we didn't reassure you?<eos> Yes, I would.
He's got no big-screen flat plasma TV.<eos> Computer's configured for Arabic.<eos> No beer.<eos> No funky week-old clothes in the corner.<eos> No pizza boxes.<eos> This is very un-American.<eos> Felix Attino.<eos> Columbian.<eos> That explains why he's un-American, but not why he speaks Arabic.<eos> This would.
What do you mean "a show"?<eos> Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.<eos> Like, to music?<eos> I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.<eos> So you'd do a striptease?<eos> I wasn't swinging around a pole.<eos> Good, good.<eos> There was one time I put body glitter on.<eos> Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
I've been waiting all year for a cousin Carter.<eos> Chance.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> We'll get him back.<eos> Sorry about the landing.<eos> We had a pressurization problem on the descent.<eos> Where is Maria Gallego?<eos> Oh, yeah, uh...<eos> I'm hoping that you're going to honor our agreement.<eos> My cousin Carter would.
So I'm the guy you call when you think your mother's gonna have a shit fit?<eos> Otherwise you don't want anything to do with me?<eos> I just thought you'd understand.<eos> - You have tattoos.<eos> Mom has tattoos.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> What is the point, then?<eos> These are my friends.<eos> They wanted me to do it. Yeah? And if your friends wanted you to do drugs, would you do that?<eos> Of course I would.
What's all this, then, Stu?<eos> I'm making my move.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - This is it. That's your move? The old "fake yawn, surreptitious grope" combo?<eos> - It's a classic.<eos> - It's a clam, Stu.<eos> Next thing I know, you'll be sticking your dick through the bottom of that tub of popcorn, - Diner-style.<eos> - Would that have worked?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know, Stu?<eos> Actually, I would.
- Is this yours?<eos> - I'm pregnant, George.<eos> How messed up are we, when my story can be seen as inspirational?<eos> You're going to be killed by a werewolf.<eos> A wolf-shaped bullet.<eos> Bang! - Would you like to have a baby?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Grab some dinner. Then back to bed.<eos> You know your way out, right?<eos> Paige?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> You have every reason to hate me.<eos> I don't even know why I'm here.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I would.
You are so much more.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't do this, Emma.<eos> I want to, I do.<eos> I want this. You have no idea how much I want this, but...<eos> I'm not mad at Lux for not telling me.<eos> I'm mad because she did.<eos> I would give anything to unknow this.<eos> If I could go back and be like my mom, happy and oblivious.<eos> Because I would...
Whatever it is, hitting the kill screen accidentally exposed it.<eos> And Snyder killed to keep it a secret.<eos> What is he doing now?<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You kill the zombie...<eos> And then you kill their brains.<eos> Wouldn't hypovolemic shock render the second step unnecessary?<eos> 'Cause when you shoot a zombie in the head, sometimes the brains sneak out through the hole, and then you have to kill that separately.<eos> I see. I think. Mm-hmm.<eos> Or maybe I'd rather not.
So they cast a spell on the dead bird and it flew.<eos> For a couple of seconds, at most.<eos> But it was spectacular.<eos> Your work for me in that circle is done.<eos> It's no longer safe for you there.<eos> What are you going to do to them?<eos> What I have already told you will have to suffice.<eos> Any more and I'll just have to glamour it out of you.<eos> Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Of course not.<eos> Because those dead fuckers are hardcore.<eos> They will kill you and not blink an eye.<eos> Even we're no match for 'em.<eos> Yo, speak for yourself.<eos> Yo, don't be a fuckin' moron!<eos> Dumb ass.<eos> You don't think a vampire wouldn't rip you to pieces in a heartbeat?<eos> I'd fuckin' put up a fight at least.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
All they can do is go to court, have you declared bankrupt... take over.<eos> The court will appoint receivers. You'll be out.<eos> Fine!<eos> Then I'm out.<eos> You'll be out, and Ida'll be in.<eos> Who?<eos> Ida?<eos> That's a lie.<eos> She would never do it, never.<eos> Oh, yeah, she would.
We're very touched by how generous you're being.<eos> We realize how you're trying to smooth things out here instead of making them worse.<eos> Please.<eos> It's the least we can do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, come on.<eos> I mean, so many parents just take their kid's side acting like children themselves.<eos> If Ethan had broken two of Zachary's teeth Alan and I might have had more of a knee-jerk reaction.<eos> I'm not sure we would see the big picture.<eos> Sure you would.
There'll be things to do. Things to get on with.<eos> Give me that gun.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I'm not letting you go anywhere with that gun!<eos> You will do as I have ordered!<eos> And you have another flashback?<eos> That was an accident.<eos> You tell that to the next Danny Ferris...<eos> Wouldn't this be better?<eos> Yeah, it would.
- You know why?<eos> It has an ingredient my cakes have never had before...<eos> Danger.<eos> I know!<eos> Sneaking around makes everything taste better.<eos> When I was with John Rowland, every sense was heightened, it was like this...<eos> Skip it.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Wouldn't I?
To welcome your wife to Midsomer.<eos> How lovely.<eos> Sarah, this is Jones.<eos> Jones, my wife.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Sarah, please.<eos> And I'm sure you weren't christened Jones.<eos> Ben. Thank you, Ben.<eos> Would you like a coffee?<eos> No, he wouldn't.
- It's complicated.<eos> It's not complicated, you just have to do it.<eos> I came out to mine on Mother's Day.<eos> - How old were you?<eos> - Sixteen.<eos> - Did they freak out?<eos> - No.<eos> I told them nature or nurture, it's your fault, so get over it.<eos> Good answer.<eos> - I would, but...
(Electronic whirring)<eos> (Electronic whooshing)<eos> (Whirs)<eos> Mom, I'm fine.<eos> You could have been seriously hurt.<eos> We wanted to take all precautions, leave nothing to chance.<eos> Thank you for letting him up on the ship.<eos> Every being in the universe understands a mother's pain when her child suffers.<eos> You would have done the same for my children.<eos> I would.
It's easy.<eos> Live, Annie.<eos> Seize the day.<eos> I will.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's gone.<eos> Sorry.<eos> George.<eos> Would you like to have... a little... hairy baby with me?<eos> Yes, I would.
That's not his style either.<eos> We have to tell him.<eos> We've told him all we can.<eos> We can't even tell him we've seen his future self.<eos> He's interacted with his own past.<eos> It could rip a hole in the universe.<eos> Except he's done it before.<eos> In fairness, the universe did blow up.<eos> But he'd want to know.<eos> Would he?
What about Maggie?<eos> She wants to earn her citizenship in the 2nd Mass by being a fighter.<eos> Should've taken me up on my offer.<eos> And join your tattered remnants?<eos> I'll take a rest for a little while.<eos> Being the leader of a post-apocalyptic gang of outlaws has been exhausting.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming today with Hal.<eos> You'd do it for me.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Good for you.<eos> Feel free to high-five Mr Khan on my behalf.<eos> Is it me, or was she just attempting humour?<eos> Where's Alison?<eos> She's still in ITU.<eos> Why?<eos> There's a problem.<eos> She went off this morning, and a crash team was called.<eos> They intubated and ventilated her.<eos> They would.
Well, Celine's not like your sister!<eos> Celine's fine.<eos> - All right. - I'm taking her out tonight.<eos> Right, well, I'm off.<eos> - Just want to talk to your dad.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm his son.<eos> If he talk, he'd talk to me.<eos> - Would he?<eos> - Of course he would.
It's really important to us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've never even heard of most of the stuff that's on your list.<eos> Can I go to my room?<eos> We're... we're not angry with you.<eos> We just wanted to have a little talk.<eos> That's all.<eos> I really want to go to my room.<eos> Would anyone care for some more wine?<eos> Oh, I would.
I hope you and Duane are okay.<eos> Stay off the road.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> I don't know, just-- just be safe.<eos> Maybe we'll see you in Fort Benning someday.<eos> Rick signing off.<eos> Just thinking about our trip to the Grand Canyon with Carl.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Pamela Stewart.<eos> Sit down!<eos> What are you, then? You're not brother and sister.<eos> Not husband and wife.<eos> Just having it off now and then with Freddy Krueger?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Pamela Stewart.<eos> You haven't got a son called Alan Stewart, have you?<eos> What do you know about it? He's the one who grassed up pizza face.<eos> He'd never. No?
I'll meet you in stall three.<eos> Istill kind of think it's Barney.<eos> There's no way it's Barney.<eos> Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen.<eos> I am Dr. Stangel.<eos> It's Barney.<eos> Wow. Really, dude, bravo.<eos> You almost got a peek.<eos> But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?<eos> Would you...?
I haven't got all night.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Manny is taking a nap on the deck.<eos> Oh, well, maybe I need to, uh, wake him up and have a little talk with him.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, it occurred to me that you might be tempted to tell someone about my little business venture.<eos> Oh, you mean your Ponzi scheme?<eos> Knock it off, Rose.<eos> Unless you want me to tell your husband that you're having an affair with my brother.<eos> You wouldn't.
"Yes, I am."<eos> Yes, the Zoe the cat is a cat, but that doesn't make her a bad person.<eos> I need your help.<eos> How can we persuade the audience to elect me Pope without them noticing that we've done it?<eos> That's odd.<eos> That's wrong.<eos> My hand is not that liver-spotted!<eos> I'm having that.<eos> You wouldn't wear such cheap cassocks either.<eos> No, I wouldn't either.
Obviously, I had the feeling the evening hadn't gone well.<eos> Your wife made a statement saying that you'd talked about killing Faso.<eos> She was just trying to get a better deal on the divorce.<eos> Believe me, Detective, I've nothing to hide.<eos> I've opened my heart to God, and I'll open it to you.<eos> I took the money, I took the drugs, I took the women.<eos> I booked the hookers, I paid the bribes.<eos> There was no wickedness, none, that I wasn't party to.<eos> So, if I'd killed Oscar, I would tell you.<eos> Would you?
How are you?<eos> Not cool.<eos> Not classy at all. - Hello.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'm fine. - It's a nice day, for a Sunday.<eos> - It's Saturday.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> Would you like to have coffee?<eos> Because... I would.
Can't apologise without words.<eos> Can't sleep without a bed, neither.<eos> KNOCK ON DOOR/DOOR OPENS Ma'am, are my eyes being silly again?<eos> Only I just seen Twister coming up the stairs.<eos> You may as well have my bed, Twister.<eos> I shall work through the night. Uh... Oh.<eos> Miss Lane, I beg you, don't throw him out.<eos> He has nowhere else to go.<eos> Miss Lane wouldn't turn a poor fellow out into the night.<eos> Indeed, I would not, Mr Turrill.
You don't know anything.<eos> You'd just be repeating gossip.<eos> Violet Slater's husband heard him bragging in the pub.<eos> Gossip.<eos> Do you want to destroy your son's marriage?<eos> I'm not the one in the wrong.<eos> You will be if you tell Paul.<eos> Wouldn't you want to know?<eos> In his situation?<eos> Wouldn't you?
He says you may have damaged your spine.<eos> How long will it take to repair?<eos> We can't expect them to put timings on that sort of thing.<eos> But he did say it would get better?<eos> He says the first task is to rebuild your health, and that's what we have to concentrate on.<eos> I see.<eos> And he says there was no reason why you should not have a perfectly full and normal life.<eos> Just not a very mobile one.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> I would.
Well, excuse me.<eos> I don't treat mixed breeds or four-legged creatures<eos> - or anything else -- - that's alive.<eos> Yeah, I forgot.<eos> Okay, knock it off, you two.<eos> Get the salad.<eos> Would you like me to reimburse you for misdiagnosing your dog?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I would, actually.
I stopped by the recruiting office the day he came to town.<eos> Made sure he knew what he did.<eos> That make you feel better?<eos> Feel better about losing a child?<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But killing Doug -- that would have made you feel better.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> But it wouldn't bring back my son, now, would it?<eos> No, sir, it wouldn't.
I'm gonna leave before he does anything truly embarrassing.<eos> Ha, too late.<eos> Agh!<eos> - Pick it up.<eos> - Suck it!<eos> Get out!<eos> Suck home plate!<eos> Suck it!<eos> Want the last bite of my creamsicle?<eos> Yes, I would actually.
'I used to hear her screaming for someone to take it away.'<eos> 'Where were your parents?<eos> ' 'My dad was next to useless.<eos> 'My mum was... 'impotent, like me.'<eos> 'Except you weren't, though, were you? '<eos> 'She wanted to be free of it.' 'Would you do it again?<eos> ' 'I thought she was better off dead.' 'Yes, I realise that.<eos> 'What I'm asking is, would you do it again?<eos> ' 'Yeah, I'd do it again.<eos> Course I would.
You can and you will.<eos> You have to.<eos> And you have to take a bath.<eos> I stink, don't I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm afraid he's going to leave me.<eos> Ben.<eos> I keep telling everyone he won't, but...<eos> But I'm afraid he will, and I wouldn't blame him.<eos> I would.
BMW only bringing 450 1Ms to Britain, 300 of them already sold.<eos> OK, hard on the brakes, penultimate corner, still very greasy out there.<eos> Into Gambon and there he is across the line.<eos> I have the time here.<eos> It did it in 1 minute 25 dead so, even though it was a damp track, it was faster than an M3.<eos> Very good, but hang on, because I think there was a bit of film there we didn't see.<eos> No, there wasn't.<eos> There was, from the final run.<eos> I think the audience would like to see it.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Even Adrianna offered to help!<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> When did you talk to Adrianna?<eos> She was at Dixon's when I went looking for help.<eos> Ade didn't blow it off.<eos> No, at least she cares.<eos> Ever since my sister's been missing, you've been acting like it's no big deal.<eos> Maybe you'd get it if your family was ever around.<eos> Yeah, maybe I would.
"Donna, by the way, those are really nice shoes that Louis has on"?<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> We're on the same side.<eos> And although I would not choose to have you both on this, that is how it fell.<eos> So I expect you to put your differences aside and work together on this so that everyone can be happy.<eos> Can you manage that this time?<eos> She's always hated me.<eos> Maybe this is a chance to put all that behind you.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Really, I would.
If you love me, you won't make me do this.<eos> And if you love me...<eos> I'm a terrible dancer.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You're a wonderful man.<eos> You promised we'd just stay an hour.<eos> Uh-huh. Unless you're having a really good time.<eos> It's the best time I've ever had, except for maybe every single night we've been in bed together.<eos> I don't think I'd count band camp.<eos> I would.
Maybe we wait.<eos> - We wait?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can't force you into anything.<eos> Just know this:<eos> You are more than what he allows you to be.<eos> More than just some affirmative action spic who brown-nosed his way into the council chamber.<eos> You are right at the head of the fastest-growing immigrant population in the state, not to mention the country.<eos> Now that's something he should acknowledge with more respect.<eos> I would.
Everything okay here?<eos> If you consider larceny okay.<eos> Mrs. Delfino, on behalf of Fairview market, I'd like to apologize for Kevin.<eos> Seems we're all paying the price for his rejection from the police academy.<eos> Oh, well, excuse me for not wanting to live in a world where people can commit crimes without suffering the consequences.<eos> You are a criminal.<eos> I've known Mrs. Delfino for years.<eos> She pays for the grapes she eats in the produce section.<eos> She would never do anything bad.<eos> Sure, I would.
You know that guy that we were talking about?<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, I just want to throw in my two cents and say that I'm sure you're on his radar.<eos> I mean, he'd be lucky-- well, I--I mean, anyone would be lucky to be with you.<eos> Well, thank you for the pity party.<eos> But I think I'll live.<eos> The T-shirts say so.<eos> No, um, seriously.<eos> I'll bet you anything if this guy didn't have a girlfriend that he'd be all over you.<eos> - Would he now?
But I picked all my classes.<eos> I bought t-shirts.<eos> I-I had it all planned.<eos> How could Stanford think she's not worthy?<eos> She's perfect.<eos> Last week you didn't want her to go.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't not want her to get in.<eos> I was sure she would get in.<eos> You got in.<eos> Well, I wouldn't now.
Listen, um, that database you're coding, we're gonna need it a little faster, okay?<eos> You- - You got to keep up.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see what I can do, Dave.<eos> Not exactly what I expected.<eos> Software engineer of the month.<eos> That's very impressive.<eos> But it doesn't quite explain the private security, the unlimited funds.<eos> No.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
No, no, I--no, I don't think he knew that name.<eos> No, I-I--<eos> How much money have you paid him since your husband died?<eos> And how much more will you give him now that he can sense your son?<eos> And then if Connor dies and Glass can contact his spirit, what won't you give?<eos> Hey, don't say that.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> You're sick.<eos> Nate would never do that.<eos> Of course he would.

(Jamie) Good.<eos> Was starting to worry.<eos> Hold still.<eos> Maggie never liked these much.<eos> White sheets, that's all she'd ever buy.<eos> Said it made her life feel clean.<eos> It's amazing what you do for someone you love.<eos> Get rid of your sheets... car... your past.<eos> I would have done anything for her.<eos> I still would.
Used to?<eos> - Roddy...<eos> - So now you're with Carter?<eos> - I can't do this.<eos> - You still love me.<eos> I can't keep sneaking out to be with you.<eos> And if you didn't put the rats in his car, then who did?<eos> Your boyfriend.<eos> He would not do that.<eos> Yeah, he would.
We've been following the investigation.<eos> Jim's been good enough to keep us up-to-date with the others.<eos> All those girls.<eos> I can't believe that nobody's been able to catch up with this monster.<eos> We will, soon.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now don't lose hope.<eos> Molly wouldn't want that, now, would she?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Previously on "Harry's Law"...<eos> My father and I really appreciate your efforts.<eos> I adore you. Don't get me wrong, I do.<eos> But I want to be able to see and feel a future in a relationship.<eos> - Take it outside?<eos> - Wait.<eos> Are you two sleeping together?<eos> - He'd like to.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.

Yeah! To the freakin' weekend!<eos> Oh, ho. Somebody's having fun, right?<eos> Yeah, somebody likes to show up at detective rackets and drink all our booze, even though he's never been a detective.<eos> Never will be either.<eos> Couldn't be if he wanted to.<eos> Deputy Chief of Patrol Costello.<eos> Yeah, well, you want me to bum-rush him out of here, man?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> You ever wanna haul off and punch him in the face?<eos> - I would.
No.<eos> It is.<eos> Come on, you said yourself, you'd leave love to others: For you, it's a disaster.<eos> But that doesn't mean you should run around talking shit about me.<eos> What about you?<eos> You were watching her.<eos> She was really mad.<eos> Because you had to turn around and tell her about it!<eos> She would've found out anyway.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
First two seasons ...<eos> No, three seasons I was here, I was walking in the same direction, trying to reach the edge of the preserve.<eos> Let me tell you something, there ain't no edge of the preserve.<eos> Maybe you and your friend wanna tell me about that ship?<eos> Let's see.<eos> That's a brilliant idea.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> The whole time I've been here, it never occurred to me ... to commandeer the alien spacecraft.<eos> But I wouldn't know how to fly it.<eos> He would.
Her name's Asiram.<eos> She'll be at the head of our vessel.<eos> Indeed she is!<eos> Oh!<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> - Right.<eos> I used to be in the Girl Guides.<eos> - Were you indeed?<eos> - Mmm. Then you would know that the bowline is the best knot for mooring.<eos> I would.
The opposite sex has no sense whatever when it comes to their limits.<eos> They must be constantly watched, least they harm themselves in the simple act of being men.<eos> Wait.<eos> Domina.<eos> How did you fare with Spartacus last night?<eos> Was his cock of impressive size when engorged?<eos> How many times did he have you?<eos> Speak.<eos> He would not have me.<eos> He would not?
No, of course not.<eos> Um, excuse me.<eos> Any idea what caused him to fall?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> Well...goodbye.<eos> Ah...<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> You might have told me she was Lady Raeburn.<eos> It didn't seem important.<eos> No, it wouldn't to you.
Is Mrs Crompton OK?<eos> She's not ill.<eos> I am her GP, but a friend more.<eos> Ella Ransome.<eos> Inspector Lewis, Oxfordshire Police.<eos> Sergeant Hathaway.<eos> Doctor. Isobel said... ..she said you think Andrew was murdered.<eos> ..she said you think Andrew was murdered. Would that surprise you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, yes, of course it would.
Running for office?<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Honey, believe me, I'm as surprised as you are.<eos> And I'm struggling with this, But someone has to defend the principle.<eos> Someone has to fight back.<eos> Dad, you're a polygamist.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that, sweetheart.<eos> You can't run.<eos> You'd be exposed.<eos> We all would.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.<eos> That's not right.<eos> Queen Wallis of Baltimore?<eos> Unthinkable.<eos> Can he do that?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> But he's going to anyway.<eos> All hell's broken loose.<eos> - Can't they carry on privately?<eos> - If only they would.
It's a lovely day for it<eos> Is it?<eos> Did you find anything useful?<eos> It depends on one's needs<eos> I'm looking for something pretty specific<eos> Fifteen years ago I was in a bar in Marseille A Chinaman ... a cargoboat skipper was saying he lost a fortune<eos> A container of Star Wars figures. But no ordinary Star Wars figures faulty Darth Vaders - made brown like Ben Kenobi instead of black.<eos> Unique.<eos> Collectable<eos> But he'd lost'em in the storm
A new king has been crowned.<eos> King Stephen, yes.<eos> Opposed to him is Maud, King Henry's daughter.<eos> A woman cannot take the throne.<eos> Maud, supported by Gloucester and Earl Bartholomew, is secretly raising an army against Stephen to regain the throne.<eos> Stephen must know of their treachery.<eos> But if word came from me, Gloucester would have me hanged.<eos> You're asking me to do this?<eos> I'd never get an audience.<eos> Your bishop would.
Carl!<eos> He's not here.<eos> What?<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know, he's your murdering fugitive.<eos> If you want to keep him, you've got to look after him.<eos> What is it with me and volatile unsuitable men?<eos> Be honest with me, am I Ulrika Jonsson?<eos> And thank you, for not saying "I told you so. "<eos> As if I would.
You know, it's one thing, not being as good a businessman as my dad, but I thought that if I ever had a kid... like...<eos> Maybe that's why I just like being Lux's friend.<eos> Because I'm afraid that if I... that if I'm a dad... I'll be him.<eos> You don't have to be your dad.<eos> You just have to be a dad.<eos> I mean, the bond that you have with Lux already?<eos> - Most people would kill for that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> I would.
It's nothing for you to worry about.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> E.K.G. Tech to 3-1-5. Thanks.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why... why are they after you?<eos> What... what did you do?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Yes. It that who she's...<eos> What is it, mr. Leake?<eos> She ran up over $100 texting last month.<eos> And, we, um, we grounded her and we took away her cell.<eos> Not we.<eos> Me.<eos> I did that.<eos> Why didn't you tell me she had a boyfriend?<eos> Because you would have freaked out.<eos> No, i wouldn't.
In high school, this was Lucas' bedroom.<eos> Mm. Now that that's burned into my brain, how we, uh, doing on the wardrobe choices for scene 23?<eos> The big love scene... slinky off-the-shoulder, tight-and-revealing.<eos> Nice.<eos> I knew hiring you as costume designer was the right move.<eos> Let me see them on her before I make a decision.<eos> So... speaking of high school memories,<eos> Haley and Quinn organized that fundraiser dance at Tree Hill high tonight.<eos> And I just wanted to tell you in case you were thinking it'd be weird to go.<eos> Not that you would.
Ben, come on.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Good looking pant.<eos> Not the right cut for you, though.<eos> I think they look good.<eos> They're exactly what you wanted.<eos> Yes, because I'm a fucking moron.<eos> No, you're just a little insane, 'cause you hate everything you ever done.<eos> No real guy would wear these.<eos> - I would.
He's already dumped the phone.<eos> Doesn't it bother you, working for spics?<eos> See, the spics we got here -- they're mostly wetbacks with no papers.<eos> They pick lettuce all day, live like 30-deep in some rat-piss apartment or else, like, you know, homemade tents out by the highway.<eos> Point is, they ain't running shit.<eos> No.<eos> "No" what?<eos> No, it doesn't bother me.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, well, it would me.
It is hard to be a single man out there.<eos> No, it is so much harder to be a single woman.<eos> So much harder.<eos> You guys read "cathy"?<eos> Look, when it comes to sex, women are the gatekeepers.<eos> That's why it's easier for you.<eos> You get to decide when and if it's happening.<eos> And in fact, if you were to call a total stranger, Ask him to have sex, he will say yes.<eos> Please.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
You want to protect her, and the best that you can hope for Is that someday a nice man will come And take her from you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey, sue, I need you in the writer's room.<eos> [tearfully] I knew this day would come.<eos> I just didn't think it would be so soon.<eos> You take good care of her.<eos> I don't know if I can go through this With a real daughter.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> I know that was hard, but I bet You wouldn't give up this week With miss laroche vanderhoot for anything.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
How many times have I heard you say, "If we could get out of Lark Rise?"<eos> Now is our chance.<eos> My husband is the best stonemason for miles around.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Your own yard.<eos> You could do the kind of work you love.<eos> Not mending walls just to earn a shilling.<eos> Wouldn't you like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
That the marionettes are not kind to latecomers.<eos> They bend over and show their bloomers.<eos> Okay, I speak a little spanish.<eos> ¿señor, te gustaría hacer el agua<eos> Y tenemos nuestra cama?<eos> Gracias.<eos> What was that?<eos> I just asked him if he wanted to have a glass of water<eos> And sit down for a minute,<eos> Like any kind person would.
Are you saying he doesn't deserve this?<eos> Look, it doesn't matter if he deserves this or not.<eos> You're not gonna get anywhere near him.<eos> You think he's gonna let you come up next to him with that?<eos> I thought he'd be sleeping.<eos> If you do this, you will get hurt.<eos> I can still smell him on me.<eos> And we will get hurt coming after you.<eos> - No-one would come after me.<eos> - I would.

Yes, you do.<eos> I know you do.<eos> I don't really care.<eos> No, you're just smart enough and you're just clever enough to occasionally amuse me.<eos> If I had anybody else- anybody else to choose from- - I would.<eos> You are the best of a bad situation.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> I use you, man.<eos> Yeah, I would know if you were using me.<eos> Oh, oh, you would?
You know, the reason that you're mad that Baze and I are together isn't because you're worried about Lux, or you're afraid that we're gonna ruin your stupid wedding.<eos> It's because you're afraid you're gonna ruin your wedding because you have feelings for Baze, and you don't want Ryan to know it.<eos> Okay, Abby, enough with the therapy talk.<eos> You got your license, like, online.<eos> One class!<eos> You're rushing to marry Ryan, but the second Baze says he likes you, you freak out.<eos> If you didn't have feelings for Baze, it wouldn't matter to you.<eos> He just told you that he has feelings for you.<eos> The least you can do is appreciate it for one second.<eos> I would.
You know I got gigs on the weekends, what gigs there are. Go see 'em during the week.<eos> They miss you, especially with me comin' down here all the time, both of us gone.<eos> I miss them too.<eos> I miss our routine.<eos> I'm just sayin'.<eos> - Yeah, I know you just sayin'.<eos> - You know we could...<eos> Well, he up there, you down here.<eos> Who would know?<eos> I would, baby.
Minnie, perhaps you are right.<eos> Laura...<eos> What does it feel like to fall in love?<eos> Well, it feels... taken over... in a way that's so wonderfully aching and unsettling...<eos> I didn't know I was in love until you asked me.<eos> If I was in love with Daniel, and I in't saying I am cos I in't...<eos> But if I was, and if he came all the way to Candleford just to see me, I would tell him I loved him.<eos> Would you tell him, Laura?<eos> Yes...<eos> - I would. - Oh!
Oh, no, here we go.<eos> It's really cold.<eos> Have you got any warm clothing? What does it matter if we're cold?<eos> We have to know what she is up to.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> There should be some stuff down there, have a look.<eos> I want the other life.<eos> You know, where we're happy and settled and about to have a baby.<eos> But don't you wonder, if that life is real, then why would we give up all this?<eos> - Why would anyone?
You took my clothes.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - You took my clothes.<eos> Well, now I laundered your clothes.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> That's an odd combination, when you think about it.<eos> I mean, if you think about it.<eos> Milk... One sugar, right?<eos> No. No, and why would you know how I take my coffee?<eos> I wouldn't.
I'm sure you could tell me, for example, what was the gift you gave your sister Jennsen last year when you were trying to earn her trust?<eos> A kitten.<eos> And unless you want to share that poor creature's unfortunate fate, you will hand me the scroll right now.<eos> Hm.<eos> How very interesting.<eos> You may be on your way now, Sister.<eos> Sisters!<eos> You will of course want refreshment, My Lord.<eos> And company.<eos> Yes, I would.
You know, a lot of people said, "What, he's conducting wars."<eos> I agree.<eos> But also, he's made this outreach to the Muslim world which I love.<eos> 'Cause I don't want a million or billion people being pissed at me for any reason.<eos> You know, that is the one area where we have to lower tensions and there are a few signs that things might be getting better.<eos> I read in the paper the other day that for the first time, Saudi Arabia had a fashion show.<eos> Their top designer, Muslim Dior... is on a world tour with his spring line and they just happened to be in Raleigh, North Carolina tonight.<eos> And I asked some of the models if they would come over.<eos> Would you like to see the...<eos> You would?
Told you she'd say that.<eos> Good idea, though, shooting video at the crime scene.<eos> - Arsonists love to watch their handiwork.<eos> Problem is... Mikey's not watching.<eos> He's got his eyes closed.<eos> - He's having a private moment.<eos> - He's getting off.<eos> - I light a couple of candles if I want to get in the mood...<eos> I don't torch my house.<eos> But a pyrophiliac would.
The tumor has compromised the organs to the point - where anything we do to remove it...<eos> - Will kill me.<eos> Audrey, you're not even listening to them.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> I just want one more month.<eos> I'm not gonna risk dying before that.<eos> One more month?<eos> Our daughter is getting married, in a month.<eos> And I would like to see her do that.<eos> I would...
Oh, um, he is one of our new test models.<eos> I'm the one who hires the models. Oh! Oh, that's weird.<eos> That's a total mystery.<eos> Maybe one of those things we'll never know, like what water's made of, or who invented canned potato chips.<eos> No, really. Did Wilhelmina hire him? No.<eos> I want you.<eos> Now.<eos> And far from this location.<eos> But, no, wait. Okay, so that only leaves my mother.<eos> Why would my...
You will have your turn.<eos> I am expected to undertake extra duties.<eos> Saturday evenings, I am required to be here in the post office, when there is not a shop in the town, not an employer.<eos> - The inn, the constable, the hotel.<eos> - Miss Lane, please.<eos> Thomas, what is it that you want?<eos> An eight-hour day.<eos> Recognition that I and my fellow workers are not at Miss Lane's beck and call when she chooses to say we are available and must work.<eos> Miss Lane, would you like to respond to Thomas's grievances?<eos> I would.
Masked riders on horseback with pointy hoods? - Hello?<eos> - The parades were beautiful.<eos> The floats, the flambeaux--<eos> Black men carrying flaming propane torches And scrambling for change tossed in the street.<eos> It had its antebellum aspects, I'll admit.<eos> - That's part of carnival.<eos> - I hate the flambeaux and the hooded masked riders.<eos> I wished they'd do away with all that.<eos> I wouldn't miss the old line carnival stuff at all.<eos> - I would.
You okay with this, right?<eos> Just think of it like it's the same thing as always.<eos> You're just delivering some hamburgers.<eos> It's not just delivering hamburgers.<eos> Hey. You got a kid, right?<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - Patrick.<eos> All right, imagine these two guys had Patrick working as a mule. Making him kill people.<eos> Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid?<eos> Of course, I would.
I don't know.<eos> You're so beautiful and young.<eos> Anna and I never had A romantic relationship.<eos> But you love her.<eos> For lots of reasons...<eos> And in a very different way.<eos> I have to tell you something<eos> And I probably shouldn't.<eos> I promised...<eos> I wouldn't,
I don't know.<eos> I've sent him communications, but if he got them,<eos> He hasn't been able to communicate to me.<eos> there has to be a way.<eos> What about how you crossed over when you first got peter?<eos> The last time I opened a door,<eos> It set in motion the ripples that weaken the very fabric<eos> Of our reality.<eos> To do so again could instantly shatter Both worlds...<eos> And likely would.
We must be rigorous in our consideration.<eos> Perhaps tomorrow might be a little warmer.<eos> I could take her out then.<eos> But we do have a moral responsibility to seek out her owner.<eos> Of course we do and so we will, my dear.<eos> I propose that we put up a notice.<eos> "Dog found." That will certainly attract the attention of anyone who might know of her master.<eos> Do you suppose she might care for another bowl of warm milk?<eos> Would you like warm milky-milky?<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
And we've had a few complaints, so, better to be safe than sorry.<eos> Before we start, Oscar, how are you feeling?<eos> You doing all right, buddy?<eos> I'm doing great.<eos> And I felt like that right away, too.<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.<eos> He's... he's doing a lot better.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You'd never know how bad he was before.<eos> No. I wouldn't.
I've got a patient coming to see me.<eos> Is it a girlfriend?<eos> I'd tell you if I had a girlfriend.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- Yeah, he can't use a y-front.<eos> - Right.<eos> Need more like a w-front.<eos> Yeah, so he pops his kecks down there.<eos> I don't think it's that much of a problem.<eos> - It's not like--<eos> - Well...<eos> - ( Stephen laughs ) - I don't know.<eos> I'd prefer that than elephant man's head.<eos> - Well, of course you would.
It's like saying, "I hate you, " without all the mean words.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> I-I thought that our Grayson-ship was... was going great.<eos> Our Grayson-ship is... got me.<eos> Our relationship is going fine.<eos> I just want 24 hours for myself, okay?<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> It's a huge deal, Grayson.<eos> I mean, anybody who knows anything about anything would think this is a huge deal.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
What's wrong with you?<eos> You can't hang out with your roommate's ex.<eos> That's totally uncool.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm over it.<eos> Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.<eos> Is he making any progress?<eos> Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.<eos> So would Ben Affleck.
It was a mistake.<eos> I'm looking into it.<eos> Yes, hello!<eos> - Lloyd can't find a script?<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, E, maybe it's time you start reading some.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Best script-finder in town.<eos> - Would you, E?<eos> - Of course he would.
What symptoms? Short-term memory loss.<eos> Fine with where she went to school. Not so great with where she left the car keys.<eos> Now, he couldn't make any predictions, but he stressed that dementia could set in very quickly and shorten life expectancy.<eos> Talk about the sins of the father.<eos> If Dad was responsible.<eos> You think she did fall out of a tree?<eos> Well, she wanted him to give her away.<eos> I know the dad-daughter thing is a thing, but... Irreparable brain damage? Maybe that's a recent discovery.<eos> I think she's walking around with the wounds of an abusive childhood festering in her head and she wants revenge before they kill her.<eos> (MOBILE RINGS) I would.
I'm legit now.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Bet these medical marijuana cards aren't.<eos> JJ, I need a name.<eos> No?<eos> Okay.<eos> Throw him in the tar pit.<eos> You wouldn't do that.<eos> I wouldn't; he might.<eos> In fact, he would.
Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly.<eos> I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.<eos> I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.<eos> I'll go as high as 40. Sixty-five.<eos> Done.<eos> You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?<eos> I do.<eos> I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.<eos> Would you like to see my cats?<eos> I would.
Where's luka?<eos> Asleep.<eos> His shadow spell was successful.<eos> I was able to track that girl.<eos> However, I did have a little run in<eos> With one of the brothers that killed me.<eos> I assume he didn't live to tell about it.<eos> Actually, I spared him.<eos> He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her.<eos> They both would.
I'm starving.<eos> Thanks for coming, Ric.<eos> You need something to drink?<eos> Coffee?<eos> Bourbon?<eos> Bourbon in your coffee?<eos> Elena mentioned you needed my help.<eos> We were hoping you could help shed some light on the Lockwood family.<eos> Now, why would I know anything about the Lockwoods?<eos> Well, you wouldn't.
Look.<eos> And, um...<eos> Here's mine.<eos> Fuck.<eos> They do... they do kind of look alike.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What am I supposed to do with that information?<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> You want me to tell you.<eos> Yes, I would.
I've got a patient coming to see me.<eos> Is it a girlfriend?<eos> I'd tell you if I had a girlfriend.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
It'll only take a minute.<eos> Okay.<eos> My wife and I... we... we never saw eye-to-eye on... I wish Melanie would've known that.<eos> I can never forgive myself for turning my back on my daughter.<eos> Now I'll never see her again.<eos> Thank you... for making her happy.<eos> This was my mother's.<eos> I wanted to give it to Melanie.<eos> But I want you to have it...<eos> If you would.
Yeah, and it's a really long way, and I had to do it over and over again, so I'm just going to go get some rest.<eos> Go team.<eos> Amy's home?<eos> I saw her car.<eos> Yeah, the woman that she works with encouraged her not to bring John in today because apparently a bunch of the babies were sick.<eos> George, I really hope that you're not lying to me, you and Ashley, about her making the team.<eos> Why would we lie to you about that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why would you lie to me about that?<eos> We wouldn't.
Whatever.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Jerry.<eos> Luke, hey, brother.<eos> This looks like a double homicide.<eos> Double trouble.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, stop. Uh...<eos> I wouldn't say something like that.<eos> you totally would.
It's all beautifully kept and so modern and hearing over it some of the most profoundly beautiful operatic chorus ever.<eos> It's a marvellous mixture and it sums up Wagner as much as anything can.<eos> The demands of the stage and the demands of art coming together.<eos> This is a rehearsal for Siegfried, the third opera of the Ring.<eos> It's an opportunity for the soloists to go through their paces, backed by a full scale Wagnerian orchestra of more than 120 musicians.<eos> It's wonderful, I don't think I've ever been so close.<eos> It's like being inside a painting.<eos> You're actually inside the texture of the music in a way you could never imagine.<eos> I wish you could believe how happy I was.<eos> You wouldn't.
Hi.<eos> Uh, they need first aid supplies, too.<eos> Is somebody hurt?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> It's just a preventative measure.<eos> I'm Ella Montgomery, Aria's mom?<eos> - We met... - At the theater.<eos> I...<eos> I remember.<eos> Well, of course you would.
It's a refueling system.<eos> They did not stop any more than they absolutely had to.<eos> I've pulled some hair samples I'm certain are gonna correspond with the hair samples from the crates.<eos> I mean, it's the same guys.<eos> - Yes. These men are hunters.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those. Ugh.<eos> You should see your dad.<eos> How would that help the case?<eos> Oh, it wouldn't.
- Right.I was limping.<eos> Can I sit down?<eos> - no.<eos> - yes.<eos> We didn't have to wear big-boy shoes in the drug unit.<eos> You're not gonna take those off in here?<eos> No.I'm not.<eos> Well,I can take a look at your bullous lesions if you would like me to.<eos> - Maura,come on!<eos> - Would you?
Can we say hello yet?<eos> In the car!<eos> And it's definitely, especially not fair on them. And what about Rita?<eos> I mean, she's with us all the time, Dave, and she always will be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love Rita, you love Rita.<eos> What's ever changed?<eos> Except she's gone and we're still here.<eos> And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work. "<eos> She would.
And that's really all I have to say.<eos> Good job.<eos> Before we vote,<eos> I'd like to endorse Kim Keeler.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Um, I second that.<eos> My vote is for Kim.<eos> And, uh, mine, too.<eos> Would anyone else like to say something?<eos> I would....
Patrick.<eos> Tell me what happened with Landon Wale.<eos> Ooh, big Detective.<eos> Consultant.<eos> Consultant.<eos> Stop stalling.<eos> Just tell me if you killed the man, and I'll take you to Mexico.<eos> I'm touched.<eos> Cabo? You--you'd do that for me?<eos> Yes, I would.
Maybe yes?<eos> Maybe yes.<eos> You think we could make that a definitely yes?<eos> I'm feeling pretty good about things right now.<eos> That makes me really happy, Anne.<eos> Good. I'm happy, too.<eos> Would you like to go out to dinner tonight, just the two of us?<eos> Spend a little time together outside of bed?<eos> Would you like to spend some time with me outside of bed?<eos> I would.
No, Nathan, back me up on this.<eos> Fine.<eos> It was the center that killed your wife.<eos> We think that they were stealing medications that she was supposed to get.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> We have the people responsible for this in custody at the station right now.<eos> I want them held accountable.<eos> That's what we're counting on.<eos> Hey, would you like to go to coffee?<eos> You would?
- You, for instance.<eos> Look, I saved your life, didn't I?<eos> Enough, fellow.<eos> - Scared?<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Don't shoot, don't.<eos> What, are you gonna sing me a song about your family and kids?<eos> We are all heroes until we face a shotgun.<eos> Would you leave if those three got me then?<eos> Would you?
6 out of 6 alleles.<eos> Have a seat, Kevin.<eos> I want to help Ryan.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> If you get sick the same way Ryan is, it'll be a problem.<eos> Then Ryan will help me.<eos> I mean, he'll give me his kidney.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Ryan can't give you his kidney.<eos> But he would.
See you in a bit.<eos> I still feel like the world's biggest dick for leaving her at that altar, mate.<eos> How could I have fuckin' done that to her?<eos> I know you don't wanna hear it, but I swear I think you're the friggin' maddest bastard for not marrying her.<eos> D'you not think if I had the bloody chance again...?<eos> We've had the chat... if I had the chance again, I would marry her a million and one times over, I would.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I fuckin' would.<eos> No, you wouldn't, you wouldn't.
You say that her lexical features are consistent with her vernacular?<eos> Huh?<eos> Are the words hers?<eos> Yeah, that's what she said.<eos> I need to ask you about the words that Jenny used.<eos> Does it sound like something that she would say?<eos> Does she sound like herself?<eos> We never--we never told her to not be afraid.<eos> Why would she say that?<eos> She wouldn't.
Stevie, marriage is a pretty big step, all right?<eos> I mean, do you have any sort of plan of how you'll provide for her financially?<eos> I have no plan whatsoever.<eos> And you do realize if you had offspring they would be mixed children?<eos> They could be made fun of on the playground.<eos> I was made fun of on the playground and I turned out pretty cool.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck it. Just as I have found what I'm looking for here maybe it's time you found what you're looking for.<eos> Steven, if you would like to take a Mexican wife -<eos> Yes, I would.
We had to weigh in.<eos> So he might have got a clump?<eos> If they had broken through our lines and got into that dock they'd have had the Navy to deal with.<eos> Could this have killed him?<eos> I can't give an opinion until I've done the post mortem.<eos> But from a superficial examination I think it's unlikely.<eos> So he might not have been drunk, he could have been suffering from delayed concussion.<eos> Yes, highly possible.<eos> So if he was still dizzy when he left the pub, he'd be easy prey.<eos> Yes, he would.
What about the blood trail?<eos> The sprinklers came on, washed the blood away.<eos> Killer probably thought the water hazard would do the same thing to the murder weapon.<eos> I've done that before.<eos> That's a driver. That's not the murder weapon.<eos> A 9- and a 4-iron!<eos> An edge and a hosel, like a -- like an iron?<eos> But it wouldn't be the 4-iron.<eos> I mean, this far from the hole, you'd use a 4-iron -- which if you got pissed off and mis-shot, you'd throw it in the water.<eos> Well, I would, anyway.
God...<eos> Who let him in here?<eos> I did.<eos> I'm just pitching' in, aiding' the cause, Helpin' the angels of spirit<eos> Make the world a cheerier place.<eos> God.<eos> Savannah, does he talk that much during sex?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
This may be able to lead us to our two remaining thieves.<eos> Got a lot of evidence, and not a lot of answers.<eos> Stay positive.<eos> What would you do?<eos> What would I do what?<eos> If you found millions of dollars of gems in the street?<eos> Give 'em back.<eos> Oh, come on, guy.<eos> You wouldn't keep some?<eos> Why, would you?
That so?<eos> Did I do som'thin' wrong?<eos> Yeah, a big one too!<eos> Can't you see why Hani has studied so desperately?<eos> - You're just a moron!<eos> You stupid... - That so? Hey, Hani... you still lik' Seung-Jo... huh?<eos> Aft'r all that dissing he's given to ya, you still have it fo' him?<eos> So, that's lik' ya like that kinda pretty boy styl'?<eos> No!<eos> Why would I?
Yes.<eos> To collect. Mr Spools, meet Stanley, the Post Office's new head of stamps.<eos> Head of stamps? Mmm.<eos> Wow.<eos> Is there a hat?<eos> One thing at a time, Stanley.<eos> Yes, Mr Lipwig.<eos> 'Wait before you tear this letter up in disgust.' 'Ask yourself one question.'<eos> 'Would you have done anything so different? '<eos> 'Would anyone? '
You know what I mean?<eos> Definitely.<eos> Most definitely. Yeah.<eos> Hey, Joni, did you tell Paul about your graduation speech?<eos> No, she didn't tell me.<eos> It was so full of wisdom and hope.<eos> Hey, go get it.<eos> You know, I bet Paul would like to hear it.<eos> No, Mom, I'm sure he wouldn't.<eos> No, no, no, sure he would.
Absolutely.<eos> We have considered Democra's explanation... as to why they dismissed Ms. Bolkovac... and there is no doubt whatsoever... that the real reason for her dismissal... was that she made a protected disclosure... and accordingly was dismissed unfairly.<eos> You smuggled files that belonged to the UN out of the mission.<eos> Don't you think that was a rather reckless thing to do?<eos> Those young women had put themselves at great risk by confiding in me.<eos> And I led them to believe that they would receive justice... but we let them down.<eos> So the least I can do is let them be heard.<eos> Given everything you've been through... would you do it again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Come on, Ana!<eos> Look!<eos> Fantastic!<eos> What are you doing here, Gigi Paparu?<eos> Well, Mona...<eos> - I don't believe your story.<eos> - You mean I'm not telling the truth?<eos> - Have you told anyone else?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> You'd better not.
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.<eos> Find the scent, my compares, and you too shall have much rewordings from Master for the toil factor you wage.<eos> Hey, Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar.<eos> You must've bumped it.<eos> Yeah, your voice sounds funny!<eos> Beta! Gamma!<eos> Mayhaps you desire to...<eos> Squirrel! Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.<eos> No, no.<eos> But maybe Dug would.
I'm fighting to save my life and you're trying to throw yours away.<eos> Now why is that?<eos> 'Cause...<eos> I want to be like the girl in this picture, young and alive.<eos> I haven't seen this picture since- I wasn't any older than you there.<eos> You look like a totally different person, so happy. Don't you miss that?<eos> Well, no.<eos> You're telling me that you wouldn't jump at the chance if you could turn the clock back?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
-What is the largest living mammal on Earth?<eos> The blue whale! Weighing over 1 50 tons.<eos> These are facts.<eos> These are the fact ones.<eos> They're not jokes.<eos> Darling, I think you might have a joke.<eos> Yes, yes, yes, yes.<eos> Yes, it's funny.<eos> Would you like a mince pie?<eos> Yes, I would.
Fine, the potting shed.<eos> Who does he think I am?<eos> Prince Rainier of Monaco?<eos> What if I got married instead of going to college?<eos> Married?<eos> Married.<eos> Well, it would depend who it was, of course.<eos> Would it?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Of course it would.
It's not that I don't like her.<eos> It's that sometimes I worry you do.<eos> Your objections have been noted.<eos> Thank you, Mr Dominic.<eos> –Hello, Echo.<eos> –Hello.<eos> I had an exam.<eos> That's good.<eos> Would you like to have some lunch now?<eos> I would.
It's different with her.<eos> I'm more like a client than a john.<eos> She only has a few of us.<eos> We pay her extremely well and she makes it worth our while.<eos> How-how does she do that?<eos> She... she's totally into it.<eos> She makes you happy to be a man.<eos> I think she improves my marriage to a woman who lost interest in me after our third child was born.<eos> Would your wife agree with that?<eos> No, she would not.
You like her better caus' she bakes.<eos> I'm pretty sure I like you the best.<eos> What?<eos> I know you love me.<eos> Doesn't feel right, sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> This is your wife's body.<eos> Just cause I'm not her doesn't mean we can't hook up.<eos> We know from experience Tara wouldn't like that.<eos> Sure she would.
Fine, but I win every "my mother's a fucking horrible person" contest.<eos> To mother issues.<eos> You're lucky, Marshall.<eos> Your mum's there for you.<eos> Look what she made you.<eos> Hey, Nordic.<eos> I just read in Us Weekly that Lance is dating one of the Olsen twins.<eos> Which must be total vindication for Sheryl Crow.<eos> I mean, that guy is just gonna fuck everyone, isn't he?<eos> Hey, I would.
No.<eos> I'm just happy you're not mad at your old Birdie.<eos> Why?<eos> For what I made you do.<eos> Helping me with Marv and all the others.<eos> You didn't make me do those things.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> I would do it again.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> But I would.
No, it's a good thing.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted you to know that Ocurro's talked.<eos> He's confessed to a couple of other homicides.<eos> Here?<eos> The Dominican Republic.<eos> Serial murder's gone global.<eos> Victor?<eos> Would you like to see Joy now?<eos> I would.
You mean like he's Mick Jagger and we're a bunch of roadies?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We made that motherfucker.<eos> I'd like to be in business with you.<eos> - That I might regret.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
What do you think?<eos> I think you had better leave right now, mr. Jane.<eos> I don't have the--the time or the patience for tomfoolery.<eos> So you think he's guilty?<eos> I'm wasting my time.<eos> We' done talking.<eos> Suppose I could prove he was innocent.<eos> Wouldn't you want that?<eos> Wouldn't you want that blot on your name expunged?<eos> Of course he would.
- Not important.<eos> - No. But we got a missing Navy captain who is.<eos> Office of Naval Intelligence called it in.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Uh,yeah,didn't you say that...<eos> Missing person,DiNozzo.<eos> Hasn't been 48 hours.<eos> - So it is not in our jurisdiction yet.<eos> But you'd like us to make a few calls.<eos> We certainly would.
Oh, look.<eos> He's come to save the village.<eos> How noble.<eos> What are you going to do, Hood? Hmm?<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> Going to shoot me?<eos> And risk bringing down the wrath of Prince John on Nottingham?<eos> Well, I don't think you want that, do you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
# I'm crying tears of a rapper #<eos> # Tears of a rapper. #<eos> Yes, well, all good examples.<eos> - Can we go now?<eos> - But my point is: Just be careful around rappers, all right?<eos> You hurt their feelings and kaboom... they'll hurt you more than your feelings... they'll hurt your pretty little brain, Bret.<eos> It'll be gone, then you'll have no feelings.<eos> - How would you like that?<eos> - Well, I wouldn't like that.<eos> No, none of us would.
Then all at once the trouble started<eos> A pack of murderers and thieves<eos> Like swarms of locusts they descended Their aim to make the town folk flee<eos> They've got to be here somewhere.<eos> Where's my first lieutenant?<eos> Here I am, sir. Yes, sir. Right indeed.<eos> Yes, I am, sir! I want you to turn this settlement upside down until you find Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson!<eos> That fat bastard thinks he can steal my bride and get away with it?<eos> I wouldn't bet a corn farthing on him escaping.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Don't give...<eos> Whiskey.<eos> - He wants a drink instead.<eos> - I'm not surprised.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - That was...<eos> - Necessary.<eos> Doctor, he's calm now.<eos> Is there perhaps something else we can give him to make him more receptive to our questions?<eos> No, I'd rather not.
This is Lee Scanlon.<eos> Lee, nice to meet you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> So... 20 weeks.<eos> First ultrasound.<eos> So big question:<eos> Do we want to know the sex of the baby?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> I would.
Why are you yelling like there's an iron bar in your throat?<eos> You've given credit to the Molokan!<eos> - Sure I have.<eos> - How could you?<eos> ! Don't you know I have nothing to do with him?<eos> Don't you know if I get my hands on him I'll drown him in the milk churn?<eos> You're to go and demand that money at once!<eos> Or I'll go.<eos> And have words with him!<eos> - She would too!
I thought maybe he wasn't English, but he sounded OK.<eos> And the colour of his hair?<eos> His eyes?<eos> Dark.<eos> Very dark.<eos> All over.<eos> You mean black?<eos> I mean his aura.<eos> So if you saw him again, would you recognise him?<eos> Yes, I would.
...which brings us to the ABCs of CPR. Yes, sure, Charlie.<eos> I would love to go to prom with you.<eos> I would be thrilled.<eos> Thrilled. Hey, come on.<eos> Pretty sharp, huh?<eos> Girls, I'm telling you, are not into the flashy stuff.<eos> They just want it simple, classy, like James Bond.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Would James Bond use a cane?<eos> No, he would not.
come here.<eos> what do you think about adam and roger?<eos> eh, no, no, adam's not gay.<eos> are you sure?<eos> no, i'm not.<eos> i just can't tell anymore.<eos> and that haircut doesn't exactly scream, "i like girls."<eos> beers for you guys... and i decided to try a sea breeze.<eos> doesn't that drink come with a blouse?<eos> of course not, and why would it?
Until this week.<eos> Eh, after three kids, I have the right to complain.<eos> You know, women should learn how to tell their husbands they're pregnant on Fridays, that way you've got all weekend to, you know, let it sink in, have a little nervous breakdown and then be prepared to get thrown back into the real world.<eos> So, you're okay with this?<eos> Yes.<eos> Even the college fund?<eos> They're going to need a good education if they're planning on taking care of me in my old age because as you know,<eos> I have very expensive taste. Mmm.<eos> You wouldn't know it by looking at ya.<eos> You wouldn't?
Next time we meet, I'll be a Mecha hunter.<eos> I'll destroy you.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> Why did you become a Mecha?<eos> Every time I look at my arm I'm reminded of the past.<eos> The past?<eos> My sister Himawari got sick and suddenly went mad.<eos> She was frail and affected by a deadly epidemic.<eos> The doctors gave up on her.<eos> But that mad scientist wouldn't.
Daddy?<eos> yeah.<eos> why are you calling so late?<eos> Honey, i-i'm sorry.<eos> I forgot, uh... i forgot what time it was.<eos> You -- you go back to sleep, okay, pumpkin?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> This isn't you, westen.<eos> You're capable of a lot, but you wouldn't hurt a child.<eos> But you would, brennen.
He rides around on a board that looks like this<eos> Do you Do you know Do you know Fran<eos> Do you know Francisco?<eos> Excuse me<eos> Do you know someone named Francisco?<eos> Ever skateboarded with him on the streets?<eos> Yeah, I know him Do you know where he likes to skateboard?<eos> Don't remember<eos> Would $5 help your memory?<eos> - No, but $10 would.
She can bring the baby too, if she wants.<eos> I'll ask her myself.<eos> Bye, Ashley.<eos> Want me to get rid of him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm thinking abo it.<eos> - So - so<eos> So, neither of you are conversationalists.<eos> Maybe ind it awkward having to talk in front of you.<eos> would you yes?
I like that.<eos> Ashl's made a commitment not to date in high school.<eos> I don't wa to go out with her.<eos> I just want to marry her and have children.<eos> In that order.<eos> Whoa, okay there, buddy.<eos> no no no? You'reot getting anywhere near her.<eos> I didn't say I was going to.<eos> I just- - I wanted to.<eos> but Who wouldn't?
So the funeral arrangements have been made already?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He left a will.<eos> And he left instructions for everything.<eos> He planned everything.<eos> Said he wanted a happy, uplifting service celebrating his life.<eos> That's not gonna be too easy.<eos> Especially if there's no alcohol.<eos> It wouldn't be easy no matter what.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
I need you.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> I know.<eos> Last time I was here... I couldn't wait to get away.<eos> This time, I want to stay forever.<eos> Well, you can't.<eos> You said yourself, you have to go back there.<eos> Now you're the one who can't wait to go.<eos> - Can you take my case, please?<eos> - Well, I would but, erm...
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.<eos> And what charges might those be, Will?<eos> I haven't said anything yet.<eos> Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Even the new state's attorney thinks there's nothing there.<eos> And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half-hour's notice.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?<eos> - You wanna know what I would say?<eos> - I would.
What?<eos> What did I say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just that's what I always used to say to Peter.<eos> (phone beeps)<eos> Are you there?<eos> I just need to pick up a few things, and I'll be home soon.<eos> Jackie, I don't know if I've said this, but thank you...<eos> for stepping up.<eos> Of course I would.
Funny. But you know what's not?<eos> I may not be able to pay house dues, let alone my tuition next master.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}I can't get a job around campus because word would get around that I'm broke.<eos> {\pos(192,230)} - You still have that car, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}You're gonna tell me to get rid of the car if I'm so strapped for cash... {\pos(192,230)}Not a chance!<eos> That car is your only remaining redeeming value.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}Here's one. Sperm donor.<eos> {\pos(192,230)}Someone of your pedigree could earn three times as much as I have... {\pos(192,230)}...would.<eos> As much as I would.
Open relationships only invite chaos.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's not an open relationship.<eos> We're completely monogamous.<eos> It's just one of our games, like the rest.<eos> Yeah, until it isn't anymore, playing the scorned woman.<eos> And actually being the scorned woman is a slippy slope.<eos> B, college is about to start.<eos> What happens when one day you don't get there in time, and he actually kisses someone else, or worse?<eos> He wouldn't.
I know.<eos> You don't interrupt me when I'm with a patient.<eos> I know.<eos> Then you'll also know to turn around, walk away and close the door. Fine.<eos> We'll just let her bleed to death then.<eos> Save you the trip.<eos> What?<eos> There's an emergency at the school.<eos> Would you like to know why?<eos> Would you?
"This is all but a done deal.<eos> "I heard they're starting rehearsals right away.<eos> O.M.G.!<eos> O.M.G.!<eos> O.M.G.!" and look at this one.<eos> "A source at John McGinnis Management<eos> "confirmed it when I called--<eos> The Blue Pill is definitely getting back together."<eos> "the Hayley Blue tribute tour." I thought you said Hayley wouldn't let the band have the name back.<eos> She wouldn't.
Don't you think?<eos> I mean, have you ever seen anything like this is your life?<eos> - Huh.<eos> - Only me. Only me this happens to.<eos> I bet you I could sue 'em.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Do I have a case?<eos> Tell me. - Would you testify for me?<eos> - No. - You wouldn't testify?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
I understand that.<eos> Tell me about Newbury Heights, Mr. Eldredge?<eos> What?<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> June 21, you went to Newbury Heights to check out a near miss collision, isn't that right?<eos> Would you like to take a break?<eos> If you were to learn there was a problem with a piece of equipment on your trains, Mr. Eldredge, you'd replace the part, wouldn't you?<eos> Of course I would.
Malcolm, stop blaming yourself, Hillier would have found Ruth anyway.<eos> Organise a surveillance team.<eos> We're really close to Harry now.<eos> I was the one who put them in danger!<eos> No, Malcolm, you weren't.<eos> Get some rest, we're dealing with this.<eos> One...<eos> ..two...<eos> You'd kill a child?<eos> Of course I would.
It's distracting.<eos> Probably caused by a perforated septum.<eos> I think you're derailing our session to avoid dealing with the issue.<eos> You won't get better if you won't engage with the problem.<eos> At the end of the day, that's all that counts.<eos> It doesn't make a difference to me.<eos> I can sit here all day.<eos> I can't.<eos> Would it help you if I told you that you weren't running from me but from yourself?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
I could be dead right now.<eos> But I'm also grateful.<eos> What?<eos> To Stefan.<eos> He saved my life, and...<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Not since he told me was leaving.<eos> for all I know, he's already gone.<eos> He wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.<eos> Yes, he would.
Do you really need to ask the question?<eos> Something happened.<eos> What's that?<eos> Squeak up.<eos> Something happened to me.<eos> Are you a virgin? Hi ho!<eos> Shut up!<eos> What was it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> 'Would I?
Take a look at this. There's a handprint in the center back of this chair right here.<eos> He pulled this chair out for himself.<eos> Over here, there are handprints on either side of the chair.<eos> He pulled this chair out for her, poured her wine...<eos> And even cleaned up after the meal was done.<eos> But up he something changed.<eos> Then he drew her a bath. And this is where Melissa Johnson was murdered.<eos> This is where the fantasy ended.<eos> Because she broke it?<eos> I would.
It is perfect for you.<eos> It's like a sex castle.<eos> There's plenty of closet space for all your condoms and body sprays.<eos> Plus in the morning there's a huge shower in the master to wash away all your shame.<eos> You're single.<eos> Are you telling me that you're not playing around with some young guy?<eos> Well, I do have a date tomorrow with a slightly younger fellow.<eos> Ah. And would you like to tell me<eos> - what he does for a living?<eos> - I would not.
Thanks.<eos> Well, gotta get moving.<eos> It keeps the ticker ticking.<eos> How's your dad's cooking?<eos> Is he doing all right?<eos> - Too many veggies!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> (Dave) Doctor...<eos> You would tell me if anything was wrong.<eos> Course I would, darling.
- Right about now I am.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Zero, back to the car.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us.<eos> Conversation's over.<eos> Playing Little House on the Prairie with a schoolteacher,<eos> I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.<eos> And you would know, huh?<eos> - I would.
I'm not going to beg, and I won't call again.<eos> The truth is that I was a preemie. I was several weeks premature, and there was talk of oxygen deprivation. I'm not making excuses, but the doctor said...<eos> Idiot.<eos> Oh... You know someone a bunch of years, and it's easy to forget that you were fortunate enough to have known them for even one day.<eos> And that was Lucky, to me.<eos> I mean, he was my friend. He... Well, even more important, he was my family.<eos> And where was I when he was breathing his last breath?<eos> In Japan, making a business deal.<eos> Is there anyone who would like to say anything about Lucky - before we say goodbye?<eos> - I would.
I've received a letter from our friend Cranmer.<eos> In Nurnberg, clergy are allowed to marry.<eos> And mr. Cranmer has taken full advantage of that fact.<eos> - Lady Elizabeth.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> You know what I want.<eos> Are you really going to marry mistress Boleyn?<eos> I have it on very good authority that she and Thomas Wyatt were once lovers.<eos> - She denies it.<eos> - Well, she would, wouldn't she?
It's only dope.<eos> Drugs caused it.<eos> Dad caused it.<eos> Is he still in your room?<eos> No, Mummy, I don't wanna join the Navy.<eos> Oooh, shoe.<eos> Oh, shoe...<eos> - Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Cos you would have stopped us.<eos> - Too fucking right I would!
Huh? I know that look.<eos> Have you laid one on for me?<eos> Have you? Huh?<eos> Patrick?<eos> Patrick, you have, haven't you, so?<eos> Huh? Come on away.<eos> Two Guinness, son.<eos> Oh, is this her?<eos> She would do me.<eos> She fucking wouldn't.
You have no idea how much I have to read.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - It's fucking intense.<eos> - Don't use that language.<eos> You haven't quit school, have you?<eos> - You've been studying so long.<eos> - You think I'm lying to you?<eos> I have loads to read every day.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I'll get a gun and end up with this agony.<eos> Fuck you again!<eos> When I was a kid... heard my father... talking with friends, complain about this evil and that revenue.<eos> Seemed so sad. Know?<eos> It seemed so old at the time.<eos> Now I'm about to go through the same.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> Will be two years next week.<eos> He would have loved this place.<eos> Yes I would.
Is that how he speaks about his work?<eos> What are you saying, Paul?<eos> That I can't form an opinion of my own father's work?<eos> You think I'm quoting him?<eos> You know, he says a lot of shrinks are failed artists or writers.<eos> Maybe you're jealous of him.<eos> He travels around the world, he works with models.<eos> Meanwhile, you're trapped in your cell with fuck-ups like me.<eos> Oh, I'd take a fuck-up like you any day over one of those supermodels.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
Well -- congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So are you happy for us?<eos> Is that important to you?<eos> Well, if you're gonna be a guest at our wedding, you'd better be happy for us.<eos> Andrew and I wanted to invite you.<eos> Your wife, too.<eos> But you wouldn't come, right?<eos> Would you?<eos> No, of course you wouldn't.
So, we are done for the night.<eos> I guess.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> - Yeah, just, Adam hasn't rung yet. - Ah.<eos> Sure he will.<eos> I know I would, if it was our anniversary.<eos> I wouldn't disappear.<eos> Infact, I would... cherish you.<eos> Ah, Owen!<eos> Yeah, no, no, really, really, I would.
Ma... please don't make me leave Lark Rise.<eos> Come here.<eos> When I was about your age, Laura, some relatives came to visit us from Australia.<eos> And they persuaded me to go back with them.<eos> I was so excited.<eos> It was going to be a whole new life.<eos> It was all arranged, till the night before I was due to go<eos> They began to talk about snakes that infested their garden.<eos> So, I said, "I shan't go."<eos> And I wouldn't.
We have encouraged our friends and customers to come to the cause.<eos> We will ensure that the whole of Candleford stands behind you, Miss Lane.<eos> Pa!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Enjoying the sights.<eos> My, don't you look the part.<eos> How is it for you here, Laura?<eos> I like having my own room, and the meals and the baths and there's books everywhere.<eos> You would tell me if you couldn't settle here, wouldn't you?<eos> - Of course, I would.
This prattling voice will cease forever!<eos> Oh, that'll be the day.<eos> No man is allowed to enter the Temple of Sibyl.<eos> Well, that's all right, just us girls.<eos> Do you know, I met the Sibyl once, hell of a woman.<eos> Blimey, she could dance the Tarantella!<eos> Nice teeth.<eos> Truth be told, I think she had a bit of a thing for me.<eos> I said it would never last, she said, "I know".<eos> Well, she would.
It's only for losers, like musicians and...<eos> ! That's my girlfriend.<eos> Then I guess you'll be paying for her chocolate.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Gotcha! That's nice work, Officer Otto.<eos> Happy to be of service, old bean.<eos> ...cannon, neat, neat, neat<eos> Look, an American nerd bird.<eos> Nerd bird? Would a nerd bird have chocolate, huh?<eos> Would a nerd bird?
Yeah.<eos> All right, dispatch says since these two here are pretty well dead, it's gonna be awhile before they can send anybody over.<eos> They're stretched pretty thin today.<eos> All right, so they disagree about the cut.<eos> They start shooting at each other, and one of the shots... hits the car's gas tank?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> Yeah, but you think that's what happened?<eos> No. I just said it looks that way.<eos> Because you really have to be aiming if you want the gas tank to explode like that.<eos> You really would.
I HAVE TO FIND IT.<eos> I'VE WAITED TO FEEL HUMAN FOR A LONG TIME...<eos> BUT I FORGOT HOW PAINFUL IT CAN BE.<eos> ARE YOU HUMAN?<eos> FOR NOW, YEAH.<eos> HOW DOES IT FEEL?<eos> IT FEELS AMAZING.<eos> IT'S BEEN 55 YEARS SINCE I SLEPT IN A BED, FELT THE SOFTNESS AND WARMTH OF PILLOWS AND BLANKETS.<eos> DO I MISS SLEEPING IN AN INDUSTRIAL FREEZER?<eos> WOULD YOU?
Wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't do it. You're awake.<eos> You're not a killer,clark.<eos> There's a -<eos> - There's a good man inside of you.<eos> What do you think,Sammy?<eos> Am I a good man?<eos> Just let him go.<eos> I would.
Wait.<eos> Don't do it. You're awake.<eos> You're not a killer,clark.<eos> There's a -<eos> - There's a good man inside of you.<eos> What do you think,Sammy?<eos> Am I a good man?<eos> Just let him go.<eos> I would.<eos> I really would.
- I hope we find it because I'm starting to cramp like a...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Quit whining.<eos> No, Sam, I mean, son of a bitch.<eos> So? Our apple-bobbing cheerleader?<eos> Tracy, the Wallace's babysitter.<eos> She told me she'd never even heard of Luke Wallace.<eos> Interesting look for a centuries-old witch.<eos> If you were a 600-year-old hag and you could pick any costume to come back in, wouldn't you go for a hot cheerleader?<eos> I would.
But all I can find is his CRU web page from three years ago.<eos> Apparently, he's a songwriter.<eos> Not bad?<eos> Pretty rudimentary chord changes if you ask me.<eos> How old do I look in this?<eos> Eighteen.<eos> You know, lying about who you are is never good, Rusty.<eos> It signals a lack of self-esteem.<eos> Why would I want to be anyone but Dale Kettlewell?<eos> - You wouldn't, Dale.
Honey, you're crazy.<eos> I love you, but you're crazy.<eos> I'm not jealous.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - What?<eos> Why aren't you jealous?<eos> I mean, if I came home and I found you having a tête-à-tête with an ex-boyfriend over a plate of Indian food, you know what I would do?<eos> You would grab a plate and join in, just like I did.<eos> You're right.<eos> I would.
She's in a lot of pain.<eos> Then I hope she goes fast.<eos> Not likely.<eos> Just shoot me if I ever get like that.<eos> Really?<eos> Hell yes.<eos> I'd do the same for you.<eos> Pull the plug, put a pillow over your head, whatever.<eos> I'd never let you suffer.<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
That's what you wanted before, and you got a lie, so why is this time gonna be any different?<eos> Your friend is a really bad girl.<eos> Your friend's a really bad guy.<eos> So what?<eos> People are what they are, and people are good and bad.<eos> Except for you, Grace.<eos> You're the exception.<eos> You're the only good person I know.<eos> If your parents would let me come over tonight, I'd love to hear your personal testimony.<eos> You would?
There's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.<eos> And you guys aren't going?<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to support him?<eos> A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.<eos> That would be cool. I'd go to that reception.<eos> Come on, this is huge.<eos> Raj is gonna be in People magazine, and he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.<eos> Would you like to go with me?<eos> Of course I would.
Well, little gifts are always a nice way to express your feelings.<eos> I know.<eos> Could be as simple as a cashmere robe or as extravagant as a new car.<eos> Yeah, I suppose it could.<eos> Excuse me, I got something really cool for Jake.<eos> Doesn't even have to be new!<eos> Certified pre-owned is still very thoughtful!<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> I was trying to research cars, but you wouldn't believe what comes up when you Google "Hummer."<eos> Actually, I would.
We'll see, it's a tough old bird, this.<eos> - Did you like it?<eos> - No. It's better than your Maybach.<eos> More brake.<eos> Brake!<eos> No, you can't brake there, you'll be off in the field.<eos> Oh, gearbox, gearbox!<eos> What's the matter with the gearbox?<eos> - It wouldn't go in.<eos> - Yes, it would.
Pretty sure that was it<eos> You said you never felt this way about anyone before.<eos> Ishat true?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Okay, listen, after all we've been through... When you walked away tonight, all I could think was,<eos> "she's the one I want to be with."<eos> So, yeah, it matters.<eos> It's easy for you to say Because you didn't just pull a janet jackson At the snowflake ball.<eos> You wanna grab a drink?<eos> Yes, I would.
See?<eos> It's something.<eos> Partial small bowel obstruction.<eos> Blockage explains the pain.<eos> What explains the blockage plus seizures?<eos> Atrial fibrillation throwing emboli.<eos> Crohn's causing an abscess.<eos> Could be a million things.<eos> There's no way to know unless we get him in for an MRI on his head or exploratory surgery so we can biopsy his bowels, which he won't let us do.<eos> Wouldn't.
- What the hell does that mean?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I want to play.<eos> Let's not jinx my system.<eos> - What gives?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, this is just for fun, right?<eos> If you don't win I can just get you a satellite radio.<eos> I don't want the radio.<eos> I would.
I couldn't do that.<eos> I ate little children.<eos> You used to be more fun.<eos> Hey, do you think animals have souls? .<eos> - Why shouldn't they?<eos> . - What kind could a worm have? .<eos> - Small, probably.<eos> - Small, big, that's the mystery.<eos> I wouldn't want to be a worm.<eos> I would.
Everyone knows we've had our conflicts.<eos> Now we must show our sympathy with Einar and his family!<eos> That we can do later.<eos> The important thing now is to stand together.<eos> There is not much we can say so far.<eos> She stable, but the situation is still critical.<eos> It's great if one of you could stay with him.<eos> I could stay, if you want.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - But I would rather that Kristian...
Why?<eos> Because you had some microscopic nuclear things and you dropped them.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Big klutz.<eos> Oh, oh, nightmare!<eos> Yeah, they're down there somewhere.<eos> Oh, it's a pain.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Yeah, you're getting angry.<eos> Oh, well, I would!
-Mothering?<eos> -Yep. And you're a woman,<eos> -so you should go on, get down there.<eos> -l'm... I'm not...<eos> What?<eos> Good with children.<eos> Nullah?<eos> I wanted to extend my condolences.<eos> Go away.<eos> Would you...
I mean, about all of it?<eos> Yeah, we should probably do that.<eos> Well, do you wanna get in?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> So how do you wanna do this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We could wait for a red light.<eos> Will you come to my launch party tonight?<eos> - Would you like me to?<eos> - Yes, I would.
No, she should stay out of all that shit.<eos> - Stick to herself.<eos> That's it. - She's an alpha female!<eos> - She's British!<eos> - She's what?<eos> ! - Stop!<eos> Just don't drop the soap.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> - Don't drop the soap.<eos> - I wouldn't.
Hi there.<eos> I'm Alice Pieszecki and this is "Alice in Lesboland"<eos> and today I have my collegue Max Sweeney with me.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> As some of you may know, Max is sort of our behind the scenes techy guy on OurChart, and, uh, he recently, uh, did a blog about being a trans-guy and it kinda pissed some of you off and I said some things that weren't so cool, apparently, and I just wanted to apologize publically to Max.<eos> So, I'm sorry, Max.<eos> Actually, um, you said that I wasn't part of your community.<eos> Which is... it's more than just kind of uncool.<eos> - Wouldn't you say?<eos> - Yeah, I would, yes.
Go back to sleep.<eos> But when we decide to change who we are for someone we love...<eos> What time is it?<eos> ... we can surprise even ourselves with who we've become.<eos> All right, Jordan, you win.<eos> I miss you guys.<eos> I miss you, too, Daddy!<eos> Jordan, would you like to say the same thing?<eos> - I would not.<eos> - She would not.
See another bug. Zig. Zag.<eos> If you don't put it on, we're not going.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Nothing, sorry.<eos> I was just thinking about something else.<eos> You look great.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Hop on.<eos> Would you stop... stop laughing.<eos> Would you, please?
