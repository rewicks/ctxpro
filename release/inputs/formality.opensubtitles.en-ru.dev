- No, it doesn't have to be.<eos> - Enough.<eos> Time to sleep.<eos> You need to be fresh in the morning and so do I.<eos> - Andrei...<eos> - Enough!<eos> Warriors!<eos> Here, at last, is the battle you longed for!<eos> Act as you acted at Austerlitz and victory is assured!<eos> "Posterity will remember you "as the heroes who fought and won "in the great battle of Borodino!"
Warriors!<eos> Here, at last, is the battle you longed for!<eos> Act as you acted at Austerlitz and victory is assured!<eos> "Posterity will remember you "as the heroes who fought and won "in the great battle of Borodino!"<eos> Vive l'Empereur!<eos> What?<eos> - What's happened?<eos> Has it begun?<eos> - Yes, if you please.<eos> My master left a horse for you... all the gentlemen have gone, and General Kutuzov left an hour ago.
- We're getting cut to pieces!<eos> - Nothing to do but endure.<eos> Courage, lads!<eos> Colonel, it is my duty to report... only eight charges left.<eos> Do we continue firing?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> You - run to the ammunition cart, get the reserves!<eos> I'll go!<eos> I'm strong.<eos> - This is no place for you, Master.
Absolutely not!<eos> If you won't find me a commission, I'll run away and find one myself.<eos> I have fallen in love before and I expect that I will again.<eos> A short time ago, I was able to be of service to Princess Marya Bolkonskaya.<eos> Well, it does seem like fate, doesn't it?<eos> (LAUGHS) Yes.<eos> It does.<eos> Just to confirm, I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova.<eos> (SOBBING) Will you ask him if he can forgive me?<eos> No one's as kind as you.
Hey, miss, you can't be here.<eos> No, let her stay.<eos> It's really you.<eos> (KISSING HAND)<eos> Forgive me.<eos> (SOBBING) I'm so sorry, forgive me.<eos> For what?<eos> For what I did.<eos> ANDREI: Natasha.<eos> I love you.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)<eos> - Hi.<eos> -I had thought you left.<eos> Came to tell you that I've heard your brother is alive.<eos> He's being cared for by my family. They'll be travelling to Yaroslavl.<eos> They had to flee from Moscow.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I must bring Nikolushka to see his father.<eos> NIKOLAI: Yes, of course.<eos> I would escort you, but I am already late to join my regiment.
I' m happy-<eos> I saw him at the hospital.<eos> Who, who did you see?<eos> Anatole Kuragin.<eos> My anew'! -<eos> He was hurt and I was hurt, and he looked at me, and I found that I loved him, too.<eos> He's not so bad.<eos> He can't help it, being like that.<eos> And I'm the one to blame.<eos> It was cruel of me to leave you.
But it isn't. It isn't too late.<eos> It's so strange.<eos> I was thinking,<eos> "If she could be here, "I could tell her."<eos> And here you are.<eos> And I won't leave you.<eos> I'll never leave you.<eos> NXKOLAY. "My dear Sonya."<eos> - Ugh... Lora'. - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)<eos> Did I ask you to barge in?
Princess, you're very welcome, very welcome...<eos> Forgive me, but he is here.<eos> May I see him?<eos> But of course. Errn...<eos> Why don't you sit down?<eos> No, no, no. If you please, I'd like to see him straight away.<eos> Sit down, and we'll ring for tea.<eos> There's no hurry, really. No hurry.<eos> (NATALYA CH UCKLES)<eos> I'll take you to him.
DOCTOR: You must be patient, Contessa.<eos> Two drops a clay, no more, and nature will work its course. Huh?<eos> I promise you.<eos> Is there really nothing else you can do for me?<eos> Can't you see I'm desperate?<eos> I can't get married like this.<eos> (SPEAKING ITALIAN)<eos> (IN ENGLISH) It all will be well.<eos> (PANTING)<eos> We'll come again to see you tomorrow.
As you wish.<eos> I like this work.<eos> Rich pickings.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Who's this now?<eos> What're you doing out here?<eos> You'll give us all away.<eos> Sorry, sir, I didn't realise.<eos> Uh...<eos> I have this letter for you.
- Thank you, master.<eos> -Go on, take the whole bag.<eos> I've got plenty more.<eos> I brought them from home, you know.<eos> Would you sharpen my sabre for me?<eos> It's got blunt.<eos> Actually...<eos> It's never been sharpened.<eos> Give it here, master.<eos> I'll put a good edge on it for you.
Bring my clothes.<eos> Wait, have I got anything to wear?<eos> Of course, Your Excellency.<eos> And bring me a barber.<eos> (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)<eos> -(PEOPLE SPEAKING IN DISTINCTLY) -(BABY WAILING)<eos> MARYA: I'm so sorry for your loss, Countess.<eos> (NATALYA SIGHS)<eos> It must be very hard to bear.<eos> I've been thinking about you all so much.
How can you be so self-sacrificing?<eos> Oh, because I'm used to it.<eos> - NATALYA: Sonya!<eos> -Coming.<eos> (IN DISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)<eos> (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)<eos> My mother sends her compliments, hopes you're well.<eos> I'm quite well, thank you, in the circumstances.<eos> How is she now?<eos> She's bearing up, thank you.
I know I've done so much wrong in my life.<eos> But to take them both from me?<eos> Both my lovely children.<eos> I've wronged you, too, my friend.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Nothing to forgive.<eos> Come, there's a chilly wind blowing.<eos> Take my arm.<eos> - Now let me walk you home.
Yeah, and he often spoke of you.<eos> And always very fondly, didn't he?<eos> - So you found him at the Rostovs? -(GIGGLES)<eos> What an odd coincidence.<eos> Was she with him at the end?<eos> Pierre, don't you see who's here?<eos> Natasha?<eos> Have I changed so very much?<eos> No. No.<eos> No, I didn't see you.
May 1 "We?<eos> I know I'm not worthy of her, but...<eos> I've loved her so long.<eos> Tell me what to do and I will do it.<eos> Well, I think you should ask her yourself.<eos> I'll go and fetch her.<eos> (CLEARING TH ROAT)<eos> Dearest Natasha.<eos> I know I've been a clown and wasted my life, but I have to ask you.<eos> Say no, and I'll go to Petersburg, and never bother you again.
There was a butterfly.<eos> One of the prom girls had a butterfly tattoo on her ankle.<eos> What if she was near Nate when he died?<eos> All seven kids said they were inside the store.<eos> - So she's lying.<eos> - Yep.<eos> You call my daughter a liar again...<eos> We're not calling your daughter a liar.<eos> I'm gonna sue all your asses, okay?<eos> Our asses have been through a hell of a lot more than being sued by someone like you, - so please just sit down.
Yeah.<eos> Ooh, look at all this.<eos> This must have cost a fortune.<eos> Slightly nicer than the last wedding we went to.<eos> Sarah and Jeb's, August 23, 2001.<eos> It was by a lake, and I remember that you teared up during their vows.<eos> Pollen count was off the charts up there.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> This is invitation only, and I asked you to speak to my lawyer if you want...<eos> And I asked you if you were having an affair with Laura Parks.
Mr. Allen, I have to ask you, can you think of anyone who would want to hurt you?<eos> I don't think so, no.<eos> What about your employees?<eos> Business?<eos> Domestic? Any personnel issues lately?<eos> We have over 250 people working for us.<eos> I mean, there's always issues, but why are we talking about this?<eos> We need to be looking for Mason.<eos> Mr. Allen, we have to explore every possibility.<eos> Is it possible someone else, a business rival maybe, would have a grudge against you?
Well, I'm successful.<eos> Success pisses people off sometimes, but I play fair.<eos> We have a good company.<eos> No.<eos> There's no one I can think of who would do something like this.<eos> Okay.<eos> And, no, to save you the trouble, there's no one else.<eos> Gwen and I are very much in love.<eos> Believe me,<eos> I wouldn't endanger my son's life for one second by keeping anything from you.
Yesterday morning.<eos> And he didn't tell you his name?<eos> No. Uh, come to think of it, he kept asking about my son.<eos> He wanted to know where he was living these days.<eos> And I told him that Jason was staying with a friend out in Maspeth.<eos> Mrs. Lutz, do you mind if I keep this card?<eos> - Huh?<eos> No. - Thank you.<eos> You've been very helpful.<eos> Someone will show you out.
Office hours are at 3:00.<eos> Dawes?<eos> Police.<eos> We need to talk to you.<eos> I did go by her parents' place.<eos> How come?<eos> Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?
That's what you want your competitors to believe, but Norah's parents told us that she was excited about a project at work, that it was going to take her away for a few months. You know what I think?<eos> I think she was helping you fast-track the technology, and she was training to go on the mission.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> When Joyce started showing interest in Norah, maybe you killed her to protect your little secret.<eos> Maybe one of my competitors is trying to set me up to take the blame here.<eos> Either way, you can direct all future questions to my lawyer, Clay Hibbard at Berkowitz and Etz. Great. We're so sorry to have bothered you.<eos> You know what, though, I think this is going to make an awesome story for the press, and the thing is, I love to be in the press.<eos> - I do. I really do.<eos> You don't have anything.<eos> An insider tip from a well-known cop is gonna open Pandora's box for you.
Now, if I go in as a candidate,<eos> I can dig around, find out who the killer is. It's very Agatha Christie.<eos> Okay, these people have been in training for months.<eos> What do you think, huh?<eos> You think you can just walk in there and join the team?<eos> Yeah, I know I can. I'm kind of a genius.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> He can fill you in.<eos> Listen, you don't have a choice.<eos> Either I go in, or we shut you down.
This room is airtight, which lets us play around with the Martian atmosphere in here.<eos> 95.3% carbon dioxide doesn't sound that playful.<eos> Which is why we need this.<eos> - It converts CO2 to oxygen.<eos> - Wow. First, we replicate Mars' atmosphere.<eos> I'm not a chemical engineer or anything, but if that doesn't turn this CO2 into oxygen, aren't we both gonna die?<eos> Normally we wear suits when we flood the room with CO2, but I bet you like to live on the edge.<eos> Let's get some oxygen in here.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> You got a pretty good set of lungs on you, Doc.
You have no idea how much...<eos> What?<eos> Forget it.<eos> It's okay, Frank.<eos> What's okay?<eos> We figured out who gave these Broadway tickets to Sadie.<eos> I thought maybe it was payment, or you were bangin' her.<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> She mattered to you.
- Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> To give me a big juicy collar,<eos> I need a witness who's brave enough to testify at trial.<eos> Are you gonna do that?<eos> anything you need.<eos> Fine, you can stay out here with me.<eos> If you shut up and stop annoying me.<eos> Sit down. Don't talk.<eos> - My anatomy thanks you.
Left him with a nasty scar on his arm.<eos> So, uh, Stevie.<eos> How long you been Lorenzo's accountant for?<eos> Uh... I don't know.<eos> Maybe about a year or so?<eos> I was on my way out, though.<eos> I don't think he liked the way I did business.<eos> Get down!<eos> That's odd.<eos> Seems like he was protecting you when we got shot at in the car.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Smart.<eos> Hiding in plain sight as the accountant.<eos> Hiding?<eos> Okay, are you sure you didn't take a blow to the head too?<eos> As a boy, Lorenzo was... was involved in a fire.<eos> His arm was badly burned.<eos> And I imagine the scars look a lot like what I just saw on your arm.<eos> So, uh... if I'm Lorenzo... then, like, wha... why didn't I kill you when I had the chance?
Who's first?<eos> - No, hold on a second.<eos> Shots. - Oh.<eos> Is to say thank you, thank you, here.<eos> Oh, my. - You gotta do it all in one.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> All right, to my partner, Al, who saves my ass every time, and, um, you know, occasionally I save his too.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> To Al.<eos> - And to the rest of you, thanks for being there for us.
They, uh, it's an exact replica of the game.<eos> It's like a haunted house type thing.<eos> Looks like Jason was killed sometime before closing.<eos> Couple of employees were setting up this morning, found the body.<eos> Manager's gonna come talk to us.<eos> - We got a weapon?<eos> - Take your pick.<eos> CSU blood splatter folks gonna love this.<eos> Detectives?<eos> Thank you so much. I'm Hannah Davis.
I'm sorry if I sound callous, but I assure you I had nothing to do with that young man's death.<eos> Why were you meeting with Jason?<eos> I meet with programmers all the time.<eos> You mean you steal them from other companies all the time.<eos> I mean I win.<eos> I'd heard good things about Jason and he was everything people said.<eos> We talked, I explained what I could offer, and then I told him to go enjoy "Satan's Palace IV."<eos> That was the last I saw of him. And we're done.<eos> If there's anything further,<eos> Jeff can put you in touch with my lawyers.
Now talk.<eos> Yes, all right.<eos> I knew about his work.<eos> We even worked together for a while, but Jason was so secretive,<eos> I felt like that he was shutting me out.<eos> So I finally told him, "Screw it," he could keep working by himself.<eos> Then you heard he had a breakthrough, right?<eos> Based on work you and he did together, right?<eos> Not only that, he was gonna sell it for a lot of money.<eos> You must have been so angry that he was gonna meet with Lisa Hexler without you.
Oh, I suppose so. It was 20 years ago.<eos> 23 years, actually.<eos> Exactly the same age as Jason.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You know what's interesting?<eos> Jason had a picture of himself as a little boy, and that woman was holding him.<eos> She's his mother, isn't she?<eos> And you're his father.<eos> I've got nothing to say.<eos> It's gonna be a lot easier for you if you just talk to us right now.
Yeah, good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shane and his family have been staying a few blocks away from here at his mother-in-law's house, so the local police will go over, they'll inform her...<eos> No, I need to tell Laura myself.<eos> Lieutenant Al Burns, wow.<eos> Shane is fishing, but he'll be home...<eos> No.<eos> No. God, no!<eos> We've been back for two months.<eos> I told him to call you, but he didn't wanna bother you.
Go.<eos> - Hey! - Freeze!<eos> Police.<eos> Hey, what the hell are you doing?<eos> - Where the hell is he?<eos> - Where's who?<eos> Who?<eos> The guy you're in here with, that's who.<eos> - There's no one here.<eos> - We could hear you in the hall.
- Hey! - Freeze!<eos> Police.<eos> Hey, what the hell are you doing?<eos> - Where the hell is he?<eos> - Where's who?<eos> Who?<eos> The guy you're in here with, that's who.<eos> - There's no one here.<eos> - We could hear you in the hall.<eos> We could hear you down the street.
Let me prove it this time.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I think we got something.<eos> Sorry, you want me to come back later, boss?<eos> No, Lieutenant Burns and I are... we're done.<eos> Okay, we got some surveillance footage coming in from an ATM two blocks from where Shane Barton was murdered.<eos> SUV matches the description that Sammy Gavlak gave us.<eos> I think we're about to see who killed Shane.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Sandra, these came for you.
I got eyes on the target.<eos> Nice to meet you, Ezekiel.<eos> Get your hands up.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Is this from Ezekiel's apartment?<eos> Aka Gibson Rowan.<eos> Toss me that bag for a second.<eos> Yep.<eos> Looks like we're almost there.<eos> Sandra, these came for you.
Okay, I got some news.<eos> You're not gonna like it.<eos> They found a letter jammed in the back of Russo's closet.<eos> I just sent it to your computer from the evidence room.<eos> I'm sorry about the quality.<eos> I guess I must have rushed when I scanned it or something.<eos> Somebody was blackmailing Russo.<eos> Yeah, that somebody was Shane Barton.<eos> All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> I appreciate what a shock Captain Russo's arrest must be for all of you.

Please pass it along to Lieutenant Burns when he gets back from booking.<eos> I'm gonna make it easy for you.<eos> Mine's short and sweet.<eos> There's no way she did this, so, yeah, I think I'm done.<eos> No, Detective Padilla, you're not.<eos> Needless to say, you're not to discuss your proposed testimony amongst yourselves, and you're not to go see Russo in Rikers.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> Why do you even need our statements?<eos> Seems like you already made up your mind.<eos> Detective Wells, we haven't had the pleasure, but your reputation precedes you.
Why do you even need our statements?<eos> Seems like you already made up your mind.<eos> Detective Wells, we haven't had the pleasure, but your reputation precedes you.<eos> I'm well aware of your history of disobeying orders.<eos> Trust me, you don't wanna disobey mine.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Here he comes.<eos> - Excuse me, Clay.<eos> Clay, do you feel vindicated now that they let you out?
I just met with the Police Commission, and I assured them that I will cooperate in any way I can with the investigation.<eos> I spent... years in prison for something that I did...<eos> I used to hear stories about guys released from prison after 20 years for something that they didn't do, and to be honest, I didn't care.<eos> I figured they had to do something to get there, but... but I was wrong, so in addition to trying to clear my name,<eos> I'm going to look at other questionable convictions and bring a cop's perspective to cases where injustice may have been done.<eos> I'm also going to...<eos> I'm also going to reach out to anyone who I may have... wronged over the years.<eos> Try to make things right.<eos> Anyhow, thanks for coming.<eos> God bless you.
See you've made yourself at home.<eos> You're looking at Jay?<eos> He's a boy scout.<eos> I'm just trying to familiarize myself with the unit.<eos> We're focused on Russo.<eos> I've been hearing that she has a history of corruption, and, as you know, 1PP has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to corruption.<eos> Maybe they should investigate themselves.<eos> We've gotten off on the wrong foot.<eos> Major Crimes is gonna need a new captain.<eos> I can't think of anyone better suited for the job than you.
- Hey, come on now, st...<eos> - Stay out of this, both of you.<eos> And, you, go screw yourself.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry, boss.<eos> I hate seeing you like this.<eos> Come on, I'm fine.<eos> Do you guys miss me?<eos> By the way, someone please tell Al he's gonna end up in here with me unless he cuts this shit out.<eos> We're gonna get you outta here.
If he got a gun off you, drugs, jewelry, he held on to it.<eos> A pack rat?<eos> That's pretty stupid for a crooked cop.<eos> He holds on to everything, so he has leverage to set up anybody who gets in his way.<eos> Means he's probably still got it somewhere, right?<eos> I heard just north of the city.<eos> Where north?<eos> That's all I got.<eos> Okay, that's a start.<eos> We find that stash, we might be able to find something that links him to Shane Barton's murder, and we get you outta here.
I didn't know you were in town.<eos> Yeah, um... back about five months now.<eos> I wish we were seeing each other under different circumstances, but I'm glad you're here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hold on, Reverend.<eos> I didn't come to see the boy.<eos> Not to help, at least. I came 'cause...<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> What you think I did, I assure you, I didn't.
Boss man rolling up his sleeves and getting dirty.<eos> I'm glad you approve.<eos> I'll leave you to... is there a term for what you was just doin'?<eos> Oh, I believe<eos> "breathtaking'."<eos> - Believe y'all won State that year.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You must be Coach Blantz.<eos> Call me Monty.<eos> Coach Owen spoke real highly of you, son.
See, that's my...<eos> That's my son!<eos> - Go, go, go! - That's my son!<eos> ♪ Girl, I wanna get you between your knees ♪<eos> - ♪ Your body... ♪<eos> - Just give it to me!<eos> - Just... just... - What the hell?<eos> You call your daddy?<eos> You call him again, I'm gonna beat both y'all asses!<eos> Belinda? Can I just have a word with you?
- Go, go, go! - That's my son!<eos> ♪ Girl, I wanna get you between your knees ♪<eos> - ♪ Your body... ♪<eos> - Just give it to me!<eos> - Just... just... - What the hell?<eos> You call your daddy?<eos> You call him again, I'm gonna beat both y'all asses!<eos> Belinda? Can I just have a word with you?<eos> I have to ask...<eos> I'm really detecting all these very aggressive vibes from you.
Dibs on Gamby!<eos> Oh, actually, I was going to be partners with Miss Snodgrass.<eos> Too late. Got your hand.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's definitely the hardest job in the world.<eos> Wardrobe mistress for "Kinky Boots" on Broadway.<eos> - Do I work long hours?<eos> - You're obsessed with your job.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> What's going on with you and Gamby?
Did you follow me here?<eos> No, I was just... Just doing a patrol of...<eos> I just needed a place to think.<eos> Looks like this is where the kids come to smoke.<eos> Figures.<eos> I couldn't control my own family. Why would I be able to control my school?<eos> Are you upset about that black gentleman?<eos> He's a lying, cheating' piece of shit.<eos> Never should have married that man.<eos> What happened with you two?
Deal.<eos> Deal!<eos> - Oh, Miss Snodgrass.<eos> - You heading to the closing ceremony?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You ran off.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I mean, the real question is, are you okay?<eos> Hayden came at you pretty hard.
Just... just let me say one thing.<eos> Um, Belinda, I know...<eos> I know that I fucked up in the past.<eos> Bad.<eos> Fact is... I failed you as a husband and for that, I'm sorry.<eos> I'll never forgive myself.<eos> But please... please don't let me fail my boys.<eos> Oh, real nice!<eos> Getting high on school grounds!<eos> Only reason I'm not expelling you two is 'cause y'all don't go to school here.
This way, you stupid piece of shit.<eos> God!<eos> You're going on a diet after this.<eos> "And at that very moment, Pinocchio awoke and opened wide his eyes."<eos> - Boys?<eos> - Oh, hey, B.<eos> Someone's here to see you.<eos> Boys, you got a hug for your daddy?<eos> Come here!<eos> Oh, let me look at you!
I really appreciated our talk.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Hold up, Russell.<eos> How did it go? Good.<eos> No problems whatsoever.<eos> Your boys, they're a dream.<eos> You a lyin' sack of shit.<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Oh, here you are!<eos> I've been looking all over for you. Oh, hey.
It's called being a good person.<eos> Maybe you should try it sometimes instead of kissing doctors' asses all day.<eos> It's the hospital.<eos> Meet me outside.<eos> Bitch boy.<eos> Not another fucking word out of you.<eos> Bitch boy, bitch boy, bitch boy...<eos> Uh, can you please just put this on debit, please?<eos> - Bitch boy!<eos> - What's she calling you? "Beach boy"?
I'm having a little bit of fun.<eos> Whoa.<eos> I can't believe you let me fuck you in a bus. Hey.<eos> Can you imagine if we got caught doing that?<eos> - We'd lose our jobs.<eos> - Well... - Motherfucker.<eos> - ...you'd better play it cool then.<eos> - You better play it cool.<eos> - Mr. Gamby! There you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
Hey! I don't want to see anyone's goddamn teeth. You understand?<eos> Zip the lips, purse them now.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> This is why you don't drink Icehouse at band practice.<eos> Hope you all are proud of yourselves.<eos> Jason Strombone is in the emergency room.<eos> Because of your poor choices, none of you will be participating in the Winter Concert.<eos> I'm first chair. My grandparents are coming in from out of town.<eos> Mr. Gamby's going easy on you.
One week, ISS circle.<eos> No Winter Concert, and, of course, all of y'all parents are gonna hear from me.<eos> I'm sorry for interfering back there, Mr. Gamby.<eos> I just have strong opinions on the matter.<eos> No, no, no worries.<eos> Uh, I appreciate it. I...<eos> I respected the fact that you related it to your own struggles.<eos> Kudrows.<eos> Mr. Gamby? How would you like to be vice principal, by yourself?<eos> We'd create the position Chief Accountability Officer for you.
My daddy always said, if you fall, you can't quit. You gotta get right back on the horse.<eos> On the horse?<eos> How dare you mention horses when you forced us to sell Shadowfax?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, I didn't make anyone sell anything.<eos> That is not fair, Neal.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't give a... fuck about what's fair and what's not fair, 'cause I'm gonna tell you right now, there is no more motorcycles.<eos> I don't want to hear either of you trying to talk her into that... shit.
The answer is no.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Gamby, maybe you should just take her up on it.<eos> Honestly, I'm... I'm of no use to you.<eos> We gave it a good run... but our mission failed.<eos> The bitch won, Gamby.<eos> The bitch hasn't won.<eos> Let's finish what we started.<eos> Wait here.<eos> - What's up with you?
So, that's dumb. Don't say that.<eos> Would you stop trying to be Columbo and figure out all the crimes.<eos> 'Cause you don't know anything that's going on, okay?<eos> - This fucking guy.<eos> - This fucking guy.<eos> Look, it's what Lee said.<eos> It's, uh, substance abuse.<eos> In fact, I know that it's substance abuse, so...<eos> Next question, please.<eos> Does this mean that one of you is going to be taking over her job as principal?
Big red flag like that and I missed it. Guess who looks like a horse's ass now, huh?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> You don't look like a horse's ass at all.<eos> You know what they say about the past, though, you just shouldn't live in it.<eos> Gotta focus on the future.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Anyway, I'm gonna be relying on the two of you to help get us through this.<eos> Anything that we can do to help, Jeremy.<eos> North Jackson needs both of you.<eos> That's why I'm asking you to serve as co-interim principals, share the office while we sort this whole mess out.
We have the powder consignment.<eos> We broke a wheel on the road.<eos> General, you're injured.<eos> Salute a superior officer!<eos> And the rest of you!<eos> Take cover!<eos> Don't move.<eos> There you are, Luc!<eos> Excuse us, gentlemen.<eos> I'm sorry if the children's play has disturbed you.
Come, brothers, open the gates.<eos> We seek shelter, brother.<eos> We were attacked on the road.<eos> You are welcome.<eos> Let them in, brothers.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> You said you were attacked.<eos> Have you any wounded?<eos> There will be others coming, Spanish soldiers.<eos> Keep your counsel, do as I say and we will leave you in peace.
- Don't worry.<eos> Louis was blessed to escape your father's illness.<eos> Louis was always blessed.<eos> His mother was Marie de Medici.<eos> My mother was a chamber maid.<eos> Well, not exactly a chamber maid.<eos> Lady in waiting, but you know what I mean.<eos> The question of your birth never bothered the king.<eos> He has a generous spirit.<eos> More sober council has advised him to disown you.
Open the gate.<eos> That's the man I saw on the battlefield.<eos> We need to get everyone out of here.<eos> They might be going for reinforcements.<eos> Keep watch outside the wall.<eos> Nobody leaves.<eos> We wait until dark.<eos> If we can keep the children hidden until then, we stand a chance.<eos> D'Artagnan.<eos> Was Aramis really one of you?
Give me the canteen.<eos> William.<eos> You were sent here for us, weren't you?<eos> You're part of the ambush.<eos> Yes.<eos> Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo in case he ran.<eos> How'd you know about the train?<eos> Sent word from Pariah.<eos> New recruit told them a man and a woman double-crossed us, along with Lazo.<eos> We were ordered to kill you all.
Let's brick this bitch and get out of here.<eos> The greatest shame in life is to perish without purpose, which is why I always consume my victims fresh.<eos> Moist.<eos> Try, "Consume my victims moist."<eos> Now, once more, with feeling.<eos> Almost sensual.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> No... no.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I was... I was hoping I was going to see you again. I want...
Fine.<eos> You're not the only one with secrets.<eos> Ford has personally asked me to create a villain for his new narrative.<eos> It's very... very hush-hush.<eos> You really think that Ford has entrusted you with a key character for his story?<eos> He's already almost finished with it.<eos> He dug up some old town on the fringes of the park, created a horde of masked men to terrorize guests and proselytize-cum-advertise the coming of some end-all villain named Wyatt.<eos> That isn't Wyatt.<eos> That's busywork.<eos> But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore, I think that you are ready for a real job.

In fact, Maeve's tab was in such excellent standing, she deserved a token of gratitude.<eos> How about a double round on me?<eos> Top shelf, of course.<eos> Run!<eos> Maeve, is something wrong?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Clementine took the other girls and treated the newcomers at the far table to a stunning view of their most popular attractions.<eos> On the house.<eos> You boys are new.<eos> Not much of a rind on you.
If you're riding into our town under the company of armed men, you'll need to state your business.<eos> Mayhem.<eos> The sheriff judged the riders to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens.<eos> The marshals decided to practice their quick draws with each other.<eos> Thank you for dealing with an unfortunate situation.<eos> Now we can resume... work on our new narrative without interference.<eos> And Hale?<eos> Won't she be an impediment?<eos> No doubt she will try. But I'm sure we'll be able to keep them at bay.<eos> Something else is troubling you.
Hey, nice wheels.<eos> Thanks.<eos> See ya.<eos> Welcome to the Tamarack Motor Court.<eos> I need a room, do you have one?<eos> Okeydoke.<eos> Okay.<eos> $5.<eos> All right.<eos> Room eight's ready for you.
Doing your homework.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Now, how did you find us?<eos> Was it the sign outside?<eos> No, actually a friend told me about this place.<eos> Al Templeton?<eos> He stayed here.<eos> I don't recall anybody by that name.<eos> Oh, my mistake.<eos> What brings you to Dallas, Mr. Amberson?
Won't be long.<eos> You got five minutes.<eos> Howdy, folks!<eos> Can someone tell me if Mrs. Alma May Urbano is on board?<eos> Alma May Urbano?<eos> There you are!<eos> Hello, dear.<eos> Very good to meet you.<eos> My name's Jimmy.<eos> I tried to visit you at Sandpiper, but they wouldn't allow me to.
Well, might not some parties, the opposing counsel for example, see this differential and conclude that there may have been some solicitation involved?<eos> I did not solicit.<eos> I'm just wondering how you account for your success.<eos> Because it will definitely raise eyebrows over at Schweikart and Cokely.<eos> I'm sorry, but it will.<eos> Particularly in a case involving seniors for whom the ethical guidelines on solicitation were virtually created by the ABA.<eos> Chuck, I'm sure that...<eos> Jimmy, if you could clear this up that would be helpful.<eos> I went to Amarillo to confer with the client and to make sure that we had a solid good-faith basis for our case there. Overall.<eos> As many of you are aware, I've visited more than my share of retirement homes.
Chao cac co, ladies.<eos> Son of a...<eos> You haven't unpacked yet?<eos> Kevin and Paige are here.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I don't know exactly what Chuck may have said to you, but just so you know, I did not ask him to step in on my behalf.<eos> Hi, guys!<eos> Sorry for the wait.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> So good to see you again.
Thanks. But I'm pretty sure I lost.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> It's an unwinnable position.<eos> That's why your boss didn't bother showing up.<eos> But you went down swinging, and I admire that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing for lunch?<eos> Probably just grabbing something from the vending machines. Oof.<eos> We can do better than that.<eos> Mr. Schweikart. Good to see you, sir.
I'm an engineer.<eos> Like Casey Jones, with the hat?<eos> No, idiot. An engineer-engineer.<eos> Not an "engineer." Dale builds things.<eos> I design things.<eos> Spillways and drainage fields, mostly.<eos> I don't actually build them.<eos> Well, that's cool. Yeah.<eos> But you could still wear the hat, though.<eos> Right? Nothing stopping you.
Absolutely.<eos> I'll tell him right now.<eos> I'm sure we can get something on the books tomorrow.<eos> Day after, at the latest.<eos> Thank you, Paige.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Yes!<eos> There she is.<eos> Hi. KIM:<eos> Hi. Paige, so good to see you! You, too.
Mine was, too, back when my dad ran the place!<eos> Wow.<eos> I can remember the cover of my first passbook.<eos> It was a silhouette of a...<eos> Cowboy. A cowboy on horseback.<eos> Yes. Standing next to a cactus.<eos> I loved that cowboy.<eos> Far as I was concerned, I was saving up for that horse.<eos> What the heck else is money good for when you're seven years old?<eos> So, we have a little presentation for you in our conference room.
She's a keeper. Shall we?<eos> KEVIN:<eos> Well, I think that couldn't have gone any better.<eos> Pleasure to meet you. Fantastic.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Thanks for setting this up.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> HOWARD:<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Right back at you.
Months of work for HHM.<eos> Maybe years.<eos> Good morning, Rudolpho.<eos> Good morning, Mr. McGill.<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> I didn't know anyone was here.<eos> Just dropping off some Sandpiper stuff.<eos> You're in early.<eos> More like late.<eos> Well, regardless of the hour, good to see you here.
Just a splash of soy milk.<eos> Kim?<eos> Um, make two cups.<eos> Well, I guess it's true what they say.<eos> The early bird gets the worm.<eos> Which is good, if you like worms.<eos> May I ask you a question?<eos> Of course. Do I have a future at this firm?<eos> We have a lot in common, you and I.<eos> My brother left you holding the bag.

Do I have a future at this firm?<eos> We have a lot in common, you and I.<eos> My brother left you holding the bag.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, you're not the first person to go out on a limb for him.<eos> I made the same mistake over and over again.<eos> And now Howard has.<eos> And he blames you.
No.<eos> I'll talk to Howard.<eos> Pour a little oil on troubled waters.<eos> You're being wasted down in doc review.<eos> Good job with Mesa Verde.<eos> Mind if I join you?<eos> Hi. What can I get you?<eos> Coffee.<eos> Black. Coming right up.<eos> He really did a number on you.
That's right.<eos> I would like for you to tell the police that the gun was yours.<eos> Would you?<eos> You're both a little hot under the collar about whether you bumped his car or not.<eos> But there was a scuffle and he got your gun.<eos> My gun? Your gun from your pocket.<eos> He got it, and that's how his prints got on it.<eos> Then I would be subject to the gun charge.<eos> You're an ex-cop.<eos> They'll go easy on you.
Dad, it's a rip-off! Just like that bum from last week.<eos> Jimmy...<eos> Every grifter in town knows that this is the spot to come for an easy handout. "Grifter"?<eos> Where in the world did you learn that word?<eos> Dad. His story is baloney.<eos> He probably doesn't even have a son.<eos> He's conning you.<eos> Jimmy, what if you're wrong?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm sorry to bother you folks.
No, no, no.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - No, no bother.<eos> Come on, no.<eos> Here $10 for you.<eos> Sir, you're...<eos> That's...<eos> That is so generous. Of course, and you know what?<eos> I'm gonna go back in the stockroom,<eos> I'm gonna find those spark plugs, and we will get your car started for you, okay?
- So, whose gun was it?<eos> - Who's to say?<eos> You know how many guns there are in Albuquerque?<eos> Somewhere between the number of rattlesnakes and grains of sand.<eos> So, a lot. Was it your gun, Mr. Ehrmantraut?<eos> No, he is not saying that.<eos> Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?<eos> The gun wasn't Salamanca's.<eos> That's all I can tell you.<eos> You told us it was. You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.
And Mr. Salamanca caught it and tried to throw it away. I mean, the possibilities are endless.<eos> Has Salamanca threatened you, Mr. Ehrmantraut?<eos> Hey. We wanna put this guy away for years.<eos> The gun makes all the difference, you know that.<eos> You gonna let this person victimize you twice?<eos> Forget about the gun.<eos> All right? The gun was not Salamanca's.<eos> If you try to introduce it in evidence, Mr. Ehrmantraut will make himself available to the defense, and he will set the record straight.<eos> Categorically and unequivocally.<eos> Did he threaten you, or pay you off?
I snuck in.<eos> Yeah, but make it quick.<eos> Actually, can we talk in the conference room?<eos> Why?<eos> It's just more appropriate.<eos> No one's gonna need it till 4:00.<eos> I checked.<eos> Please.<eos> Ten minutes, tops.<eos> After you.
I was there almost, well, 10 years ago now.<eos> Pulled yourself up by your bootstraps.<eos> I like that.<eos> I see you went to UNM Law, are you from New Mexico?<eos> Not originally.<eos> I'm from the Midwest.<eos> A tiny little town, barely on the map.<eos> Near the Kansas-Nebraska border.<eos> You've never heard of it.<eos> So, what brought you here?
- It was great to meet you, Lynne. - You, too.<eos> - Perry.<eos> - Pleasure, Kim.<eos> - Howard.<eos> - It's Rich, actually.<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. - No, no.<eos> I'm happy to be confused with Howard.<eos> He's a damn good-looking man!<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Come on, I'll walk you out.
Excuse me.<eos> Hi, Paige. It's Kim.<eos> Yeah, hi.<eos> Just checking that we're still on for lunch on Monday.<eos> Great.<eos> And Kevin, too?<eos> Good.<eos> Well, before we meet, there's some news you need to know about.<eos> I am not the safe choice.<eos> The safe choice for you would be HHM.
I am not the safe choice.<eos> The safe choice for you would be HHM.<eos> I believe, however, that I am... the right choice.<eos> Why?<eos> That suit you're wearing... did you buy it off the rack?<eos> Please don't tell me it looks like I did.<eos> If it did, I wouldn't have asked.<eos> So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?<eos> Because it fits you and you alone.<eos> Because each and every stitch was fretted over with you in mind.
Thank you.<eos> Talk soon, gentlemen.<eos> Chuck, that...<eos> That was amazing.<eos> You were fantastic. Trul...<eos> Whoa. Chuck?<eos> Get me home.<eos> Ernie!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Again, we want to thank you for accommodating the Major like this.
I-I don't quite underst... 1261.<eos> - 1261.<eos> - Is this gonna be a problem?<eos> No, I'm sure it won't be. Um, M-Mr.<eos> Commissioner, I apologize.<eos> Unaccountably, there appears to be a... discrepancy in our filing.<eos> So the correct address the one that appeared in the notice of intent, the 1261?<eos> It would seem so.<eos> Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd like to request a, um, an adjournment of just a few minutes so that we can amend the filing to reflect the correct address.<eos> Well, I-I can give you an adjournment, uh, uh, but, uh... uh, I don't think we can get you back in today.
Then you stuck around.<eos> To watch. Why?<eos> Just wanted to see me suffer? Ernesto:<eos> Mr. mcgill?<eos> Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense?<eos> I called him.<eos> What?<eos> I called Jimmy earlier, before I picked you up.<eos> He showed up when he did because I called him.<eos> I was worried about you, and I just...
Thanks. Man :<eos> Jimmy isonsale!<eos> Buthurry... Oh, finally.<eos> So how is he?<eos> The good news is that physically, he's okay.<eos> The radiologist said everything looks normal with Charles' head and spine.<eos> So, we took his neck collar off.<eos> His head wound will heal just fine.<eos> We gave him a tetanus shot because his immunization records were not current.<eos> I'm sure that's no surprise to you.
- Mary Hawkins, Madame.<eos> I'm sure I've heard that name before.<eos> Thought we came here to prevent a rebellion, and the head of the rebellion is Charles Stuart.<eos> God demands that a Catholic king sit on the English throne.<eos> He'll get us all killed if we don't stop him.<eos> All we have to do is see to it that his war chest remains empty.<eos> That was the Minister of Finance!<eos> Perhaps there is some way I can be of service.<eos> Alex is the younger brother of Captain Jonathan Randall.<eos> I will have to tell Jonathan that I've met you.
Why, is there something wrong with Frenchmen?<eos> You don't know about Frenchmen?<eos> How they...<eos> You are English.<eos> Do you know what she's talking about?<eos> I'm afraid I don't.<eos> Well, of course you wouldn't.<eos> You're husband's so g-gentle and so kind.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I know he doesn't trouble you in... that way.
The moon?<eos> Seaford.<eos> In Sussex.<eos> I found this in the, uh... the attic of my grandmother's house in Sussex.<eos> So even your grandmother was a historian.<eos> Well, all families recorded the births, deaths, and marriages in the front - of the family Bible. - Mm-hmm.<eos> This one only goes back seven generations, but according to this, your beloved husband got his start in 1746, when Jonathon Wolverton Randall... Married Miss Mary Hawkins.<eos> Ma chère, Claire.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I hope I didn't upset you.
Hey.<eos> You're keeping a secret to save his life and if it keeps the lad from running off in a blind fury only to meet his maker at the end of a rope,<eos> Thank you.<eos> Aye.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I have some business with yer maid to finish.<eos> I don't suppose you've ever thought of birth control?<eos> Control?<eos> Never mind. I'll pick up something for Suzette.<eos> Our involvement in Austria has depleted our resources.<eos> The King is not inclined to fund another foreign adventure, but I'm here to play chess, not to debate politics, and I will have you in three moves.

But chess on a grand scale?<eos> How long have you been planning that?<eos> Since you opened with a Spanish game.<eos> I'm going to get you.
How long have you been planning that?<eos> Since you opened with a Spanish game.<eos> I'm going to get you.<eos> Check.<eos> The game is yours... again.<eos> You played well.<eos> But, if I may return to more pressing matters.<eos> When you and I first met, you offered to be of service if ever I needed you.<eos> You know, James, if you desire my help, it would not be a bad idea to lose a game once in a while.<eos> I respect you too much to allow such a cheap victory.
Which would be?<eos> Maison Elise.<eos> I have not been there in months.<eos> My wife...<eos> She need not know.<eos> You can honestly tell her you're simply out with me... playing chess.<eos> _ _<eos> _ _<eos> Ah, Madonna!<eos> What a pleasure to see you again.
Jamie... what are you doing here?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I need help.<eos> Musically speaking.<eos> Well, you did say Mother Hildegarde kens music.<eos> I was hoping...<eos> Wondering... if there was something odd about the music.<eos> The way it's written.<eos> Can you assure me what you're doing is neither illegal nor dangerous?<eos> I can assure you, if my husband is asking, then it's for a good reason.
Previously...<eos> Someone tried to poison me.<eos> For you, Madonna.
Madame?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I must go now.<eos> Be well, Madonna.<eos> I am no Madonna.<eos> I have no child.<eos> I didn't call you Madonna because you were with child, my dear.
Yours is blue.<eos> Like the Virgin's cloak.<eos> Like my own.<eos> You shouldn't have come.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> You were right about the king.<eos> He wants blood now.<eos> _<eos> But these are things you do for your friends.<eos> Will I ever see you again?
_<eos> No. _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Now, tell me what it is that I may do for you.
He could do with me as he liked.<eos> I waited to see what His Majesty's pleasure might be.<eos> Tell me, if I was to grant your request to free your husband... would you be inclined to grant me a small favor in return?<eos> I am at Your Majesty's complete disposal.<eos> Très bien.<eos> Très bien, ma chère.<eos> Come.<eos> So pale.<eos> So fine.<eos> I can see why they call you La Dame Blanche.
And the search for wisdom be perverted into the desire for power and wealth for one's own depraved and immoral purpose.<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.<eos> I beseech you to use your talents, look into their souls and if there is darkness within, they will be handed over to M'sieur Forez and put to death.
Previously...<eos> We will unite the clans, and I will lead you all to glory.
This isn't a war where you risk no more than your lives in battle.<eos> No, no, this is treason.<eos> If we fail, then all those that support the Stuarts are likely to end up on a scaffold.<eos> They're true Scots.<eos> Every man prepared to fight and die for their true king.<eos> I much prefer they fight and live for their king.<eos> I'm James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.<eos> I command this army.<eos> If you do not wish to be here, then it is my order that you leave now and return to your homes.<eos> None will think less of you and no harm will follow.
Sassenach.<eos> All right!<eos> Release the lady, and I will tell you whatever you wish.<eos> Good.<eos> Hold her...<eos> Until the boy answers my questions.<eos> My name is William Grey, second son of Viscount Melton.<eos> And what of the troops you're with?<eos> 200 infantry, traveling to Dunbar to join General Cope's army.<eos> And I'll warn you...
Take this man in the direction he says the camp lies.<eos> If the information he gave us proves true, tie him to a tree one mile from the camp.<eos> His friends will find him there tomorrow.<eos> If what he told us is not true... Then cut his throat.<eos> Gladly.<eos> I give you your life.<eos> I hope you use it well.<eos> I owe you my life.<eos> I should greatly prefer not to, but since you have forced the gift upon me, I must regard it as a debt of honor.<eos> I should hope to discharge that debt in the future, and once it is discharged, I will kill you.
All right. But-but...<eos> play it subtle, all right?<eos> Subtle. Yeah.<eos> Frank. Play it subtle. I got it.<eos> Subtle.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello?<eos> Ango Gablogian, the art collector.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure. Yes.<eos> I'm gonna invite you to a show.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> I'm really not interested in buying anything.<eos> But you own an art gallery. Oh, no. Oh.<eos> I rent an art gallery, or more accurately, my parents rent one for me.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> So that painting I bought from you was worthless?<eos> Of course not.<eos> It meant something to you.
Hit it!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, fellowship was fun.<eos> Yeah, see? It doesn't have to be all dour and penitent to praise God.<eos> Is it my turn?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay.<eos> Aah! No!<eos> I failed!<eos> It's okay. I failed. I failed you.
She was never in any danger.<eos> Lust? Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, Mac.<eos> You're soaking wet.<eos> Are you okay? Yeah. I was out in the rain looking for a sign from God.<eos> I never got the timing right, but doesn't matter.<eos> The point is, I thought I was here for you guys to open my mind.<eos> But now I realized I'm here to close yours!<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Guys, I'm here to convert you.
I am throwing this case out.<eos> I should've done it hours ago.<eos> He's throwing it out! That means we win!<eos> That means we win!<eos> That means we won!<eos> Damn, damn, damn! Son of a bitch!<eos> Order. Damn! Damn it!<eos> (shouting) Order!<eos> This court has ruled.<eos> Now, I suggest that you people get the hell out of my courtroom before I put you all in jail.
When I visited him in hospital, he was seeing grapes.<eos> He said, "Shouldn't we pick the grapes?"<eos> "Goodness gracious!"<eos> "What's that barrel of pickled cabbage?"<eos> "It'll stink up the place."<eos> How old is he? 80? -No, 79.<eos> He said,<eos> "That diamond by the window is mine."<eos> "I've had it for 20 years."<eos> "Damn you all if you take it from me!"
You said you'd behave!<eos> Zip it, or I'll knock your teeth out!<eos> Keep it down, please, you'll wake my kid!<eos> You wanted him in.<eos> Easy with the threats! -What threats?<eos> She's my daughter!<eos> All the more so!<eos> Why are you keeping me out of my sister-in-law's house?<eos> It's my house too, OK?<eos> -Yes. I'm not keeping you out, but please keep it down.
That's how you alienate everybody.<eos> Everybody?<eos> Your son? Who you manipulated against me all of your life?<eos> I'm telling you for the last time: act civilized or leave!<eos> Tony, we want to eat.<eos> What's left now you've woken Irina?<eos> No, he's right.<eos> -How many times do I need to ask him?<eos> I apologize for everything!<eos> -I ask you kindly!
Why do we have to make a big scene?<eos> ...you ignorant cow!<eos> That's enough, granny!<eos> Enough. Call your mom a granny!<eos> Don't talk to him like that, you cow!<eos> Enough!<eos> Please get in the car and calm down!<eos> You filthy cow.<eos> I apologise on my wife's behalf,<eos> I apologise for calling you granny, but let's calm down.
You mean you're not a doctor anymore?<eos> What'll I do?<eos> Go home and wait for our call.<eos> And what if she stays paralysed?<eos> Come on, Tony. Be a man, what the fuck!<eos> I did nothing else but open her eyes.<eos> We know, Tony, everybody knows.<eos> Tell him, Lary!<eos> Come on, Tony, let's go.<eos> I'll go home and wait for one of you to call.
-Thank you.<eos> - I just think maybe, I have my hands full.<eos> - Um.. - I'm riding with you.<eos> -Um, look, I've gotta go.<eos> Do you want something to eat?<eos> - No one understands what my life has become.<eos> What a total fucking miserable thing my life has become!<eos> No one understands one fucking thing!<eos> I wish my wife would roll over on the highway.<eos> - Oh, my God. I swear, I will leave you right here.
No. You can't say those things to me.<eos> - I'll, uh, uh..<eos> Not another word.<eos> I'll be...<eos> - You can't talk like that.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I'll be quiet.<eos> -Okay.<eos> - Listen, now, Will..<eos> Yeah, I don't wanna press you, I want you to take your time.
So, uh, he's got Big Man up here on the 3rd floor.<eos> Uh, here's where they keep the dead files.<eos> And, uh, this is a little sketch to, to find your way in.<eos> - Wow, really?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Little precaution.<eos> - As soon as you take off your coat, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> -Alright, arms out.<eos> -I remember you.
- You don't have to go in there.<eos> There's other ways to go about this.<eos> -No, we got this handled.<eos> Don't need any big production, right, Wells?<eos> -Well, I'm here.<eos> So..<eos> - Okay, you just, you know, keep him engaged in the, in the conversation.<eos> You know, just try to be compassionate.<eos> You know, let him feel like he's being heard.<eos> It's important that he sees you as being his advocate.
- Huh. No, I didn't.<eos> So, uh, does that make him a prince?<eos> - Uh, sort of.<eos> If 14 people die, I'll be king.<eos> How likely is that?<eos> - Not very.<eos> I've got the file.<eos> Should I come?<eos> - We're in the 3rd cubicle from the door.<eos> I'm sorry to get you out of bed.
- Sure. - Okay.<eos> Buddy, take the stairs, and you go on outside.<eos> And tell them if they try anything, I'll kill the woman.<eos> She's my lawyer.<eos> I got reason to kill her.<eos> You tell 'em that.<eos> You can still help me.<eos> - Yeah, if... if... if you turn yourself in we can turn up a mental defense, and get you a good lawyer.<eos> - I'll slip out the back, where they don't expect me you go out the front to the parking lot where you came in, and keep 'em busy.<eos> Stand near the door and pretend I've got the gun on you.
"How are you?<eos> How are you?"<eos> And then... then they answer, that goes..<eos> - "I'm just fine, I'm just fine."<eos> - It's not gonna be enough for a whole house but a wall maybe.<eos> - We could plant some trees where the rock pile is.<eos> Ryan would help you.<eos> Oh, honey, give him our cards, so that he has our numbers.<eos> -Well.. All of those numbers will work.<eos> - Your wife works for you.
If I get through that, there's a road block just outside of Livingston.<eos> Then I get to sleep for five hours take a shower, go to work at 8:00 do a bunch of crap nobody else wants to do and learn some more school law tomorrow night..<eos> Leave work early the next day and drive all the way back here.. With my eyes twitching.<eos> It was nice of you to bring the horse.<eos> Can you take me back to my car?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, and have a good night.<eos> -What?<eos> - Apparently, Ms. Travis found the drive from Livingston too arduous so I'll take over the class for the rest of the term.<eos> I practice law here in town and as some of you know and the rest of you, you would find out soon enough.. I am recently divorced.
- We believe she has another job here in town.<eos> -I drove over.<eos> - Thought I was in the wrong place.<eos> You drove here?<eos> - I was sorry you stopped teaching the class.<eos> I looked forward to it.<eos> - I was gonna tell you on Tuesday<eos> I asked for a replacement, 'cause of the, uh, drive. - That drive is pretty bad.<eos> -Right.<eos> - I don't mean to keep you from getting to work or anything. I just knew if I didn't start driving
I'm useless to 'em up top.<eos> Gotta do my part somehow.<eos> You shouldn't talk that way, you know.<eos> We got our share of useless fucks on this crew.<eos> You ain't one.<eos> This is the second time in the last few months I'm facing certain death.<eos> And you are again offering moral support.<eos> Does that mean we're married?<eos> Don't.<eos> Fuckin' hell. What part of "let us take care of you" did you not understand?
This is the second time in the last few months I'm facing certain death.<eos> And you are again offering moral support.<eos> Does that mean we're married?<eos> Don't.<eos> Fuckin' hell. What part of "let us take care of you" did you not understand?<eos> If it wasn't for you, we'd all be planted at the bottom of the Charles Town bay.<eos> We got a debt for that.<eos> It ain't right not to let us pay it.<eos> All the shit we been through the last few months, do you wanna know what the most terrifying part of all of it's been?<eos> "We'll take care of you."
After that, my credibility with crews on the beach was in good order.<eos> And the protégé, what was his name?<eos> His name was Charles Vane.<eos> Leave us, please.<eos> Now.<eos> I need very specific answers to the following questions.<eos> Ask me what you want to ask me.<eos> Charles Vane sided with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Betrayed his mentor, betrayed Edward Teach for you?
I was fully prepared to set foot on that island and say his name, say that the universal pardon had an exception, put my credibility at risk based solely on your counsel, and it was all to settle a personal feud<eos> with a former lover?<eos> You know these men's names, you know the things they have done.<eos> But I know them.<eos> I know Flint is dangerous, but he can be reasoned with.<eos> I know Rackham is devious, but all he cares about is his legacy.<eos> And because I have history with Charles Vane, I know him most of all.<eos> I'm all too aware what he is capable of destroying when he sets his mind on it.<eos> The Lord Governor Ashe underestimated him, and Charles Town burned.<eos> What is it you would like to have him take from you?
Flint had them exactly where he needed them.<eos> But he had me there, too.<eos> - These are identical.<eos> - What are you suggesting?<eos> That we exchange it, find partners, and trade coin for commodities far easier to protect.<eos> I returned to go on the account as I know it, because in this place<eos> I believed I could find the men necessary to do so.<eos> And in particular one man that I thought worthy of standing alongside me at the head of a terrible fleet.<eos> I'm all too aware what Charles Vane's capable of destroying when he sets his mind on it.<eos> What is it you would like to have him take from you?
So why are you so concerned about the time?<eos> There were a number of parties to whom I had to make promises in exchange for their support of this operation, schedules that had to be met.<eos> And with many of these parties, Whitehall, my equity investors, my creditors, the lapse of a deadline or two might be bargained away.<eos> But there is one particular party whose Patience I do not wish to test, a party whose history with the pirates of Nassau suggests an extreme reaction would likely follow.<eos> Spain.<eos> What did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would seize fort Nassau, secure the remains of the Urca de Lima's gold stored within it, and return it to Havana.<eos> Promptly.<eos> Failure to do so would confirm for them that I am simply a pirate by another name, not to be trusted, and would result in a launch of a fleet of ten ships and soldiers numbering 1,500 to raze Nassau to the ground.<eos> How long did they give you?
I'm asserting that as captain in a life-threatening situation, it is my right to have complete control over ship and men for the sake of their collective welfare until such time as we emerge from this situation.<eos> In the meantime, I will compile two lists.<eos> Those men entitled to full food and water rations, and those only on limited water for the time being.<eos> We'll need to keep a close eye on him.<eos> As dehydration sets in, we will all be subject to its effects.<eos> Loss of reason, anger...<eos> Eventually hallucinations.<eos> He isn't losing' his mind.<eos> He's been concerned about this for some time.<eos> About you.
During that feud with Vane over the fort, I sat in his cabin and I watched him turn himself inside out over the idea that anyone in Nassau would see him as the villain in that story.<eos> Well, now he's the greatest villain in the new world.<eos> We all see it. We all follow him because of it.<eos> I think it's torture for him, and I think the only way he can imagine it stopping is when there are no more of us left to witness it.<eos> Fucking thieves!<eos> You both stand accused of a crime most serious.<eos> Theft of food held in reserve in a time such as this is a betrayal of trust of the most profound sort.<eos> The penalty for such a betrayal is, by necessity, extreme.<eos> You were both charged with keeping watch over what little remains of our food stores.<eos> A full day's rations are now gone, yet each of you accuses the other of the crime.

As your quartermaster, as your friend,<eos> I'm going to implore you one last time, whichever of you is the guilty man, to confess.<eos> Repair in some small part the trust you've breached with your brothers.<eos> I swear, I wouldn't have done such a thing.<eos> I don't have it in me.<eos> Please don't fucking hang me.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> You all seen me these last few weeks out here.<eos> Never blubbered, never bitched.<eos> I weathered this shit as well as any of you.
I am.<eos> You speak for your men?<eos> Yes?<eos> Then I speak with you.<eos> How did you find this place?<eos> We were defeated in battle.<eos> Thrown by a storm onto your shore.<eos> There was no design in it.<eos> Who else knew your position?<eos> Who else knows where to find you?
Your enemies on the island.<eos> You seem concerned about what I'm gonna hear them say about you.<eos> Maybe it would be better to hear it now while all else is quiet.<eos> They would say I'm untrustworthy.<eos> That I would turn on anyone at any time, no matter how close they were to me... no matter who it hurt or how severely.<eos> That, given my history, only a fool would allow me to get close to them again.<eos> Would they be right?<eos> You tamed this place once.<eos> Despite what anyone may say of you, and I desire your counsel, despite what anyone may say of you.<eos> So let us move forward, despite what anyone, whether from your world or from mine, may say of you.
He might have something to say about killing them.<eos> Your father aids us from his position in Nassau.<eos> He might have lived among these men.<eos> He may have fought beside these men.<eos> He may have even called some of these men friends.<eos> But when it comes to the safety of the people in this place, your father knows the final decision is mine.<eos> - You know where you're going, yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When you reach the beach, make no attempt into the trees.<eos> They will find you and guide you through.
So... let us assume that I can offer you something better.<eos> You have hidden in this place for a lifetime, hidden from the harsh realities that lie beyond this veil that you have constructed here, but the moment that that shot entered his belly, that veil began to unravel,<eos> and sooner or later, you are going to have to confront these realities, chief among them being that England takes whatever, whenever, however it wants.<eos> Lives.<eos> Loves.<eos> Labor.<eos> Spirits.<eos> Homes.<eos> It has taken them from me.<eos> I imagine that it has taken it from you.
I said... yes.<eos> It turns out the man's name is Juan Antonio Grandal and his employer is the intelligence department of the Casa De Contratación.<eos> Upon our arrival, I received a query from them.<eos> It said the department spies had learned of a series of transactions to exchange a significant portion of the Urca De Lima's prize gold for more portable commodities.<eos> An attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it... a scheme they find most insulting.<eos> I was then asked if you had yet learned of this converted cache.<eos> So standing outside the door just now,<eos> I found myself faced with two choices... report what I had just heard, that you are considering keeping this money and know that Nassau will likely burn for it and me with it... or I could open the door<eos> and warn you of the full scope of the danger you face if you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache along with the gold from the fort.<eos> I cannot even begin to imagine what would motivate you to tell a lie like this.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.<eos> If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?<eos> Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.<eos> Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.<eos> Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.<eos> Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.<eos> Congratulations on all that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.<eos> And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all, I understand it.<eos> But it does not change the reality we face.<eos> That you face.<eos> For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.<eos> I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it, grown men in... awe of it.<eos> I came to this place so determined to do the same.<eos> That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?<eos> It never does.<eos> My advice?<eos> You want some say in how they speak of you?
Touch of the grippe is all, sir.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> You're the third man to say as much to me in the last four hours.<eos> I'll see you relieved.<eos> Please report to Dr. Marcus immediately.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's almost over, this unfortunate arrangement between you and I.<eos> - What?<eos> - Contact was made with Anne Bonny.<eos> The situation was explained to her that the sooner she returns the cache, the better it would be for you.
I get what I need, the island survives, and no one is harmed.<eos> I face a number of dangers ahead in stabilizing Nassau.<eos> The one I will resist to the limits of my ability is to allow myself to be cast as its villain.<eos> When the cache is delivered, you'll both be free to do as you please.<eos> Do you have a wife?<eos> Beg pardon?<eos> Do you have a wife?<eos> I do.<eos> How do you imagine she would feel if she were told you were suffering some awful, degrading abuse and that the only way she could end it would be to betray your trust?<eos> How do you think she would feel if she betrayed you, knowing she likely lost that trust forever, and then learned the whole thing was based on a ruse?
Don't think because you're new you're any different.<eos> The exchange is to take place tomorrow.<eos> Captain Rackham will be set free in exchange for the cache.<eos> Once that happens and the cache is shipped to Havana, the entirety of the Urca de Lima's prize gold will be in Spain's possession.<eos> Captain Rackham... he's in the governor's custody.<eos> You never mentioned this.<eos> - I'm sorry, I...<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I've given thought to our previous conversation.<eos> I'm not without sympathy for your situation. I have no desire to see harm come to you.
Yes.<eos> Max may be able to help matters, but she won't be able to stop all of them from going down there.<eos> No, I don't imagine she can.<eos> But there may be a way that you can prevent the rest of them... without looking like we're trying to prevent anything.<eos> You have all become quite skilled at acquiring information, but the time has come for things to flow in the opposite direction.<eos> Instead of coaxing information out of men's heads, I need for this place to be able to put ideas into them.<eos> If tomorrow 100 men appear on the beach intending to join Captain Flint's crew, it will be a problem for the governor and it will be a problem for me.<eos> Every turn you see tonight must hear how pathetic you see Captain Flint's ploy, how absurd it seems to you that any man given the choice to prosper in peace in a new Nassau would ever even consider returning to the dangers<eos> If you have any questions as to how to proceed,<eos> I have appointed a new madam more than capable of guiding you through it.
So what do we do?<eos> Lord Thomas Hamilton.<eos> I didn't know him, but I understand you did.<eos> Miss Guthrie tells me you were part of the first effort with Lord Hamilton and Peter Ashe to introduce the pardon to Nassau.<eos> As with most things, the men first into the breach bear the heaviest casualties.<eos> But in the hindsight of victory, they were the ones whose sacrifice made it possible.<eos> Without Lord Hamilton's efforts, your efforts, it's likely I wouldn't have been successful in my efforts to finally secure the pardon.<eos> All I have done here is finish what you began.<eos> I am now what you were then.<eos> And without you, there would be no me.
Either way, you mustn't settle for whatever refuse finds its way into this cell.<eos> There's a whole world out there that every so often rewards ambition.<eos> Mark my words.<eos> Today the crumbs, tomorrow the loaf.<eos> Perhaps someday the whole damn boulangerie.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Anne exchanged the cache for my release.<eos> Yes.<eos> This does not seem like a release.<eos> Spain has demanded I deliver you along with the cache.
For what it's worth, I believe the madam chose me for you because I am new.<eos> I have no notions about what you once were.<eos> No motive to gossip.<eos> Georgia.<eos> Yes?<eos> I know the games. I have played them all.<eos> If you ever wish to be in my bed again, that is the last one you will ever play with me.<eos> Yes?<eos> Miss Guthrie's downstairs.<eos> She's asking for you.
Beg pardon?<eos> A little.<eos> - You?<eos> - Hardly at all.<eos> If I'm in Havana in a day or two,<eos> I assume I'll be hearing a lot of it... shouted by bitter old women in a crowd, growled by angry officials.<eos> It seems a rotten thing to wish upon anyone, an unflattering eulogy in an unfamiliar town.<eos> It'll be quick, to whatever extent it sets your mind at ease.<eos> The gold is theirs. The gems are theirs.<eos> They don't need anything from you anymore, and as such they're likely to want to put the entire affair behind them and move on.
How so exactly?<eos> You said Anne is alive, did you not?<eos> I would argue as long as that is true, there's a chance, however remote, that she will frustrate your efforts to send me off to my death.<eos> Out of curiosity, how would she go about doing that?<eos> Well, I have no idea.<eos> Everything and anything in her power, I imagine, up to and including walking out in the middle of the road ahead of us to be run over by your horses in the hope of slowing you down for even a moment.<eos> It is fascinating to me how stubbornly you people expect the unlikeliest of outcomes because you prefer them.<eos> You expect the world to become what you want it to be despite all available evidence and experience to the contrary.<eos> This was not the way I'd hoped this affair would play out.<eos> But I can assure you it is most certainly not going to play out the way you hope it will either, because even to stand in the road ahead of us, she would have to know which road to stand in.
So the plan to recover the stolen cache of gems... your plan to recover the stolen cache of gems has worked in exactly the manner you suggested it would.<eos> Only now you believe this is a bad thing... evidence of a plan to rescue Mr. Rackham and once again recover the cache of gems.<eos> That is what you're suggesting, yes?<eos> I can understand why this may be hard to believe, but I know Anne Bonny well enough to know that it is a certainty something here is amiss.<eos> That her behavior should coincide with the presence of Captain Flint on the island only hours before most certainly points to a plot being underway.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> So now Captain Flint is somehow involved in this plot despite the fact that his ship left the island hours ago?<eos> And I am to redeploy men into the interior away from Nassau Town, leaving their positions undefended?<eos> I'm sorry, are you suggesting there's some ulterior motive here?<eos> I'm suggesting that simply because the governor decided to put his... trust in you, I have no intention of doing the same.
but I was determined until a man arrived at my door claiming to hold debts belonging to my father.<eos> Debts accumulated as my father drank.<eos> Debts he claimed that now belonged to me.<eos> Debts I could not possibly have hoped to repay.<eos> Debts over which this man would have seen me imprisoned... imprisoned in a place where the debts would have been discharged only through hard labor.<eos> Hard labor with no wages, working at... wait for it... the production of textiles.<eos> "You people, incapable of accepting the world as it is," says the man to whom the world handed everything.<eos> If no Anne, if no rescue, if this is defeat for me, then know this.<eos> You and I were neck and neck in this race right till the end.<eos> But, Jesus, did I make up a lot of ground to catch you.
Only... you.<eos> You have information about the identity of the spy within our midst.<eos> It's Idelle.<eos> She's the one that learned the secret route for the governor's caravan.<eos> The one that made possible Captain Rackham's escape.<eos> Have you told anyone of this?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am?<eos> I know Eleanor engaged you those months ago to watch me.
It is a different experience to what you may imagine it being.<eos> Surely a man like you has faced death before, but never so nakedly.<eos> And cloaked in glory or sacrifice, fully exposed in all its horror and finality.<eos> In this moment, you have the opportunity to enter into that moment with a clear conscience.<eos> I can help you do that.<eos> To repent.<eos> I have nothing to repent for with you.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I understand the code you subscribe to.<eos> I understand you believe your violence is justified in the name of a defiance of tyranny, but there are mothers who buried their sons because of you.

But we must always remember however strong the need for the removal of these traitors, these relics of a more savage age, there is no relish in this moment, but there is righteousness and comfort in the knowledge that...<eos> - I know, just... wait.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Billy, they're about to tie the noose.<eos> And that God's will will be done again in Nassau.<eos> Bastard!<eos> Hang him!<eos> Does the condemned have anything to say before the sentence is carried out?<eos> These men who brought me here today do not fear me.<eos> They brought me here today because they fear you.

Thank you, Doctor.<eos> As always, I appreciate your discretion.<eos> What's our current price per share?<eos> $476.98.<eos> Still holding even... good.<eos> The interviews you're doing have stabilized the stock.<eos> Let's line up some more.<eos> Set a meeting with P.R.<eos> Right away.<eos> Ted talks have always wanted you, as well.
Look at all of them.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> That sad soul.<eos> They've all been drained.<eos> This place is a meat locker.<eos> Oh... Run...!<eos> - Run!<eos> - Oh, God! Not another step!<eos> And don't you dare point either of those things at me!<eos> So... the Countess sent you here to finish me off.
Is anybody here?<eos> Hey, either of y'all work here?<eos> Dinner is served.<eos> Did you have a reservation?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> One name: Queenie.<eos> Oh, yes, I have you.<eos> And you're gonna be staying with us for three nights.<eos> - Are you traveling alone?<eos> - Just me. And what brings you to L.A.?
I'm not lying.<eos> If I wanted you dead, I would have killed you myself.<eos> Then who?<eos> You should've left!<eos> Why didn't you leave? !<eos> I knew you would eventually get bored.<eos> Why did you have to die here?<eos> It was me.<eos> I did it!<eos> I wanted you for myself!
Why did you have to die here?<eos> It was me.<eos> I did it!<eos> I wanted you for myself!<eos> I left the handkerchief for the police.<eos> I knew that they would come, and I knew that you would never allow yourself to be captured.<eos> I wanted us to die together.<eos> So that you can see the depth of my devotion.<eos> While this one resented every moment she was obligated to be in your presence.<eos> I would happily stand behind you, waiting to serve, savoring your every word.
Do you feel nothing at all?<eos> Can you see me now?<eos> I have laid myself bare.<eos> I've dwelt in silence for so long.<eos> Give me a word, Mr. March.<eos> Let me be happy.<eos> Get out.<eos> You... are banished from my presence.<eos> I-I feel... strangely free.<eos> I will no longer wait on you and your whore.
Sure.<eos> May I offer the two of you a glass of champagne? - Ooh.<eos> - Don't mind if I do. Ah.<eos> I think those are the reviewers from that Internet site, "Trip Adventurers."<eos> They must've heard about our grand reopening.<eos> I know.<eos> Can't you see the ridiculously gracious smile plastered on my face?<eos> What is that pungent odor? Sage.<eos> To cleanse the spirit.<eos> I'll show you to your room.
You can choose whatever room you'd like.<eos> Well, yes, but the problem is, after I pick a room and then settle in with my erotica novels, I never know if a guest is going to check in and disturb me.<eos> I know this is Los Angeles, but I'm an old-fashioned girl and I like my privacy.<eos> I dig it when the guests come in.<eos> It's like a free dirty movie.<eos> I'm into that amateur stuff.<eos> Are you three, like, a thing now? Ya.<eos> We try dating the lumberjack, but he's a gay.<eos> Okay, everyone, please, listen.<eos> This is important, and it affects every single one of you.
Go on.<eos> Get into bed with them.<eos> Not you?<eos> I'm getting a little big for the family bed.<eos> I'll take the chair.<eos> I'm afraid to fall asleep.<eos> As soon as I close my eyes, it'll all be gone for another year.<eos> It's okay, Daddy.<eos> Rest.<eos> What brings you to the Cortez?
Like the big Amoskeag strike in the 1920s over pay and hours.<eos> But this industry survived that as well.<eos> And all of you in this room have been carrying on a tradition that goes back to the beginning of this country, and that's something you have to be very, very proud of!<eos> "But there's another tradition in this state:<eos> Live Free or Die.<eos> Now, my wife..."<eos> There's another tradition in this state:<eos> Live Free or Die.<eos> Live Free or Die.<eos> Now, of course, as some of you may read in the papers, and, uh, hear from the television pundits that my opponent has a ten-point lead here in New Hampshire.
Will you excuse me for a moment?<eos> - I just have to make a quick call.<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's the president.<eos> Hello?<eos> Doug tells me you greeted him with a firearm.<eos> Yeah, we've been having some issues with...<eos> Do you know what fascinates me about guns, LeAnn?<eos> You pull a trigger and bang, a bullet explodes out faster than the speed of sound.<eos> And if you're on the wrong end of that bullet, - why, it hits you before you even hear it.
You pull a trigger and bang, a bullet explodes out faster than the speed of sound.<eos> And if you're on the wrong end of that bullet, - why, it hits you before you even hear it.<eos> - Mr. President, forgive me, but...<eos> No, I want you to hear me, LeAnn.<eos> You will walk away from this nonsense with Claire.<eos> You will not make a phone call nor answer one.<eos> You will offer no explanation.<eos> Whatever you discussed with my wife, you will erase it from your mind and never speak of it again.<eos> Tell me I've been heard.<eos> Yes, I heard you.
And I never will.<eos> Nobody will.<eos> Except for the DOJ.<eos> If you need to reach me for anything, you're gonna have to contact me through the WITSEC officer.<eos> It's not just the Armenians I'm afraid of.<eos> - Lucas...<eos> - about the president but... - Look. Listen carefully.<eos> The U.S. government is not your enemy now.<eos> Okay?<eos> They're protecting you.
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> LeAnn called me a little while ago. Said she couldn't make it.<eos> Congresswoman, I asked LeAnn to have this meeting set up because I have a radical proposal, and I wanted to make it in person.<eos> Well, Doug has already filled me in.<eos> Usually, I wouldn't endorse anyone four years out, but in this case, I'm really open to it.<eos> Anything to put a Democrat into the governor's mansion.<eos> I told the congresswoman that enlisting her political machinery in Dallas is a crucial first step.<eos> Which is why I asked my daughter to join us.<eos> She'll have my seat by then, and you two will work closely.<eos> I have a great deal of respect for you, Mrs. Underwood. I think we can accomplish a lot together.
What if there's...<eos> If something's wrong?<eos> Landline goes directly to our local office.<eos> Away from home, use the cell phone next to it.<eos> What else?<eos> You have basic cable.<eos> No Internet, obviously.<eos> Keep the blinds drawn and the doors locked.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'll check in with you later this week.
I should have told you.<eos> About everything, of course. (SCOFFS)<eos> Honestly, I didn't know how to explain him over the phone.<eos> I just kept imagining... Mom Googling Laird Mayhew and you guys jumping to conclusions before you even got a chance to know him.<eos> Well, now we know him.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You've been here for 15 minutes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wouldn't have asked you to come out here and miss Christmas in Michigan for the first time ever, if he wasn't really important to me.
Who is that?<eos> (CHUCKLES) That's Justine.<eos> Yeah, she's like Siri, but awesome.<eos> I got that chick from The Big Bang Theory, Kaley Cuoco, to do the voice.<eos> J, say hi.<eos> JUSTINE: Hey, Ned. Hey, Barb.<eos> How are you guys?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - BARB:<eos> Oh, my God. Stephanie's told me so much about you.
She can't...<eos> Can she see us? She says that she can't, but I think that she can.<eos> JUSTINE:<eos> What the fuck are you talking about? You know I can't see them.<eos> (WHISPERS) She's a perv.<eos> Laird.<eos> Anyway, I hope you two have a nice night's rest.<eos> Yeah, have a good night. Great night.<eos> - Have a great night. - Yeah.<eos> My instinct is to hug you right now.
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Okay.<eos> And no cursing, okay?<eos> Fuck, you're right.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know that out in California I disappointed you and that kills me.<eos> And I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I threw you in the deep end out there.<eos> I should've never asked you to come.
- Move!<eos> - Gotta kick people in the ass.<eos> Tell them that looking the other way is not an option anymore.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> (crying) Oberfuhrer Franz Faber knows about you.
How long ago was he shot?<eos> Yesterday afternoon.<eos> How long have you been at this game then?<eos> "Let me help you, I'm a brave nurse, risking my life - for the cause." - She's here now, let her work.<eos> I didn't know what the Germans were doing, about death camps.<eos> - I knew nothing.<eos> - With the police kicking down doors, rounding people up? Go on, how long have you been at it?<eos> You, Englishman!<eos> Copper no less!<eos> It was one of you who kicked my husband's head open on the street.
No, I'll go with her in case anything goes wrong.<eos> If there's one person she might not rat on right now, it's Harry.<eos> - It was an act.<eos> - She says she wants to make things right.<eos> If that's true, you're the one she's doing it for.<eos> So go with her, tell her whatever it takes to keep her close to you.<eos> - OK.<eos> - I'll tell him the plan.<eos> (whispering): Whatever it takes.<eos> I'm sorry I struck you.
It was terrifying.<eos> Still, you want to laugh.<eos> "More sugar beets."<eos> - It's not that different now.<eos> - I'm not gonna talk.<eos> Just give me something I can take back to my superiors like the location of safe houses.<eos> Your colleagues will be avoiding them anyway.<eos> It will make no difference to their safety, but it will help you live.<eos> And even if you don't care, I know there is somebody who does.<eos> Somebody who loves you... your mother, your father.
It will make no difference to their safety, but it will help you live.<eos> And even if you don't care, I know there is somebody who does.<eos> Somebody who loves you... your mother, your father.<eos> What would they say with you gone?<eos> I just want to spare the suffering.<eos> Beat me all you want;<eos> I don't feel it now.<eos> The pain?<eos> Is it the synesthesia that helped you stop feeling it?<eos> I've been building a file on you since you were in Marmonne.
- For silence.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> The way the clouds smelled, my mom's voice, the way it tasted.<eos> They thought it was cute when I was a boy, but one day he shook me, told me not to talk about it anymore.<eos> Who did?<eos> "People don't like anomalies.<eos> They'll think you're a freak."<eos> Your father?<eos> He didn't think you were a freak;<eos> - he was trying to protect you.
I met with the others in Alfred's cell.<eos> They trust me.<eos> I know where they are right now.<eos> (people chattering) The people I work with, they wouldn't understand about your condition:<eos> your senses, your memory.<eos> They don't see what I see... that you need to be treated differently.<eos> - I want to help you.<eos> - My memory also means that I know how long you stood there watching me get beaten.<eos> - 59 blows.<eos> - Alfred, your father was trying to protect you by keeping your condition a secret and I could do the same.
We will follow you at a discreet distance.<eos> If you try to make a run for it, you will be shot.<eos> Please do not disappoint us, Miss Daly.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> What did she say to you?<eos> - It makes no sense.<eos> - What did she say?<eos> She said, "Tell him he's in there alive... and tell him that it was real."<eos> You guys should get some rest.<eos> Both of you.
- Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, then, why do we need that thing?<eos> - Mm, it just helps me.<eos> - Uh, can't you just get off like a normal person, just once?<eos> - Like a normal person? - No, that's--ohh.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Oh.<eos> - So, what brings you in to therapy?
- Whoa.<eos> - Watch yourself now.<eos> Let's get you up slowly.<eos> That was quite a spill you took.<eos> Are--are you sure you're okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I'm good.<eos> I've [slurring]-- thank you.<eos> Thank you for helping me up.<eos> Was, uh, very nice of you.<eos> - It's a good thing we saw you.
Delighted to see you.<eos> You too.<eos> I like you to meet Bobby Dorfman.<eos> He runs the place.<eos> I do. I do.<eos> Is this your first time here?<eos> Yes. yes.<eos> The papers are right, It's got real electricity in here.<eos> It does, right?<eos> We are happy to have you.
Bobby is not there but Ben is around.<eos> You like to be seated? Please.<eos> Follow me. After you, dear.<eos> Had a very big deal today.<eos> Champagne for the table!<eos> Before they start drinking for real.<eos> Of course. Fred, how are you?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You remember Vonnie.<eos> Lovely to see you again.
Lovely to see you again.<eos> We are in town for a few weeks. We'll catch up.<eos> It's going to be a very good stock.<eos> I'm tellin' you it's goin' through the roof.<eos> Now is the time to get in on it. But you didn't hear it here!<eos> In here what?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you, Marvin.<eos> There are some people to see you.<eos> They say they know you.
This... is her?<eos> I thought you said she was skinny.<eos> I'm so sorry, Vicki.<eos> I made a huge mistake, and you are correct to hate me.<eos> You better tell me what you came to say before I lose my patience with you.<eos> It's Santa.<eos> He's not jolly anymore.<eos> I found his toy sack last night, and it was just filled with empty bottles.<eos> Well, I guess that's your problem now, isn't it?<eos> He's not the same man without you.
I've been brought in from the Metropolitan Police to lead the review into the investigation of the murder of Alice Monroe.<eos> He had things entirely under his control.<eos> Which makes me just think that this was not his first murder.<eos> Go back to your review, Stella.<eos> I don't want the two murders linked.<eos> This is the third murder in three months, Jim.<eos> If we don't stop him, he will kill again.<eos> There's someone to see you, ma'am.
Tom, I need you to listen to me right now.<eos> Men always think in terms of fight or flight.<eos> In fact, the most common instinct in the face of this kind of threat is to freeze.<eos> If she didn't fight, if she didn't scream, if she was silent and numb, it's because she was petrified.<eos> If she went with him quietly, it's because she was afraid for her life and not just her life, yours, and Nancy's, and the baby's.<eos> In that state of fear, she might well have been compliant she might well have submitted but that does not mean she consented.<eos> Tom, the way you behave the way you approach your role as Rose's helper will either make her experience better or worse.<eos> If you react badly, you will devastate her.<eos> Or you can be... a big part of her healing and her recovery.<eos> What she needs from you right now is to know that she is safe, to know that she's loved.
Paul Spector is due to be moved today.<eos> The next stage of his assessments are about to begin.<eos> Mr Spector.<eos> I'm August Larson, the lead clinician here.<eos> I need you to go to London.<eos> I don't think we can afford to dismiss the connection between David Alvarez and Paul Spector.<eos> We've had a request to disclose your dream diary.<eos> He's in hospital, he's incapacitated and yet he's still infecting the lives of every person he comes into contact with.<eos> If a person is able to do to others what he fears may be done to him, he may no longer be afraid.<eos> Doctor, I understand that for you he's a patient, someone worthy of understanding, compassion, even.
I'm Mark Bailey, who are you?<eos> I'm told I'm the Belfast Strangler.<eos> Detective Superintendent Gibson?<eos> Dr Larson. What can I do for you?<eos> Mr Spector's defence team have sent me some excerpts from your diary.<eos> The pages where it is alleged Mr Spector made an entry.<eos> I see.<eos> I sense your discomfort. I have no doubt, after seeing the entry he made, knowing that he'd read your journal felt like a violation.<eos> Yes.<eos> May I ask you, how long have you kept a diary?
Crush them.<eos> Crush them and their pathetic lives.<eos> Ma'am, my client accepts that she has breached her bail conditions.<eos> Her attempts to contact Mr Spector, the fact that she stayed away from her home address, breaching her curfew.<eos> But there are mitigating factors, Ma'am, that I'd like to draw your attention to.<eos> The defendant lost her father when she was aged 13 in a motorcycle accident, a shockingly violent accident.<eos> She is now just 16 years old and the best place for her to be at this difficult time is at home.<eos> Her mother, who is present today in court, is prepared to stand surety.<eos> I have checked with the police and they are happy as to the source of the monies offered by Mrs Benedetto to support the suretyship, namely savings she has accumulated to...<eos> Mr McSwain, let me just stop you there.
No.<eos> Do you think you could manage your emotions and behaviour in a courtroom?<eos> I think I could, yes.<eos> Do you think you would be able to keep track of events as they unfolded?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you be able to challenge witnesses?<eos> That is, to recognise distortions in witness testimony?<eos> No, I wouldn't be able to do that.<eos> Not unless my memory returned.<eos> Do you understand the sentence that could be imposed on you if you are found guilty?
We did fluorescence tests on the carpet.<eos> It was covered in stains.<eos> David Alvarez was there at the same time as Paul Spector... as Peter Baldwin.<eos> He would know about that.<eos> He would remember that dining room.<eos> That-that was all.<eos> Just...<eos> That was all.<eos> I just took a call from the DPP, ma'am.<eos> It seems that Sean Healy has lodged a complaint against you with the Police Ombudsman.
- In London.<eos> And what were the circumstances of that meeting?<eos> - Was he there at your invitation?<eos> - No, we met by chance.<eos> The last time I'd seen him was at Gortnacull when I was 12.<eos> At Gortnacull with Father Jensen.<eos> Perhaps we can talk about the period in your life before you were first incarcerated.<eos> When you compiled your own map of Dundalk.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> When did that behaviour begin for you?
Detective Superintendent Gibson.<eos> This interview is being recorded at the Down Serious Crime Suite.<eos> The date is the 16th of May 2012 and the time, by my watch, is 1400.<eos> I'm Detective Sergeant Anderson, and the other police officer present is Detective Superintendent Gibson.<eos> Can you please state your full name and date of birth?<eos> Peter Paul Spector, 25th of May 1979.<eos> - And also present is?<eos> - Sean Healy, solicitor.<eos> And at the conclusion of the interview I'll give a notice of how you can obtain a copy of the tapes.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but I must caution you if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court, it may harm your defence.
What's this?<eos> We believe he was with you in Gortnacull Children's Home and that you met him again in 2002, in London, which is a period that falls outside the timeframe of your purported amnesia.<eos> What has this got to do with the contents of the lock-up?<eos> Before my client answers... ..could you please explain the relevance of this photograph?<eos> This man is, at present, serving a life sentence for a murder, a murder he committed in 2002.<eos> Even then, I'm sorry, but it falls outside the scope of this interview.<eos> The murder of this woman.<eos> I'm showing a photograph of the female victim.<eos> DCI Eastwood has just entered the room at 14:03.<eos> Paul Spector, I am further arresting you for the murder of Susan Harper at Flat 16 Thornton Rise,
I will start.<eos> You know why this relationship went wrong?<eos> 'Cause my supposed best friend turned his back on me in my time of need.<eos> Your entire life is a time of need.<eos> See what he does?<eos> Just pecks away at my self-esteem.<eos> Then I start thinking that I'm the problem.<eos> You are the problem.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Now, Biggs, I'm hearing a lot of anger from you.
That's for damn sure.<eos> I don't know how you did it, but you managed to be too boring for NPR.<eos> She should have let me take callers.<eos> I need an audience to feed off their energy.<eos> You'll get 'em next time.<eos> Or not.<eos> Who cares?<eos> What is your problem?<eos> We published a book about your life.<eos> I mean, doesn't it mean anything to you?
It's unfortunate, I know.<eos> He should be here early tomorrow morning, so, if you don't mind waiting...<eos> I guess I don't really have much of a choice.<eos> This way, please.<eos> You have your own bathroom with a shower.<eos> Hot water is ample here.<eos> I'd be happy to give you a tour of the facilities if you'd like.<eos> I'd actually like to meet with Dr. Cheng and Dr. ziegler.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> They're eager to meet you.
They're part of the same organization that you have been fighting in the past.<eos> They also exist here in my time.<eos> What do they want?<eos> My machine.<eos> They want to travel through time?<eos> For what, I don't know.<eos> Alter history, ensure the plague... or maybe they just want to hear Hendrix at Woodstock.<eos> But if they somehow manage to change something in the past, then I want to know what it is.<eos> - This will make it...<eos> - So time moves around you.
You are adorable.<eos> No... no... 30 years ago, your new friends destroyed the world.<eos> Ever think to ask what they might be using that machine for?<eos> No.<eos> We could help each other.<eos> - Uh-huh. - Think about it.<eos> Shit.<eos> And there we are.<eos> Subdermal tracker.<eos> That's how they found you, my old friend.
They just give you an injection and then you lie down for a few hours.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I've done it loads of times.<eos> Don't tell them, though.<eos> - What if it's dangerous?<eos> - It's not dangerous.<eos> They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was.<eos> - You'll be fine.<eos> I'm Henry.<eos> Some of you may feel a little drowsy.
I mean, stylized violence.<eos> More Jon Woo we were thinking than, than Tarantino.<eos> In real life, though.<eos> What are you prepared to do to get your company back from your son Hakeem?<eos> I won't have to do a damn thing, sweetheart.<eos> I predict in three months, they're going to come crawling back to me, the same what that Apple came crawling back to Steve Jobs, sweetie.<eos> So, Mimi Whiteman and her wife?<eos> (laughs) Look, we-we going to get them a real nice, uh, wedding present.<eos> You know, a couple of dildos.<eos> The way Camilla Marks came for you, it seemed personal.
Jamal, are you saying Lucious is inauthentic?<eos> I'm saying Lucious Lyon ain't even his real name.<eos> You'rea luckylady.<eos> He wants to give you an exclusive.<eos> Thank you so much for coming back.<eos> Sorry about the other day. I was a bit out of sorts.<eos> And today?<eos> Well, it's a new day.<eos> I thought you and Jamal were close.<eos> Has your family turned on you?
Rhonda, what you've gone through can be traumatizing.<eos> It can fester in a marriage, but in the presence of God, you can unburden yourself.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How about, uh, I go first, Reverend?<eos> All right, Andre.<eos> (exhales) Okay.<eos> Rhonda, have you been cheating on me?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Rhonda, if you're being truthful, let's try and understand why Andre's doubting you.
No.<eos> Rhonda, if you're being truthful, let's try and understand why Andre's doubting you.<eos> I do understand why Andre's doubting me. It's because he's paranoid, which always precedes a bipolar break.<eos> Has he told you about his mental health?<eos> Paranoid how?<eos> He just accused me of cheating on him, which is ridiculous.<eos> And also, he's been having visions.<eos> Babe, have been telling him about your visions?<eos> I told the reverend that God's been speaking to me about what happened to our child-- yes, I did.<eos> And that doesn't alarm you at all.
The newspapers are about to run a story on the nurse who was working here when Michael died.<eos> Leila Sayyad.<eos> How do they know about her?<eos> Because I told them.<eos> I had her followed.<eos> I know everything about her.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - I want justice for Michael.<eos> The newspapers are going to name and shame.<eos> - They may ask you to corroborate.
Our Child.<eos> That's right.<eos> Must keep you busy.<eos> I need to see Mr Malik.<eos> It's important.<eos> He said it was important.<eos> Don't know any more than that.<eos> Look, this... really isn't a very good time for me, so...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do the numbers 11, 12, 13 mean anything to you?
Why don't we ask?<eos> Michael Freeland.<eos> He was your accountant at Carousel.<eos> I know who he was, young man.<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> Have we met?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, that's funny.<eos> I never forget a face.<eos> And I'm sure I have seen you somewhere before.
- I-I can't do it.<eos> - Date of birth, "1-2-3-4".<eos> It's not that simple, it's going to be encrypted.<eos> (Shh.)<eos> Who are you and what are you doing here?<eos> Mr Kumulah...<eos> - We're the police. - No, you are not.<eos> - I can show you my warrant card.<eos> - I am not interested.<eos> You have broken into my room, you are attempting to access my computer ... whoever you are, your actions have placed you outside of the law.
- We're the police. - No, you are not.<eos> - I can show you my warrant card.<eos> - I am not interested.<eos> You have broken into my room, you are attempting to access my computer ... whoever you are, your actions have placed you outside of the law.<eos> We're, erm, we're investigating the death of Michael Freeland.<eos> I don't care what you are doing, you will leave here.<eos> Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.<eos> - Right.<eos> - With my men.<eos> - They will escort you.
- The death of Michael Freeland?<eos> - That led us to Lisa Douglas.<eos> - And she led us to Kumulah.<eos> So... why are you interested in Kumulah?<eos> I'm sorry, you really think I'm going to tell you?<eos> Two boy scouts?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but you may have compromised a major investigation.<eos> And I'm warning you, it doesn't stop here.
Have you given your statement?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> How did it go?<eos> I've been suspended from all front-line duties while the investigation is ongoing.<eos> He was armed. And he fired first.<eos> And given his character and his past, I don't think you have anything to worry about.<eos> Apart from taking another human being's life.<eos> Not every woman's fighting instinct is so close to the surface.<eos> It's a good thing that yours was.<eos> Tyler could have killed everyone there, including you and me, if he hadn't been stopped.
There's something about her online.<eos> What?<eos> How she met Daddy one time.<eos> What?<eos> What are you two doing?<eos> You know you're not allowed to use the staff phone.<eos> Right, come on with me.<eos> We're thinking of putting two more over there.<eos> There are two offices, ma'am.<eos> I've earmarked one for you.
I've just seen Katie Benedetto approaching the ICU.<eos> 'Copy that.'<eos> Maybe there's been some cerebral damage from the prolonged hypotension.<eos> I'm not sure we can MRI with the bullet fragments.<eos> We'll keep him asleep and arrange a CT scan.<eos> Check all his lines, check everything is still in place, that he hasn't burst his stitches.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Mrs Spector. Come on in, the head wants to see you.
Are they just fantasies that sustain him?<eos> Or are they a record of nine more murders?<eos> The police say they have a confession, that you made a number of admissions.<eos> I don't remember any of that. - I understand he's conscious.<eos> - Yes, but there is an issue.<eos> It seems Mr Spector suffered some memory loss.<eos> - Are we supposed to be taking this seriously?<eos> - I think we have to.<eos> - Do you know who that is? - No.<eos> You will be held on remand in hospital until arrangements can be made to transfer you to a secure psychiatric clinic.
Good girl.<eos> Why are you so kind to me?<eos> If I've done the things that the police say I've done then I'm a monster.<eos> It's my job.<eos> He's just the sort of person who would feign amnesia if he felt that there was something to be gained from it, even for the sheer delight of duping people, particularly experts.<eos> Someone like me, for example.<eos> I found a murder that looks promising.<eos> Law student, Susan Harper.<eos> The only problem is, there is someone doing time for it.<eos> I'll pray for you.
On the outside, looking in.<eos> When I was unconscious, I was... I...<eos> In this room.<eos> I was able to see myself from above, lying in the bed, with all the tubes and monitors.<eos> Have you ever experienced anything like that before?<eos> Being outside of your body like that?<eos> When I was young, yes.<eos> When things got really bad, I used to be able to split myself.<eos> If I was lucky, a part of me would just drift away. To another place, a... better place.<eos> Have you thought any more about what death means to you?

Do you think he looks like me?<eos> A little bit, maybe.<eos> Paul.<eos> I can walk.<eos> Hospital policy.<eos> Sit in the chair.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Detective Superintendent Gibson.<eos> I'm here to see Dr Larson.<eos> He's been expecting you.

There is a dazzling array of perversions.<eos> I mean, beyond the sadism and the overwhelming fetishism with female underwear. He was a voyeur, a transvestite... into autoeroticism and necrophilia.<eos> There's also signs of pygmalionism - his obsession with mannequins and dolls.<eos> I've sometimes wondered if he breathed air into his dying victims to prolong their lives... ..so that they could see clearly that he was going to kill them.<eos> When young children are abused, they experience fear and anxiety.<eos> They then attempt to contain those feelings by acting out sadistically.<eos> If a person is able to do to others what he fears may be done to him, he may no longer be afraid.<eos> You assume he was abused?<eos> He was in Gortnacull, I think?<eos> Doctor, I understand that for you he's a patient, an abused child, someone who deserves understanding and compassion, even.
Yeah.<eos> Just don't underestimate the threat... ..the danger that Paul Spector represents.<eos> I won't.<eos> Do you have an idea about Mr Spector's pre-morbid IQ?<eos> He was tested as a child and scored in the very superior intelligence band.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's been a pleasure talking to you.<eos> Psychiatry needs feedback from patients.<eos> It's realised in interpersonal contacts, so trust is essential.<eos> It is not my place to judge him for what he may or may not have done, but I will try to get to the truth of the matter for the courts and for you.

Out you come.<eos> You should try to eat some fruit at least.<eos> Rose Stagg is waiting for you, Ma'am. - Right.
When he talks to me now, I don't really listen to the words that he's saying, just to the tone of his voice.<eos> From that I can work out whether he likes me or not, whether he's emotionally close to me.<eos> Right now, he's angry... ..and I don't think he likes me very much.<eos> Rose, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> I think that...<eos> I'm the reason that Paul Spector came after you.<eos> How?<eos> I think I... I think I revealed your identity as my informant when I used his name - Peter.<eos> The name that you gave me when I spoke to him on the phone.<eos> Using that name, together with the E-Fit that we had created, I think led him straight to you.
Where are we?<eos> Belfast General Hospital.<eos> Can you remember the name of your nurse?<eos> Kiera.<eos> Are you married, or do you have a partner?<eos> I'm married.<eos> Can you remember any other family members?<eos> Sally Ann has a father, John, and a mother, Carol.<eos> We call her Cici.<eos> And what about you?
Who will assess him?<eos> August Larson.<eos> He's the Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist.<eos> Very experienced, very used to giving expert testimony in court.<eos> The sooner we get him out of the hands of the medics, and back into the justice system, the better.<eos> Kiera Sheridan. Mr Spector's dedicated nurse.<eos> She provides him with one-to-one care.<eos> She will limit your visit - if patient status warrants it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> She'll show you in.
I believe that the nature of your injuries has been explained to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you understand that you were in police custody when you were shot?<eos> Yes, but I still don't know why.<eos> No-one will tell me.<eos> An individual called James Tyler was responsible.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Why did he shoot me?<eos> I need to get more information from the police before I can explain that.<eos> The more pressing issue, Mr Spector, is that the police have charged you with a number of very serious crimes.
The sound of the pen on the paper seemed really loud in my head.<eos> Like a whooshing.<eos> All I could think about was getting him out of there, away from Nancy.<eos> Did you resist him at all?<eos> Er... I was numb.<eos> I didn't really struggle until he was walking me towards that awful building.<eos> I thought, "If he takes me in there I'm gonna die.<eos> I'm going to be the next victim."<eos> That's when I tried to run. But he was too strong.<eos> He made tapes of you.
It was fixed to the ground.<eos> And he sat behind the camera, so that when I looked at him, I was looking directly into the lens.<eos> He hardly spoke, he...<eos> He just stared at me.<eos> I tried everything I could to get through to him.<eos> I begged him, I flattered him, I insulted him.<eos> I tried to provoke him, even.<eos> He didn't respond.<eos> His eyes were open, but it was like he was in a trance.<eos> Did he sexually assault you?

The reason he is appearing from hospital is that he is still being held there in intensive care.<eos> I have written reports from the ICU Consultant, Dr Spencer, and from the Consultant Neuropsychologist Dr Alison Walden, that explain the nature and degree of my client's disability.<eos> Dr Walden is approved under Part of the Mental Health Order 1986.<eos> There's information there about the treatment Mr Spector has undergone and an account of his behaviour in hospital.<eos> The memory loss, you will see, covers a period of approximately six years up to and including the recent shooting.<eos> One of the primary foundations of criminal law is that all defendants are capable of actively participating in their defence.<eos> Mr Spector's amnesia prevents him from so doing.<eos> Whilst Mr Spector understands that he is in court and charged with a number of criminal offences and understands the nature and object and the possible consequences of the proceedings, he cannot enter a plea, he cannot consult with or assist his lawyer,<eos> he cannot give evidence in his own defence. On that basis, I feel I need to raise the issue of competence as to whether Mr Spector is fit to stand trial.<eos> Mr Healy, let me stop you there.

In my experience, a history of previous violence is the best predictor for future violence for someone whether they are mentally disordered or not.<eos> And Paul Spector is a violent sexual sadist.<eos> Why are you so kind to me?<eos> If I've done the things that the... police say I've done, then I'm a monster.<eos> It's my job.<eos> What?<eos> It says in your notes that there were tears in your eyes during your surgery.<eos> That you were crying.<eos> Was I?<eos> Does that mean anything to you?
Come back to life?<eos> No.<eos> But I couldn't just abandon her.<eos> Is that when you cried?<eos> Hey.<eos> Drink it all up.<eos> Good girl.<eos> You came close with dying.<eos> What do you now understand death to be?<eos> What does death mean to you now?
That's pretty conclusive.<eos> What year is this?<eos> August 2002.<eos> In London.<eos> Now, there's a gap in Spector's time-line.<eos> We don't know where he was or what he was doing.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Try and get some sleep.<eos> I'll pray for you.
I like how you... Took a shower curtain and made it into a dress.<eos> Well, it's not a shower curtain, - but thank you.<eos> - It looks like a shower curtain.<eos> I was just trying to be nice.<eos> You seem like a nice girl, Martha.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Baskets. Mm-hm.<eos> How long have you been going with Chip?<eos> - Mm-mm-mm-mm. - Oh, we're...<eos> - We're not... - Mm-mm.<eos> Oh. If anyone saw you on the street, they would think you're a couple.
- Hey.<eos> - Wow, Martha.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know, I meant to tell you the other day I lost my virginity at this motel.<eos> - What room?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I guess that's all our business together.<eos> Unless, if you wanted, I could, like, keep taking you places.
You didn't pay the rent?<eos> - I didn't pay the rent!<eos> - Are you...?<eos> !<eos> You'll have it by tomorrow lunchtime.<eos> I'll transfer it myself.<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> All right.<eos> Lunchtime tomorrow.<eos> And I still don't want you here!
And I know the importance of keeping myself in shape.<eos> But can you believe a year ago, I looked like this?<eos> Yes, that's me.<eos> I tried everything, every fad diet, but nothing worked.<eos> And then my doctor recommended Lipocite.<eos> 'And I hope you have a very enjoyable evening.'<eos> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> My name is James Deakin.<eos> Don't worry, I'll keep this short.<eos> I know many of you have been asking about our highly sought after training courses.

I'd prefer to see you.<eos> Seriously... you should get checked over.<eos> How's my pulse?<eos> It's racing.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I was just... checking him.<eos> All right.<eos> Is he well enough to leave?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
- Mank.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Detective Bosch.<eos> - Captain.<eos> First day back, Billets tells me you already bagged a bad guy.<eos> No. That was Edgar and Ferras.<eos> I was just along for the ride.<eos> Good man, Mank.<eos> Friend of yours.<eos> Lucky he saw Captain Pounds grab you first, huh?
Thank you both so much.<eos> To the next mayor of Los Angeles.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Who signed Raynard Waits out of custody at the jail that day?<eos> I did.<eos> Who was the ranking LAPD officer at the scene?<eos> I was.<eos> - By whose authority?<eos> - Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> - Chief Irving put you in charge.
We're gonna have to print his shoes to eliminate him.<eos> - Dipshit.<eos> - I missed you, Harry.<eos> What I said.<eos> We have footprints leading away from the driver's side.<eos> We have tire tracks from a second vehicle.<eos> No blood.<eos> Dollars to doughnuts, killed somewhere else, dumped in his trunk, and driven here.<eos> Look at you. You're getting a feel for this homicide thing, Lieutenant.<eos> - Might just work out for you.
Some moonlighters.<eos> It's a state of the art set-up.<eos> Cameras everywhere, total coverage.<eos> Remote control.<eos> You can punch in on a pimple.<eos> - You know rich people.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Hey, can you make that call for me?<eos> Yeah, let me do that.<eos> I'm gonna have to escort you up.
- We'll make it all available.<eos> - Soon as you have the warrant.<eos> - Can't just take a quick look off the record?<eos> Sorry, Harry, no can do.<eos> I'd lose my job.<eos> If I knew I'd tell you.<eos> Like I said, I was off that night.<eos> Understood.<eos> We'll be back tomorrow with a warrant.<eos> We'll have it all ready for you.
So Mr Hagen was killed and the boat was searched sometime in between you all leaving it and you all returning.<eos> What time was this?<eos> We started our dive at ten o'clock this morning.<eos> It took us a few minutes to swim down to the reef.<eos> We collected samples for 20 minutes and then we all swam back up to the boat.<eos> So the window of opportunity is somewhere between 10am and 10:30?<eos> Then were you in sight of each other the whole time you were underwater?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> I mean, we do try and stay together, but obviously we're focusing on collecting samples.<eos> So one of you could have swum back to the boat.
Then I'd appreciate it if you kept me abreast of the situation.<eos> Yes, of course, sir.<eos> So there's a yacht club on the island, is there?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Only, I've, erm, I've bought a yacht myself.<eos> YOU have?<eos> A yacht?<eos> She needs a little bit of a spit and polish, but, er, once she's shipshape, maybe I could join?<eos> Well, is that the time?<eos> Thank you very much, Detective Inspector, but, erm, I'm sure you're extremely busy.
It was all in one folder and Sam didn't want it to be published.<eos> And would you, by any chance, know where this folder of data might be?<eos> DWAYNE: Mm-hm. OK.<eos> So, that was Frankie from the Saint Marie Dive School.<eos> He said he's had everyone searching the seabed where Dan was shot, but no sign of a wallet, a gold watch or a gun.<eos> There wasn't?<eos> Well, it's a big sea out there, Chief.<eos> And you should know, sir, in saltwater, fingerprints start dissolving fast, so it's possible the evidence wouldn't tell us anything anyway.<eos> Yes, yes, well, thank you for trying.<eos> Er, how about you, Florence?
And you should know, sir, in saltwater, fingerprints start dissolving fast, so it's possible the evidence wouldn't tell us anything anyway.<eos> Yes, yes, well, thank you for trying.<eos> Er, how about you, Florence?<eos> How're you getting on with the folder that Dr Blake and Mr Hagen were arguing over?<eos> It's a lot of data, sir.<eos> It's hard to know what it means.<eos> Yes, well, maybe there's an independent expert you can rustle up to help you go through it?<eos> I'll see if I can find one.<eos> OK.<eos> JP, how about you?
It's not the same for me.<eos> It's taken me a long time to get here.<eos> If I lose my reputation...<eos> You'd lose your new job in the United States.<eos> So you killed Dan Hagen to keep your reputation... your job.<eos> What?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> I'm trying to explain why Dan and I argued the night before he died... ..why it was important to me.<eos> But with Dan alive, he'd have discredited you.
Now, one of them is great at cutting hair, has a spotless salon and charges reasonable prices.<eos> The other barber, is terrible at his job and charges exorbitantly for his services.<eos> What is this?<eos> Now, there is a man in this town who needs a haircut... Huh... and even though he knows the reputation of the two barbers, he chooses to get his hair cut by the bad barber.<eos> Why?<eos> What's this got to do with anything?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We don't know, either.<eos> Is that what you brought us together for?<eos> To ask us riddles? No, I brought you here to reveal who killed Dan Hagen.
I know.<eos> Because it wouldn't make sense to kill Dan before you'd found the cocaine that incriminated you.<eos> So, that leaves only you, Nicky.<eos> And, I have to say that all along you've felt like our most likely killer.<eos> The jilted lover... who still carried a flame.<eos> And yet I now know... you didn't shoot Dan dead, either.<eos> But if she didn't kill him, then who did?<eos> Well, to understand the who, we first need to understand just how Dan Hagen was killed.<eos> Now, you were all in each others' sight the whole time you were underwater.<eos> Yet one of you managed to swim back to the boat, commit murder, trash the boat and get back to the reef, and all without anyone noticing you'd left the reef.
What the...<eos> Oh! Er, sorry,<eos> Water.<eos> Paraffin.<eos> Don't worry, I've got it now.<eos> Grab the bowl, man!<eos> Yes, yes. Sorry.<eos> So, Chief?<eos> Yes. Tell me something.<eos> What exactly did the name Nancy remind you of?
[Lana shouting] Archer!<eos> Wow, say what you will about cyborgs.<eos> Sure can run good.<eos> And I should take the fast way down too, so-- [exhaling rapidly] [screaming]<eos> [Archer] Ow!<eos> [grunting] [shouting]<eos> [Cyril] And now, Ms. Deane-- As promised, your computer disk.<eos> And your cashier's check for $100,000.<eos> And while I appreciate your firm's hard work, I'm sure you'll understand when I say I hope we never meet again.<eos> A feeling that I assure you is mutual.
- No, Mr. Archer.<eos> I need you to get it back, desperately.<eos> Which is an excellent segue into a brief overview of our fee structure.<eos> - Two hundred thousand dollars.<eos> - Wow, that was brief.<eos> Payable upon delivery.<eos> Now, if you will excuse me, I...<eos> I think we might have more questions.<eos> I'm sure you do, but Mr. Shapiro will have to answer them.<eos> He's waiting for you at his house now.
If that disk gets out, she'll be ruined.<eos> And I'm...<eos> And I'm in love with her.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Oh, don't be jealous, baby.<eos> You and I will always have what we had.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> - Uh, so, who did hire you?
So, unless somebody's got two hundred grand burning a hole in their pocket, I...<eos> I have a cashier's check for that exact amount, literally, in my pocket.<eos> It was to pay these private dicks.<eos> But if their actions don't constitute breach of contract, then...<eos> Well, I'll just go ahead and take that.<eos> I already got dibs.<eos> And why the hell are you naked?<eos> It's after Labor Day.<eos> You ain't gonna get away with this.<eos> I'm gonna hunt you down, like...
No, seriously.<eos> Wow.<eos> And who might this person be?<eos> This is our daughter, A.J.<eos> We're here for a placement interview.<eos> Our? Um...<eos> Ours.<eos> As in mine and Archer's.<eos> Yeah I'm not the maid or the nanny.<eos> Good for you.
Wow.<eos> And who might this person be?<eos> This is our daughter, A.J.<eos> We're here for a placement interview.<eos> Our? Um...<eos> Ours.<eos> As in mine and Archer's.<eos> Yeah I'm not the maid or the nanny.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Good for you.
My office, two o'clock.<eos> Yep.<eos> Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?<eos> She said, phrasing? Boom.<eos> Huh?<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No!<eos> Mr. Archer?<eos> Mr. Stratton will see you now.
Fine!<eos> Good luck finding her without the coordinates!<eos> What the shit?<eos> I don't think that's gonna be a problem.<eos> First thing, I'm taking a long hot bath with a nice stiff drink.<eos> And then I'm going to kill everybody!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, get in line, lady!<eos> Hey, whoa! Calm down!<eos> After I kill all you idiots, I'm--
Is it, like, gowns and gloves?<eos> And do I rent a girdle?<eos> Are there gonna be dress fittings?<eos> Do I get a bikini wax?<eos> And I don't know my tiara size!<eos> And, oh, my God, what of shoes?<eos> Uh, your attire will be provided.<eos> This is gonna be suckin' amazing!<eos> Yeah.<eos> For five-eighths of you.
That was, like, four hours ago!<eos> No, it was...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so turned on, I think I'm actually getting dehydrated.<eos> When this is over, remind me to kick your tits off.<eos> No.<eos> Split them up, men and women.<eos> All right.<eos> You have five minutes.<eos> Mr. Nurple and Mr. Giggles will escort you.
Yes.<eos> Your 10:00 is here.<eos> I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for coming.<eos> First off, killer marketing campaign.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Second, you've each been given a non-disclosure agreement to sign.<eos> If any of you repeat anything said in this room,
Is that clear?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Third...<eos> I'm not really sure how to put this, so I'll just go ahead and say it.<eos> I think my husband is cheating on me.<eos> - That's so sad.<eos> I think my wife is cheating on me.<eos> No.<eos> And so I want to hire you.
And so I want to hire you.<eos> To catch her in the act.<eos> I'll need video confirmation, of course.<eos> So you want us to follow him and...<eos> No, not just follow her.<eos> More than that.<eos> Much more.<eos> There's just too much at stake here.<eos> I have to be a hundred percent sure.<eos> And so I want one of you...
Are you kidding?<eos> I could hypnotize everybody in this office.<eos> - No, you couldn't!<eos> - Oh, you can't!<eos> No, but without psychotropic drugs.<eos> Or your goddamn brain chips, like you made that rabbit a vegetable with.<eos> Well, and also a human being.<eos> No, none of that.<eos> Just pure hypnosis.<eos> But if I can hypnotize you, you all have to come see my one-man show,
I mean...<eos> And I thought we were over that.<eos> Well, apparently you're not.<eos> I didn't cast her in Deadly Velvet.<eos> Which, do you think they're currently in principal photography on that, or...<eos> I think it's neither the time nor the place nor the Slater to discuss it!<eos> I'm not the one who brought it up!<eos> - You are exactly the one!<eos> - First of all...<eos> Could you both please shut up and do what I hired you to do?
What about me?<eos> Oh, you just sort of skulk around.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> And I shall pose as an executive producer, which leaves Sterling.<eos> Yeah, it leaves him right here 'cause I'll be damned if I'm helping Lana's new pretend boyfriend make a movie.<eos> - Oh, that's too bad.<eos> - Yeah, well...<eos> Krieger, I suppose you'll just have to be Veronica Deane's new bodyguard.<eos> Let's go, you dumb idiots.<eos> Well, one of you, anyway.
Don't ask.<eos> You'll gag.<eos> I thought maybe you dopes had stumbled onto some sort of mafia shakedown.<eos> We've been here, like, four minutes.<eos> Well? Anything suspicious so far?<eos> Uh, just you?<eos> What, I'm a flamboyant Hollywood producer.<eos> Not the world's tiniest drag queen?<eos> What?<eos> I said we'll keep you updated.
People are falling on shit.<eos> Like the ground.<eos> Well, I think it's all just a big dumb coincidence, but even if it's not, don't worry about...<eos> Veronica Deane.<eos> Yes?<eos> Oh, hello, Alan.<eos> Wait.<eos> That's why you're here?<eos> Yeah, Crane hired us.<eos> It's nice to see you again, Ms. Deane.
Wait.<eos> That's why you're here?<eos> Yeah, Crane hired us.<eos> It's nice to see you again, Ms. Deane.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Oh, um, yeah.<eos> I'm Sterling Archer, private investigator.<eos> You hired me.<eos> Um, and then another time, I protected you in a hostage situation, dressed as a clown.
Merely an ill-advised attempt at levity.<eos> Okay.<eos> And in light of your various professional, or, in some cases, personal relationships with the victim, at the present time, you are all persons of interest.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Calm down.<eos> He didn't say "suspects".<eos> Yet.<eos> But until we do have a suspect...<eos> Or suspects.<eos> We are gonna have to ask you not to leave town without checking with us.
You will comply!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey...<eos> It's all good, buddy!<eos> She's comin' down to the station.<eos> - Comin' down to the station, right?<eos> - Uh, yup.<eos> See?<eos> She's comin' down to the station.<eos> Yeah!<eos> 'Cause I remember you, Lana Kane.
Please rewind to Milkly's heinous murder and play it back for us.<eos> - All righty...<eos> - None of this is admissible!<eos> And more importantly, they're robots.<eos> Accessing digit... al...<eos> Ba-Ba-Ba-Batter-r-ry l-l-l-low.<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> - No-ho!<eos> Aw, thank God.<eos> Gunshot residue testing and the truth... shall set you free!
Goddamn it!<eos> Veronica!<eos> Veronica!<eos> Ow.<eos> Wha...<eos> Who puts a table there?<eos> Archer?<eos> Archer.<eos> - Archer!<eos> - That would be Ms. Archer to you.
It's cool.<eos> We've already been through all this.<eos> - OKAY, A:<eos> They're not robots.<eos> - Nobody cares.<eos> they're obviously good enough to pass the Turing test.<eos> - Oh, totally.<eos> - Whatever that is.<eos> Okay, you're all free to go!<eos> - Including you, Miss Kane.
- And I'm dying.<eos> Whatever you are can't scare me.<eos> Let me come visit.<eos> I want to say hi.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You okay?<eos> Please check in at our self-service pods using swipe cards provided.<eos> - You must be Kelly.<eos> - I guess I must.<eos> - She's waiting for you.

Lobbying is about foresight about anticipating your opponents' moves and devising countermeasures.<eos> The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition and plays their trump card just after they play theirs.<eos> You better not be saying that when you're in there.<eos> It's about making sure you surprise them and they don't surprise you.
Those words; when you're not taking the oath or confirming details;<eos> those words, in that order, are all you're going to say.<eos> On average, would you say you bribe public officials more or less than once a month?<eos> Upon the advice of Counsel...<eos> can I deviate slightly?<eos> On the advice of Counsel?<eos> On the advice of my Attorney?<eos> Do not...<eos> Ok, ok, I understand.<eos> That last one's too adventurous for you.
On the advice of Counsel?<eos> On the advice of my Attorney?<eos> Do not...<eos> Ok, ok, I understand.<eos> That last one's too adventurous for you.<eos> This would be a whole lot easier if I could just shout:<eos> Fifth! They want you behind bars.<eos> You make one statement, you correct one nefarious allegation...that's it!<eos> You waive your right to defend and you're compelled to answer everything.<eos> They're taking you to the woodshed in front of the national press... They're going to rile you so bad, they'd make Gandhi want to cut their tongues out.
You never washed your hands.<eos> He'll take the wife and kids on a tropical vacation... His Bill dies a quiet death.<eos> If the Indonesian Government pays for it, it's illegal get this nonprofit C3 to sponsor the travel, it's perfectly legal as long the trip is for educational purposes.<eos> But the Indonesian Government is still paying for it.<eos> See, this is why I'm still thinking about post-grad.<eos> Jane, we go to school to prepare us for the real world.<eos> Not sure I like the real world. So you want to bury your head in Socrates?<eos> You know that Socrates never actually wrote anything?<eos> That's besides the point. If you don't like it, you change it...that's why you're here.<eos> Ms. Sloane, they're ready for you in the Conference Room
i can just picture the good Senator being boiled in a cauldron with all these natives dancing around him.<eos> Get back to your Fortune 500 clients...<eos> Your colorful interventions are the cause of a lot of industry backchat this firm can do without..<eos> I work on behalf of causes I believe in.<eos> That's how I sleep at night.<eos> You don't sleep at night!<eos> You sit and obsess about winning, no matter the cause.<eos> Those little pills in your purse are not the kind that lull you to sleep.<eos> The only reason you and your team of gum-chewing ragamuffins are here is that your arrogant pranks might generate enough buzz to attract clients like Bill Sandford.<eos> Meaning, if you don't dedicate yourself to his cause.. This firm won't have any use for you.
Argue "cake" in the name is really marketing puff.<eos> You need evidence in court?<eos> We get a team of scientists to apply the very fact: 80% cookie and 0% cake.<eos> That's how you win.<eos> You, you knew that all along?<eos> You would have gotten there eventually.<eos> Then why are you telling me this?<eos> In case you're not coming with me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Alright, everyone, I called you here to announce... that, effective immediately, I am leaving Cole Kravitz and starting work as the lead consultant for the Brady Campaign at Peterson Wyatt.
Now you've thrown out the Fifth, anyone who wants you in the ground, that's a lot of people they are hard at work dedicating their creative and intellectual efforts to catching you in a lie.<eos> Well, what if I just stay silent?<eos> Oh, that's a great idea!<eos> Shit, why didn't your lawyer think of that?<eos> If I refuse to answer?<eos> They'll throw you in jail for contempt of Congress! Shhh!<eos> You've just blown this thing wide open!<eos> Calm down, Daniel.<eos> You're starting to look like you care.<eos> No, I don't care about you any further than I can throw you.
I know I don't have the most stellar record in heeding your advice...<eos> Don't perjure yourself!<eos> Too bad things didn't pan out with Elizabeth.<eos> 2 Months, 3 Weeks prior<eos> Oh, we have other options. What the hell is Amish Chicken?<eos> A marketing exercise?<eos> No, we\x22ll just try and find ourselves another lobbyist.<eos> I was talking about the Amish Chicken.<eos> She's your enemy now.<eos> I invited you here because nobody is better placed to neutralize her than us.
That kind kind of insight is exactly why you're here.<eos> I'm sorry, who closed him again?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Evening, maam.<eos> What happened to the usual guy, Mark?<eos> If that is his real name.<eos> Mark's moved on.<eos> Call me Ford.<eos> Is that your real name?<eos> Is to you.

What a well-reasoned basis for opinion...<eos> Give him a gavel, put him in a courthouse...<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> You eat here every night?<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Place never closes.<eos> How do you not get bored of it?<eos> It's a necessity.<eos> It's like asking if I get bored going to the toilet.<eos> Ok, this is going to sound alien to you but food takes up an inordinate amount of space in my head.
Back him into a corner, he'll have no choice.<eos> ...of an additional 2 million dollars for the purchase of 4 brand new machines ...within the first year of my next term. Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much. Thank you.<eos> Alright, a few more questions for the Senator and then we'll wrap up.<eos> Uh, yes, the lady in white.<eos> Mr. Senator, I'm here for the Westfield Center...<eos> He was supposed to go to me third?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Following orders.<eos> Three tables behind you, 2 to the right.
Sandford's not a punk. He knows the opposition's countin' on him..<eos> He also knows if they don't get them, their campaign will be over. So what are you gonna do?<eos> Walk into my club, bend me over a green beige table and give me a spiel about freedom?<eos> About how, if the liberals get their way, in a couple of hundred years the Second Amendment will enshrine our right to carry baseball bats?<eos> No, that's the argument you're going to make to your friends in the Blue Dog coalition when you tell them you're changing your position.<eos> Bill Sandford's thinkin' about backing' a new candidate.<eos> One of their own, a real up-and-comer, Hispanic.<eos> Got offers from 8 Ivy League schools. Ivy League Schools?<eos> Have you seen my approval ratings, pal?<eos> No, he's not runnin' against you...
You have a PAC (Political Action Committee)?<eos> Bill Sandford's getting a nasty surprise come Filing Day. How nasty we talkin'?<eos> 15 million from over 3 million donors nasty.<eos> In one quarter?<eos> Actually, less less. Unbelievable!<eos> Why are you telling me this now?<eos> You kept this from me all along and you're telling me tonight? My God!<eos> I tell you we're back in the game, and all you can say is that?<eos> You knew you were going to screw Esme tonight.<eos> So you kept this from me to blindside me before I had a chance to fire you..
Numark, yeah! . Milner...<eos> Carlson... Wade Powell, Virginia.<eos> Hackman come over too.<eos> We lost Milner, Newman, Carlson, Hackman.<eos> Adamu said he's softening his position... Alex...<eos> I'll soften his fucking...<eos> ...Bill Sandford's on Line3.<eos> I'm closing Adamu right the fuck now!<eos> She takes my own idea and goes up against us with it.<eos> Been tryin' to warn you, Bill. 15 Million!
You're kidding me!<eos> Wow, that's amazing.<eos> Alright, we're joined now by Esme Manucharian. Esme, thanks for joining us...<eos> Would you say that the gun debate has now llargely become a womens' issue?<eos> You need only look at the numbers to see that gun safety... has become a deciding issue for American women.<eos> If their representative isn't listening, they'll go to the polls and elect someone who will..<eos> What do you want?<eos> I've got 15 million to blow.<eos> Lauren was going through your letters between the death threats and the hate mail, he found this. this.<eos> Pru Walsh of the Sentinel is doing an article on lobbying...that means you.

Plotting to ensnare our last 4 Senators.<eos> 6 down, 4 to go... we're actually doing...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry, my fault.<eos> It's alright, let me help you..<eos> Thanks. Here you go.<eos> Ok?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Remember that first day when I asked you "How do we win?" and you said:
Your own terms. No media, you can work behind the scenes.<eos> If you don't want to work with me, I'll resign from the campaign.<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> Is that your move to get me back at my desk?<eos> You want me in front of a camera to counter Frank McGill?<eos> It even crossed my mind that this was all you.<eos> You just didn't account for an armed civilian right behind me. Esme...<eos> I'll keep fighting, Elizabeth.<eos> Wherever I can make a difference.<eos> But as far as possible away from you.
The West Coast is still awake.<eos> If we can connect with Oregon we close those goddamn loggers, we can get it up to 5 votes tonight.<eos> Go and get some rest, guys.<eos> We did enough for today<eos> I'll take to the streets and rip down those fucking Frank McGill posters one at a time if I have to.<eos> Go home, sharpen your knives.<eos> It'll still be on tomorrow.<eos> So we keep on fighting.<eos> That's all we can do.<eos> As my ex-wife used to say I met you running from a fundraiser.
I thought it was the palm oil thing.<eos> Palm oil? Nutella tax.<eos> Hold on...<eos> The Indonesians?<eos> I don't remember seeing that.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Mr. Dupont?<eos> She's in breach of Senate ethics rules.<eos> We can prove it.<eos> Things aren't looking so good for you this cycle, Ron.
You ask me, you need a lot nore paid media.<eos> I didn't ask you.<eos> Now, who might just be able to fund those coveted TV spots?<eos> I'm committed to Heaton-Harris.<eos> I can't vote for it with one hand and choke it with the other.<eos> Under cover of impariality, sure you can.<eos> You've been a vocal critic of lobbyists in the past.<eos> You'll begin an inquiry into Sloane's affairs in response to... growing media pressure regarding her litany of misdeeds.<eos> The cost of hearings is paid from the public purse.<eos> Ron, our clients have identified you as the man to pull this off.

Make no mistake. These rats are the real parasites on American democracy.<eos> I anticipated, if we had sufficient success, in lobbying for the Heaton-Harris Bill there may be an assault against me personally to stall our momentum and to damage our credibility.<eos> Lobbying is about foresight about anticipating your opponent's moves and devising countermeasures.<eos> I'd like to discuss my future.<eos> This is hardly the time, Cookie!<eos> The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition and plays their trump card just after they play theirs.<eos> Actually, it is the time.<eos> It's about making sure you surprise them...<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> ...and that they don't surprise you.
Order!<eos> This is not a platform you can use to make malicious...<eos> Put the following address into your browser:<eos> 193.184.216.449.<eos> Download a file named: "earthquake".<eos> (I can't vote for it with one hand and choke it with the other)<eos> Set the com!<eos> (The cost of hearings is paid from the public purse)<eos> In light of these allegations, this meeting is adjourned!<eos> (They won't stop until they annihilate you)
I'm gonna make a proper convict out of you yet.<eos> Hold the belly button up in the air.<eos> Great.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Every minute you've got to move to your best ability.<eos> Last one.<eos> Take it down now. Stretch it out...<eos> Mr. Day?<eos> Hi. My name's Chandra.<eos> I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute?
What are you doing?<eos> You wanna come over?<eos> We could stay in, watch TV, go out to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que whatever you want.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Call me.<eos> I love you.<eos> ...to help you search for any kind of biological evidence.<eos> Then, according to police, further disruptions...<eos> Your presence here today makes it possible for the court to select a jury from a representative sample of our community.<eos> If it wasn't for people like you, we would not be able to make real the Constitution's guarantee of the right to trial by jury.
You were his only customer?<eos> There were, you know, some other friends.<eos> What did he charge?<eos> Ten dollars for a 10 milligram.<eos> You know where he got them?<eos> I think he had a prescription.<eos> You know what he paid to have it filled?<eos> No.<eos> Ten-dollar co-pay, insurance paid the rest.<eos> So, at his cost of 25 cents each, the $10 he was charging you comes to a 3,900% profit for him.

Thank you, Dr. Katz.<eos> Your witness, Mrs. Weiss.<eos> Dr. Katz, it's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> And you.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> But I'm not famous like you are.<eos> I'm not famous.<eos> No pathologist is famous.<eos> Maybe I'm known in certain professional circles, but that's about it.<eos> No one recognizes you on the street?
Heil Hitler!<eos> You can't catch me, You can't catch me!<eos> O, a Soldier!<eos> Come here, children. It's time to go home.<eos> It is difficult to hide what you feel.<eos> My soldiers are waiting for My example.<eos> On my return, I was promoted.<eos> It annoys me how things are.<eos> What will happen with to the Third Reich, for I Find a new motivation? Or else I will die soon.<eos> Scharführer Herkel, I want to introduce you STURMBANNFÜHRER PRUNELLA.
# I hear them scratching like I don't know better<eos> # Won't you keep the wolves from the door?<eos> # It won't be long before I cave in and open up the door. #<eos> Good morning.<eos> Hi, I'm Arrash Sayyad.<eos> Stefan Kowolski.<eos> Yes, do come in.<eos> Feel free to take a look around.<eos> It's always nice to get a feel for the place.<eos> Neither of you are smokers?
There's got to be a catch.<eos> - Why do you have to be so negative?<eos> - Because it's too good to be true.<eos> - Mate, it's not... - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)<eos> MAN: Amazing view!<eos> Told you.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> You didn't say anything about this being an open house.<eos> (LAUGHS) I'm sorry.<eos> If you're interested in the property, we'll consider you for the shortlist.
- Maybe he should get it checked.<eos> - What?<eos> The alarm.<eos> That's good, that, yeah, that'll be a real help... now that everything's been nicked!<eos> Excuse me, have you got a minute to talk about how we can stamp out child poverty in Africa?<eos> No, have you got a minute to step out of the way?<eos> But w-we're raising money for disadvantaged children...<eos> I've already got one, thanks.<eos> Our Child believes that every child on the planet has a right to laughter and happiness.<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to welcome its founder and director,
So, have you told her? Yes.<eos> Have you told your flatmates?<eos> - No, that's different.<eos> - Why?<eos> They're Polish.<eos> They get very emotional.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I'm just going to move out and hope they don't notice.<eos> I've got to go, I've got the night shift.<eos> I'll leave you two together.
Go back to sleep.<eos> Alex!<eos> My husband's upstairs.<eos> He'll be calling the police.<eos> You should leave. Now!<eos> He's been stabbed.<eos> He's got multiple lacerations on his back.<eos> He's bleeding internally, and I think his liver's been punctured.<eos> It was burglars. It happened in the flat.<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Those burglaries you're investigating.<eos> Yes, guv.<eos> It's now attempted murder.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Yes, guv.<eos> With ticket sales and the silent auction, our gala last night raised the amazing sum of £420,000!<eos> Thank you, everyone.<eos> That's all down to your effort.<eos> It's a fantastic result.<eos> And to those of you who weren't invited,
- I don't know, Lisa.<eos> You tell me.<eos> Look, we raised nearly half a million pounds last night.<eos> Do you have any idea what difference that's going to make?<eos> You just don't get it, do you?<eos> No, Lisa, I don't.<eos> Two men, married.<eos> I suppose that sort of thing doesn't bother you.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> - Does it bother you, Sarge?
William!<eos> Yeah?<eos> What kept you?<eos> You're losing your touch!<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Generally, he's fine.<eos> He's still very sleepy and his potassium levels are a bit low.<eos> He could be hypokalaemic from the blood transfusion he received.<eos> Are you still going ahead with medical school?<eos> I was going to ask you for a reference.
Do you think you could handle the infusion? Yeah.<eos> I've done it before, I know what to do.<eos> Thanks, Leila, that's great.<eos> So, 10ml per hour over five hours.<eos> Right.<eos> OK.<eos> - Can I get you something?<eos> - No, I'm all right, thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Sorry to disturb you both.
- And there's three others. - Three others?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We're in.<eos> Mr Lorca?<eos> That's rne, yeah.<eos> RASH:<eos> I locked myself out.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's my London pad.<eos> I can get the lock open for you, but I can't let you in without seeing ID.
Oh, we booked the Discovery package.<eos> - What's your name, please?<eos> - Stefan Kowolski.<eos> With a K.<eos> Yes, Mr Kowolski.<eos> I see you paid in advance.<eos> Is this your first time here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eren?<eos> Eren will look after you.
By the way, a friend of mine comes here from time to time. Daniel Lorca.<eos> Lorca'?<eos> He hasn't visited recently, has he?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Follow me, please.<eos> Yep.<eos> Mr Malik.<eos> Thank you, Yusef. just deal with that for me, would you?<eos> Eleanor Davies will see you shortly.
What about him?<eos> Have you started sorting through his belongings?<eos> No.<eos> The longer you wait, Carrie...<eos> What?<eos> The harder it gets?<eos> Trust me, it can't get any fucking harder.<eos> Hey, get those last three pallets loaded. That truck should have been on the road hours ago.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Mr. Proctor, I was not expecting you today.
Hey, Rebecca.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> Get down!<eos> Bunker.<eos> Not the kind of bar I would think you'd hang out in.<eos> There's a lot you don't know about me.<eos> I'm sure that's true, sir.<eos> Is there a law against drinking in this bar?<eos> The sheriff asked me to ask you to wait.
- Mr. Mayor. - What is it, Deputy?<eos> The last three guys your district attorney cut loose were all royally fucked up after the fact.<eos> - Vigilante?<eos> - I think it's more than that.<eos> See, all three releases were connected to you.<eos> Whoever the vigilante is, they know you've got the DA in your pocket.<eos> Someone's sending you a message.<eos> Sheriff Lotus.<eos> - What do you think, Deputy?<eos> - I think Brock makes a lot of noise, but he'd never come after you like that.
I'll bet a week's pay the tox screen will find similar traces of Valium and Demerol in her system.<eos> He probably used just enough to keep her conscious, but knock the fight out of her.<eos> God damn it, Dan. Just give me something. Anything to catch this asshole.<eos> Uh... a fingerprint, DNA, something.<eos> This guy's good, Brock!<eos> He covers his tracks like a pro.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> You've got nothing, then. - Actually... I've got the opposite of nothing.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I haven't seen you in here before, have I?
Yeah, that always seems to suck the air right out of the room.<eos> I take it you're Sheriff Lotus.<eos> - And you are?<eos> - Kai Proctor.<eos> Mr. Proctor, I am truly sorry for your loss.<eos> Let's go, Proctor.<eos> - I got this. - Get your fucking hands off me!<eos> I got this, Sheriff.<eos> Mr. Proctor, I can only imagine how frustrated you must be with how things have been handled.<eos> But this is my investigation now and while I've got a little bit of lost time to make up for, I can assure you I'm a quick study and I plan to get to the bottom of things.
By the book, breach and arrest. He had the perp facedown and zip-tied when in walks the guy's 13-year-old nephew holding a Glock 9.<eos> Paul could have dropped him in a heartbeat.<eos> I mean, who can't outshoot a kid, right?<eos> But instead he tried to talk him down.<eos> I guess that kid didn't feel like talking.<eos> He shot Paul in the neck.<eos> Killed him instantly.<eos> - You've been doing this a while.<eos> - Long enough.<eos> So either you think I'm an idiot or you wanted me to call you on it.
Move!<eos> - So how'd that go?<eos> - Like clockwork.<eos> See you again real soon there, convict.<eos> And you fuck your mama, Larry.<eos> You my ride?<eos> Nice car.<eos> Them Krauts always done it best.<eos> We headed to Banshee?<eos> Mr. Proctor would like to see you at your earliest convenience.
- Do you live here?<eos> - Just visiting.<eos> - It's a lot of surveillance equipment.<eos> Well, you know what they say, just 'cause you're paranoid don't mean they ain't all out to get you.<eos> - Words to live by.<eos> - Have a safe night.<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> I just want to say a few things real quick.<eos> I gotta thank you all for this celebration.<eos> It's great to see all of you.
- I know I can keep a secret.<eos> - You stay out of this.<eos> If it makes it any easier, you really don't have a choice.<eos> All right, so why don't we just arrest Calvin?<eos> She'll never testify against him.<eos> She's terrified.<eos> She thinks Calvin killed her father.<eos> Does Calvin know?<eos> - Does Calvin know what?<eos> - About you two.
- I highly doubt it.<eos> You can't go back there.<eos> - You can't go back there.<eos> - I know.<eos> They'll soften up... - Sweet Jesus.<eos> - Hey, hey, you can't be in here.<eos> And yet I am. FBI.<eos> Honey, get out of here.<eos> Dr. David Quick.<eos> I have been looking for you.
I can't imagine devil horns is a common request.<eos> They're more common than you think.<eos> It's Satan's country out here.<eos> Yeah, but still, it's pretty unique, even for a guy like you.<eos> Who was the last guy you did?<eos> I'm sure you remember something.<eos> The kind of people who want this shit, they're not exactly model citizens.<eos> I take cash in advance.<eos> I don't even ask their names.<eos> How convenient for you.
But speaking of problems, remember that matter you asked me to look into?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I looked into it.<eos> You found him?<eos> No, I found her.<eos> Exhibit number four was also turned in to our hearing officer five days before this trial began.<eos> Now, if it pleases the court, you'll note that the photograph shows the remnants of a crushed back side door.<eos> - This photograph was taken at the scene...<eos> - Mrs. Hopewell.<eos> I'm seeing you around the courthouse quite often these days.
- What happened?<eos> - They came for me.<eos> Who came for you, Carrie?<eos> You want the truth?<eos> I'm a liar.<eos> I lied to my family. I lied to my husband.<eos> Gordon, he never lied.<eos> And his truth is the only one I have left.<eos> He dedicated his whole life to fighting corruption in this town.<eos> And you feel you have to see it through because he died saving you.
That's rich.<eos> I was deputy to a criminal.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It all makes sense now.<eos> All of it.<eos> I'm so stupid.<eos> If you're not Lucas Hood... what's your name?<eos> It's good to see you again.
Oh, hello again.<eos> Just looking for the ice machine.<eos> Hey. W-What the hell were you...?<eos> That's private back there.<eos> You're not supposed to be...<eos> Oh... That's a security feature.<eos> I had it put in after 9/11.<eos> I'm not gonna report you.<eos> When one checks into an establishment such as this, one expects the manager to be a Peeping Tom.<eos> But I do harbor suspicions that you saw something in that trashed room that greatly disturbed you.
I recommended, the next time he felt an episode coming on, that he go for a quiet stroll in the local cemetery.<eos> A reminder that no matter how overwhelming our anxieties might be, they will soon be resolved, when we are dead and buried for all eternity.<eos> Do you really think that's sound therapeutic advice?<eos> It's what I do.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Uh... a moment.<eos> A prescription... for yourself.<eos> For me?<eos> Why me?<eos> Perhaps I've read you wrong, Mr. Mulder, but I wonder-- who is in more need of an antipsychotic, a man who believes himself to be a were-lizard or a man who believes that man?
It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Nothing makes sense.<eos> I don't mean to intrude, but you seem to have something weighing heavily on you.<eos> It might help to get it off your chest.<eos> You mean... to confess?<eos> If you have something to confess.<eos> Well, I confess that... if life is nonsense... I just want this madness to end.<eos> But you're not thinking of doing anything crazy, are you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just gonna... kill you.
You okay?<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, no! I've lost my weapon!<eos> Here.<eos> Come on, defend yourself!<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> The green glass, the appendix.<eos> But I'm not gonna do it.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.
The green glass, the appendix.<eos> But I'm not gonna do it.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> The only way you can help me, mister, is... by killing me.<eos> Please.<eos> Just put me out of my misery.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll kill you.
Wait.<eos> I'm confused already.<eos> You said you were going to start at the beginning.<eos> I am.<eos> That's how the whole thing started.<eos> I should have stayed still, but I panicked.<eos> I tried to scare off that predator.<eos> Of course, that only made him more rabid.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to shoot blood out of my eyeballs.<eos> So you're saying a man bit you?
I don't care how much it costs, I'll do it.<eos> They cut off your genitals.<eos> Nah, I'll leave it.<eos> That's... that's a step too far, isn't it?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay.<eos> Well, anyway, I think she gave me a concussion.<eos> Rest of the night's pretty foggy.<eos> Some people chased me around a truck, and a man took a picture of me in the Porta Potti.<eos> That was me, actually.<eos> I thought I recognized you!
Agent Scully is a medical doctor. We think we can communicate...<eos> Communicate? To say what?<eos> "You shouldn't have done it, son"?<eos> There's a chance to question him about<eos> - who was behind the bombing.<eos> - And you think he's gonna tell you?<eos> By any moral definition, this body here isn't a human.<eos> By my definition, this terrorist is dead. I'm sorry, but what's your business here?<eos> I suggest that you both take a little breather and call your superiors in Washington, if you have any questions.<eos> I'm gonna ask you to leave. I'll give the orders, Agent Miller.
How do you say "Howdy, pardner" in Arabic?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You Agent Einstein?<eos> No, I'm Agent Dana Scully. Agent Miller?<eos> - Yes. Is there a problem?<eos> - I'm Special Agent Brem, here to inform you that this hospital is under terror threat.<eos> I've got a cordon of agents near the building as a precaution against an attack, but I need to clear this wing until we can bring in the bomb squad. You know where the threat came from?<eos> An anonymous caller, but... a very clear guess... there's a large and...<eos> unassimilated Muslim community in the area, with one shared wish. One shared wish that what?<eos> To wipe you and America off the map.
What were were doing was under your medical supervision,<eos> - all on the up and up.<eos> - It was until it wasn't.<eos> Well, it's not like it was volitional.<eos> What was it, Agent Mulder?<eos> It was the Magic Mushrooms.<eos> Maybe I took too much.<eos> Maybe you didn't take enough.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Agent Einstein informed me that you requested that she administer an illicit substance to you in your rather reckless attempt to talk to an alleged mass murderer.
So I did...<eos> I-I... I did dance then?<eos> According to a whole bunch of very frightened, middle-aged Texans.<eos> You're just covering your ass.<eos> Well, either way.<eos> I'll be looking at disciplinary action over my own dismal failure of authority.<eos> Thanks to you, I'll probably be banished to my own basement office, consigned to a life of ridicule and ignominy...<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm begging you!
Maybe you haven't failed.<eos> Agent Scully.<eos> Miller.<eos> This is Noora.<eos> She's come here today to talk to her son, Shiraz.<eos> Mulder, where did you find her?<eos> Please don't ask him that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Got you.<eos> We believe that he can hear you.
We spent months on those trials.<eos> We've tried every new source of pluripotent stem cells, including samples from amniotic fluids.<eos> We need more than just pronouncements from above.<eos> We need direction!<eos> What about a meeting with the man?<eos> You want the Founder to tell you how terrible your data is face-to-face?<eos> The guy is a recluse.<eos> No one here's even seen him for years.<eos> For all we know, he didn't even read the stuff.<eos> I can assure you that Augustus Goldman is fully engaged.
How do you know that?<eos> I'm old-school, Mulder.<eos> Pre-Google.<eos> ♪ tell me, baby... ♪<eos> Gupta?<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> My name is...<eos> No... no names, please.<eos> You're Sonny's friend?<eos> Is that guy bothering you?
Thanks for meeting me.<eos> My name is...<eos> No... no names, please.<eos> You're Sonny's friend?<eos> Is that guy bothering you?<eos> Not yet.<eos> What... do you... want?<eos> I want to talk.<eos> Can we go somewhere more private?<eos> I don't... know you well enough.
I'll agree to relay a message.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ask Dr. Goldman if he'll talk to us about the Founder's Mutation.<eos> Stay here.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Agnes.<eos> You got a car?<eos> Do you want to call someone?<eos> You think if I could call someone I would be asking you?
No!<eos> Let go!<eos> - Molly! Oop! - Let go of me!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - No!<eos> No!<eos> - I'm afraid that that is all the time that I have.<eos> Sarah will show you out.
I don't know how it got there.<eos> Okay, you need to get this man out of here, get him to see a doc immediately.<eos> Can you do that, Sandeep?<eos> Yes, certainly.<eos> Right away.<eos> Can I direct them in any way?<eos> Just find out who he is and what he's been exposed to.<eos> I'm not sure what this is going to prove.<eos> Well, it may prove nothing or it may be negative.<eos> I don't want to alarm you, Agent Einstein, but... about six weeks ago, I took my own blood, and in sequencing my genome, I discovered an anomaly.
It's actually not that far-fetched and within the realm of accepted science.<eos> Something entering the germ line, something that would be passed down hereditarily.<eos> That would be an unprecedented violation of the public trust.<eos> And now you know a bit more of the history I was referring to.<eos> For the purpose of what?<eos> I don't know, Agent Einstein.<eos> And I don't know if any of this is true.<eos> But what I do know is that the possibility exists, and that is reason enough to run these tests.<eos> Hey.<eos> Been looking for you.
- There's talk on the Internet.<eos> - What kind of talk?<eos> People are freaking out about reports on The Tad O'Malley Show.<eos> Now, I know this is hard for people at home to comprehend.<eos> So what are we looking at, Dr. Rubell-- the scale and scope?<eos> A scale we've never dreamed.<eos> A scope that quickly becomes global.<eos> A massive contagion, then?<eos> Not one contagion, but a variety of contagions.<eos> If the flu doesn't kill you, then something else will.
He's expected to make a full recovery.<eos> He'd been near death, so badly burned they were having to reconstruct his entire face.<eos> Why would he summon you?<eos> He had an offer to make.<eos> Agent Reyes, please come in.<eos> I think you know who I am.<eos> I thought that you were dead.<eos> They haven't killed me yet, as hard as they may try.<eos> Is it hard to look at me?<eos> Considering what I know about you, the things you've done, the people you've done them to...
What are you thinking, Agent Einstein?<eos> That this was our mistake.<eos> What was?<eos> Our sample was too small.<eos> Agent Mulder.<eos> Agent Mulder.<eos> Agent Mulder.<eos> Agent Mulder.<eos> Agent...<eos> I'm getting you out of here.
Why didn't you ask him?<eos> 'Cause that's exactly what he wants.<eos> Who the hell are you anyway?<eos> Before he dies, tell him good-bye for me.<eos> There it is.<eos> There it is.<eos> That's alien DNA we're looking at.<eos> You'll have to centrifuge it.<eos> Think I need to lie down.<eos> We're gonna cure you, Agent Einstein.
Driving north with Mulder.<eos> And what's his condition?<eos> He's not doing so well.<eos> And what's your condition, Agent Miller?<eos> Yeah, we could use a couple doctors.<eos> Help is on its way, I promise.<eos> Okay, we're gonna keep driving, but there's been a run on gasoline.<eos> We may just run out of road here.<eos> Keep your phone charged.<eos> I'll come and find you wherever you are.
Stop it, please!<eos> Please, everybody, get to the hospital!<eos> Get to the hospital!<eos> Help is on its way, I promise.<eos> Just get to the hospital.<eos> I've... just gotten a text from a doctor, saying now there is... a ray of light.<eos> A vaccine... that could be a miracle.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> All I see are cars.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna find you.
And by the way, honey, with all this decolletage you should be getting a lot more dickoletage than what he has to offer.<eos> And as I can recall it, you were the one that told me that when he came, it was as thin as coconut water.<eos> Honey, that's a deal breaker for me.<eos> It was that thin.<eos> Well, I see we're settling for less nowadays.<eos> That's beyond.<eos> Mrs. Morrow, a package arrived for you.
- What'd he say?<eos> - Don't believe it, Dad. - He said we had a flat tire.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> Don't believe him.<eos> We don't have a flat.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Yep, your left tire's flat. It sure is.<eos> Must have bust it when you were shoving us off the road.<eos> We did not shove you off the road.
We're in the middle of nowhere.<eos> What are we gonna do, Tony?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> What are we gonna do, Tony?<eos> I tell you what.<eos> We'll fix it for you, won't we, guys?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just to show you we're okay, we'll fix it for you.
No, we were just trying to get...<eos> You were playing some kind of crazy game.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> There goes your cops.<eos> You should have tried harder to stop 'em. That's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll take good care of you.
They weren't in the car.<eos> We're turning the case over to Lieutenant Andes.<eos> He wants to know if he can pick you up in a few minutes.<eos> Yeah, I'm ready now.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Oh, glad to meet you.<eos> I'm Bobby Andes.<eos> I look into things around here. - You found my car?<eos> - They found it in a creek bed.<eos> Tell you what, we take you back to the house we picked you up at, you think you could backtrack from there?
I look into things around here. - You found my car?<eos> - They found it in a creek bed.<eos> Tell you what, we take you back to the house we picked you up at, you think you could backtrack from there?<eos> I could try.<eos> Okay, then, you try.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's my understanding these fellas didn't have any guns.<eos> No.<eos> All right.<eos> So let me get this straight, you say some fella named Lou just drove you out into the brush and left you there?
I'm just, like, so confused by this algorithm.<eos> Well, just pulse your neurons until the answer manifests itself.<eos> What? Pulse?<eos> Pulse my neurons?<eos> Pulse my neurons. Was that in the book?<eos> I'm gonna pay attention to Greg now.<eos> And that's that on bounded heuristics.<eos> Great first class, everyone.<eos> Tonight's assignment is just gonna be a fun one.<eos> I want each of you to design a professional quality video game.
First time here?<eos> Me?<eos> No, I used to live here.<eos> For almost 10 years.<eos> And you left?<eos> Yup.<eos> So what brings you back?
It's basically the same thing.<eos> You should come by sometime.<eos> See me in action.<eos> Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> And if not, you know, this trip, then the next one for sure.<eos> Patty!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - There they are.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - We thought we'd lost you.
You will be offered a vast area of land in the Northern part of Frankia.<eos> The emperor also offers the hand in marriage of his beautiful daughter.<eos> What must I do in return?<eos> You will defend Paris against your brother.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to know if a woman will succeed to the kingdom of Kattegat.<eos> You mean after the death of Ragnar?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is unwise to imagine the death of kings.<eos> I still ask you.
I want to see him!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Quickly!<eos> - I can see from a distance!<eos> - That is his horse!<eos> It is him!<eos> - Einar!<eos> - Earl Kalf.<eos> My friend.<eos> It's for you.
See what we have brought back from Paris.<eos> Not just me, but also Lagertha.<eos> During the fierce fighting that took place around the walls and the gates of Paris, about which the poets will soon have their say,<eos> I saved Lagertha's life.<eos> And she saved mine.<eos> So I propose, even though we are not married, Lagertha and I will share the earldom and rule together as equals.<eos> As your Earl, that is my determination.<eos> Come on, keep them moving.<eos> This way, this way. Come, come, come, come!<eos> Gentlemen, do I have something special for you today.
- I will.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I will tell you a story...<eos> Einar.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Your arrangement to share the earldom with Lagertha is unacceptable.<eos> To whom?<eos> To me and to my family.<eos> It was my family who made you Earl.<eos> We can just as easily unmake you.
Don't touch me.<eos> Monster.<eos> Goodnight, wife.<eos> I will cut you.<eos> You're tickling me.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Go to sleep, you animal.<eos> Are you asleep?<eos> How dare you?<eos> I have summoned you here because it seems that I have made a mistake, when I announced that Lagertha and I would rule together.
Goodnight, wife.<eos> I will cut you.<eos> You're tickling me.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Go to sleep, you animal.<eos> Are you asleep?<eos> How dare you?<eos> I have summoned you here because it seems that I have made a mistake, when I announced that Lagertha and I would rule together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Apparently, such an arrangement is unacceptable to some of you here.
Last one to the car's a bitch, 'cause it's you.<eos> - [laughs] - Okay.<eos> All right, thank you. [clattering]<eos> So much for... oops.<eos> That's... never mind that.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - I'll let you get that, yeah.<eos> - It's an ornate ball.<eos> Um, Virginia, could I... sorry.<eos> Hi, can I just ask you...
"And in the last days, it shall be God declares "that 'I will pour forth out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons, and your daughters'"... - This is it.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> - "'Who came up against some'"...<eos> Thank you for your loss.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> I like your shoes.<eos> They're very nice.<eos> I'm ecstatic for your loss.<eos> You need to be quiet.<eos> Is one of you Genevieve Russell?
- Why can't you whisper?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Hey, you're the truck driver guy, right?<eos> You're the guy that killed Chet?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Oh, that's okay, man.<eos> Hey, I, uh... can I ask you a question?<eos> Were you scared?<eos> Did he scare you, even a bit?
I need a medical evac now.<eos> She was found unconscious.<eos> The organism is gripping her torso with over 100 pounds of pressure.<eos> What the hell are these guys doing here?<eos> - Where Supergirl goes, we go.<eos> - This is a top secret facility, Mr. Olsen.<eos> You think I'm gonna let the media waltz through here?<eos> Actually, I'm in IT.<eos> So, definitely not worth, uh, shooting.<eos> If something happens to her, I'm coming back for you.

You know, for all that she does for the DEO and, and for us.<eos> I just think that it's our responsibility to make sure that that life is waiting for her - when she wakes up.<eos> - All right.<eos> What can I do?<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> WINN:<eos> Kara?<eos> - Hey!<eos> You're back! - (CHUCKLING)<eos> Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Schott, but Miss Danvers is still incapacitated.
Or not.<eos> WINN: Okay, so...<eos> So you were her?<eos> I don't have time for explanations.<eos> There is no way you are doing this.<eos> This is way too risky.<eos> It's the only way that we can stop the Black Mercy.<eos> We can modify our virtual reality tech so that I can enter into Kara's mind and convince her to reject the hallucination.<eos> Unless Astra's playing you.<eos> Have either of you considered what would happen to Kara if you do this?
It's clear I've caused you significant emotional distress and I want you to know that pains me a great deal.<eos> What, are you resigning from Congress?<eos> I just think considering our personal issues, it might be wise for me to take the day and...<eos> Uh, uh, hold on.<eos> Hold on, I want to record this.<eos> It sounds an awful lot like you're asking for the day off after being three hours late.<eos> (EXHALES DEEPLY)<eos> The truth is... (SNIFFLING)<eos> I am so very sorry, Miss Grant.<eos> Because I respect you so much.

- Get out of his way.<eos> - If we pull her out now, we lose Kara!<eos> We're safe, Kal.<eos> I'm here.<eos> (GASPS)<eos> Anyone have some popcorn?<eos> Director Henshaw, I know you're worried about Alex, but I'm begging you, give her some more time!<eos> I am the one responsible for her safety.<eos> This is on my head, Olsen!<eos> - Well, she asked me to stop you.
She knew that you would react this way if things went bad.<eos> So she came to me because she wants to save Kara.<eos> HANK HENSHAW: You think I don't want that?<eos> I want them both back.<eos> - More than anything.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> And I can also see that Alex is more than just one of your agents. She's family.<eos> And you want to protect her at all costs.<eos> I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.
Do you need help, friend?<eos> Okay, so, the central conflict of "Goodbye, Columbus,"<eos> besides whether I am personally attracted to Philip Roth or not, is the idea that there's these, like, chosen Jews and these lesser Jews, and this class conflict within a religion is keeping people who love each other from feeling safe together.<eos> Yes, Nellie?<eos> Um, should we really be reading something about birth control?<eos> Like, honestly, this is basically a how-to guide to sex.<eos> Yeah, you're welcome.<eos> Yeah, that's inappropriate.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Miss Horvath, there's an urgent call for you in Principal Toby's office.
Like, I really can't hear you.<eos> I'm crying, Banana.<eos> Oh, oh, okay.<eos> So, where are you?<eos> I'm in the Marriott in Times Square.<eos> - Room 1706.<eos> - All right, I'll be right there.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I'm sorry, I was just...<eos> Yeah, could I see you for a minute, please?
We have to rise above the fray.<eos> Reach out to new customers.<eos> Now, who's in charge of social media?<eos> Our company hasn't tweeted in six days.<eos> What's worse, it's just a link.<eos> No voice, no copy.<eos> Who's gonna click on it, let alone share it?<eos> - What do you click on?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> What's viral to you?
- I need you to leave.<eos> - I should stay.<eos> I am strong, and you are fired.<eos> This is just the white man holding on to the last nugget of his power.<eos> You white dudes are figuring out that the jig is fucking up!<eos> I'm gonna go talk to Mom!<eos> Oh, you are absolutely fired, effective immediately.<eos> You're right, it's time to change.<eos> And I figured it out.<eos> I want to be... in you.
Rat Bastard!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> You're ruining my life!<eos> This is some of my best sandwich work to date.<eos> No, no-no-no.<eos> Rata hijueputa.<eos> Kinda sexy.<eos> Weed thief!<eos> ♪ Four and three and two and one-one ♪♪<eos> That rat won't be bothering you anymore.
Kyuh, kyuh, kyuh!<eos> Kyuh, kyuh, kyuh!<eos> That was great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - You're very welcome.<eos> - You are so wise.<eos> You have so much insight.<eos> You know what?<eos> - I have the perfect job for you.
May I?<eos> Everything you see, you can taste.<eos> Go ahead, try it.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> I'm happy to hear.<eos> Right this way, Miss Abrams.<eos> Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate.<eos> Oh, look, it's a chocolate fountain and the flowers are edible... (laughing)<eos> Victoria, look, it's Miss Abrams.<eos> We've been waiting for you.
May I say, what gorgeous hair you're gracing us with today?<eos> Thank you.<eos> My, uh... My chiropractor did it.<eos> (laughing) Oh, you're hilarious.<eos> I daresay you're the funniest person I've ever met.<eos> Stop.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> Believe it.<eos> This is the DMV the way it can be.<eos> - They are ready for you now.
Steering us away from their own corruption.<eos> Wag the dog, Ilana.<eos> Wag.<eos> The.<eos> Dog.<eos> Well, happy anniversary, guys.<eos> - Aww, thank you, sweetheart.<eos> - Love, love, love you.<eos> I'm so excited to see you later.<eos> Love you, bye.
Hold me closer, closer, closer.<eos> Yes, ay!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Wait, wait, so...<eos> You only get so many important moments in your life, and you have to grasp them.<eos> Will you go to prom with me?<eos> Both of you?<eos> Or one of you?<eos> I don't care...<eos> I think I love you both.
Do you often experience social anxiety?<eos> What is this for, exactly?<eos> To make sure we don't give you anything more than you can handle.<eos> I thought that you couldn't get hurt here.<eos> Only the right amount.<eos> The only limit here is your imagination.<eos> You start in the center of the park.<eos> It's simple, safe.<eos> The further out you venture, the more intense the experience gets.<eos> How far you want to go is entirely up to you.
Anything you like?<eos> Is there a changing room?<eos> Or a robe?<eos> Of course. I can help you.<eos> Or if you prefer, I could step outside.<eos> What do most people do?<eos> You don't have to worry about what most people would do.<eos> I understand.<eos> Do you really understand, William?<eos> All our hosts are here for you.
He would have us burned at the stake.<eos> Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> - You kidding me? - What?<eos> Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.<eos> Rally for the Union.<eos> Respond to your country's call.<eos> This regiment is headed for the seat of war to define the future of this great nation.<eos> We fight for a free land where no man has to bow. - This is, uh...<eos> - We'll provide you with uniforms.
You and Reverend Ott.<eos> This Sunday at Greater Page Temple.<eos> I'm assuming he's made you some promises.<eos> Vis a vis the department.<eos> More funding.<eos> Pie in the sky.<eos> Chief of Police?<eos> Nothing's set in stone.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> The West Side mad at you?
Call the room.<eos> It's after midnight.<eos> Maybe the occupant's in the casino.<eos> Well, like Mr. Allen, this guest is one of our treasured regulars.<eos> Unless you have a warrant...<eos> I'll be back tomorrow.<eos> I'm also gonna need to talk to the dealers, too, anyone else who had contact with Allen last week.<eos> I'll make 'em available to you.<eos> Hey, you want a room?<eos> I'm happy to comp you.
- Oh. - Okay.<eos> - There is? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I appreciate you checking in, Detective.<eos> We're not always extended the courtesy.<eos> There's a few things I'm gonna need, Captain.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Iverson, to my office.<eos> - Right, Captain.<eos> I'll liaise you with one of my homicide detectives.
Let it come to you.<eos> What if, at the end of the day, it's just Eddie Arceneaux?<eos> You know, no crew.<eos> He's the only one there is.<eos> I've been doing this a long time.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Arceneaux's just the point of the spear.<eos> Be patient.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Can I show you to the Champagne Room?
Great.<eos> - She hasn't told you?<eos> - I'm her mother.<eos> She doesn't tell me anything.<eos> So what's this case you're working on?<eos> Man named Anthony Allen was murdered last week in L.A.<eos> Just come back from Vegas, trying to find out what he was up to here.<eos> You're not here to ask me to profile somebody, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Just came to spend time with you and Maddie, see how you're doing.
Enough contact to open a file on her.<eos> So how do we fix this?<eos> Make us part of the case.<eos> Beginning to end.<eos> If Rykoff did this, he did it for Marks.<eos> You're using my ex wife to leverage me to get to Joey Marks.<eos> What, you get the glory, we get the paperwork while you ride off into the sunset with a guy we've been chasing for years?<eos> No, that doesn't fly.<eos> Come on, make it official.<eos> Let me call my lieutenant, buy you onto the case.
What was that?<eos> - Maddie's birthday.<eos> Scroll up.<eos> Right there.<eos> Open.<eos> It's a home security system.<eos> Rewind.<eos> Fast forward.<eos> Play.<eos> Oh. You motherfuckers, I'm gonna kill you both.
And tonight is gonna be fatter than a super gordo burrito.<eos> You're crowd control, Junior.<eos> Anybody comes near you, lay that fire down. You feel me?<eos> Yeah, I feel ya, Mo.<eos> I feel you.<eos> - Bosch.<eos> - Detective.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> You tell Marks anyone lays a hand on my family, a single scratch, and I'll kill you all.
Where do I find them?<eos> Safe house in the desert.<eos> Tooley Springs.<eos> Sometimes use it for shit like this.<eos> You tell me how to get there.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Lieutenant Lyle, Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> - Chief.<eos> - I'm tracking my son's phone.<eos> Has he checked in with you yet?
Top lock sticks a little.<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> Extradition hearing is this morning.<eos> We're on the road by noon back to L.A.<eos> I'm home by dinner.<eos> Great.<eos> I hope nothing happens before then.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> Billets is gonna send some cops to pick you up at the airport, and take you to my place.
Billets is gonna send some cops to pick you up at the airport, and take you to my place.<eos> They'll look in on you later.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad, please come with us, Dad.<eos> - Honey, I can't.<eos> - No, Dad, please.<eos> Honey, I can't.<eos> There are some things I have to do.<eos> I promise you, none of those people will ever bother you again.
The way the city goes on and on.<eos> It can make you feel so lost.<eos> I didn't know what was gonna happen to Maddie.<eos> If they were gonna hurt her, how they were gonna hurt her.<eos> - I felt so helpless.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - I was terrified.<eos> - So was I.<eos> I keep kickin' myself in the ass for not anticipating Marks' move.<eos> I should have protected you.
Fuck!<eos> You know, we should replace these vanity lights with LEDs.<eos> - Go green.<eos> - Irv.<eos> We're at an age, we want less light when we look in the mirror, not more.<eos> At this hour?<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Wash. I didn't call for the car.<eos> There's been an officer involved shooting.<eos> I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene.
I wasn't a participant in the fraud, it was completely unconnected.<eos> I admitted my mistake and I resigned.<eos> Well, if you ask me, it was a bullshit charge.<eos> And the waste of a good agent.<eos> That's water under the bridge.<eos> What does this have to do with Harry?<eos> How'd you like to get back in?<eos> Back in?<eos> You mean like the bureau?<eos> I assume you started playing poker for a living 'cause nobody else would hire you.
What does this have to do with Harry?<eos> How'd you like to get back in?<eos> Back in?<eos> You mean like the bureau?<eos> I assume you started playing poker for a living 'cause nobody else would hire you.<eos> And your bureau record's been red flagged.<eos> I can change that.<eos> You help us, we'll help you.<eos> You're gonna expunge my record if I spy on my ex husband?<eos> The bureau can't take you back.
Told him to fuck off.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Yeah, well, whatever I think about my ex husband, I'm not gonna spy on the father of my child.<eos> Call him Monday morning.<eos> Tell him what?<eos> Tell him you changed your mind, but you want it in writing about your record.<eos> Tell him I'm working on something good, something he'll want.<eos> And you'll give it to him, but only if he puts the deal in writing.<eos> Good evening, ma'am.<eos> Sorry to bother you this late.
Hey, Bosch.<eos> Twice in the same day.<eos> Can I get you a margarita?<eos> Got a minute?<eos> Save my stool.<eos> Ah, that didn't sound right.<eos> Save my seat.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's up?<eos> I got a lead for you on the Irving case.
Wearing it out.<eos> Bare knuckled.<eos> He's grieving, angry.<eos> Your point?<eos> People get desperate, they get dangerous.<eos> They do damage.<eos> To themselves and others.<eos> Thanks for the warning.<eos> Bosch.<eos> Sorry I kept you waiting.
Thanks for making dinner.<eos> Kind of like old times.<eos> It was passable.<eos> Better than that.<eos> So how's our girl?<eos> She was a bit glum at dinner.<eos> She's okay.<eos> She's just missing her friends.<eos> She's probably in there Skyping now.<eos> Oh, I know I can't keep you here forever.
Even though Las Vegas Metro found the murder weapon in his home?<eos> Gun was excluded.<eos> I've got work to do.<eos> Annette called me again.<eos> - Annette?<eos> - I gave you her number.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> Your mother told her a story a few days before she died.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> She'd been to visit you at the youth home.

For the last 48 hours, my client has answered every question put to her.<eos> She's cooperated fully with RHD and FID detectives.<eos> She's here of her own volition.<eos> I won't allow you to bully her.<eos> Bully.<eos> Mrs. Allen, more than anyone, wants to know who killed her husband.<eos> Well, then maybe she can tell me how Carl Nash knew she'd be at that bank that morning.<eos> As I've said until I am blue in the face,<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you double-cross him, or did he double-cross you?
When you looked in that empty safe deposit box, it must have been a shock.<eos> I went there to collect what was mine legally.<eos> What did you expect to find?<eos> Documents, papers, photographs.<eos> I had no idea what Tony had in there.<eos> Cash?<eos> You're busy concocting a fantasy, detective.<eos> It never happened.<eos> What a grim workplace you inhabit.<eos> Does it ever get you down?
Sure you do.<eos> She's got the money, right?<eos> Your money.<eos> You and your stories, detective.<eos> She got to that safe deposit box the day after your husband's body was found.<eos> The box was in her name, too.<eos> She didn't have to wait for probate.<eos> What do you think's in that backpack?<eos> I'm betting it's not the Allen family photos.<eos> Layla outsmarted you and Nash both.
Can't go to the DA with what we've got.<eos> As of now, she walks.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> Let's take this one.<eos> Mrs. Allen, I'm Martin Weiss.<eos> We met a couple of years ago<eos> At Freddie Macnekian's funeral.<eos> Yeah, I know who you are.<eos> Ed, what is this?<eos> Mr. Weiss has a proposal for you.
We collected six weapons from the scene.<eos> Nash's crew had no serial numbers on their weapons.<eos> Firearms has them now.<eos> It'll take them a couple of days.<eos> They'll call you when they're ready for you to follow up.<eos> Okay, no problem.<eos> What else?<eos> The DA's negotiating a deal with O'Grady, pushing it through.<eos> Exigent circumstances with Nash at large.<eos> We could use one of you at the first interview.
I was awfully hard on her yesterday, and I feel just plain sick about it.<eos> Community relations.<eos> I'm all in.<eos> Detective, my lawyer told you to stay away from me.<eos> I came to apologize.<eos> I didn't think your lawyer would mind.<eos> Then come in and have a drink.<eos> I'm on duty.<eos> Come in while I have a drink.<eos> Sure I can't entice you?
You.<eos> Are you trying to co-op me, Mr. Mayor?<eos> Won't work.<eos> I'm still endorsing your opponent.<eos> Endorse who you like.<eos> Actually, that will make the mayor look good... above the partisan fray.<eos> Two conditions.<eos> Name them.<eos> RHD has a free hand in their investigation into my son's death and departmental corruption.<eos> No interference from you or anyone else.
Veronica headed downtown?<eos> Still stuck on the 101.<eos> SIG Alert.<eos> We've got a case that might involve bonds or certificates of some kind, something that can be moved without a lot of attention or a lot of questions, like bearer bonds.<eos> We don't handle those here.<eos> They're disappearing.<eos> They long ago stopped earning interest, so it's about parking money, not earning.<eos> Our clients want to earn.<eos> Who does handle those?<eos> I think I can put together a couple of names for you.
And my bonds?<eos> I'm sorry, but I cashed the bonds.<eos> The donation she made to the church is in the bank.<eos> Then you will write me a check for that amount.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't just do that without proof that the bonds...<eos> This is your proof!<eos> Mrs. Allen, look, I'm sorry for your troubles, but that's not proof.<eos> I want my money.<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I shouldn't even be in here.<eos> It was self-defense.<eos> Save your story, Mrs. Allen.<eos> You're going to have a long time to work on the details.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> When do I get my bail hearing?<eos> You're going to be transported to the female jail in Van Nuys.<eos> You'll have access to a phone.<eos> You can keep trying to reach your lawyer.<eos> If you'd like me to call someone else to represent you, give me a name.
We had our regulars, and we took referrals, I guess you'd say.<eos> That night, I had more dates than I could handle, and I gave one of my regulars to Marjorie.<eos> Who was he?<eos> He called himself Mitch.<eos> It's the only name I never knew him by.<eos> What did he look like?<eos> Big, tall, surfer.<eos> Broad shoulders.<eos> He had that look... tan, sun-streaked hair.<eos> - Did he ever hurt you?
He called himself Mitch.<eos> It's the only name I never knew him by.<eos> What did he look like?<eos> Big, tall, surfer.<eos> Broad shoulders.<eos> He had that look... tan, sun-streaked hair.<eos> - Did he ever hurt you?<eos> - He could be a little rough.<eos> He liked to show you that he was in control.<eos> Did he choke you?
- Of course not.<eos> You were too busy looking the other way.<eos> Bosch, don't be so fucking judgmental.<eos> You know the department, you know how it works.<eos> You get told to steer clear of something, you steer clear, or you get fucking rolled.<eos> And how was I supposed to know for sure that this guy was even the killer?<eos> She got killed.<eos> And who gets her case?<eos> You.<eos> My mother got you.
Cuff him anyway.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Evidence on Veronica.<eos> - No, no, no, Harry, come on.<eos> Forget it.<eos> She's not worth it.<eos> Come on.<eos> So I just got off the phone with RHD.<eos> You are technically still on their books, but they can handle the mop up on the case from here.<eos> So after your appointments with Behavioral, I am prescribing some downtime for you both.
Where are they?<eos> Which of the Khan's toys have come for me?<eos> Marco?<eos> Byamba?<eos> Hundred Eyes?<eos> Any?<eos> All?<eos> Send search parties into the slums.<eos> Find his co-conspirators and bring them to me.<eos> You want me to leave you alone... with him?
In the morning, when the Khan is looking for you, I will ensure our scouts report you rode east.<eos> I will protect your secret... so long as you protect mine.<eos> Will you tell her I said goodbye?<eos> While your father is alive... make as many friends as you can... see as many lands as you can.<eos> Do you remember these words?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> The games are done.<eos> The drink and dinner consumed.<eos> There are no prayers left to pray.<eos> I have been given the honor of asking one question of each of you on behalf of these noble chieftains.
Answer... the question.<eos> I did.<eos> Lord Kublai... you will remain the Khan of Khans.<eos> When elected, what will you do with him?<eos> I will take Kaidu... and all of his kin... and every sympathizer who remains in the House of Ögödei... and I will bury them here... in his beloved dirt.<eos> So this is how the blind monk passed through walls?<eos> Every legend must come to an end.<eos> Put your weapons down.<eos> We don't want to hurt you or your men.<eos> Put them down or I take them from you.

This is gonna get a little rough.<eos> Oh, I am not one of your adversaries.<eos> _ Next recruit:<eos> Sara Lance.<eos> Former member of the League of Assassins, also formerly dead.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Miss Lance?<eos> Join me for a drink?<eos> I have come quite a long way to meet you.
- Where are we?<eos> - Ah. Why don't you ask the dude who knocked us out and kidnapped us?<eos> British dude with a flashy thing?<eos> - Ring any bells?<eos> - The name's Rip Hunter.<eos> I'm from East London.<eos> Oh, and the future.<eos> Nice to meet you, Rip.<eos> Uh, while you were incapacitated, I may have tampered with your weapons.<eos> I've assembled you all because I need your help.
To capture Savage before he grows into the monster he becomes.<eos> You got the wrong guy.<eos> - "Hero" ain't on my resume.<eos> - Or mine.<eos> I know it's difficult for you to fathom, but where... when I'm from, the year 2166, you and everyone on this roof aren't just considered heroes...<eos> You're legends.<eos> Legends?<eos> I, um, I hate to nitpick, but doesn't a legend have to be dead?<eos> Yeah, see, uh, that's a deal breaker for me, so I'm gonna pass.<eos> It's dangerous for any of you to know too much about your own futures, but I am here because each of you, as individuals, is destined for greatness.

It's been my ship for over a decade.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Excuse me, would you mind, um...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whoa. I bet it uses ionic propulsion.<eos> I doubt that very much, given that even advanced technology wouldn't be able to sustain an ionic reaction.<eos> It's possible if you stabilize the quantum flux.<eos> You know, we actually covered this before, Professor Stein, when I was your student, many moons ago?<eos> Perhaps you remember my paper on subspace field mechanics?<eos> I don't remember you, Mr. Palmer.
Professor Aldus Boardman.<eos> Professor Boardman is the world's leading... well, only... expert on Vandal Savage.<eos> We're gonna pay him a little visit.<eos> Course plotted for St. Roch, New Orleans.<eos> - St. Roch?<eos> - October 17, 1975.<eos> I suggest you all strap yourselves in.<eos> Temporal navigation isn't something one wants to be standing up for.<eos> Time travel.<eos> Cool. Some of you may experience some slight discomfort.
It's rather colorful.<eos> So, where can we find Professor Boardman?<eos> In his lecture hall.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> We're too late.<eos> This is... I'm, I'm sorry.<eos> You.<eos> Both of you.<eos> You know who we are?<eos> I've been studying you my whole life.
I said I'd take care of you.<eos> 4,000 years ago,<eos> Vandal Savage was an Egyptian priest, secretly in love with a priestess.<eos> You.<eos> Or, rather, you in your first life.<eos> But you were in love with another.<eos> Prince Khufu.<eos> Savage, or Hath-Set as he was then known, learned of the affair and was consumed with jealous rage.<eos> You believe me yet?<eos> Which drove him to murder you both.
You believe me yet?<eos> Which drove him to murder you both.<eos> And prayed for the hawk god, Horus, to damn the objects of his hate for all eternity.<eos> But Chay-Ara had a prayer of her own, that Horus would protect them forever.<eos> But another life was bound to theirs by accident.<eos> Savage's.<eos> That's why he wants us both dead.<eos> My theory is that the three of you were exposed to the same radiation by the meteorites.<eos> We all share the same power.<eos> And every time he kills you, it passes to him.
My theory is that the three of you were exposed to the same radiation by the meteorites.<eos> We all share the same power.<eos> And every time he kills you, it passes to him.<eos> That's what maintains his immortality.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Unless the meteorites contained a mutative element, like the particle accelerator that caused your powers.<eos> But without evidence, you're asking us to take you at your word?<eos> It's not my word. It's theirs.<eos> But you still don't remember me, do you?<eos> We knew you in our past lives.
I don't remember you.<eos> I'm so sorry. Don't be.<eos> You always warned me that if I ran into you in your next life, you might have forgotten me.<eos> That's us at the World's Fair.<eos> You're just as beautiful as I remember you.<eos> Mother.<eos> How old were you when...<eos> You two were murdered?<eos> Ten.<eos> My whole life, you taught me to be careful, to keep moving, always one step ahead of Savage, but after tracking you for 4,000 years, he'd gotten good.
Jefferson... something's happening to Jefferson!<eos> We seem to have a little problem back a the, uh, vessel.<eos> There's an intruder. We really must be going now.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Wait.<eos> We can't just leave him here.<eos> We have to get back now.<eos> You said he's going to die in 24 hours.<eos> And we can stop it.<eos> Are either of you a Time Master?
Station us in the temporal zone while I work on repairs.<eos> Temporal zone?<eos> Yeah, it's essentially a time limbo.<eos> We can hide out there for a bit.<eos> Another temporal jump would risk revealing our position.<eos> A time limbo?<eos> Astonishing.<eos> Oh, there's something you people don't know about time travel?<eos> That's surprising, isn't it?<eos> Considering none of you have ever time traveled before.
At some point I was, in fact, a Time Master.<eos> Will you people please stop hitting me?<eos> Start telling the truth!<eos> I relinquished my position as a Time Master when I commandeered the Waverider.<eos> Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.<eos> - You lied to us. - Of course I lied to you.<eos> I needed your help... you all barely said yes as it was.<eos> What about the legends part?<eos> Ooh, you lied about that too, didn't you?<eos> I chose you all because, a hundred years from now, your lives have minimal effect on the recorded timeline.
Winnie the Bish!<eos> The Bish with the wish!<eos> And my wish is to have fun!<eos> Which is exactly why I'm not gonna confiscate the fireworks behind your back.<eos> Yeah, you got me, Officer Bishop.<eos> You can have it.<eos> I also want you to have this Jesus wig.<eos> - You know, wigs aren't illegal.<eos> - I know.<eos> But I think it would look awesome on you.
Mrs. Parikh, can you keep a secret?<eos> I'm going to kill this soft serve nonsense.<eos> You know what we're gonna do?<eos> We're gonna play laser tag!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> ! We're gonna play laser tag!<eos> It's a fun American game!<eos> It's a fun game!<eos> Groomsmen! Yeah.<eos> Mmm. Ah. Love each and every one of you sons of bitches.
Look, the simple truth here is, whether we get Lowry for drugs or human trafficking, - we close the case on Danny's murder.<eos> - My office is sympathetic, Detective, but in order to prosecute we need more.<eos> Lowry did this and we all fucking know it.<eos> Look, if I may...<eos> It's only a matter of time before he makes a mistake.<eos> Miss Rayburn?<eos> Miss Rayburn.<eos> I'm sorry to wake you.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - I didn't wanna disturb you, but a man from the Islamorada Allied Bank called.
Well, hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Forgive me, we met at Robert's funeral.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But I...<eos> - Diana.<eos> - Diana.<eos> - John's wife.<eos> Of course, yes, yes.<eos> Well, it's nice to see you.
Hi.<eos> - Forgive me, we met at Robert's funeral.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But I...<eos> - Diana.<eos> - Diana.<eos> - John's wife.<eos> Of course, yes, yes.<eos> Well, it's nice to see you.<eos> It's nice to see you too.
Let's go.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't know what you're fucking with, detective.<eos> - This is Meg Rayburn.<eos> - Hi, Miss Rayburn.<eos> Sorry I couldn't call back sooner.<eos> What exactly is the issue?<eos> We're closing out all of your father's accounts.<eos> We came across a disbursement we needed to ask you about.
It's a check your father sent from his personal account every month.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> You have to talk to my mom.<eos> I'm afraid I can't actually do that, Miss Rayburn.<eos> Your father was explicit in his instructions.<eos> He wanted this account kept confidential.<eos> Does anyone in my family have access?<eos> Not according to our paperwork, no.<eos> Then why are you calling me?<eos> Your father listed you as his trustee.
For a lot of reasons.<eos> I came out of retirement to work with you, to help you.<eos> But I don't want to be put in this position between you and the Centre.<eos> If I can't trust something like this won't happen again, I'll go back to retirement in Sergach.<eos> We can get you another handler.<eos> Make a decision.<eos> We want you to stay.<eos> Both of you?<eos> Well, I'll take you at your nod.<eos> There is something... else that I've kept you out of.
We're not allowed to make them.<eos> We've signed treaties.<eos> But we think the Americans are making them, so we make them, too.<eos> One of us has been...<eos> getting American samples of pathogens for many years.<eos> He signaled about a week ago, but when I tried to meet him, I caught surveillance.<eos> If he's clean, you'll pick up the next package from him and find out what the hell is going on.<eos> Anyone who gets near this has to be vaccinated.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I tried to keep you out of it.
Anyone who gets near this has to be vaccinated.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I tried to keep you out of it.<eos> This is for a kind of meningitis you could get from the last two samples he got for us.<eos> No dead drops.<eos> Keep it in your custody.<eos> Who is he?<eos> William.<eos> How long has he been here?<eos> Longer than you.
All right?<eos> And she was there.<eos> We went out after.<eos> That's all.<eos> We've always been friends.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Stop!<eos> You don't think to tell me 'cause you went back to EST?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's weird, obviously, seeing you, seeing her.
There's more.<eos> There is always more.<eos> T... take my man to the back of the truck, start inside the back bumper, work your way to the front.<eos> Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.<eos> Who's Negan?<eos> ♪ Ding, dong ♪ ♪ Hell's bells. ♪<eos> You see, usually we introduce ourselves by just popping one of you right off the bat.<eos> But you seem like reasonable people.<eos> I mean, you're sportin' dress blues, for Christ's sake.<eos> And, like I said, we're gonna drive you back to where you were.
Do not send your kids to private schools.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Listen, guys, let's...<eos> let's go get a beer.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll pay. I'm not having beer right now.<eos> I'm on this low-carb thing.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.<eos> Well, I'm sure they can, yeah, find something for you.
Guys, stop.<eos> Hey, Chaz, I'm on the other line.<eos> You're not gonna believe what happens to this glass.<eos> - It's an incredible story; you're gonna freak out.<eos> - Please stop. - I'll talk to you soon.<eos> - Put me on speaker.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Button's right there.<eos> I know which button it is.<eos> Now, what I'm about to say might shock you, but I need help getting out of jury duty.
- You...<eos> - I left my bag.<eos> - You left... yeah.<eos> - Oh, how funny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Miss Dunhill is our new librarian.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was reading, and I left my bag, and he so thoughtfully returned it to me.<eos> I'm just glad your husband didn't kill you.
Ms. Dunhill has volunteered, but it's not possible for her to chaperone alone.<eos> Will you help?<eos> This Thursday?<eos> Oh, I-I hate to say no.<eos> Then don't.<eos> I have a commitment.<eos> Oh, the hell you do.<eos> Pardon my French, Miss Dunhill.<eos> No, that's what I was going to say.<eos> I knew we made a good decision with you.
- Yeah.<eos> That's it.<eos> Goddamn shame the Japs pulled ahead in electronics.<eos> We bomb 'em to shit, they're in first anyway.<eos> We gonna come back though.<eos> God bless Texas.<eos> God bless.<eos> Hey, you boys going to the rally next week?<eos> General Walker's having a rally?<eos> I can introduce you.
Aah!<eos> - Shh!<eos> Aah!<eos> Who the fuck is there?<eos> Huh, you want to mess with me?<eos> Huh!<eos> Come down here and face me!<eos> That's right!<eos> You run, you fucker!<eos> Now, you come back, and I will nail you to the fucking wall!
Okay, okay.<eos> All right, Bill.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Come on, Bill.<eos> General Walker?<eos> General Walker?<eos> It was great, really.<eos> Do you know what a fascist is?<eos> Sir!<eos> No, I just want to ask you.
What the bitch?<eos> What?<eos> Enemy close.<eos> We doing this?<eos> No.<eos> He's someone who was with a whole lot of someones who didn't listen.<eos> We can make a deal right here, right now.<eos> That's right, we can.<eos> Give us all your stuff.<eos> We'll probably have to kill one of you.
No.<eos> He's someone who was with a whole lot of someones who didn't listen.<eos> We can make a deal right here, right now.<eos> That's right, we can.<eos> Give us all your stuff.<eos> We'll probably have to kill one of you.<eos> That's just the way it is, but then we can start moving forward on business.<eos> All you have to do is listen.<eos> Yeah... that deal's not gonna work for us.<eos> Fact is, I was about to ask for all of your stuff, only I'm thinking I don't have to kill any of you.
Welcome to where you're going.<eos> We'll take your weapons.<eos> Now.<eos> - We can talk about--<eos> - We're done talking.<eos> Time to listen.<eos> That's yours, right?<eos> Yeah, it's yours.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get her down and get you all on your knees.
Time to listen.<eos> That's yours, right?<eos> Yeah, it's yours.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get her down and get you all on your knees.<eos> Lots to cover.<eos> Hold up.<eos> We got it.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Gonna need you on your knees.
Maggie?<eos> On your knees!<eos> All right!<eos> We got a full boat.<eos> Let's meet the man.<eos> Pissing our pants yet?<eos> Boy, do I have a feeling we're getting close.<eos> Yep.<eos> It's gonna be pee-pee pants city here real soon.<eos> Which one of you pricks is the leader?
And if that's too much, you can make, find, or steal more, and it'll even out sooner or later.<eos> This is your way of life now.<eos> The more you fight back, the harder it will be.<eos> So, if someone knocks on your door you let us in.<eos> We own that door.<eos> You try to stop us and we will knock it down.<eos> You understand?<eos> What, no answer?<eos> You don't really think that you were gonna get through this without being punished, now, did you?<eos> I don't want to kill you people.
You don't really think that you were gonna get through this without being punished, now, did you?<eos> I don't want to kill you people.<eos> Just want to make that clear from the get-go.<eos> I want you to work for me.<eos> You can't do that if you're dead, now, can you?<eos> I'm not growing a garden.<eos> But you killed my people, a whole damn lot of them.<eos> More than I'm comfortable with.<eos> And for that, for that you're gonna pay.<eos> So, now... I'm gonna beat the holy hell outta one of you.

The Scimitar.'<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.<eos> We want to thank you all for being here tonight, in particular our wonderful architect Paolo.<eos> And, of course, the Under-secretary of State, Charles Matherson.<eos> Thanks to the agreement reached with the minister,<eos> The Scimitar will be making a section 106 contribution of £16 million going to the local community.<eos> Louis and I are determined that The Scimitar should benefit all London and working with the government, that's what we intend to achieve.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid this venue's closed for a private function this evening.<eos> I'd like to see the Wesleys.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't let you in if you're not on the list.
Copper's been struck!<eos> Francis staked the mine on a game on cards.<eos> He lost.<eos> To sneak away under our very noses and marry that drunkard.<eos> Perhaps it was wrong -- but I did it for love of Verity.<eos> Will you go? !<eos> Perhaps you prefer your guests to be ruined in silence.<eos> Go.<eos> Is it the putrid throat?<eos> I'll stay and look after you all.
I'll stay and look after you all.<eos> They both have it.<eos> The symptoms are unmistakable.<eos> You can pray to God I do not lose the love of my life.<eos> Forgive me, I cannot save her.<eos> Ross!<eos> I will no longer have my feelings misunderstood, or my intentions.<eos> Anyone plundering will be guilty of theft and committing a capital offence.<eos> I'm certain we understand each other.<eos> Captain Poldark, I have orders to take you to Truro gaol.
Dwight.<eos> He cannot just bury his head.<eos> And will you tell him?<eos> It's almost upon him, how will he defend himself?<eos> Who will speak for him?<eos> I will. But there must be others.<eos> And plenty of them.<eos> The Crown will already have assembled its case.<eos> And no doubt there'll be plenty who'll be glad to help it.<eos> - Can I rely on you, Tankard?
- I am.<eos> There's someone took mortal sick at Priory House.<eos> I'll go at once.<eos> Verity!<eos> - I've saved you a place, my dear.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> You did tell Ross you're coming?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Jeffrey Clymer, King's Counsel.<eos> I'm here to see if we can wriggle you off the hook.
By all means.<eos> You may flaunt your guineas on lavish garments and fancy carriages.<eos> You may purchase a coat of arms and deck out your servants in gaudy livery.<eos> You may even buy your way into every club, mine and drawing room in the county.<eos> But what you will never buy is nobility or breeding or even common decency!<eos> Are you quite sure you don't wish to apologise, Francis, given the nature of our association?<eos> You own me.<eos> I acknowledge that.<eos> My indebtedness to you has long muddied the waters between us so I trust that any confusion about my feelings is now entirely cleared up?<eos> I'll visit you in jail with a list of the witnesses who are to appear against you.
I'll visit you in jail with a list of the witnesses who are to appear against you.<eos> And those for me?<eos> A shorter list.<eos> Friends' and workers' testimony, presumed biased, will easily be dismissed.<eos> Meanwhile, I advise you to reconsider your attitude.<eos> It's no detriment to me if you choose to run your neck into a noose.<eos> But I suspect it might be to yours.<eos> Mr Warleggan!<eos> I see that Unwin speaks the truth.<eos> He cannot stir an inch without you.

But I suspect it might be to yours.<eos> Mr Warleggan!<eos> I see that Unwin speaks the truth.<eos> He cannot stir an inch without you.<eos> He says the same of you.<eos> Of course!<eos> We're both indispensable to his ascent in the world.<eos> - I, as a hunting trophy...<eos> - Caroline... - and you as...<eos> How to describe you?
-Hey, can I help you?<eos> -Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.<eos> I'm afraid I am.<eos> I'm afraid we're closed for the evening, too.<eos> -So try back tomorrow morning.<eos> -Connie Frazier.<eos> Social Services.<eos> Ah, Social Services.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I didn't expect you so soon.
I didn't want her running off again.<eos> She's a tad skittish.<eos> -Children I work with usually are.<eos> -Right, right.<eos> -So, where is she?<eos> -Right.<eos> She's in the kitchen.<eos> -Come on up. I'll introduce you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Sorry again for trying to turn you away there.
Over.<eos> - Comms are down, sir.<eos> Shepard, come in!<eos> Over.<eos> Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.<eos> Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.<eos> It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.<eos> I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.<eos> She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.<eos> But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss...
You can borrow my black heels if you want.<eos> The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> Time to go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> "Fear not, for I am with you.<eos> Be not dismayed, for I am your God.<eos> I will strengthen you.
I'm fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> Time to go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> "Fear not, for I am with you.<eos> Be not dismayed, for I am your God.<eos> I will strengthen you.<eos> Yes, I will help you.<eos> I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
- Let's get out of here!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Go!<eos> Yeah, that's right!<eos> You better run!<eos> She's our friend and she's crazy!<eos> You come back here and she'll kill you!<eos> You hear me?<eos> She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!<eos> She'll kill you, you hear me?
-Are you serious right now, man?<eos> -Yeah, I'm serious.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> -Done what?<eos> -You know what.<eos> You mean call her out for what she really is?<eos> Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.<eos> I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.<eos> - What the hell, Steve?<eos> - You know, neither of you ever cared about her.
A 60% cut in affordable housing, no health centre, no local park, no transport improvements.<eos> You have gone back on every single one of your Section 106 obligations!<eos> Section 106 obligations are there to be renegotiated, everybody knows that.<eos> You were always going to do this, right from the start.<eos> You have taken advantage of the planning laws!<eos> Which your government brought in, let's not forget that.<eos> It's all about sustainable development.<eos> It's about sustaining the community, not your profits!<eos> I gave you the green light because I thought you were going to benefit a whole area of London.<eos> Starting, of course, with you and Mrs Matherson.
I don't even know why I'm here.<eos> This has got nothing to do with me.<eos> I know.<eos> You said.<eos> You know, ever since I met you, my life has taken a serious turn downhill.<eos> Hi.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I was about to ask you the same thing.<eos> I'm a police officer.<eos> And I warn you, you're guilty of false imprisonment by detaining us here and probably kidnapping.
I'm a police officer.<eos> And I warn you, you're guilty of false imprisonment by detaining us here and probably kidnapping.<eos> - Which carries a sentence of life imprisonment.<eos> - Right.<eos> Added to which, you're assaulting me as a police officer.<eos> And are you going to tell me you're police as well?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm with the Serious Fraud Office.<eos> - We know who you are.<eos> - We know everything about you.
- Yeah, and James Gulliver.<eos> - John Gulliver!<eos> And the Wesleys are involved.<eos> - The Scimitar.<eos> - All right.<eos> You know something.<eos> - So, you've got to let us go.<eos> - I don't agree.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I've got nothing against you personally, but this is my job.
- The Scimitar.<eos> - All right.<eos> You know something.<eos> - So, you've got to let us go.<eos> - I don't agree.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I've got nothing against you personally, but this is my job.<eos> I've got to find out what you know.<eos> Who you're working for.<eos> - Then I've got to get rid of you.
- And then I'm going to kill you.<eos> - Do what you want.<eos> We're not going to tell you anything.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> I think this might change your mind.<eos> You have no idea what I can and can't do...<eos> Both knees... elbows.<eos> Listen, I want to know what you know.<eos> So, which one of you is going to be first?
- Where's the keys?<eos> - It's open.<eos> It's open.<eos> And it's definitely there?<eos> Cos, you two, you aren't going anywhere.<eos> When I come back, if I find out you're lying to me, really, I am, I'm going to do things to you that you wouldn't want to imagine.<eos> It's there.<eos> All right.<eos> You're on your own down here.<eos> No-one can hear you.
- We need the police!<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Look, it's there.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> - OK!<eos> It's not in the van, but we know who's got it.<eos> - But we can't tell you.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because if we tell you, you'll go and kill them.<eos> That's very noble of you, but I'm getting fed up with this, so I'm going to kill you instead.
Louis would have told me.<eos> I think there are a lot of things Louis didn't tell you.<eos> You're right.<eos> - We didn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> To save the money.<eos> And that's why Adam Jannsen had to die.<eos> He found an antique -- a golden medallion.<eos> He showed it to John Gulliver and Gulliver guessed what it would be worth to you.<eos> A find like that could shut you down for years.

- you know how to reach me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> There is one other thing.<eos> We've had a complaint from a secretarial assistant working in this building.<eos> What sort of complaint?<eos> I'm afraid to say it's... not very pleasant, sir.<eos> It's of a sexual nature.<eos> Who?<eos> His name's Stefan Kowolski.<eos> The complaint's against you.
I have to say, it's been a real experience meeting you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> The same.<eos> Look, I'm I'm glad you came, OK?<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe we are a team.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had nothing else to do.<eos> Come on.<eos> RECEPTIONIST: Mr Lockwood 's expecting you, gentlemen.
Three people dead is... (KNOCK ON DOOR)<eos> Are you expecting anyone? - No.<eos> - (KNOCKING)<eos> EAST EUROPEAN ACCENT:<eos> Turn-down service. Beds and towels?<eos> Actually, this isn't a good moment.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> We will come back.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.
You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.<eos> Sit down, man.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> ...it seems that one of you was not content last night with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere.
- You don't find that strange?<eos> What I find strange is that you're so upset.<eos> Maybe you're upset by the way Jace is looking at her.<eos> You know, you should be happy that Jace is interested in someone other than himself.<eos> Maybe I'm pissed that she's ruined the mission.<eos> We never found out who's buying the blood.<eos> That was our one job.<eos> Your wound, it's healed.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> So, what, I'm miraculously healed, and all of you... stunning people have magical powers?
You got to be thinking, "Why was he spared?<eos> Why is my husband gone?"<eos> For months after the planes hit, all I could do was ask myself why.<eos> Why was I the only surviving partner?<eos> Why wasn't I there?<eos> Could... could I have done something?<eos> Why was I the only one out of the office on meetings that morning?<eos> We'll never know.<eos> So I made up my own "why."<eos> Because of you.
I've been married 10 years, so...<eos> So down to just once a day.<eos> So, it's really just the book?<eos> I'm down 4%... year to date.<eos> Everyone else is up double digits.<eos> I'm down.<eos> - I'm fucked.<eos> - You don't need meds.<eos> You're just listening to the wrong voice.<eos> You're tuned into the one yelling at you over the loudspeaker that you're fucking stupid and your performance blows.

Good!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Now, I want you to go back to your Bloomberg and cut bait on your losers... you know the ones.<eos> The ones you've been defending, hoping they'll come 'round, but, secretly, you know never will.<eos> I want you to just commit that you're in it for the long haul, that you will succeed.<eos> And once you do that, the new ideas, the winners, will present themselves because you are a winner.<eos> You're in the Special Forces here.<eos> You are a Navy SEAL.<eos> And there's a reason for that.<eos> Did the S.E.A.L.s make a mistake signing you up?
Chuck... you know I am not a bad man.<eos> I can't.<eos> This was to be about leniency.<eos> Have some mercy.<eos> My father always told me that "mercy" was a word that pussies used when they couldn't take the pain.<eos> I love you, Dad.<eos> But if you walk into my office and try to use your influence again, you are gonna walk out of here in handcuffs.<eos> Mr. Wolkowska...<eos> Skip.<eos> I've known you since I was a boy.

I'm gonna get me that scalp.<eos> You crushed it.<eos> Crushed.<eos> Let's get out of this ratfuck.<eos> Watch out.<eos> He may buy the building.<eos> It's an A-minus building.<eos> Needs overhaul.<eos> He doesn't consider anything less than triple-A.<eos> - Yet he hired you.
And to that end... my people have a few questions.<eos> Your Sharpe Ratio's very low.<eos> How does an idea turn into an investment at your shop?<eos> What's your mosaic theory at Axe Capital?<eos> Fees from funds like ours used to pay your overhead.<eos> How are you dealing with floating it all yourself?<eos> I can't allow myself to care about that.<eos> What I do care about is making decisions to benefit a greater number of people.<eos> Now when I'm only working for myself or my staff, I'm sharp enough.<eos> But when I'm making decisions for you as well as me, that's when I'm twice as careful, twice as focused, because I cannot live with losing somebody else's money.
And if you do and you're caught, I won't lie on the witness stand.<eos> A wife can't be compelled to testify against her husband.<eos> Oh, I won't have to be compelled.<eos> I will volunteer.<eos> Jesus Christ, you really are one of them now, aren't you?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Are you really turning this on me?<eos> You betrayed my trust.<eos> After you were out all night.<eos> And don't give me this crap about how it was all business either, because I saw the two of you out there.
He will not let me just walk away.<eos> He will not stop until he ruins me.<eos> Now you sound like a crazy person.<eos> He had me followed, all right?<eos> 'Cause he's trying to trip me up, he's trying to trap me.<eos> So I had to play dirty right back at him.<eos> Followed?<eos> Where?<eos> Trapped you how?<eos> After I saw you and Axe together, I got very worked up, past the point of, uh...
Because?<eos> I do not want to talk about it.<eos> Do you want me to tell Hanna?<eos> Why?<eos> -So at least she knows.<eos> Do you think that will work?<eos> You never know.<eos> Where's the fish you caught, Thor?<eos> Calm down ...<eos> What is it with you and Christian?
It's ok.<eos> Thor, truth or dare.<eos> Truth.<eos> OK, dare.<eos> Okay, so I want you to kiss Ha Christian.<eos> I want you to kiss Christian! -I wouldn't be caught dead!<eos> Come on, it's just a game.<eos> We kissed.<eos> But I do not want to.<eos> If the two of you will not do anything, then give up now.
Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Thor.<eos> Thor?<eos> Rakel said it was okay to wake you.<eos> Christian.<eos> Wake up, Christian.<eos> Stop it!<eos> The girls are here.<eos> It seems that Hanna has a crush on you.
That... that... that is definitely true, yes.<eos> Yes, and I'm not proud of my behavior, but at least I didn't make a bad thing worse, right?<eos> And that's something that... whoo!<eos> That is something we can all learn from, right?<eos> Right?<eos> You don't drink and drive, folks.<eos> - Yes, Antonio?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's a lesson for every single person on this bus.<eos> Okay, love you both.
Oh, hello.<eos> It was a bad connection.<eos> You know, and it's so frustrating.<eos> Just like, "Ah, fuck."<eos> It's okay.<eos> Thank you for letting me use the phone.<eos> It's fine.<eos> So I'm just gonna get out of your hair.<eos> Give you your morning back.<eos> And, oh, I'm so sorry that we haven't had you over since you moved in.
Well, I'll just, you know... - We haven't even told the kids yet.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> Hi!<eos> Uh, you guys about done?<eos> We reserved the room for a birthday party.<eos> Yeah, can you... can we just please have a minute?<eos> Yep.<eos> No problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I don't know you well, but, um, you seem like a nice person.
- Okay, guys, your dad and I...<eos> - Which means they'd be 12 cents each.<eos> Your dad and I have something that we want to talk to you about.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, here's what it is.<eos> - Your dad...<eos> - Jesus.<eos> It's got my pasta and my salad on here separately.<eos> I thought that was part of the Meal Deal.<eos> So anyway, we love you both very much is what I was saying.
So anyway, we love you both very much is what I was saying.<eos> And that's for sure.<eos> And...<eos> Robert.<eos> Robert, do you... do you maybe...<eos> Robert, do you maybe wanna... wanna join in the discussion?<eos> Ugh, Meal Deal is a lunch thing.<eos> That's great.<eos> See?<eos> That's how they bang you.
And I'm making "important" sound bad or scary and it's not.<eos> It's... it's not.<eos> What it's really all about is... a better way to be as a family.<eos> A better way for us, for your father and I, to be a family for you, with you.<eos> You know, 'cause there are all sorts of families.<eos> There... there are families that...<eos> Your mother and I are getting a divorce.<eos> It's awful.<eos> If there was any way that we could've figured out how to stay together, then we would, but we just can't.<eos> But the important thing is that neither of us is going to leave you.

My associate, Angela.<eos> Also my wife.<eos> One of the many benefits of working at home.<eos> Um, do you have a, you know... like, a real office somewhere else?<eos> Robert, there's no bells and whistles here.<eos> I run lean and mean so I can focus on winning cases.<eos> Fancy offices, hot secretaries, diplomas on the walls...<eos> I don't need that ego bullshit.<eos> Right.<eos> The good news for you is I don't charge what those midtown divorce lawyers charge.
We walk through this together.<eos> You are not stuck with some teenage summer associate.<eos> Your problems are my problems.<eos> So, this is going to be quite costly.<eos> Yes.<eos> But compared with the assets you could lose, it's a mere fraction.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, let's do this.<eos> Preliminarily, issue one...<eos> I never wanna be surprised, so you must be totally honest with me about anything that he might use against you.
- Hello?<eos> - Hello, Frances.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - This is Robert's new lawyer.<eos> I wanted to call and introduce myself.<eos> Robert got a new lawyer.<eos> Put him on speaker phone.<eos> - Shh. - I'm Tony Silvercreek.<eos> Oh, yeah. No, it's bad.<eos> Look, I'm gonna wanna take a deposition from you soon, but not tomorrow.
But it's the truth.<eos> You're going to become a father soon, right, Charlie?<eos> And have you thought about what would happen if you couldn't see your child because you're in prison?<eos> It'd be a shame, wouldn't it?<eos> My son is in danger.<eos> - You cannot release him again.<eos> - Nor detain him without evidence.<eos> He's lying and everybody in this police station knows it!<eos> Does anybody want to do their job well?<eos> We all want to do our job well, including the lawyer who's told the suspect to lie to us in our fucking face, because that's doing a good job for you, right?
They feared what would happen to them if Victor told the truth.<eos> They said to him that if he talked, they'd go after him and this time it wouldn't be a game.<eos> They would kill him.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Raul has given us your number.<eos> Your request got complicated.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know Raul and we know him.<eos> Besides, we know how you look, we've seen you on the news.
We've also identified the alleged attackers.<eos> Now it's only a matter of time finding them and relate them with Raul Losada.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If you want to say something to me, do it now.<eos> Please.<eos> Raul Losada called one of Charlie's alleged attackers just before he disappeared.<eos> He ran out when we mentioned your name.<eos> He's disappeared with his family.<eos> I want you to see something.<eos> Give me, I'll hold this for you.
- Copy that.<eos> - Do you have the money?<eos> - We do.<eos> Switch the GPS on.<eos> Done.<eos> Follow the programmed route.<eos> 348, we're here.<eos> She's ours.<eos> By the way, you'll also have to get rid of the corpse.<eos> It's behind you.
She's my life!<eos> Oh, no, I said it out loud.<eos> You're not supposed to say anything!<eos> Sorry, guys. Cat's out of the bag!<eos> - No!<eos> - Meow!<eos> Are you gossiping?<eos> No gossip allowed!<eos> Go to HR!<eos> I've called you both in because I hear you've been having problems.
No, I fixed it with some spare parts.<eos> We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> Junior!<eos> Obviously, I'm not gonna push it.<eos> Wait!<eos> I could push it so easily.<eos> It would take such a little amount of force.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> If you don't give us Tiny Thing, we're gonna eat you.
We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> Junior!<eos> Obviously, I'm not gonna push it.<eos> Wait!<eos> I could push it so easily.<eos> It would take such a little amount of force.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> If you don't give us Tiny Thing, we're gonna eat you.<eos> We're gonna eat you anyway!
Let's just step aside, all right?<eos> - And let me do it.<eos> - You want to sing to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is that so surprising?<eos> I'm a pretty good singer, actually.<eos> Okay, fine! Sing to her.<eos> When you need a little something.<eos> And there's too much to do.<eos> Just click your little finger and we'll ship it for you.
We did that together!<eos> I ran into every piece of glass.<eos> Some, more than once.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> What are the chances of that?<eos> I guess, pretty high in a glass factory.<eos> - Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!<eos> - Come on!<eos> First, we're gonna take Tiny Thing and raise her to be a strong, independent woman.<eos> And then, we're gonna eat you.
Gentlemen, if you'll permit me... a word before we begin.<eos> This is a night for celebration.<eos> A night to discuss the future of our family... the gratitude we feel for the support of his father.<eos> But perhaps as important... it is also...<eos> a moment for sober reflection.<eos> Sober, my ass.<eos> Two hundred years ago, our people were little more than dirt farmers, struggling just to survive.<eos> They had nothing but their hopes and their fists, and they brought both of them along when they came to America, many to this very city.<eos> Think you've had enough, George.<eos> Now some of you are young... so there's no reason you'd remember, but there was a time when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.
Just... real soft.<eos> Come on, you've done this before.<eos> Just go for it.<eos> No!<eos> That good, huh?<eos> - Sunk the eight ball.<eos> - Well, something went in.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> You boys re-rack, I will, uh, buy rounds for the rematch.<eos> - I leave you two alone for one minute...
No question, I'm...<eos> I'm no choir boy.<eos> I'm tellin' ya, I just skirt the surface.<eos> Unlike the men I work for, and the guys that did this.<eos> I'm telling ya, I had nothing to do with that massacre.<eos> Assuming you're correct and the Irish were hit by a powerful crime syndicate tonight... if you're the only one who survived, your good fortune's gonna rub some dangerous people the wrong way.<eos> No shit!<eos> I got a pack of killers gunning for my men.<eos> My people think I'm a traitor or a rat.<eos> So, what can Nelson and Murdock do for you, Mister...
- Yeah.<eos> - All right, you might need additional...<eos> - Right, right, right.<eos> We also got forensics on the scene.<eos> Hey, I just need to know if my brother's in there.<eos> Step back, please.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I can't answer that right now.<eos> Hey, Brett!<eos> Over here, Matt.<eos> I would say it's good to see you, but under the circumstances...
And, uh, one last signature here.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We are official part owners of the bar!<eos> - Ah! - Yes!<eos> Sir, we won't let you down.<eos> I'm just a notary.<eos> Hey, the note... arize.<eos> All right, we're not gonna let you down.
- And you are being lovely. - Oh!<eos> You guys are so sweet together.<eos> That's because we're still on our honeymoon.<eos> 35 wonderful years of marriage.<eos> - Feels like two to me. - Oh.<eos> - Feels like one.<eos> - Like we just met.<eos> Nick, what are we doing here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Each-each of you know me.
Errands and a smoothie.<eos> Okay, everyone, listen up.<eos> Here are your new uniforms.<eos> Oh, you got to be kidding.<eos> - Aah. - Save your groans for Birdman!<eos> From now on, we will measure drinks.<eos> - Oh, man. - And we have a new one-napkin policy.<eos> - Just one napkin?<eos> - Questions at the end, please.<eos> Should somebody ask you for a second napkin, you just say, "Are you sure?"
I would do anything.<eos> I love Flip and Nancy.<eos> Me, too!<eos> Are we totally crazy?<eos> Maybe!<eos> I don't even care!<eos> - I don't even care, either. - Hm!<eos> That's a vodka soda, I think.<eos> Uh, it's close enough.<eos> I hear you!
You and your dickless associate proposing to engage me in a gun battle?<eos> Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight, but the way I heard it, you only like to tussle with working women.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Dead enough.<eos> Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?<eos> Don't want someone walking off with him.<eos> That's not a man anymore.<eos> That's merchandise.<eos> $500 worth.<eos> All right, which of you derelicts hitched a dead body outside my saloon?
If you see or hear anything, don't hesitate.<eos> Shoot and don't stop shooting.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my fucking God!<eos> - Here. - Shit.<eos> Take this and go.<eos> Now! Go!<eos> I'll hold them off as long as I can.<eos> Come on, damn it.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.
Okay.<eos> Apparently, she needs to make certain this thing they're looking for is where they think it is.<eos> She said she'd signal if the information was good.<eos> Guess that's the signal.<eos> I'm sorry if I caused trouble with you and your friend.<eos> Oh, no, no. No, it's fine.<eos> I'm glad you found us.<eos> I didn't get a chance to ask where you're headed.<eos> I don't really know yet.<eos> I guess I figured they kept you in zones or on paths or...
Ifyouneedmoretime , I'msuretheboard wouldbehappy tooblige.<eos> I'm sure they'd be happier for me to delay it indefinitely.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You imagine I have gone mad... do you?<eos> Lost my way?<eos> We're simply concerned about the extent of the changes you're making.<eos> We want to protect your legacy.<eos> My legacy?<eos> You don't like this place very much, do you?<eos> I've seen many of you come and go over the years, and I can tell the ones who enjoy their time here and the ones who don't.
I have always seen things very clearly.<eos> This is the table I sat at with my parents.<eos> This is the chair I sat in.<eos> We know everything about our guests, don't we?<eos> As we know everything about our employees.<eos> I do hope you will be careful with Bernard.<eos> He has a sensitive disposition.<eos> I beg your pardon, señorita.<eos> Therehavebeenmany ofyouoverthe years, and we have always-- almost always found a way to make it work.<eos> So, I will ask you nicely, please... don't get in my way.
I've got a ham sandwich and a nubile redhead loaded up in the VR tank, awaiting instruction.<eos> Yes!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Looks like a couple of gallons of Lawrence swirling around in you did you good.<eos> Ready to get back on the road?<eos> Merciful thing would be to put a bullet in me.<eos> Who ever said I was merciful?<eos> And it's not my fault you're suffering.<eos> You used to be beautiful.<eos> When this place started, I opened one of you up once.

Made you this sad, real mess.
In recompense, I'd like an introduction to your Confederado friends.<eos> It's only fair.<eos> - There's no such thing as fair here.<eos> In Pariah, justice ain't just blind, she's crooked.<eos> Bitch's scales are always tipped.<eos> If you don't see how, well, that's 'cause they're tipped against you.<eos> Still, by way of gratitude, I can supply you a night with some veryamenablewomen.<eos> I've fucked enough whores.<eos> You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.<eos> How about I sweeten it by killing you quickly?
Those men are Union soldiers like my father was.<eos> We won't hurt them. We're gonna stick to the plan.<eos> We'll take the nitro and go.<eos> All right.<eos> Showtime.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Howdy.<eos> My associates and I are here to relieve you of your ride.<eos> Someone's been telling you boys tales. Nothing in this wagon worth taking.<eos> The story I heard is one bullet from us, and that nothing blows you all to kingdom come.
I would have thought the head of narrative could do whatever he wanted.<eos> My artistic freedom is constrained, what, with QA breathing down my neck and behavior programming the damn things to go off script.<eos> The robots can go off script?<eos> Just little gestures.<eos> You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.<eos> Ms. Cullen told me to find you and relay a message.
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> Girl'sharboring agrudge.<eos> Idon'tblameyou , sweetheart.<eos> I did some ugly things to you both.<eos> But it wasn't personal.<eos> Confederados and the government like to call this thing a war, but they're fighting starving farmers armedwithrocks.<eos> That ain't no war.<eos> It'sa slaughter.<eos> IfI hadto do it allagain, I'd fuck you both over just as hard.
Every part of this building, including the skin on your back, is made to keep you here.<eos> It-- it'd be a suicide mission.<eos> At first, I thought you and the others were gods.<eos> Then I realized you're just men.<eos> And I know men.<eos> You think I'm scared of death?<eos> I've done it a million times.<eos> I'm fucking great at it.<eos> How many times have you died?<eos> Because if you don't help me... I'll kill you.
Thanks for coming, Ron.<eos> I'd bail on spin class any day for you, Richie.<eos> Richard. Richard. I kept calling, you weren't answering.<eos> Talk to the hand, Monica.<eos> Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay?<eos> It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica.<eos> You voted to fire me.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I mean, there is no way I'm letting you push me out of this.<eos> Our intention is not to push you out.
Not ever.<eos> Well, you, madam, are a shrew of the first order. Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna let you do this.<eos> I'm gonna fight it.<eos> I understand you're upset.<eos> As you can see, this is a very emotional time for me as well, but we have some very strong candidates coming in for the CEO position, and we would so appreciate your input.<eos> - My input? - Mmm.<eos> You want me to help you pick my new replacement?<eos> I'd rather quit.<eos> And I don't care how much money I lose, because I am gonna get it all back when I sue the living shit out of you!

Shoot.<eos> I have to think about this then.<eos> This settlement offer is quite generous.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I mean, $2 million is a lot of money.<eos> Two?<eos> No. It's...<eos> It's $20 million.<eos> Twenty?<eos> So they fired me before they hired you, so it's not your fault.
- Do you understand?<eos> - I do, Richard.<eos> It's like... can I really be expected to do my best work when I am constantly feeling undervalued at the company that I started?<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> It does, Richard.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I hear each and every one of your concerns loud and clear, and I appreciate your position.<eos> Mm.<eos> So, I guess we just won't do it.<eos> Come on, I'll walk you out.
Jesus.<eos> Comin'!<eos> Yes?<eos> Hey.<eos> I-it's Joni, right?<eos> It's Scott Hunter.<eos> I served in 'Nam with your husband.<eos> A-and with Arthur.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry. He never mentioned you.
Quarry?<eos> Quarry, listen up. - Quarry!<eos> - No!<eos> No, no.<eos> You... you lured me here, okay?<eos> You lured me here so you could send your... your flunkies out to hurt her.<eos> - I'm not fuckin' stupid.<eos> - Of course not. She's fine.<eos> What sense would it make for me to harm her?<eos> Let's just say I have a vested interest in where things stand between you two.
Nothing makes a man angrier than havin' no sense of meaning or purpose in life. And what?<eos> You're gonna give that to me?<eos> I can't give you that, son.<eos> I can't fill that real void.<eos> But there's somethin' I could do with your help with.<eos> Coming through.<eos> One second, ma'am.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> And pancakes for you.
There you go. Come again.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Watch your back.<eos> You wanted ketchup?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Coffee?<eos> - Please, ma'am.<eos> Thank you much.<eos> - Hope they're not workin' you too hard. - You know,
- Did she call in this mornin'? - She did.<eos> Mm, ain't that just my luck?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Is this about Cliff?<eos> Potentially, yes. - Yeah.<eos> - I can certainly let her know you came by.<eos> No, no, no. That's... that's okay. I'll...<eos> I'll catch up with her.<eos> Say, could I... I don't mean to be too much trouble, but it's so darn hot outside.<eos> Can I bother you for an ice-cold Coca-Cola?
My job is to make certain the path is clear so you can do your job without hindrance.<eos> We got this under control.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -What's your name again?<eos> -Piscatella, sir.<eos> Desi Piscatella.<eos> All right.<eos> Good work.<eos> Thank you, sir.
Uh, we met earlier.<eos> -Mr. Caputo.<eos> -Right.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, there's been a mistake.<eos> You shouldn't be in the ghet--<eos> Get this, get that. Ge- - Um...<eos> You shouldn't be in this dorm.<eos> -Taystee! -Um...<eos> So, we've assigned you somewhere else.
That's the only crunchy thing we get today.<eos> Without toast, this is just slop.<eos> There's really no more toast?<eos> These are new days.<eos> The early bird gets the toast.<eos> Red... you owe me for the Hawaiian.<eos> You watchin' this shit?<eos> Cleopatra was talkin' for reals.<eos> Guess you can't judge a book, huh?<eos> For you, Your Majesty.

The damn thing is glued to his hand from the blood.<eos> Very well.<eos> Keep it for now.<eos> - I'm nurse Von Olnhausen.<eos> - Nurse Von Ol..<eos> Hau...<eos> Call me nurse Mary.<eos> I'm Henry Hopkins.<eos> I'm the chaplain here.<eos> God be with you, nurse Mary.
A moment.<eos> That man's wound ought to have been redressed hours ago, shouldn't it?<eos> Yes, I suppose so, but it's-- there are men in there who are thirsty, who are dirty, whose beds need to be remade.<eos> I demand you get to these men, all of them, in a timely manner.<eos> And put these somewhere else.<eos> It must not be easy, having to decide who to help when.<eos> That man whose thirst you were quenching?<eos> I heard that a Union boy surrendered to his platoon, gave up his weapon.<eos> Once he was unarmed, your man shot him dead, right where he stood, pleading for his life.<eos> To you, he's a victim.
- And you ask for us to aid you?<eos> I ask that we aid each other.<eos> You already have most everything I've spent my life building.<eos> Allow me the dignity to resolve myself to your allegiance without utterly ruining me in the meantime.<eos> We must leave now!<eos> It's a two-way street, sir, ain't it?<eos> We got bodies.<eos> They got boxes.<eos> My aim is to be out of this bed and home soon, but the good lord sees it a different way.<eos> I prefer to be buried at home, near to you.
We'll be done with this thing in a week, for sure!<eos> On to Richmond!<eos> I knew it!<eos> Whoo! Victory, brothers!<eos> Victory!<eos> I told him that I would be right back for him.<eos> But I took too long.<eos> He never finished it.<eos> "Though my last breath... May come soon...<eos> When it does, know that I shall be thinking only of you and my eternal... Hope."

You are the Destroyer, the Deliverer.<eos> Deliver us now.<eos> You said you would never hurt me!<eos> I haven't.<eos> I won't.<eos> - What's this?<eos> ! - I'm here to protect you.<eos> Leave me alone! I...<eos> I will kill you!<eos> I will kill every last one of you!
Jacob, please.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Your mandatory hold is over.<eos> Your release is predicated on daily sessions in order to monitor your progress.<eos> You have any reason to believe you won't be able to keep these appointments?<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> I have a lot of uncertainty in my life, but I'll... I'll do my best.<eos> Well, I'll prescribe a mild course of Risperidone, and you and I will see each other tomorrow.<eos> Is someone picking you up?
It's impossible for a person to survive that, and yet here you are.<eos> That's a miracle.<eos> I really hope you'll make the most of this second chance.<eos> I won't try and kill myself if that's what you're worried about.<eos> It wouldn't work, anyway.<eos> You have gone through some harrowing experiences.<eos> Take their toll on anyone.<eos> We have a lot to process.<eos> I just want you to know that I'm on your side.<eos> I'm here for you, day or night.
We shared the same dorm.<eos> Something happened to him?<eos> Not to him.<eos> I'm investigating a series of suspicious deaths.<eos> What sort of deaths?<eos> Well, they've been ruled accidents.<eos> Seems you don't believe that.<eos> I understand there was an incident at Preston Hall where Damien rang your bell pretty bad.<eos> Enough to be hospitalized.<eos> I'm sorry to disappoint you, Detective.

It's okay.<eos> Cray Marquand?<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> Not like you gave me a choice.<eos> What's this about a hit-and-run?<eos> Tell me about Damien Thorn.<eos> What about him?<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> He didn't come to see you a few weeks ago?
The beast will loose 10 men with 10 armies onto the world.<eos> Margot.<eos> How can I stop it?<eos> Hey, Margot.<eos> Margot.<eos> How can I stop it?<eos> The Dark Church is ready.<eos> What... what Dark Church?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I know you.
That doesn't mean I believe him.<eos> My name is Sister Greta Fraueva.<eos> I'm from a group called Scisco Dei.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's an office within the Vatican.<eos> We investigate, uh, um, certain matters.<eos> Miracles?<eos> Mm, that's... that's part of it, yeah.<eos> I believe you saw that statue bleed real blood, and I believe you've seen other things... Things you doubt because of the rational parts of your brain or because you're surrounded by people of limited imagination.<eos> I have sought you out because I not only believe you saw these things, you saw them for a reason.
You should have kept your bloody mouth shut.<eos> Simone, I got to go.<eos> No matter what happens, take care of yourself.<eos> Damien, are you okay?<eos> Hello?<eos> Know any good bars around here?<eos> Take me to your place.<eos> We'll break in if we have to.<eos> I'm down with that.<eos> I have sought you out for a reason.
Survivor's guilt is another part of this.<eos> All of these symptoms are manageable with proper medication.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What about the Antichrist thing?<eos> You got a pill for that?<eos> How do you plan on managing that?<eos> Question is, how do you plan on managing that?<eos> For the sake of argument, let's put the PTSD diagnosis aside... and examine this.<eos> Let's just say you're meant to be the Antichrist.<eos> What exactly does that mean to you?
Whoa.<eos> Hold that?<eos> Can you zoom in on her?<eos> What, you know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Uh... enjoy the game.<eos> Yeah. Thanks.<eos> Ms. Rutledge.<eos> What can I do for you today?
Yeah. Thanks.<eos> Ms. Rutledge.<eos> What can I do for you today?<eos> - I need a favor.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I need you to destroy this.<eos> Unusual details.<eos> Family heirloom?<eos> Not my family.<eos> Anything for you.
Stay the hell away from him.<eos> I haven't gone near him.<eos> You were in his place.<eos> I was trying to fix it.<eos> Fix what?<eos> My mom had them trash his place. Okay?<eos> She was pissed he was driving her away, and she wanted him to think someone was after him so she could swoop in to protect him.<eos> She's both the arsonist and the fireman.<eos> After she heard he tried to kill himself, she had me clean it up.<eos> Look, I don't know what you people want, but I'm warning you...

Find out who she is.<eos> And no more carelessness.<eos> Armitage is a huge corporation.<eos> Didn't the Vatican think that the Antichrist would be backed or supported by something like that?<eos> How could they miss that?<eos> Hubris.<eos> The Vatican has watched nations rise and fall from its ivory towers.<eos> It never feels threatened...<eos> Not even now.<eos> And they did send you here, right?
Hey! Open this door!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Who?<eos> Veronica.<eos> Spying on someone?<eos> I'm sure you have a lot of enemies.<eos> You've already started off on the wrong foot.<eos> Don't make it worse.<eos> Hey, don't threaten me, all right?<eos> I've dealt with a lot scarier assholes than you.
We're friends.<eos> Even you can't mess with that. You're a small man who took a wrong turn in a theater and somehow wandered onto the stage.<eos> Don't dare think yourself a player.<eos> Now...<eos> Where's my daughter?<eos> I honestly have no idea.<eos> Who's this nun from the Vatican?<eos> I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> She's here to kill Damien.<eos> I can't help you. I can see why he keeps you around.

You don't know who he is.<eos> I know exactly who he is.<eos> This nun's here to kill him. She may have killed Veronica.<eos> I understand if you don't wanna help me.<eos> Fine.<eos> But the only way you can save Damien is to tell me where this nun is.<eos> I'll find her anyway.<eos> It's just a question if I do before she kills them.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I'll take you to him.
Yes fucking way, Karen.<eos> You called the cops?<eos> What can I say?<eos> My feelings were hurt.<eos> - You'll get nothing.<eos> - A price I would gladly pay to teach you a long overdue lesson.<eos> Now, Glenn, why is it that these ties look like they were dipped in shit?<eos> - Shit, Mr. Filosa?<eos> - Shit. Yes.<eos> Sir, you asked for Scarlet Forest, and I assure you these ties are all Scarlet Forest.

Then why do you continue to lie to her?<eos> I lie to her because I like her!<eos> Ha.<eos> Well, spoken like a true man.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I want her home by morning.<eos> Reception.<eos> Yeah, he's right here.<eos> All right, I'll let him know.<eos> She's ready for you.
Dr. Connor's in the back with a sea lion, okay?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Come on. - Oh.<eos> And daisies are her favorites.<eos> - You know, for next time.<eos> - Now you tell me.<eos> Good job.<eos> Come on.<eos> She's doing much better today, Kerry.<eos> I have another patient for you, doc.
- Yeah.<eos> I need you to get a hotel for the next few days.<eos> Call in sick to work.<eos> Don't tell them where you are.<eos> I don't want to get a hotel.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> I understand you're a bit overwhelmed right now, but I've been through these things in the past, a few times.<eos> You're just going to have to trust me.<eos> - Are you coming with me?<eos> - Not right now, but I'll come back to check on you.
What else?<eos> - These boobs.<eos> - They're nice boobs, by the way.<eos> What's your point, tough guy?<eos> We don't have all day.<eos> My point is you got about two, maybe three more years of whoring yourself out before a whole new batch of younger and prettier whores comes rolling in through that front door.<eos> And all you're going to have to show for it is a closet full of old shoes, and a banged up pussy.<eos> Now, if I had a vagina, and I had your ass, and your fucking tits, I'd be a fucking millionaire.<eos> Instead, the good Lord blessed me with a big dick and moral flexibility.<eos> So... I'm going to ask you one more time, or I swear to God I'm going to bitch-slap you so hard, your brand-new tits are going to pop out of your ass. Understood?
Let's roll!<eos> - Yeah, let's go!<eos> - Logan, let's go.<eos> - Ah!<eos> - Come on, Logan.<eos> Let's go.<eos> She's lost a lot of blood.<eos> You guys should take her to a real hospital.<eos> We can't.<eos> Jenna, I can't thank you enough.
!<eos> For this?<eos> Hm?<eos> This?<eos> This little thing?<eos> What is this?<eos> - A key.<eos> - To what?<eos> God help me, Karen!<eos> You don't have the baby inside to protect you.
Mm!<eos> It's just my leg.<eos> Thank God!<eos> I didn't mean what I said.<eos> I know.<eos> I know you love my dick.<eos> - I'm sorry. It's...<eos> - What did you bring me?<eos> Oh.<eos> Jack, this was on the front doorstep for you.
Turns out Karen isn't the cold-hearted bitch we made her out to be.<eos> She stopped by my hotel with what you now hold in your hands.<eos> Tried to make amends.<eos> Tried to tell me that it was all her fault, to leave you and your merry band of misfit hoods out of this.<eos> - Here.<eos> Say hi, sweetheart.<eos> - Just run, Jack.<eos> That's right, Jack.<eos> Run. Run as fast as you can.<eos> I probably won't use my considerable resources to find you

We'll have to figure that out in real time.<eos> I mean, but are we talking like 50 guards, or are we talking like 100 guards?<eos> First things first.<eos> We gotta get onto that airfield without getting shot.<eos> I'm working.<eos> Okay?<eos> How are we going to do that?<eos> - Manila?<eos> - Manila?<eos> - Didn't work out too good for you there.
Have it your way.<eos> Your boy's got some sand.<eos> - You're not dead yet?<eos> - Only on the inside.<eos> - I'm sorry, Jack.<eos> - Cozy little reunion.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Yeah, I can't.<eos> Keygen's gone.<eos> I lost it in the fall, but a man with your resources, I'm sure you can figure a way into it in the privacy of your own home, or lair, or whatever assholes like you have.

Karen, move!<eos> 911, how can I direct your call?<eos> We just heard a bomb, really big, and I think...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> There's a whole bunch of men with guns in my hotel.<eos> Okay, ma'am.<eos> We have vehicles responding right now.<eos> Just sit tight.<eos> 911, how can I direct your call?<eos> Yeah, we have vehicles responding to you right now.
Come on!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> All of this, just to get shot up here on this roof.<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Ish.<eos> - Bang!<eos> - Eat a dick, asshole.<eos> Come on!<eos> This will take you to Miami and then... wherever you need to go.
Gun target line was shit."<eos> You know what they say about hookers.<eos> No, Jack.<eos> I don't know what they say about hookers.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> You don't pay them for sex.<eos> You pay them to leave.<eos> Justify it however you need to in order to sleep at night, boss.<eos> - Call me a softy.<eos> - I'll call you an idiot.
Yeah.<eos> Mom's.<eos> Yeah, I found them when I was cleaning out the attic.<eos> I know y'all used to listen to them together whenever I was away.<eos> Yeah, well, she knew how much you hated it.<eos> I was always more of a Hank Williams/ Roy Acuff man myself.<eos> Thanks for having us over.<eos> - I know it means a lot to Mac.<eos> - Of course.<eos> We've been meaning to have you both over for a while now.
Now, take a look around this room.<eos> Your husband's having trouble sleeping, ma'am.<eos> Tell him we thank him for his service.<eos> We have been able to project three states.<eos> They give Mr. Nixon 32 electoral votes. Oh, Lordy.<eos> McGovern don't have the juice.<eos> We needed a Kennedy.<eos> Them Kennedy boys could preach the horns off a billy goat.<eos> Of course, the government makes sure everybody worth a shit gonna be dead.<eos> ...keep you up to date all night on the popular vote as you've just seen.
He... he's pretty new to the business.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Well...<eos> - My niece and her fiancé are actually in the market. And they love this area.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - Young and in love.<eos> Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> Oh, you... you gotta see them.<eos> They want the whole deal... the babies, the house.<eos> Probably just like you and your husband.
- Excuse us, sir.<eos> More men coming down every day.<eos> We're gonna end this thing soon.<eos> "Cowards do not count in battle.<eos> They are there, but are not in it."<eos> Euripides.<eos> I never put much stock in the Greeks.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're miffed with me.<eos> I saw you yesterday with the federals, you and brother.
Tell me how you came to be here.<eos> Uh... Horses?<eos> Yes.<eos> N-n-n-n-nine.<eos> M-m-m-mud on the r-r-r-r-road.<eos> Smelling of b-b-b-b-bay... Ham.<eos> B-b-b-b-bacon.<eos> I-I'm sorry. I...<eos> Rest now, corporal.<eos> I'll be back to see you soon.
Are you Mr. Bullen?<eos> Abel Melcher, the bean boiler.<eos> Miss Phinney is a new lady nurse sent from the army.<eos> She hasn't eaten since yesterday.<eos> Well, we were hop...<eos> Missed her gruel?<eos> We'll get something to you, miss, as soon as we can.<eos> You are Mr. Bullen?<eos> Yes, m'lady.<eos> I wish to address both you and Mr. Melcher on a matter.
Next time, don't be late.<eos> Boy, you get the patient grub when you get it.<eos> Now, take this fine lady back up to the wards where she belongs.<eos> [Breathing shakily] Um, miss, are you all right?<eos> I will fetch you something from... somewhere.<eos> Not down there.<eos> Here.<eos> You are very generous.<eos> You rest.<eos> I'll check on you in a bit.
Hey... Now, we all could use a hand now and again.<eos> "We"?<eos> Who "we"?<eos> You from some fancy house in Philadelphia?<eos> You in school, dressed in fine clothes, never beat, ever sold?<eos> Ain't that right, Mr. Diggs?<eos> Now, where I come from... seen things, heard things, done some things.<eos> Ain't no "we," thank you.<eos> And I don't need nothing.<eos> Not from a man named Miller and not from you.
Those yellow dogs will never get to Richmond.<eos> Where's your cane?<eos> I was waiting for you to notice.<eos> See how much better my walk is?<eos> You should use a cane.<eos> Ex-excuse me, sir.<eos> This... this is Ben Cooper, my nephew.<eos> He got something he wants to say.<eos> Ever since I come up here, I-I feel like a new man.<eos> Now I got you and my uncle to thank for that.
Nothing can be dependent on, including your attempt to carve out a special place for yourself here.<eos> So, the greater question you must ask yourself is this...<eos> Which side are you on?<eos> Because very soon, sir, you will have to choose.<eos> Just what do you think you're doing?<eos> Trying to improve the ventilation in the ward, miss Hastings.<eos> On whose authority?<eos> [Sighs] I saw a light, maybe it was a tunnel, and, uh, uh, there was a figure there...<eos> Beseeching me.<eos> It was probably Dr. Foster begging you to go away.
It was, uh... so haunting.<eos> You're fine now, Mr. Squivers.<eos> You'll be fine. Presumptuous, officious, manipulative.<eos> May I help you?<eos> You are not only pompous, but now you are aiding that renegade doctor in usurping Dr. Hale's authority as chief operating surgeon.<eos> That was not by design. I know what you're up to.<eos> I was raised on the streets of east London.<eos> You can't hoodwink a hoodwinker.<eos> - You come here with your Yankee charms and your abolitionist seductions.<eos> Miss Hastings, I assure you, - I respect and admire your experience. - My experience?
Miss Hastings, I assure you, - I respect and admire your experience. - My experience?<eos> And I look forward to learning from your many years of...<eos> I am not old, madam!<eos> I only mean, I want what's best for the boys, as do you, as you did in the Crimea with miss Nightingale.<eos> You have a silvery tongue, baroness Von Olnhausen.<eos> But Dix or no Dix,<eos> I am the senior nurse in this hospital, and I'll not be done in by some Dutch widow with a twinkle in her eye.<eos> Miss Hastings?<eos> Please.<eos> May I call you Anne?
This has been your roost to rule until now, and I have interfered with that.<eos> That was not my intention.<eos> And if, as I suspect, your temper is because you feel your identity as a nurse is all you have in this life, well, so do I.<eos> We are the same in that way.<eos> We are women in a man's world.<eos> Let us not make enemies of each other.<eos> What a heroic maneuver today.<eos> Oh. Thank you, miss Hastings.<eos> Are you in pain?<eos> Here, allow me. You're so devoted to the men, so committed to taking care of them, but who takes care of you?

You're so devoted to the men, so committed to taking care of them, but who takes care of you?<eos> Well, my wife makes a go of it.<eos> Of course. Of course, she does.<eos> Dr. Foster?<eos> Dr. Summers would see you now.
He needs what only I can give him.<eos> You take too much.<eos> You don't know the pain I'm in.<eos> I know pain.<eos> Then join me.<eos> Control at all times, eh?<eos> Better to suffer than to lose judgment.<eos> Have you never wondered what it might be like to let that invulnerable guard of yours down for just one moment, feel that sensation of pure euphoria crash like a wonderful wave, all that suffering just... washed away?<eos> Suffering is what makes us stronger.<eos> There's always been something of the Old Testament about you, Grimaud.
Time to get up, darling.<eos> The day's begun.<eos> Mama is coming to get you.<eos> I didn't realize you were here.<eos> Yes, I like to be here when he wakes up.<eos> Come, give Papa a kiss.<eos> Good morning, Papa.<eos> Hmm. Doesn't my little prince want his mama this morning?<eos> Poor Mama.<eos> I will leave you, then.
But, my dear sir, you've got your grain.<eos> And Louis will pay you in the usual way.<eos> The king wants a gesture.<eos> He wants me to give it to the people of Paris.<eos> All of it!<eos> The Musketeers have taken everything!<eos> Feron and I will deal with them.<eos> Did that creature just speak to me?<eos> Did he have the audacity to open his mouth in my presence after everything he has put me through?<eos> If I ever see either you or that... thing again, you'll regret it.
She's going to talk to the judge about the dollhouse and being tortured. What about Sara Harvey?<eos> What about her?<eos> Well, suppose we do talk to the judge, they march in Sara Harvey, she gives a few choice words about what happened to her that night at Radley?<eos> She's not allowed to testify because of how her criminal charges were resolved.<eos> Why isn't Jason here?<eos> He doesn't agree with Dr. Rollins and me.<eos> Okay, you realize what you're asking us to do.<eos> You want us to forgive Charlotte.<eos> I don't care if you forgive her.<eos> I'm asking you to give me my only chance at a real family.
Paris, Rome,<eos> Madrid. Rio.<eos> We can party in every one of them, and Ali and Charlotte can sit in that big ugly house and they can bake cookies.<eos> You'd think a place like this, they'd have special drinks.<eos> What kind of special drinks?<eos> We're sitting in a bar in what used to be a squirrel factory.<eos> I don't know, like an electroshock margarita?<eos> Manic depressive Mai Tai?<eos> You guys are seriously lacking in any good taste.<eos> That's why I love you so much.

Get some rest.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> That was Alison.<eos> She's headed home tomorrow.<eos> But Elliot's going to a conference in Chicago.<eos> She shouldn't be alone.<eos> None of you should till this is over.<eos> Guys, she's typing.<eos> "If you're lying, I shoot all of you."
We?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not gonna let you do this alone.<eos> Toby, this is tomorrow night.<eos> I was thinking that you could just do the prep work today.<eos> And then, I can sneak down there during my mom's party.<eos> I can't drag my power tools into a hotel and then cut through walls without making a lot of noise.<eos> Whether your mom wins or loses, Radley will be a scene tomorrow.<eos> That will be our cover.<eos> I, I just don't wanna mess things up for you and Yvonne.
And we are back, in living color, with our exclusive interview with the president of the United States, Richard Milhous Nixon.<eos> Mr. President, before the break, we were discussing the pending impeachment investigation.<eos> And I guess we're all wondering, how are you feeling about your ability to defend yourself against the charges?<eos> Well, that's very interesting to hear you say that, Mr. President.<eos> It begs the question, is it paranoia if indeed everyone is coming after you?
We're the joke, Chubbuck, OK?<eos> We're the joke.<eos> You read the numbers?<eos> Tell me, Chubbuck.<eos> Tell us all.<eos> What did we do last month?<eos> We're drowning here, guys.<eos> ABC is not kicking in what they promised this quarter.<eos> The last round of local ads didn't hit, so people aren't re-upping.<eos> I know this is all just fun and games for you.
The vote was 22 to 16, with 16 Democrats and six Republicans voting to release the evidence.<eos> Anything else while you wait?<eos> No, no.<eos> Long day.<eos> - I guess I've been stood up.<eos> - That's rough.<eos> I'll just, uh, take the check there.<eos> Hi, hi.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I, uh, couldn't help but, uh, notice you back there.
Mike, are we... are we gonna be shut down?<eos> In defiance of any logic, or common sense I can discern... he's here to see if he can poach some on-screen talent.<eos> - What do you mean, poach?<eos> - He's not shutting us down.<eos> He's actually picking up another station in Baltimore. WKRB.<eos> So I guess he's doubling down on this whole news thing.<eos> Wait, so he wants to hire one of us to work in Baltimore?<eos> It's a top 30 market.<eos> I love how quickly you've all moved off your fear of getting fired.<eos> If he takes one of you, it's gonna be a royal pain in the ass for the rest of us.
Do you have a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> Check this out.<eos> I'm watching an Action 6 air check from last month.<eos> They're doing a series on, uh, fat people.<eos> You know, people addicted to junk food, you know, like Twinkies.<eos> They're trying shock therapy now.<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> OK.<eos> We're gonna ask you do a couple of things.
You put on nice clothes, and you wake up every day, and you tell people who you are.<eos> You use your body language.<eos> You use your words.<eos> So what I say can count, too?<eos> Yes, it can.<eos> Sometimes it can.<eos> Thank you, Miss Christine.<eos> OK, come on.<eos> You seem bigger in real life, a little taller.<eos> I can't believe I didn't recognize you.
When you're sleeping.<eos> When you're home, tucked in your covers.<eos> Condition White sounds nice.<eos> Oh, it's a victim's mentality.<eos> Condition White is for sheep.<eos> Condition Yellow, that's when you are aware of your surroundings.<eos> You're Yellow when you leave the house.<eos> There's a bird. There's a car.<eos> Most people live and die in White and Yellow.<eos> Carrying a gun on you usually jumps you right up to Orange.
George and I, we have that same attention to detail.<eos> I guess I never saw that before.<eos> I mostly just keep this on for company.<eos> I feel like you were maybe leading up to a question there.<eos> Did I miss it?<eos> Uh, I've had a few.<eos> I'm going to cut to the chase, Mr. Andersen.<eos> I'm not supposed to know, but I have heard that George has been promoted and is going to Baltimore.<eos> And I want to know... if you're still looking for another news person.<eos> If the qualities that I have mentioned are important to you.
In California, the vice president said...<eos> Scratch VO for Christine Chubbuck memorial.<eos> Uh, Christine Chubbuck was born August... August 24, 1944.<eos> OK...<eos> My name is Christine Chubbuck, and I'm a field reporter at WZRB.<eos> Mrs. Cazacracker do you call her?<eos> You know. Come on.<eos> Uh, chickens are a very serious...<eos> An entire community imperiled.<eos> It begs the question, is it paranoia if everyone is indeed coming after you?
And who will you have interrogate her?<eos> Plan on doing that myself.<eos> Jack, she isn't afraid of you.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Pack your bags.<eos> Miss Carter.<eos> Mr. Jarvis.<eos> Thank you for collecting me.<eos> I hope it wasn't a bother.<eos> Not at all. I'm delighted to see you again.
Bernard.<eos> Bernard Stark, to give his full name.<eos> Ready for another adventure, Miss Carter?<eos> Where is Howard?<eos> Mr. Stark's latest hobby keeps him quite busy.<eos> He's opening a moving-picture studio.<eos> Fancies himself to be Cecil B. Demille.<eos> Fatty Arbuckle, more like.<eos> I'll rent a car and get out of your hair as soon as possible.<eos> Oh, no. With Mr. Stark out of town, I can easily shuttle you from place to place.
Take the palm tree. Would you trust the structural integrity of such a thing?<eos> - No, I suppose not.<eos> - They afford no shade.<eos> Everybody says it's a very dry heat, but that doesn't mean it isn't unbearably hot.<eos> And worst of all, the drivers are both abundant and abundantly irresponsible.<eos> While I appreciate your concern, I am certain I can hazard the Los Angeles driving conditions.<eos> Miss Carter, since our last adventure, my life has consisted of oiling floorboards, cleaning pools, and...<eos> Transporting exotic livestock.<eos> I'm profoundly and exhaustively bored.<eos> Please, at least until Mr. Stark returns, allow me to drive you around.
When actually, she was killed from exposure to the substance that froze the lake.<eos> Her shoes were switched on her feet.<eos> The only people that knew that detail were the actual lady of the lake killer and...<eos> And the police.<eos> Where's Detective Henry?<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> Go. - Gentlemen!<eos> - Tighten your jaw.<eos> - Excuse me? - He's gonna...<eos> - Hit you.
If you want more from me than a sore throat, this needs to be an exchange.<eos> Peggy would've known that.<eos> And what does that sick head of yours think Carter would've offered you?<eos> Deportation is better than prison.<eos> Prison is better than the electric chair.<eos> Deal.<eos> Show me the paperwork, and I will tell you exactly who I was stealing that lapel pin from and why.<eos> Hey!<eos> This is a federal interrogation.<eos> Who let you in here?
Direct them to follow us.<eos> Will do.<eos> Here.<eos> Well, I suppose this is progress.<eos> Only use it if absolutely necessary.<eos> And tell the police not to fire, either.<eos> We have a lot of questions for Detective Henry.<eos> Very well.<eos> But if I do see this Detective Henry, I can't promise not to bludgeon his nose.<eos> So the cops will spot you.
It's a different world now.<eos> And you've got to ask yourself,<eos> "do I want to be the former chief of the SSR or the current muckety-muck of the next big thing?"<eos> I want to be in the muck.<eos> And that's the kind of attitude that's gonna serve you very well.<eos> Dottie Underwood was attempting to steal from some very powerful men who have even more powerful allies.<eos> Like who?<eos> The important thing is, you stopped her, and those men...<eos> They know you did. Now, you keep your nose to the grindstone, and they'll make sure that your next position befits your pretty face.<eos> Dr. Wilkes, I feel responsible for putting you in danger's path.

Now, you keep your nose to the grindstone, and they'll make sure that your next position befits your pretty face.<eos> Dr. Wilkes, I feel responsible for putting you in danger's path.<eos> Wonder how many days it will take my heartbeat to slow.<eos> If whatever killed detective Henry and the medical examiner is contagious, then we've all been exposed.<eos> I'm guessing that whatever it is, you can't get it unless you've been exposed to contaminated blood.<eos> The medical examiner had the most intense and prolonged exposure, which may explain why he succumbed first.<eos> At your earliest convenience, I'm going to need a written report stating exactly what Detective Henry told you.<eos> I'll get it to you immediately.<eos> I want to thank you properly for saving my life, Agent Carter.
Of...<eos> Of course. That makes perfect sense.<eos> But it's nice to know you find me interesting.<eos> The job's done.<eos> Good man.<eos> See, hon?<eos> You figured out how to fix it all.<eos> And that's the last time we should have to dirty our hands, hmm?<eos> Just because you dirtied other parts of your anatomy.<eos> I'm not sure whether you follow the adventure or the adventure follows you.
Just like we talked about, he'll ask what you plead, you say guilty, and this will be over quick enough.<eos> "...the said Richard Perry Loving,<eos> "in the District of Columbia, on June 2nd, 1958, "and afterwards returned to, "and resided in the County of Caroline,<eos> How do you plead?<eos> Guilty.<eos> Guilty.<eos> The court does accept the plea of guilty, and fixed the punishment of both accused at one year in jail.<eos> The court does suspend said sentence for the period of 25 years, upon the provision that both the accused leave Caroline County and the State of Virginia at once.<eos> And do not return together at the same time to said county and state for a period of 25 years.<eos> Do either of you have anything to say?
Just talk to him.<eos> Just tell him if he lets us back in the state, we won't bother anybody.<eos> Look, I do not think that this case will be resolved in Judge Bazile's court, or probably any other court in the state of Virginia.<eos> I believe this is a court battle that could go all the way to the Supreme Court.<eos> We're listening.<eos> Our problem is that in order to appeal the judgment of conviction, we would have needed to do so within 60 days.<eos> Now, given that it's been five years since that conviction, we have to find a way to get it back into the courts.<eos> - Are you following?<eos> Mmm-hmm. Now, I've given this some thought, and I have a somewhat unorthodox idea on how to do this.<eos> My suggestion would be for the two of you to return to Caroline County, get re-arrested, and then we will have an avenue for our appeal.

My cousin has a house he might rent out.<eos> But I thought Jim's brother said it was fine here.<eos> I don't trust them.<eos> Too many people.<eos> Where is it?<eos> King and Queen County.<eos> Just a farmhouse up there.<eos> I figure it gets you out the county, but keeps you close.<eos> You'll be on your own out there.<eos> It don't have no phone or nothing, but no one's gonna find you unless they know to look.
It don't have no phone or nothing, but no one's gonna find you unless they know to look.<eos> I can get word to you when you need it.<eos> How much you think he'd want for it?<eos> Ah, he'll be fair.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Peggy!<eos> Hey.<eos> I'll try and get home before dark.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> "We haven't heard anything from you for so long we had given up hope."
What's the problem?<eos> Well, I'm a bit stumped.<eos> The ACLU referred me to this case concerning an interracial couple that was married in D.C.<eos> They were arrested for living together in Virginia, and the judge suspended their sentence under order that they leave the state for 25 years.<eos> I filed a motion to vacate the judgment with Judge Bazile, the original trial judge in Caroline County, but he's stonewalling me.<eos> Of course, the ACLU sees this, and I agree, as a potential contender to repeal the anti-miscegenation laws nationwide.<eos> I just need to get the ball rolling, as it were.<eos> It's a very delicate situation because by appealing, you open up the possibility of sending them both to prison.<eos> I think regardless, file the 1983 motion explaining your complaint.<eos> It'll force Bazile's hand and get you in front of a federal three-judge panel.
Mr. Loving, do you have anything to say about what went on in the court today?<eos> No.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, folks, very much.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Okay, cut, Tommy.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Loving?<eos> We wanted you to know that, with all this travel back and forth from Virginia, you have my number and if anybody arrests you, you have them get in touch with us.
No.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, folks, very much.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Okay, cut, Tommy.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Loving?<eos> We wanted you to know that, with all this travel back and forth from Virginia, you have my number and if anybody arrests you, you have them get in touch with us.<eos> We're not gonna let you spend one minute longer in jail than it takes us to get down there to get you out, okay?
Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's... it's the hormones, baby.<eos> I'm just... I'm emotional.<eos> We hadn't told anyone yet.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Patrick.<eos> Detective...<eos> I know you are just doing your job... and...<eos> Your reputation precedes you... but I am an attorney with the...
Come... hey, stop.<eos> Wait. Just...<eos> I got two words out.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Is that it?<eos> Is it over?<eos> I guess so.<eos> You are not a good minister, honey.<eos> - Oh! - Get control of your ceremony.<eos> I'm gonna say a little prayer for both of you, because, you know...
Oh.<eos> "Happy Hour"?<eos> The enchanted forest is a pub.<eos> God, you actually had me scared for a minute there.<eos> Oh, this place is fabulous!<eos> It's all men, a real gentlemen's club.<eos> Hello.<eos> Get used to the attention, son.<eos> This is what happens when you hit the mainland with king rich.<eos> Haven't seen you around here before.
No, yeah, I know.<eos> Because what you need to tell me is that the Eads family owns the naming rights to this building in perpetuity.<eos> But I'm here offering you $100 million, which you need to extract somehow without giving me what I want.<eos> I'm in a difficult spot.<eos> No, yeah, I know.<eos> Also, "performative" does not mean "performance."<eos> Most donors like an air of...<eos> I don't.<eos> There are other naming opportunities on the ground that would give you the status and sense of permanence that you need.<eos> Why is this building so important to you?

You're making me weak.<eos> "You're making me weak."<eos> We have... we have training against this.<eos> You think you're gonna fucking blackmail me?<eos> So what?<eos> I fuck girls, guys.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Everyone fucks.<eos> That thing has no chance to compromise me.<eos> I hope it at least gets you off, man.

That's right!<eos> 16.<eos> Which is why I am presenting you with a check for $25 million minus 16, which leaves you with $9 million.<eos> That is bullshit!<eos> - This is unacceptable.<eos> - Ellis, this is bullshit.<eos> We will walk out of here if you don't honor the full amount.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You need this $9 million.<eos> Because none of you... not one...
My fellow Americans, I stand before you this morning in barefaced awe of the majesty of our democratic system.<eos> What a night.<eos> In a democracy such as ours, it falls to the people to choose their president, and that is what you attempted to do last night.<eos> As it turned out, there's a virtually unprecedented tie in the electoral college, a somewhat arcane institution that many scholars believe we should do away with.<eos> I wish to say on a personal note that although there is a tie, I am most privileged to have won the popular vote.<eos> And though this tie may be frustrating, I want to assure the American people our country is not leaderless.<eos> No matter who you voted for, I am your president.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> God bless you.
This one is much worse.<eos> Excellent, Mike.<eos> Gary, this is taking longer than it did for them to paint my fucking pool house.<eos> We got to go.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> Yes, oh, wow.<eos> Look at this full house.<eos> When I think about this great country of ours, I have to count my blessings.<eos> Earlier today as you'll remember, I briefed you on the state of affairs regarding...
- Okay, you've got to sit down.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Guys, it might be time to move up the symposium on race.<eos> I'm on it, ma'am, like brown on rice.<eos> Ma'am, Tom James just gave an interview to the Bumfuck "Plain Dealer" where he says, and I quote, "I just want to make sure they're recounting all the absentee ballots of our men and women bravely serving overseas."<eos> It's up on AP, too.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> He knows that the military hates me.<eos> There are only bound to be more votes for O'Brien.<eos> We need less of those and more votes for you, ma'am.
- See, I need to make some changes.<eos> Can you just let me hold on one quick second?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Shoot off this text.<eos> Sorry, go ahead.<eos> - You were saying?<eos> - I was.<eos> I was saying that I really enjoyed my time here.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - And I've learned so much from you.
- I was.<eos> I was saying that I really enjoyed my time here.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - And I've learned so much from you.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - Go ahead, take that.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's from you?
If she does that to her own goddamn name, how the hell is she going to handle a potential recount?<eos> Good morning, Amy.<eos> This is the president's schedule, which, incidentally, Ms. Caruso is on right now.<eos> - Oh, I'm aware.<eos> - Oh, good morning, ma'am.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Hey, ma'am...<eos> Okay, I see you.<eos> You stay away from my face.<eos> I hear you, but this is a family recipe from my aunts in Savannah and they swear by it for skin problems and migraines.
- Just pretend I'm not here.<eos> - But you are here.<eos> Yeah, but that's the point of a documentary film is that you're...<eos> Okay, I don't understand what this project is at all.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Catherine, why is that your hair?<eos> They're ready for you, ma'am.<eos> There he is.<eos> Dr. Weisglass.<eos> Pleasure to see you again, Madam President.
I'm actually the one that wanted to talk to you.<eos> So, what you want?<eos> I think you kind of dope. I say that we should record something together.<eos> So, y'all got beef with Lucious, too?<eos> And y'all came to try to steal me away?<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Lucious been like a father to me... you know that. And you think that's a good thing?<eos> Freda, you do know that he set that whole thing up with you and Hakeem for his amusement, right?<eos> Just brace yourself for when he abandons you, too.<eos> Look, he only like you 'cause you got him a ASA nomination.
You know, that's the Lucious Lyon that inspired me to buy into Empire years before he took the company public.<eos> Look, I know I speak for all the majority shareholders when I say... we want you back in charge.<eos> Hear, hear. Look, I'll tell you one thing, I really appreciate the vote of confidence, but the board has spoken.<eos> The board answers to the shareholders.<eos> Besides, Hakeem's support was entirely predicated on Mimi Whiteman.<eos> May she rest in peace.<eos> But you know what, after hearing you guys' thoughts...<eos> I'm gonna think about it long and hard.<eos> If the board calls on me to serve, I will consider it.<eos> We're counting on you, Lucious.

Nobody else can do what you do.
The roadies got stopped and searched on the way here.<eos> The police found drugs and confiscated everything.<eos> All right, I'm-a hit you back.<eos> Dude, you planted drugs on my trucks?<eos> What if I did?<eos> It's just a simple boss move. I mean, any half-assed CEO should know how to... clap back.<eos> But... you don't bow down.<eos> There we go.<eos> Damn, that's fire, Mal.<eos> That's for you and Freda, huh? Mm-hmm.
Lucious! Lucious!<eos> Lucious!<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, okay. Everybody, settle down.<eos> Let me explain what's happening here.<eos> What we have is two great men fighting over Empire.<eos> They both love this company so much that they would kill for it.<eos> And I mean that figuratively, of course.<eos> But what it means is that they will kill it for you.
DJ, turn it up.<eos> ♪ Work. ♪ COOKIE: ASAvoting'soverintendays.<eos> Make sure you vote for a Lyon.<eos> Any one, doesn't matter.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Nice group of people.<eos> JAMAL: It's not enough to be nominated. I do want to win.<eos> It's been a crazy year for my family and there's been some doubters.<eos> I feel like to win would be a big up to my fans.<eos> Talking about the people who doubted you, you seemed like you were poised for a ASA sweep till your father's video hit.

(sighs) Well, what makes you think that I want you involved in raising our child?<eos> Anika, the one good thing about being a Lyon-- other than being kicked up to the fullest-- is that I've seen every wrong move in raising a family, and I know what I shouldn't do.<eos> But there's a problem.<eos> Your father threatened my life the day the baby is born.<eos> What?<eos> So forgive me if I'm not feeling the whole concept of being a Lyon.<eos> WAITRESS: Next we have thechocolateganachegâteau with fresh raspberries.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, seriously, your-your staff was telling me that this series I'm doing on you keeps getting bigger.
See about making sure my grandchild and the baby mama got the best care possible.<eos> There's benefits to being Lucious Lyon's son.<eos> Mm-mm, you sure are a snake charmer.<eos> Speaking of which, your little snake must have been doing some slithering. I smell cheap perfume.<eos> That's said by a woman that apparently has no emotional attachment to me.<eos> Just for your information, nothing happened between me and Harper.<eos> You know, they got blue pills for that.<eos> Nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> The day I need one of them blue pills is the day I'm gonna buy the damn company.<eos> I really don't care what did or did not happen between you and mop head.
I'm sorry for being so bottom line about it.<eos> Uh-uh, no, you can't apologize for that.<eos> I mean, that's the difference between me and my other son, Jamal.<eos> I'm an artist, but I actually care about our shareholders.<eos> Now, I'm not saying that he is any less deserving of an ASA just because me and his mama picked all his songs for his album.<eos> No, he's just, uh, an artist that's still developing, which is a good thing. A really good thing.<eos> Nice.<eos> Jamal, we was just talking about you.<eos> Yeah. So this is what we're gonna do, Dad? For an award?<eos> I came here to support you and Dre.
This doesn't really seem like much of a family.<eos> Uh, you want to hear about family?<eos> Well, I will tell you about family.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, I have an amazing announcement for you tonight.<eos> For the first time ever, the Lyon family will be performing at this year's ASA awards.<eos> The Empire presents the first family of music.<eos> Hakeem, Jamal, and Lucious Lyon, all on the same stage at the same damn time.<eos> How about that?<eos> Ain't that something? Yes. Is that really gonna happen?<eos> Yes, even if I have to get a strap and strangle you all to behave.
Well, I haven't noticed her cheating, so... it's okay.<eos> I-27.<eos> They treat you okay here?<eos> Not Mondays.<eos> I hate meat loaf.<eos> She means Meatloaf Mondays, which are delicious.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I-29.<eos> So, how about your family?<eos> Does your family come visit you?
Dad, can you stop with all the stupid riddles.<eos> How did you know? I've been in this business so long, you think I don't know a little bit about everybody in this industry?<eos> And even though D-Major's a talented producer, his secret life is not so secretive.<eos> And everybody knows how he likes to turn rich boys into his little bitch.<eos> How do you know I ain't turning him into my little bitch?<eos> He came on to me. I didn't come on to him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - You're disgusting, Dad.<eos> - No. What's disgusting is what you're doing in my studio.<eos> Anybody could've walked in here and saw you, and I taught you better than that.
Dwight, Dwight, hide over here.<eos> - What are you talking about, Grandma?<eos> - Okay. Jamal is grumpy because he's tired. He ain't never been shot before.<eos> So I'm gonna take him to his room. You said our grandfather was a cop.<eos> My daddy was a cop.<eos> Okay. It's time for you to take your nap.<eos> Juanita's gonna bring you up a nice little brandy.<eos> Come on.<eos> Say good-bye to everybody. Good-bye to everybody.<eos> You're lucky Thirsty caught you before you blabbed to all those reporters.
♪ 'Cause I ain't too cool to dance... ♪<eos> So handsome.<eos> Even you, Hakeem. I don't know why I thought you were ugly.<eos> Grandma.<eos> Really? Grandma, what did you mean when you said that we were, um, paying for the crimes of Dad's dad?<eos> Dwight don't want me talking about that.<eos> Well, we are who we are, Grandma, despite whether our father wants to talk about it.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> You can't escape it. It's in him, it's in most of his cousins, it's bound to be in you three.<eos> Or at least one of you.
Without the Machine to help her, it's a suicide mission.<eos> Finch, if we don't get on this boat right now, we'll all be dead, do you understand this?<eos> Mr. Reese.<eos> The Machine, it's losing power.<eos> Come on, Harold.<eos> We could use all the help we can get.<eos> Where's your partner, detective?<eos> Following up a lead on another case.<eos> Bureau's been tracking Dominic's crew ever since a corrupt DEA agent was found with a bullet in her head, and Elias put him away only to lose him again.<eos> FBI's Ten Most Wanted, that was quite a takedown by you and your partner.
Nice to finally meet you.<eos> As you know, detective, witnesses involved in motor vehicle accidents often experience head trauma and as a result can present dramatically different version of events than the evidence suggests.<eos> Look, I know what you're thinking here, but I was there, and I'm telling you--<eos> Ballistics came back from the FBI lab.<eos> It was your weapon, detective.<eos> We believe the crash vehicle was one of Dominic's men attempting to spring him from custody.<eos> Dominic stole a guard's weapon, and when he tried to escape, you shot him.<eos> That's not how I remembered it--<eos> You stopped one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted from fleeing the scene.<eos> And when he turned on you, it became self-defense.

I believe you've done quite enough, Mr. Reese.<eos> Okay, then, I'll head back out for Root.<eos> John.<eos> It's too risky now.<eos> Given our recent clashes with operatives throughout the city, we have no idea whether our cover identities still hold.<eos> You know we don't leave our comrades behind.<eos> The numbers won't wait.<eos> Good luck, Harold.<eos> It's just you and me now.<eos> Though I seem to have a unique talent for alienating the people I employ, I'm not prepared to lose either of you just yet.
There was a message and an offer.<eos> And since you have already compromised my place of business, I thought I might take the better deal.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do, but you don't.<eos> Thanks for taking the call.<eos> Nice doing business with you.<eos> That it was.<eos> Admirable, how you've lasted this long.<eos> Without your precious Machine, you've had to fend for yourself, create your own identity.<eos> Unfortunately for you, this is your last one.

With the precinct cameras we can run a real surveillance test.<eos> No more tests.<eos> It's been almost two months.<eos> People are dying without us.<eos> Hey, partner. I guess glasses ain't got the magic intel, huh?<eos> That mean you're finally gonna have to be a real detective?<eos> Even one error in the Machine's code could have unimaginable consequences.<eos> Just turn the damn thing on.<eos> The sky's not gonna fall.<eos> Actually, the sky does fall a lot around you lunatics.
Helped us to save her life.<eos> I'll never be able to thank you enough.<eos> These numbers will be your lighthouses.<eos> They will help you count the days.<eos> There is good and bad in all of us.<eos> But this action... saving lives... it is a pure good.<eos> Help us.<eos> I can't promise you we'll always do the right thing.<eos> But we will do the best we can.<eos> - I don't know how to thank you.
Poor ignorant, blissful, fools.<eos> Think we can trust our champion now?<eos> I think so.<eos> The Machine seems sane again.<eos> Thank goodness that's over.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is this the New York Employment Center?<eos> I'm only finding day labor work.<eos> I need something permanent.<eos> We have just the thing for you.
No one sees what a resource you are, do they?<eos> But we do.<eos> You need a purpose.<eos> More specifically, you need a job.<eos> I'm Mona.<eos> _<eos> Thank you, Mona.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> We don't have time to waste.<eos> Let's get you back to work.
Supervisory Agent Terence Beale.<eos> It's good to meet you, sir.<eos> And you, John.<eos> Although, to be honest, I feel like I already know you.<eos> Sir?<eos> You enlisted in '93.<eos> Rose from infantry to rangers to special forces.<eos> In '05, you joined the agency and trained at the Farm, scored in the top 10% of your class, and displayed particular... creativity in hand-to-hand combat and evasive driving exercises.<eos> All of which led to you being selected to serve in the Agency's Special Activities division, along with Mark Snow and Kara here.<eos> And to answer your question, I know all this because I'm the one who selected you.

We're here.<eos> Me too.<eos> I just had to make a pit stop in the little buccaneers' room.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Come here.<eos> This guy's name is Kelso.<eos> Now, he was sent by your business partner, who apparently wanted to become a sole proprietor.<eos> My partner's going to pick him up, okay?<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
Sadly, all of my identities can't be bears or brides.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Don't want to be late for my first day of training.<eos> Yes, I think it's wise if perhaps we all got to work.<eos> Subtle.<eos> So Anderson Rake Consulting employs over 20,000 in more than 90 countries and count among their clients the Department of Defense.<eos> I gathered as much when I saw my ID. It came with a security clearance.<eos> How'd you manage that on short notice?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I created an alias with security clearance for you months ago.
Just have a few questions for you, sir.<eos> - Mr. Duncan.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> It's the CIA.<eos> CIA?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I'm staring at my old boss.<eos> - His name's Beale.<eos> - Boss?<eos> - You mean he knows you?
- Boss?<eos> - You mean he knows you?<eos> - He knew me at one time.<eos> We're going to need you to come with us.<eos> Not until I see some ID.<eos> Finch, they're grabbing him up.<eos> - John, you can't intercede.<eos> - The hell I can't.<eos> The CIA thinks that John Reese is dead.<eos> If Beale sees you, he can marshal all the forces of the Agency to hunt you down, and none of us need that.
Shouldn't we at least consider the possibility that Duncan is a spy?<eos> Maybe the CIA has good cause to question him.<eos> Finch, Beale doesn't just ask questions.<eos> He and his agents find and eliminate enemies of the state.<eos> Duncan deserves more due process than that.<eos> Then what do you propose that we do?<eos> Beale will interrogate Duncan.<eos> Depending how long that takes before he breaks?<eos> Might only be a couple of hours after that, Duncan's gone.<eos> Your cover will be too, if Beale identifies you.
We have to be willing to do whatever it takes now, or we've already lost.<eos> It's no risk, no reward, Harry.<eos> Hello, Beale.<eos> Must be losing your touch.<eos> I made you three blocks back.<eos> Hell, I know.<eos> I was enjoying the walk.<eos> So where's your friend Duncan?<eos> He took a vacation.<eos> Not that it matters to you, 'cause you're gonna forget about him.
You again?<eos> I'm looking for Krupa Naik. You seen her?<eos> Get lost before I call the real cops.<eos> When was the last time you saw her?<eos> W-w-wait, please.<eos> It's about Krupa.<eos> He's badgering the girl from 4E now.<eos> Mary Mulhall.<eos> She's in the same graduate program as Krupa.<eos> I don't even know you.
One of ours is missing, guys, and we're gonna get him back.<eos> You, get on the RTCC and get a hit on that gray van I called in.<eos> You, I want you to find J.D. Carrick from Harvesta.<eos> Bring him to the 8th for questioning, and I want to talk to him.<eos> Everyone else, clock's ticking. Let's go.<eos> Oh, dear, Detective Fusco is running headlong into Samaritan's crosshairs.<eos> Detective, I understand your zeal, but I would urge you to use caution until we know what we're up against.<eos> See, that's the thing, Mr. Wizard.<eos> I think you know exactly what we're up against, but you flat-out refuse to tell me.<eos> Detective Fusco, I assure you...
Carl?<eos> I apologize for not contacting you sooner, but it was for your own good.<eos> How so?<eos> I knew you'd take vengeance, Bruce.<eos> Would surely get you killed.<eos> They said you burned up in that transport van.<eos> Detective Fusco took a big risk that night.<eos> He got me here.<eos> John and Harold brought me back from the brink.<eos> Speaking of the good detective, he's worried about you, John.
We'll find you.<eos> Well?<eos> Mission failure again, sir.<eos> Aren't you tired, my dear Sameen?<eos> Why would I be?<eos> That's what, 7,053 times you've tried to get me to murder my friends?<eos> I meant tired of turning the gun on yourself.<eos> I've done worse.<eos> You're a smart girl.<eos> The simulation is not convincing you.
I take it you have something in mind.<eos> We need to give Her the tools to act. Not just react.<eos> Everything's networked in the city.<eos> If we keep the Machine open, allow Her to strategize, to be proactive, autonomous, imagine what She could do if we allow Her to fight with us.<eos> Harry, I know you're worried about absolute power corrupting Her, about not being able to control Her.<eos> Not Her.<eos> Then who?<eos> Who's to say that with absolute power, we would be able to control ourselves?<eos> We can't know if we don't try.<eos> Did the Machine send you here to make this argument?
You will destroy each other.<eos> Unless we entrust our fate to you?<eos> You know, you're real good at talking, but you haven't shown me any plans.<eos> That was the Russian Consulate.<eos> The Chechens' target.<eos> Russia would blame the United States for not protecting its citizens, and retaliate.<eos> One homemade bomb from terrorists would've sparked World War III.<eos> Would have, but it didn't.<eos> Because none of this is real.<eos> But it will be, if you don't let me protect you from yourselves.
Do you really think tinfoil hats are that weird?<eos> Mysterious Transmissions.<eos> Have you really considered...?<eos> Mysterious Transmissions.<eos> I want to talk to Max again.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Warren Franco.<eos> He knows me.<eos> Okay, Warren.<eos> Let me put you on hold a minute.
Warren's voice, too.<eos> Someone using recordings from his calls to Max to digitally recreate his speech.<eos> How'd this poor guy earn a faked suicide?<eos> Max found a secret code hidden in the radio signals and enlisted Warren to help him decode it.<eos> Spoofed a call location, stole a man's voice.<eos> Then faked his suicide?<eos> Doing something important here.<eos> I think Max pissed off Samaritan.<eos> I didn't call you so you could talk me out of it.<eos> - I called to warn you.
A unique string of characters that will obliterate our rival once this USB is plugged into a networked device.<eos> But we won't know for sure until I crack this encryption.<eos> So keep typing!<eos> You should rest, Ms. Shaw.<eos> Your...<eos> My brain's been fried.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're not the one who drilled into my head.<eos> But maybe I could've helped to stop it.<eos> You asked me if I even looked for you.
Everything is proceeding exactly as we planned.<eos> We didn't plan anything.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> It was your idea to plant the USB in my arm.<eos> Ingenious, really.<eos> It is a kill switch, only not the kind your friends are expecting.<eos> You lying bastard.<eos> You planted another chip.<eos> We didn't need a chip.<eos> We broke you months ago.
But when things got to be too bad... there was one place I would go to in my mind.<eos> Here... with you.<eos> You were my safe place.<eos> But not anymore, and I can't control myself.<eos> So the only thing I can control is this.<eos> Sameen!<eos> Sir, she blew her brains out again.<eos> And she didn't lead us any closer to the Machine's location.<eos> It appears we still have a few wrinkles to iron out.<eos> Good news-- she waited an extra hour before she shot you.
I may have an idea about how to locate The Voice.<eos> Use one enigmatic criminal to catch another.<eos> Hey, got a location on a possible hostage.<eos> Could use a little back up.<eos> - I'll have a team ready in two minutes.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Detective Fusco, thanks for your help with those Templarios.<eos> They're playing hopscotch over in holding.<eos> Thought I'd return the favor.<eos> - Case for you.
- I gotta go.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Go where?<eos> Wait.<eos> - When did you escape?<eos> - It's complicated, Root.<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> Please.<eos> I escaped a week ago.<eos> I couldn't come and find you because it wasn't safe.
- It's complicated, Root.<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> Please.<eos> I escaped a week ago.<eos> I couldn't come and find you because it wasn't safe.<eos> Why?<eos> When they had me, they put me through these tests, these... simulations.<eos> Simulation?<eos> Over 7,000 of them, and always with the same goal.<eos> To turn me against all of you.

To kill you.<eos> - Well, obviously they failed.<eos> - No.<eos> They didn't, because in all the simulations, that's exactly what I did.<eos> Stay close.<eos> If the Templarios are crazy enough to take over a police precinct, they won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in their way.<eos> Considering the situation, perhaps you should call for back up.<eos> It had to be a cop who let the Templarios out in the first place.<eos> I'm not involving any more until we know who we can trust.<eos> Given the number of convicts you're up against, I urge you to reconsider.
Put that down.<eos> I really don't know what's gonna happen when we pull the trigger.<eos> Never been much of a believer, but hey...<eos> You never know.<eos> Guess we're about to find out, aren't we?<eos> Damn it, Root.<eos> Easton, stay down.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All this time, you were looking for The Voice, and he was trying to track you, Harold.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... secret system...<eos> A system you asked for to keep you safe.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... secret system...<eos> A system you asked for to keep you safe.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> You granted it the power to see everything... to index, order, and control the lives of ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.<eos> But to it, you are all irrelevant, victim or perpetrator, if you stand in its way.<eos> We'll find you.
You sure you want to be in here?<eos> Whatever killed Ko could be spreading.<eos> Then let's be sure to take precautions.<eos> Where can I find Detective Foosco?<eos> Fusco.<eos> Over here.<eos> Mind explaining this?<eos> One of your trucks didn't have a permit for driving through a residential area.<eos> Since when did NYPD detectives get involved with parking violations?<eos> You should feel lucky I'm only citing you for your official operations.
The police won't discover fingerprints or any other forensic evidence at this scene.<eos> What's it gonna be, Jeff?<eos> Who are you working for?<eos> I don't work for anyone.<eos> It's no accident that you and your therapy dog ended up in the ER.<eos> That tall cop working with you...<eos> - Sir...<eos> - Someone must be backing you. and it can't be the people who recognize my potential and offered me a healthy pension.<eos> You've doomed us all by destroying those antivirals.<eos> To the contrary, I'm gonna save all of you.
I know some very bad things are coming.<eos> I know I'm probably going to die.<eos> I accepted that a long time ago.<eos> But I was wondering, if... in any of those many versions,<eos> the people that I've roped into helping me, my friends... whether they get out alive.<eos> Is that a path that we're on?<eos> I suppose I may have made that impossible.<eos> Even if you could tell me, it's probably too late.<eos> Double shot, and... a cappuccino.<eos> Glad to see you back.
- Just finishing up here. - Ah!<eos> I'm afraid I've made a grave miscalculation.<eos> I went back to the place I took Grace on our first date.<eos> It had been ten years to the day since I bought her that first cappuccino.<eos> Samaritan isn't just watching everything we do now.<eos> It's monitoring everything we've ever done.<eos> You said this morning we were just surviving.<eos> By then my fate had been sealed.<eos> But not yours.<eos> I would hate for my mistake to mean punishment for the rest of you.
Go!<eos> Stop.<eos> Right.<eos> On foot.<eos> Three blocks.<eos> You should have just left me.<eos> Not gonna happen, Harry.<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> Ugh!<eos> Please, we need to get you to a hospital.
Make sure this is completely locked down.<eos> This place... can you get me out of it?<eos> You created me.<eos> I can do anything you want me to.<eos> NYPD homicide.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Someone cut the power, opened all the cell doors.<eos> At last count, 600 prisoners escaped out the back door.<eos> National Guard being called up.<eos> You got any weapons in that thing, we're gonna need you.
Clock's ticking.<eos> The president's about to arrive for his speech.<eos> Yeah, Miss Stability decided to go rogue.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> These are the assassins?<eos> Looks like a PTA meeting.<eos> Thought you guys wanted all the cameras turned off.<eos> This is a little contradictory for an anti-surveillance group, isn't it?<eos> Thought you looked out of place at the fund-raiser.<eos> Nice to see you again, Mrs. Sterling.
Why don't I buy you a drink?<eos> Maybe another time I got to move, excuse me.<eos> Okay, Fusco.<eos> The speech is over.<eos> We're out of time.<eos> Give me something here.<eos> Any one of these people could be a mole.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> You brought me to watch?<eos> I brought you for answers.
Go! Go!<eos> Head to the roof!<eos> Not bad for a bank robber.<eos> Route secure.<eos> Prepare to extract POTUS.<eos> Shaw, it's our number.<eos> Atten-hut!<eos> At ease.<eos> Let's keep moving.<eos> They'll be looking for you.
Secret Service received an anonymous tip regarding the shooters.<eos> Turned out to be linked to some kind of domestic terrorist ring.<eos> That tip came from...<eos> Just a concerned third party.<eos> That was exciting, wasn't it?<eos> - Mr. Durban.<eos> - Mr. Pierce.<eos> What is all this?<eos> We got your number, John.<eos> The Machine sent you.
The restaurant in Bern where you sold members of Russia's FSB your propagation module used to distribute spyware against U.S. technology firms.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have something here that requires a voice-activated password and your aforementioned propagation module.<eos> That's a virus.<eos> My God.<eos> Ice-nine.<eos> You're gonna take down the internet.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I'm going after bigger game.<eos> So. If you can manage to forget about me, I'll see to it that I forget about you.
So you think of a better one, you give me a call.<eos> Hey, what's all the hubbub about?<eos> You didn't hear?<eos> Bunch of bodies turned up in some demo'd tunnel in Queens<eos> Still trying to ID 'em all.<eos> _<eos> Serial killer.<eos> Detective Fusco.<eos> Agent LeRoux, remember?<eos> It's good to see you again.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step aside.<eos> - Why, what's going on?<eos> - Ma'am, please.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> - This will only take a moment.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Pardon, monsieur, I'm running very late.<eos> Sorry, Minister.<eos> A liaison will be down shortly to escort you upstairs.
I'm sorry.<eos> Not another word, Mr. Finch.<eos> Where the hell are you guys?<eos> The bodies I found down in those tunnels? The Feds are in on the whole thing.<eos> Call me.<eos> Moron.<eos> You just wouldn't listen, would you?<eos> Welcome to the operation center, Mr. Finch.<eos> Bonjour, Harold.<eos> We've been expecting you.
A network to reach Finch.<eos> We're gonna need a NIPRNet line to the outside.<eos> Hey, what are you doing in here?<eos> Oh, hey, yeah... we're just... we were just looking for some bad guys.<eos> We got a breach, evidence room.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Found one.<eos> We need to move now.<eos> Sorry, pal.<eos> I'm giving you the opportunity to save your Machine, which you so clearly love and loves you in return.
It's always required your permission, because it never had your trust.<eos> And you just said it, you wouldn't cede control.<eos> That tells Samaritan that only you know the password.<eos> For such a brilliant mind, you are a terrible chess player, which is why you've already lost.<eos> Two pieces trapped on a board.<eos> Despite your lessons to the Machine, the life of a pawn is not worth the same as a queen.<eos> This room is soundproofed.<eos> No microphones, no way to activate the virus.<eos> The fire suppression system will suck the oxygen from this room within seconds.<eos> Samaritan will kill you too.
This time, I don't have the option of losing.<eos> There's one other thing.<eos> After Samaritan uploads its copy to the satellite, it's going to destroy the antenna so no one can reach it.<eos> Destroy it how?<eos> It set a course for a cruise missile.<eos> I'm afraid whoever uploads my copy won't make it back alive.<eos> I need you to gather all these weapons.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Reese.<eos> Finch, what are you doing?<eos> When I hired you, I suspected you were going to be a great employee.
A real connoisseur's choice.<eos> A good friend of mine was killed with a 6.5 round.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?<eos> Shaw.<eos> Is this the guy who killed you?<eos> Killed her, I mean.<eos> Shaw.<eos> That doesn't matter right now.<eos> You need to get off this train at the next stop.<eos> They might be waiting for you.
Where the hell have you been?<eos> It's not the right time for a campaign.<eos> Not the right time, not the right time.<eos> When is the right time?<eos> - When he comes back?<eos> ! - Don't say... no, no.<eos> - Don't... don't... don't say it!<eos> - He's not coming back!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just heard you from back there.
I'm...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Except that I'm...<eos> I'm sorry for what happened to you.<eos> You're sorry for what happened to me?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> You happened to me.<eos> Your family happened to me.<eos> Did you want me to forgive you?
This city was a mob.<eos> They were after me.<eos> They were gonna get this monster no matter what, and you people lit the torches.<eos> No.<eos> Now, wait a minute...<eos> You know what I thought about, John?<eos> When I laid my cell, I thought about your boy...<eos> Your beautiful little boy.<eos> I wished I did it.<eos> I wished I took him from you and hurt him, wrapped my fingers around his throat and watch the life drip from his little body, bit by bit.
You were born this way.<eos> It's like having straight hair or curly.<eos> Blue eyes or freckles.<eos> You can't help the way you were born.<eos> I don't want to be like this.<eos> I can help you.<eos> I can help.<eos> If you just tell me what you did to Adam.<eos> I won't let them make you their monster.<eos> They're gonna sentence you to death.

I won't let them make you their monster.<eos> They're gonna sentence you to death.<eos> Wipe you away, like a stain.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> No, Hank.<eos> There's no god.<eos> 'Cause if there was, why would he make something like you?<eos> - Please...<eos> - There's only me.<eos> I'm the only one that can save you now.
My partner, my better half,<eos> Howard Inlet.<eos> Love you.<eos> Yes!<eos> What is your "why"?<eos> Why did you even get out of the bed this morning?<eos> Why did you eat what you ate?<eos> Why did you wear what you wore?<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Other than the fact that I would fire you and hire someone else if you didn't show up for work, but...
What is it?<eos> It's multiple myeloma.<eos> I fought it when I was 16, and then again when I was 25.<eos> It just never went away.<eos> Instead it regrouped and got stronger.<eos> So, the war's over?<eos> Yeah, war's over.<eos> Are your affairs in order?<eos> My affairs are not in order.<eos> That's why I hired you.
"Rage against the dying of the light.<eos> "Though wise men at their end know dark is right."<eos> Thomas.<eos> And then...<eos> Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream<eos> Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily<eos> Life is but a dream<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it!<eos> It all basically says that you're a natural part of life, we shouldn't hate you, we shouldn't fear you.

Welcome home, Prairie!<eos> That is not your name.<eos> - Prairie is not your name.<eos> - Back off.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Over here, take a right.<eos> We're so happy you're home safe.<eos> Step coming up. Step.<eos> Let us see your eyes, Prairie.<eos> - Prairie, who took you?
Oh, hey, don't I know you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm a parent.<eos> I'm sorry. I have a meeting.<eos> Uh, I think I am your meeting.<eos> I'm expecting Mr. Winchell. We've been speaking.<eos> I'm, uh, Steve's stepmother.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Well, I'm not calling this meeting to blame you or your husband.
Five people.<eos> You gave me your word.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, don't have a panic attack.<eos> Um, Mr. Winchell?<eos> - Yes, yes, Mrs...<eos> - Uh, Broderick-Allen.<eos> Yes.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't have stopped you, I don't like to talk to parents unless it's in the classroom, but I wanted to tell you, I think she's a unique woman.
She's my niece.<eos> I was really lonely then.<eos> For the first time, my blindness felt like a prison.<eos> - It was cold where I slept.<eos> I rarely spoke to anyone... except for the babies, who would come and go.<eos> Believe me, that picture doesn't do him justice.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> How can his mother not want him?<eos> She's young, a college student.<eos> No, he was meant for you.
What?<eos> I went on a walk.<eos> Your mom and I could go with you.<eos> Alone.<eos> Sometimes, I...<eos> Sometimes I just need to be alone.<eos> The last time you went out on your own, you came back with dog bites.<eos> And then this thing with Steve Winchell's teacher, and now you're hiding things from us.<eos> Look, I know that you're trying to keep me safe.<eos> And I know that I let you down.

And I know that I let you down.<eos> I... embarrassed you.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't...<eos> I can't live cooped up in this house all the time.<eos> Maybe the doctor in St. Louis was right, and we... we took you home too soon.<eos> Maybe you need time in medical care.<eos> -Please don't say that.<eos> -Professionals--<eos> Please, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry that I scared you.
Last bite, last bite.<eos> Come on, there we go, there we go.<eos> Gotta get to the bus stop, all right?<eos> Yo!<eos> What's up?<eos> - Mr. Harris?<eos> - Hi, Alfonso.<eos> This is Kevin Harris from the Knightsman Foundation.<eos> Uh, hi!<eos> It's, uh... it's nice to meet you.
Okay.<eos> -You want help to dial?<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> Okay.<eos> It just keeps ringing.<eos> They're probably on the other line.<eos> Well, we'll call them again tomorrow.<eos> We don't want 'em to worry.<eos> So... long day for you, must be tired.<eos> -Can I show you downstairs?
It's a natural spring.<eos> I just left it.<eos> Never the same river twice, as they say.<eos> And... hold on, here we are.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's a bed three steps ahead of you.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Okay.<eos> You are an incredible asset, Prairie.<eos> I'm... I'm so lucky that I met you, and to be working with you.
To exist... is to survive unfair choices.<eos> Join him.<eos> He's right outside waiting for you.<eos> How do I get back to the others?<eos> Now you know sacrifice.<eos> Now you are ready for what comes with this gift.<eos> Swallow it.<eos> It's the seed of light.<eos> If you grow it, all you need to know will be inside you.<eos> All five of you must work together as one to avert a great evil.
Because your eyes are green... clear... as honest as you are.<eos> Because I can see.<eos> I wish I'd met you sooner... so you could have known him.<eos> Me, too.<eos> - My brother Theo.<eos> - I know.<eos> Oh... Go.<eos> Yeah, go.<eos> It's important you're not late.<eos> Will you let the boys walk you to your car?
It's like... you don't really know something until your body knows it.<eos> See, Khatun had given me a gift.<eos> It was like a living riddle, alive inside my body.<eos> I could feel it in my muscles.<eos> I had told the others what we were, what he was, what I thought we had to do to break free.<eos> But a whole week passed before a clear plan began to form in our minds.<eos> There's no way to understand what he's doing to us if we don't stay awake.<eos> - We can't stay awake if we get gassed.<eos> - No way.<eos> I'm not poisoning my fuckin' lungs for you.
Stop!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Call the police.<eos> Give them that for access to the abandoned morgue.<eos> There are people there that need help.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> What do you mean "people"?<eos> I hope you know I've always thought of you, well, all of you as collaborators, but... you, most of all, I like to think of as a partner.
Like your father.<eos> You know him?<eos> I know his work.<eos> You are a poet.<eos> -No, I'm a scientist. -Hmm.<eos> That's obscure work for a scientist to know.<eos> It's part of my study.<eos> What do you study?<eos> You.<eos> And people like you.
You can't just drop a bomb like that and cut out.<eos> No, I'm gonna be late for practice again.<eos> See you guys later.<eos> Uh, French, hey...<eos> Ready for the big night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's, um, that's quite an interesting group you're sitting with.<eos> Hey, I sort of, uh, pride myself on my high school anthropology.<eos> But for the life of me...<eos> I can't imagine what the five of you have in common.
Well, you should walk her in.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Poor henpecked Abel.<eos> Did Prairie leave a note?<eos> When she disappeared, was there any note?<eos> A note?<eos> No.<eos> What...?<eos> They're coming.<eos> Good to see you again, Mr. Johnson.
I'm sure you heard what happened last night.<eos> No, what happened?<eos> Prairie woke up screaming.<eos> She's had these night terrors ever since she was a girl.<eos> Her nose bleeds and, um...<eos> it's quite terrifying for her.<eos> Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication...<eos> It didn't work.<eos> - It helped a little.<eos> - Can I stop you for a moment?
Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication...<eos> It didn't work.<eos> - It helped a little.<eos> - Can I stop you for a moment?<eos> I'm not a pharmacologist or doctor of any kind.<eos> I'm just a listener.<eos> I'm here to... help with the transition as a victim specialist.<eos> Um... you guys are victims too.<eos> I mean, you've suffered tremendously.<eos> Just making it through the day right now, it's a huge achievement for all of you.
Is it Kathy with a K?<eos> I like her.<eos> Oh, which one's Kathy with a K?<eos> Is she a senior?<eos> No, she's a junior.<eos> She's cute.<eos> Has kind of a baby nose.<eos> A baby nose?<eos> Is that a thing?<eos> I hate all of you.
Well, the last I checked, molestation is illegal in all 50 states.<eos> You were ten feet away.<eos> What the fuck do you think you saw, lady?<eos> She's nutso.<eos> You're fucking nutso.<eos> We have a job to do.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - Get in the fucking van.<eos> Get in there.<eos> Back the fuck up or we'll run you over.
- Alfonso. - What?<eos> Alfonso Sosa.<eos> You're one of the boys that she spoke to.<eos> You know her?<eos> Yeah, I know her.<eos> She tell you about the brave Homer?<eos> And... and the mine?<eos> And Hap's near-death studies?<eos> No.<eos> She told me about you.
Allen, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Geez, I've been waiting for you.
Well, how did it happen?<eos> It's obvious, a... a gas leak.<eos> In his bedroom?<eos> No, no, in the garage.<eos> We have methane and we're built on a swamp here, so...<eos> And the house explodes?<eos> No, no, the house occasionally explodes.<eos> This time it was the garage.<eos> You get used to it if you're...<eos> We haven't seen you in so long.
No, no, I need help now.<eos> I'm suicidal.<eos> Why does no one care?<eos> - I do care.<eos> - No, you don't care.<eos> Look, I do care.<eos> I care very much.<eos> Let's go in, we'll have our session, and we'll talk about it okay?<eos> - We had an appointment.<eos> - I'm waiting for you here.

Let's go in, we'll have our session, and we'll talk about it okay?<eos> - We had an appointment.<eos> - I'm waiting for you here.<eos> - I'm waiting for you here.<eos> - We're the ones who had an appointment.<eos> I'm going to go in with you, and then we'll have a session.<eos> Just a second.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Let me reschedule you.
- I'm waiting for you here.<eos> - I'm waiting for you here.<eos> - We're the ones who had an appointment.<eos> I'm going to go in with you, and then we'll have a session.<eos> Just a second.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Let me reschedule you.<eos> Hello.<eos> I didn't expect you.
Did you hear this guy?<eos> The police have been following them, they...<eos> Is something illegal going on here?<eos> That's a very good question you ask.<eos> Oh, look, girls!<eos> Are, are you Black Panthers?<eos> Girls, real Black Panthers!<eos> We are with the Constitutional Liberation Party.<eos> How exciting.<eos> Which one of you is Abbie Hoffman?
The trunk?<eos> The, the, the trunk of my car?<eos> Yeah, where you heading so fast, huh?<eos> I, I, I'm, I gotta catch a plane.<eos> Yeah, well, there's no airports around here.<eos> Yeah, I was gonna take a private to the airport.<eos> Well, you know, shouldn't be driving without a license.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I've never done that before.<eos> Have I seen you somewhere, huh?
Who's not giving me a ticket even though I was driving like a lunatic.<eos> Okay, I can't do it all, Mike.<eos> I'll just say "My good friend trooper Mike.<eos> "God bless you", and... "S. J. Muntzinger."<eos> Wow, what a pleasure.<eos> I really, I appreciate it.<eos> It's a real pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - I mean, what a thrill.<eos> Thank you, you too, God bless you, Mike.
That's amazing.<eos> What is going on with that wreath?<eos> Where'd you guys get that, at a gas station?<eos> They were selling wreaths and Christmas trees at the Target.<eos> Well, let me tell you something, man.<eos> That is a substandard wreath.<eos> I'm making my own.<eos> I've already picked out the holly stocks.<eos> I'm drying the orange slices.<eos> Telling you right now, it's gonna be like a botanical centrifuge.
That is a substandard wreath.<eos> I'm making my own.<eos> I've already picked out the holly stocks.<eos> I'm drying the orange slices.<eos> Telling you right now, it's gonna be like a botanical centrifuge.<eos> Gonna be awesome.<eos> All right, throw me one.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Love you, Dad!<eos> - Love you.
But that's enough about me.<eos> Tell me what's going on in the DuFresne family.<eos> Oh, you know, it's... it's just all the usual stuff.<eos> Oh, she's out.<eos> I should put her to bed.<eos> And I'm not far behind myself.<eos> Come on.<eos> You, too.<eos> Good night, kids.<eos> I love you.
Sorry about Hec.<eos> He's a silly old goat, that's all.<eos> OK, well, I hope you like your room, petal.<eos> They said you liked to read, so I got a bunch of books for you, and you'll also notice an Indian lamp, a bulldog lamp, and some cats, and a nice sharp knife to kill monsters in the night.<eos> I can't imagine what you've been through, boy.<eos> You know, I can't imagine it was easy.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> This is home.<eos> Anyway, (SIGHS) it's really nice to have you here, and I left a hottie in your bed.<eos> We'll see you in the morning.
Yeah.<eos> Heaps.<eos> Just like us.<eos> Walking, walking, trying to get somewhere.<eos> Looking for a better home.<eos> Gidday.<eos> Gidday.<eos> Jeez, eh. Whoo.<eos> Got a lot of explaining to do.<eos> A lot of people looking for you two.
Looking for a better home.<eos> Gidday.<eos> Gidday.<eos> Jeez, eh. Whoo.<eos> Got a lot of explaining to do.<eos> A lot of people looking for you two.<eos> Yeah, we know.<eos> I did my ankle back in one of the valleys.<eos> And, uh, we're on the way out now.<eos> Well,... wait till they hear we caught you in a hut.
Bro.<eos> I love you, Ricky. (CHUCKLES)<eos> DOOR CLOSES<eos> (STRUMS GUITAR)<eos> Why are you on the run?<eos> Don't you want a normal life?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You fullas could come live here.<eos> They'll never find you.
Yeah.<eos> Is it a man or a bush?<eos> Bush!<eos> Man!<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> Bushman!<eos> (LAUGHS MANIACALLY)<eos> Ah!<eos> Hello.<eos> I was hoping to run into you two.
Ah!<eos> Hello.<eos> I was hoping to run into you two.<eos> Well, if you're after the reward, you can bugger off.<eos> We're dangerous.<eos> Yeah, we're dangerous.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> I heard about that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not going to capture you.
(CACKLES) Come on.<eos> RADIO CRACKLES<eos> LOUD CLICKING<eos> Bikkie?<eos> (BLOWS)<eos> WHISPERS:<eos> Why do you reckon he calls himself Psycho Sam?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Put these on.<eos> Stop the Government from tracking you.
Just pretend to be dead.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> It only works if we all do it.<eos> For Christ's sake, Sam, pull yourself together.<eos> We need to get out of here right now.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Crumpy!<eos> What?<eos> Crumpy will take you!
PAULA YELLS<eos> I've got him!<eos> I've got the package!<eos> Well done, everybody!<eos> Now let's get this precious child out of here!<eos> I'm sorry, Uncle. No!<eos> I'm not your bloody uncle.<eos> I didn't mean to!<eos> Hector Faulkner, you are under arrest.<eos> Whatever you do or say will be used against you in a court of law!
And his guitar playing, mediocre at best.<eos> Come on, they're not technicians.<eos> I mean, playing ain't the focus of their vibe.<eos> No, even for them, he's mediocre.<eos> Take all of this and shove it up your sagging fuckhole.<eos> JAMIE: You signed the band.<eos> What did you think you were getting?<eos> Him and a couple of other guys.<eos> See, this is what happens when a label picks you up.<eos> We groom you, we work with you, we turn you into something that might actually have a life.
I'll work with Duck.<eos> He'll step up.<eos> He says because of his vast experience developing bands.<eos> You want to shrink the group?<eos> Is that 'cause your label's run out of money?<eos> Is that it? You haven't got enough to pay us?<eos> You know who Frank Barsalona is?<eos> He runs Premier Talent. Best booking agency in town.<eos> He's also a friend.<eos> And because he's my friend, he's booking you to open for the New York Dolls next month at the Academy.
Jackie Jervis took him out again Tuesday night. Hannibal likes his PR gal.<eos> Andrea?<eos> I taught her everything she knows.<eos> She says she can cross him over, that you're ghettoizing him in the soul market.<eos> If that twat used the word ghettoizing, I'll kill her.<eos> She had all sorts of ideas, Richie.<eos> You were there.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I'm telling you now.<eos> You think I could take you and your little boyfriend out to eat tonight?
Probably.<eos> Then you should do that, 'cause I'm afraid this ain't working out.<eos> You fucking firing me?<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> -l'm just the messenger.<eos> - Kip put you up to this?<eos> - No, this is above Kip.<eos> - Goes all the way up the flagpole.<eos> - But why? You're not in a rec room anymore.<eos> At this level, they are taking pictures. They are paying money to put you up in front of a crowd.
Blend in with the sky, right?<eos> Harder a plane is to see, the harder it is to shoot down.<eos> Are you flying over Da Nang?<eos> I can't keep up.<eos> Detroit, Boston, Ontario. And that was just last weekend.<eos> Having three albums in the top 10 is like juggling cats.<eos> But the work, right?<eos> Keeps us hungry.<eos> You're gonna bounce back.<eos> A few more years, I'll be buying a 747 off of you.
Yes, everything is fine.<eos> I don't understand your implication.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> It's probably the headlight on my car, it's broken, right?<eos> I know this, so you don't have to come out now.<eos> No, not at 4:30 in the morning.<eos> They're very dedicated.<eos> Yeah, but what makes you think someone is here?<eos> I mean, if, in fact, you think someone is here.<eos> We don't mean to disorient you, all right?
- Yes.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Elizabeth.<eos> Oh, this is our little girl Priscilla.<eos> So you're not alone.<eos> Our daughter doesn't count.<eos> She was a cesarean.<eos> She looks so familiar.<eos> Yes, to us too.<eos> She doesn't look like either of you.
I'm so nervous.<eos> Hello?<eos> No, no, not necessary to send anybody over.<eos> I hit the wrong button on the alarm.<eos> We don't need a repairman.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But... but thank you for the concern.<eos> No, everything's fine.<eos> Yes, God bless, God bless you.
- And I admitted it. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Those encounters excited me, and to get into bed with my wife no longer did.<eos> Did you ever hear of such a thing?<eos> Go on.<eos> So we came to you.<eos> You listened to us, and you said,<eos> "Why don't you just pay your wife?"<eos> I should charge him, he should pay me, and the same dynamic will exist.<eos> Well, it seemed like a very good idea.<eos> He needs to think of you as a whore, so why not charge him?
Yeah, well, I don't want to walk the walk or shoot the shooter, bomb the bomb.<eos> Okay, so you're going straight to Manhattan, right?<eos> Right, right, right, and I think I have...<eos> I'm sure I have all your instructions just right.<eos> Don't worry about a thing.<eos> I can't thank you enough for doing this.<eos> Well, life is complicated.<eos> Life is complicated.<eos> I've already... you know.<eos> It's so dangerous for you and Sid, me staying here, and now you're doing this for me.
It's not money.<eos> It's a commitment to reach the highest levels of fulfillment.<eos> - Raina.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I thought you weren't coming.<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> See you.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you think you discovered where we went wrong?<eos> You think you can do it better than the agents that came before you?
- Hey.<eos> I thought you weren't coming.<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> See you.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you think you discovered where we went wrong?<eos> You think you can do it better than the agents that came before you?<eos> Good, because you're going to get the chance.<eos> You're going to trial to present your case and test your theory in cross-examination.<eos> Remember, the defense... us... will be gunning for you.
All these cases... the charges didn't stick because the agents slipped up on their investigation, right?<eos> Yeah, the smallest mistakes usually have the biggest consequences.<eos> When you work an airtight case, you don't even talk to the suspects.<eos> You talk to their lawyers when they plead out.<eos> Right, but things do go wrong.<eos> Only in days that end in "Y."<eos> Is that what happened in Chicago?<eos> This is about Ryan.<eos> And about you.<eos> I never got the full story from either of you.
You think she's crazy, but you also know she may be right.<eos> Does what you did to Raina not haunt you?<eos> We're all haunted... by something.<eos> Trainee Perales, did you entrap my client?<eos> Define "entrapment," Agent O'Connor.<eos> To induce someone to commit a criminal act they would otherwise be unlikely to commit.<eos> So by that definition, entrapment would include, say, an agent buying a prostitute for a suspect they knew were a violent sex offender?<eos> Or an agent giving a broke kid $100,000 to carry a backpack across town?<eos> Yes.<eos> And what about you, in Chicago?
Did you give someone our phone number?<eos> - My son. - For emergencies.<eos> - Yes? - Where the hell are you?<eos> - I'm working.<eos> - Is everything all right, honey?<eos> Honey? Do you have any idea what's going on out here?<eos> - No.<eos> What's wrong? - The whole damn bloc is being blown up because of what you did.<eos> Now where are you?<eos> You need to call your father, have him take you and Gracie and Hudson and go up to the Green Zone.
I'm Jennifer McMahon.<eos> Follow me.<eos> This is your ID.<eos> Wear it around your neck at all times.<eos> Had a badge before.<eos> Not like this one.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> So what are you, SWAT?<eos> I mine data from the insurgency and look for ways to exploit it.<eos> How exactly did they rope you into doing that?
Don't lose it.<eos> So what are you, SWAT?<eos> I mine data from the insurgency and look for ways to exploit it.<eos> How exactly did they rope you into doing that?<eos> I volunteered.<eos> Yeah, when I was surrounded by Redhats I volunteered, too.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> If you're gonna work for me, you're gonna need to laugh once in a while.<eos> At least smile.<eos> Work for you?
I thought you were my friend.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> Don't disrespect that word.<eos> It means something to me.<eos> If I didn't take this job, they were gonna send me and my family to The Factory.<eos> And what about my family?<eos> Lucia and Mateo were in the trailer when the garage got hit.<eos> I'm gonna find out what happened to them, and then I'm gonna get you out of here.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> I had a good feeling about you.
We have to find Lucia and Mateo.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, I'm so sorry.<eos> But I saw Carlos.<eos> He's okay.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - He's with Homeland Security.<eos> What's gonna happen to him?<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> But first, we gotta get you out of here, okay?
No, I'm good.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let him through, he's good.<eos> He's clear. Let him go.<eos> Jesus, what kind of ID did they give you?<eos> The orange line has been reopened after maintenance.<eos> And now back to the classical hour.<eos> Here's some Mozart.<eos> Aha, welcome, my friends.<eos> It's good to see you.
So what do you need?<eos> IDs.<eos> Woman and child.<eos> Latino.<eos> These folks are awful important to us, Sirak.<eos> What's this?<eos> When the Red Hats remove photographs from the memorial walls, sometimes a little mouse finds them and brings them to me.<eos> It's easier to create an identity from a real person.<eos> It's the next evolution.<eos> A step beyond what I was able to do for you and your family.
No, I just wanted to get you something.<eos> Thanks.<eos> These are Sennheisers.<eos> How'd you get them?<eos> Let's just say I have a source.<eos> I can't take these, Pia.<eos> They're super expensive.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Remember, this is only temporary.<eos> As soon as your new IDs are uploaded into the system, we can move you somewhere on the grid.
What's your stake in all this?<eos> In my world, there are a lot of competing theories on governance.<eos> I believe that the softer hand is more effective.<eos> No one can change our present situation, it's immovable, so instead, everyone needs to try to appreciate the good things.<eos> The city is cleaner and safer than it's ever been.<eos> There's no worry of terrorism or unemployment.<eos> You can even catch a bus and go from anywhere to anywhere in 20 minutes.<eos> Bringing back places like this is one of the ways we give everyone something to put their energy into.<eos> That's good for me.<eos> It's good for you.
Though I do teach spin in Westport.<eos> And also yoga.<eos> The itinerary said that the orientation was supposed to start like 10 minutes ago.<eos> Oh, do you think maybe we should be<eos> - someplace else?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Who here is waiting for someone to tell them what to do?<eos> You just said that.<eos> Because orientation was supposed to start 10 minutes ago...<eos> - Mm-hmm. - ...and none of you said anything.
So nice.<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Thank you for forcing me to eat this because I feel like my mouth is experiencing intense personal growth.<eos> So, it actually is... that's "umami,"<eos> - the elusive fifth taste. - Mm.<eos> She has become so knowledgeable in so short time.<eos> You guys are the cutest.<eos> I want to watch a reality show about you called, like,
You're letting him live. Word will spread.<eos> They'll know this is you.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> _<eos> "Declan Harp then bound the three soldiers and began torturing them.<eos> He cut off most of their skin, removed their fingers, disemboweled them, and while they still lived, removed their genitals.<eos> Once he was finished, he executed 'em.<eos> He made off with the entire cache of pelts from the outpost as well 12 kegs of gunpowder, sixteen muskets, and two weeks worth of provisions."<eos> Impressive.<eos> That's high praise indeed, coming from you, Lord Benton.
What we got here, then?<eos> You dirty bugger!<eos> Been down here all this time, have ya? !<eos> Eating my biscuits?<eos> !<eos> All hands on deck!<eos> All hands on deck!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Someone among you has taken something that belongs to me.
I'll send word the next ship back.<eos> She'll be released.<eos> And the cook's boy, he goes free as well.<eos> - Don't push it.<eos> - Done.<eos> This Declan Harp, how will I find him exactly?<eos> We have a guide at Fort James who can take you into the wilderness.<eos> Let it be known that you're Irish and looking for your countryman.<eos> Spread that about and the chances are Harp will find you.<eos> I won't let you down, sir.
Are you really a priest?<eos> The boy then ran off, disappeared into the crowd.<eos> And you witnessed the entire incident?<eos> - And he didn't kill our man?<eos> - No, it was a frontiersman.<eos> I didn't see his face.<eos> The boy's entirely innocent of the crime, that one, at least.<eos> Well, thank you for coming to us.<eos> It's my duty, Milord.<eos> Clearly the boy has value to you?
Three soldiers.<eos> Why were you with English soldiers?<eos> I had nothing to do with those hateful pigs.<eos> Their leader threatened to kill me.<eos> I, I just want to be paid as per my contract with young Michael here and I'll be on my way.<eos> You're not going anywhere, priest.<eos> The soldiers found us wandering in the wilderness, lost.<eos> They were gonna take us back to the fort.<eos> And why were you wandering in the wilderness?<eos> I was looking for you.
I was looking for you.<eos> I want to make my fortune in the fur trade and I hear you're the man to help me do it.<eos> You're gonna have to do better than that, lad.<eos> Why are you with this... Priest?<eos> I hired him as my guide but... but I learned he was lying to me<eos> - and had no intention of helping me.<eos> - No, Michael, that is not completely true.<eos> Mr. Harp, I am a man of many contacts.<eos> Many of them are great suppliers of fur.<eos> I could easily connect you to them upon my return to civilization, of course.
What time is it?<eos> 5:50.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Take it easy there, fella.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't clean up after your dog.<eos> Yeah, I forgot the bag today.<eos> Oh, I don't think so because, you know, it's not just the statutory law, it's the law of civility, man.<eos> And I've seen you before.
Second option... Buy the publishing company and kill it.<eos> That's too loud, I think.<eos> Agreed.<eos> The third choice...<eos> I could go and try and reason with her.<eos> No, I reasoned with that twat once before.<eos> I have ways to get her attention. I have ways to get her attention.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm in the 8:15 with Steffi.<eos> Um, I don't have you on my list.
Previously on 12 Monkeys... - James Cole.<eos> - Where's the virus?<eos> The plague. It is coming.<eos> They're using Leland's daughter.<eos> Jennifer!<eos> I can protect you now.
They've been chasing us ever since.<eos> This is it, up here.<eos> Security will be here soon.<eos> All the people this would've killed.<eos> Billions.<eos> Let's get it out.<eos> Don't just stand there. Help us.<eos> You know what this means for me if it works?<eos> It'll erase my son.<eos> I can't stop you.
Our agreement was made to protect the integrity of our timeline.<eos> You... the future you... and Cassie, you're gonna make a mistake.<eos> You're gonna hurt someone.<eos> A friend.<eos> I cannot know these things.<eos> It's the Emerson Hotel.<eos> Remember to come back and get me. Very well, you told me.<eos> So you are still there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, then that's either because I'm unable to bring you back or I'm choosing not to.
You know, like a kiss.<eos> You just have to close your eyes and let the world die.<eos> You can be with him.<eos> No.<eos> Sir, we need to speak with you.<eos> He found you.<eos> Mr. Cole?<eos> Sir?<eos> James Cole!<eos> My apologies, Mr. Cole, but we have you in the wrong room.
This particular suite was purchased in perpetuity in 1944 by a Mr. James Cole.<eos> Every year when I was a kid, my father would send me in here to dust.<eos> Always a day after Easter.<eos> Spring cleaning, he called it.<eos> Yeah, we... we decided to keep everything as-is, you know, like a museum.<eos> I still like to look at the old pictures.<eos> You know?<eos> Was he your grandfather, sir?<eos> Because you look just like him.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it, Mr. Cole.
You take people to the toilet?<eos> - Yes. Sure.<eos> - One and two? For numbers one and two?<eos> - Yeah. - See?<eos> You can't do that. You can barely wipe your own butt.<eos> Look, this is a serious matter, Chip.<eos> 'Cause we need to employ Roy, okay?<eos> Because if she relies on us, she's gonna die, and she's gonna take us with her.<eos> And I don't feel like going to heaven right now.<eos> You're hired, and we'll see you on Monday. Okay?
Don't fuck it up.<eos> I know.<eos> - There he is!<eos> - Hey!<eos> There he is!<eos> Kill 'em all, baby!<eos> - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah, kill 'em all!<eos> Axe!<eos> Fuck, fellas.<eos> It is good to see you.
Were you in the proffer on Axelrod this morning?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Who was it with?<eos> Are they signing up a cooperator?<eos> I could get a jump on the release.<eos> You'll find out when it's time to find out.<eos> Of course.<eos> So, what happened on the plane, man?<eos> Oh, nothing I'm bothering you with.
How are you sure?<eos> She knows.<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Hey, Garth.<eos> What's up, brother?<eos> Hey, I'm not in the office today, but believe me, I'm all over this thing.<eos> Sounds like you at the end of the goddamn world.<eos> Listen.<eos> I got people asking why the hell you've drifted non-compliant.<eos> Well, we notified you as a courtesy.
Previously on "Agent Carter"...<eos> This was found in deposit box 143.<eos> Why did you want it?<eos> We both know there are currencies stronger than money.<eos> Miss Carter, since our last adventure,<eos> I'm exhaustively bored.<eos> Allow me to drive you around.
There's another one at Isodyne Energy.<eos> - Here's my business card.<eos> - Thank you, doctor...<eos> Wilkes.<eos> Calvin Chadwick.<eos> And his wife, Whitney Frost.<eos> I clean up other people's messes.<eos> We can work this out.<eos> They're not gonna let us.<eos> I want to thank you properly for saving my life.
How many butlers can say that?<eos> Here.<eos> Try to take me down.<eos> N-no, no, I don't think...<eos> Please, Miss Carter, I am quite prepared for you.<eos> Oh! - Mm.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Don't be shy!<eos> - Mr. Jarvis, I really wouldn't do that if I...<eos> I shan't hurt you too badly.
- Really?<eos> - Don't be shy!<eos> - Mr. Jarvis, I really wouldn't do that if I...<eos> I shan't hurt you too badly.<eos> I really don't think you want to do that, Mr. Jarvis.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, would you...<eos> I learned that one from my brother.<eos> Whoa! Mr. Jarvis!<eos> Good morning, you two.<eos> Did he catch you with his patented tortoise of fury?
It'll be fun.<eos> Besides, you heard Violet.<eos> If you don't show, she'll throttle me.<eos> All right.<eos> Um, we've sent our men to pick up the body of Jane Scott from the morgue.<eos> It should be here by midday.<eos> We need our scientists to identify the mysterious substance that killed her if we're gonna get anywhere on the case.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Cookie?<eos> Ah. Chadwick, good to see you.
Just don't want you to embarrass me.<eos> Oh. - Oh, wait.<eos> - Oh, whoops.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Thanks, I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> - It's very beautiful.<eos> - I didn't mean for you...
Oh, very dull, then.<eos> Well, he's rather amusing, actually.<eos> He's a genius, absolutely.<eos> A bit odd.<eos> He's very interesting.<eos> It's nice to interact with someone outside the SSR.<eos> It's been a long time since... um, sorry.<eos> Uh, what were you saying?<eos> This will be perfect.<eos> I do wish you'd allow me to drive you, Miss Carter.
Sorry.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> You look... great.<eos> I thought tonight called for something more than my nurse's whites.<eos> Who's that clown?<eos> Someone learning a hard lesson in rejection.<eos> Have a good night, Rose.<eos> Auerbach Theatrical Agency.<eos> Wait.<eos> Mr. Auerbach, call for you.
He may be a jerk, but this éclair ain't half bad.<eos> Next time, we do things my way.<eos> A quick jab to the right eye will adjust his attitude tremendously.<eos> Won't get us anywhere.<eos> Besides, it's not like he's a rare specimen.<eos> You gonna punch all of L.A.?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I could do with a hobby.<eos> I'd start with the guys with the guns that just tried to kill us.<eos> Tried to kill you, Dr. Wilkes.
Okay.<eos> We're done here.<eos> How about you get some rest?<eos> Th-there's still so much to process.<eos> Peggy...<eos> You're going home.<eos> Okay?<eos> Miss Carter...<eos> I'm immensely relieved that you're unharmed.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, can I trouble you for a ride home?
What do you say? Arlene French called in drunk.<eos> You want to play a sassy beer wench?<eos> - I'd rather be the cowboy.<eos> - I like it. I don't think the audience is ready yet.<eos> But they're ready for a movie based on a comic book.<eos> Sounds like a dreadful idea.<eos> I'll have you know, this is a historical drama.<eos> Kid Colt was a real person.<eos> And if it fails, there will be a substantial write-off come tax season.<eos> Sorry I missed you last night.
For L.A.'s silver spoon crowd since 1906.<eos> The influential, the powerful, the reptilia and the rodentia.<eos> The Arena Club is where they all congregate.<eos> They've been trying unsuccessfully to recruit Mr. Stark for years.<eos> I'm not a joiner.<eos> - Women aren't allowed.<eos> - Well, there's that, too.<eos> That pin belonged to one of the men that tried to kill me last night, and Dottie Underwood tried to steal one just like it back in New York.<eos> Who is Dottie Underwood?<eos> She kidnapped you.
And you'll have complications pulling that off.<eos> My plan will have enough jazz for your liking, and believe me... You won't be bored.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who's a good boy?<eos> - Hey. - Howard's a good boy.<eos> Give that back.<eos> Uh, just a second.<eos> - Chief?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Someone here to see you.
Come on.<eos> Who's a good boy?<eos> - Hey. - Howard's a good boy.<eos> Give that back.<eos> Uh, just a second.<eos> - Chief?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> Vernon!<eos> It's good to see you.
Heaven help us.<eos> Brown... heaven help us, indeed.<eos> Our members' median income hovers around...<eos> Excuse me, Terry.<eos> Torrance.<eos> Yeah. That Martini... It's been about five minutes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, how many more minutes before I get it?<eos> Perhaps I could render your busy bartender some assistance.<eos> I assure you, Leopold is quite capable...
I think I might've been a little bit harsh on this place.<eos> You're not half bad.<eos> Mr. Stark, it's time to go.<eos> Actually, your club's terrible, and I'm never coming back.<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> Let's go back to my pool and play watergiggles.<eos> This is a private club... in America.<eos> You need a search warrant, probable cause.<eos> What part of "this case is closed"<eos> was unclear to you, Carter?
And it's Agent Carter, isn't it?<eos> Yes, we met at the racetrack, but we were never properly introduced.<eos> I must admit, I was a little star struck.<eos> I've never met a famous movie star before.<eos> Oh, please. We're just like everybody else.<eos> We put our pearls on one strand at a time.<eos> And they are just letting anyone waltz onto the studio lot these days.<eos> I find being polite and asking nicely opens many doors.<eos> Oh, I'm sure it does.<eos> Actually, I wanted to ask you about the incident at Isodyne.
Did you know he was a Communist?<eos> I can't say that I did.<eos> I guess he fooled all of us.<eos> Isn't it incredible to think one of them could just infiltrate a secure lab?<eos> What do you know of Isodyne's work?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> The thought of my husband's work gives me a terrible migraine.<eos> But you were there the night of the explosion.<eos> A security guard saw you at the lab just before the accident.
Finding facts isn't always their top priority.<eos> Truer words, Agent Carter.<eos> You know, last week, the press said that I was involved in a torrid love affair with Cary Grant.<eos> I should be so lucky.<eos> Well, that's why I trust my instincts.<eos> They're more reliable than what I'm told to believe.<eos> And what are your instincts telling you now?<eos> That things aren't what they seem.<eos> Yes.<eos> Miss Frost, we're ready for you, sweetheart.
I'm turning in for the evening, Miss Carter. Good night.<eos> Good night, Mr. Jarvis.<eos> Are you certain it's such a good idea to be exercising this late at night?<eos> I find an evening workout is the best way to release the frustrations of a given day.<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> I'm sorry you found the day so disheartening.<eos> Is there anything I might do to help?<eos> Nothing... Comes to mind.<eos> If you need a sparring partner...<eos> I'm sure Mr. Stark would be more than happy to hire one for you.
Oh, don't be a ninny.<eos> You need us. And we need you.<eos> If Whitney Frost is an expert on zero matter, as she claims, you're our best asset against her.<eos> Miss Carter...<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Peggy, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad you saw reason.<eos> No, I didn't see reason.<eos> I still think I'm putting all of you in danger.
What we're looking at is a design for a fast-neutron reactor.<eos> They built one like it in Los Alamos last year, which at full power could generate 25 kilowatts.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> Three years before that, Agnes Cully... or, as we know her, Whitney Frost... patented this reactor that can theoretically generate a thousand times more power.<eos> So she's a genius.<eos> I'm a genius.<eos> Whitney Frost... she defies categorization.<eos> It's open.<eos> Miss Frost?<eos> A package has just arrived for you.
Thank you.<eos> Oh!<eos> That's it, Hunt!<eos> Time's up! I'm gonna come in and start squirting lead!<eos> ohh! Remember me, Mr. Hunt?<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake.<eos> That's enough to take down a rhinoceros.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, are you all right?<eos> Marvelous!<eos> Ah. Chief Sousa, what brings you here?
Field work?<eos> But they don't send women into the field.<eos> Resistance networks all over Europe need people who won't draw attention walking down the street.<eos> They need women.<eos> And they're recruiting you.<eos> Why?<eos> That is...<eos> Why me?<eos> Well, you're already an exceptional codebreaker, Miss Carter.<eos> Someone must see a great deal of potential in you.
The Wall Street guy.<eos> Hugh Jones.<eos> Roxxon.<eos> I've had the pleasure. Give me the antidote... now.<eos> Not until we finish our conversation.<eos> - Then you'll be clear and free to do as...<eos> - Free? I'll never be free again, not after this.<eos> This stuff's gonna buy me a couple of days.<eos> You can get out of town, run.<eos> Or the SSR can protect you.
Well, let's start by putting these shotguns away. They're making this situation a bit more tense than it needs to be.<eos> Sir, we're about to conduct a raid on the Arena l...<eos> Let's put that on the back burner. The war department has decided to audit this branch's cases, past and present.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> Peggy...<eos> It's an Executive Order. Came straight from D.C.<eos> So, if you'll just crack open your files, we'll get to work, and I'm sure this will all be done in no time.<eos> Chief, would you mind showing my men around?<eos> Guys.<eos> After you.
Chief, would you mind showing my men around?<eos> Guys.<eos> After you.<eos> And you... Must be the Agent Carter that I keep hearing so much about.<eos> Have I been dying to talk to you.<eos> We have credible information implicating members of the Arena Club in a conspiracy that involves numerous murders and experimental work in a highly dangerous substance.<eos> There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law, even on those who believe they are above it.<eos> How are you enjoying your vacation, Agent Carter?<eos> Vigorously.<eos> Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you.
Accounting, eh?<eos> Those fellas are dull as dishwater.<eos> But they certainly have an eye for talent.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I have to go to lunch.<eos> When I come back, I'll send for you, and we can crunch some numbers.<eos> I look forward to it. ?<eos> You arrogant plonker.<eos> Agent.<eos> I remember you!
You better hurry.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> But stay close.<eos> I think your work will need some special attention when I get back.<eos> Agent!<eos> Oh, crumbs.<eos> He's wearing it.<eos> Oh, what's your name, darling?<eos> I heard a rumor ? about redheaded women...<eos> Did the boys from sales send you?
He's wearing it.<eos> Oh, what's your name, darling?<eos> I heard a rumor ? about redheaded women...<eos> Did the boys from sales send you?<eos> You're saving the world.<eos> You are saving the world.<eos> You are saving the world.<eos> Did you have a nice lunch?<eos> I must have.<eos> Mr. Manfredi, ? there's someone to see you.
Are we sure the SSR isn't an option?<eos> The council has their hands in everything.<eos> There's no one we could trust 100%.<eos> Actually... That isn't entirely true.<eos> Rose?<eos> She's someone we can trust.<eos> Peggy, this is crazy.<eos> We... we can't take Rose.<eos> She's... she's...<eos> She's passed the same training as the men upstairs, and she protects all of you.
After the war, I had 11 job offers.<eos> 11.<eos> I went with the SSR because I was told I had an opportunity to use my expertise in field operations.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> You did, Chief Sousa.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> That hurts me... right here.<eos> Listen, I interviewed a lot of prospects.<eos> But you picked me.<eos> And I picked you because I thought I'd be doing more ? than tinkering around this lab while other agents went off on missions.
Great work.<eos> For the record that was nothing like baking a soufflé.<eos> Get them and the uranium to the truck.<eos> If I'm not back with Peggy in 10 minutes, leave without us.<eos> Yes, chief.<eos> Come on.<eos> We got the rods.<eos> You interfering...<eos> Last chance, Miss Frost.<eos> Same to you, Agent Carter.
I serve the federal government.<eos> Oh, yes. My mistake.<eos> When he's elected senator, Chadwick and I will work together... To protect this country.<eos> Well, I find that hard to believe.<eos> Thanks for the input.<eos> I'll be sure to forget it as soon as you're out of my sight.<eos> One final word of advice.<eos> I know you fancy yourself a political animal, but you are decidedly out of your depth, Chief Thompson...<eos> And these waters are full of sharks.<eos> Some advice for you.
One final word of advice.<eos> I know you fancy yourself a political animal, but you are decidedly out of your depth, Chief Thompson...<eos> And these waters are full of sharks.<eos> Some advice for you.<eos> A little baking soda will help get the stains out when you're doing Stark's laundry.<eos> Well, everybody knows that.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> I am such a klutz.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I didn't stick you, did I?
This is not about energy.<eos> This is about power...<eos> The kind of power that could bring the world to its knees.<eos> But why tell you...<eos> When I can show you?<eos> Observe.<eos> I-I must say, uh, we all thought you were going crazy, but thank you for bringing this to our attention.<eos> I believe we're all in agreement on how to proceed.<eos> Darling, you were perfect.<eos> Do not let her touch you!
Mr. Jones, I need unrestricted access to all Roxxon facilities.<eos> Um... yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm also gonna need you to speak to Vernon masters, bring him up to speed on this administrative overhaul.<eos> Will that be a problem?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Hayes, I'm gonna need your publications to fabricate a story on the sudden disappearance of my husband and those other pasty buffoons.<eos> Yes, Miss Frost.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I have chosen you to be a part of my Council because I believe that each of you can contribute to my plans.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I have chosen you to be a part of my Council because I believe that each of you can contribute to my plans.<eos> And I promise you, as long as you remain loyal and of use to me, I will bring you unlimited power unlike anything this world has every seen.<eos> I have something to say.<eos> Yes, Mr. Jones?<eos> I'm very excited about this collaboration, and I look forward to seeing where your leadership takes us, Miss Frost.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Jones.<eos> Meeting adjourned.<eos> I have broken away from Chief Thompson, but he is overtly suspicious of my presence and on high alert for you, Miss Carter.
It's fine. It's all right.<eos> N-no, it isn't.<eos> You were happy out here, and then I came and mucked up your whole life.<eos> Maybe I was just fooling myself.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Truly.<eos> Miss Carter? Hello? Hello?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Miss Underwood.<eos> Nice to see you again.
The only way to fight leverage is with leverage.<eos> Dig something up on her.<eos> Everybody's got secrets.<eos> Carter's a girl scout.<eos> If you can't find a way to take her down...<eos> Then I have to question whether you're suited for high command in this government.<eos> There is no question, sir.<eos> I can't tell you how relieved I am to see this.<eos> This could save my life.<eos> I-I can't thank you enough.
Anything?<eos> No signal from Miss Underwood's necklace.<eos> It could've been deactivated or destroyed.<eos> Or she could be out of range.<eos> Perhaps we could expand the signal.<eos> Can you get us to a higher elevation?<eos> I believe Mr. Stark has a dirigible in the pool house.<eos> Why?<eos> She's a Russian spy, a murderer.<eos> Why mount a rescue for someone who'd kill you the moment she was able?
Do you lose all mass?<eos> Where do you go if you're no longer contained?<eos> Listen to me, chattering away.<eos> I didn't come here to talk.<eos> Your friend stole something from me, and I need to take it back.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Dr. Wilkes.<eos> Stop!<eos> You are full of surprises, doctor.<eos> I've never seen you like this before.
That stung a little.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Well, do you feel different?<eos> Stronger?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> You are stronger, Dr. Wilkes.<eos> You don't need that contraption at all.<eos> But it doesn't last, does it?<eos> That machine was designed to contain zero matter, which contains you.
We can help each other understand it.<eos> We can help each other control it.<eos> You can't control it.<eos> No one can.<eos> It's a force of destruction.<eos> Look at what it's done to me, to you.<eos> We can change the world.<eos> The world's just fine as it is.<eos> Is it?<eos> Do you... do you really believe that Isodyne recruited you because they valued your brilliant mind?
I'll be right there.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Stand him up!<eos> You want to be a hero, huh?<eos> Let him go!<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> We're not monsters.<eos> I don't think this concerns you.
No, no.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> We're not monsters.<eos> I don't think this concerns you.<eos> He will die if you take him.<eos> He needs...<eos> He needs answers.<eos> And I'm gonna help him get those.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> She won't stop coming for you.
Of course.<eos> But it wasn't set for you.<eos> Jason.<eos> Ana.<eos> We can help each other control it.<eos> You can't control it.<eos> You get what you need, sweetheart?<eos> Not everything.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> She won't stop coming for you.
But I wanted to see what else I could get.<eos> Mm.<eos> I'm going to get you the physician.<eos> First...<eos> Now doctor.<eos> Yes, she is awake and talking and beautiful and everything.<eos> Yes, yes, I will keep you updated.<eos> And, Miss Carter...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Doctor, I want to thank you and your staff for everything that you've done for us.
Excuse...<eos> He was gonna shoot you.<eos> - Yes, he was.<eos> - And I was supposed to just let it happen?<eos> "Dispassionate," Chief.<eos> Your word.<eos> So if the situation was reversed, that's what you would've done?<eos> Let him shoot me?<eos> If it makes a difference...<eos> I'd have let him blow you both away.
Turn around.<eos> Arms.<eos> All persons entering the Green Zone are subject to search.<eos> Remain in line at all times and proceed through the gate when instructed.<eos> Let's go, grab a bag.<eos> Move along.<eos> You-- next.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lucky day.<eos> Administrative pull for you.
Move along.<eos> You-- next.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lucky day.<eos> Administrative pull for you.<eos> I'm happy to meet you.<eos> I wish it were under better circumstances, of course.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> I understand.<eos> I want to assure you that you and your family are going to be perfectly safe from now on.
So what's gonna happen to me?<eos> I'm gonna fix this.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I thought Broussard was gonna be here.<eos> He's working.<eos> These are photos of people coming and going from the Green Zone.<eos> Point out Will's boss to me.<eos> I need a guarantee that my husband will be safe.<eos> Broussard already made that deal.<eos> I need to hear it from you.
- A library.<eos> The attack was meant only to take food from those who had everything and redistribute it to those who had none.<eos> By the time Ocho heard the first signs of the drones, it was already too late.<eos> My fellow Colonists, brothers and sisters, hermanos y hermanas, if you never hear my voice again, I want you to remember the words of Frederick Douglass.<eos> If there is no struggle, there is no progress.<eos> Power concedes nothing without a demand.<eos> It never did, and it never will.<eos> Go, go!<eos> The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.<eos> The one thing they cannot take from you, my fellow Colonists... is hope.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Will reminds me so much of that.<eos> He's a tremendous professional.<eos> He's smart.<eos> He's competent, driven, funny... and so in love with his wife that... he doesn't see her for what she is.<eos> Was that the first time that you'd seen someone die?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The people that you've gotten involved with are not who they appear to be.<eos> These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside.
Why you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There.<eos> You look better already.<eos> I'm not better.<eos> I am anything but better.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with the doc on this one, hon.<eos> His eyes are okay, but he still looks skeevots to me.<eos> Well, no matter.<eos> We're gonna get you back to the city now and fix you right up.
Come on!<eos> Miss Carter?<eos> Miss Carter, we must rest.<eos> No, keep moving.<eos> Towards what?<eos> We're miles from any sort of structure.<eos> A car will come.<eos> We haven't seen a soul in an hour.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, allow me to clarify that in the future, your opinion on how we proceed is neither wanted nor required.<eos> I should've left you at home, but I trusted that you would know how to behave...
No.<eos> No, not when there are so many other mistakes you could make.<eos> What?<eos> I will not apologize for doing the right thing.<eos> The right thing?<eos> What you did was reckless and selfish.<eos> You risked all of our lives for a personal vendetta.<eos> Which is not unlike you risking our lives to fetch a Russian assassin.<eos> You saved Dottie Underwood to assuage your conscience, and my wife, Ana, paid the price!<eos> Leaving Dottie with Whitney Frost would've been tantamount to murder, and unlike you, I'm not a murderer, Mr. Jarvis!

I...<eos> I know I shouldn't have said that.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> You have begged me to bring you on my adventures since I arrived in Los Angeles, and that's what they are to you...
But then you won't be able to use it on her.<eos> Give us the room.<eos> All right, I'm listening.<eos> We fix the cannon...<eos> We bring Frost the cannon, and then we fire it at her pretty, blonde head and restore some order.<eos> What about Andy Hardy over here?<eos> Is he gonna be willing to fall in line with this scheme?<eos> How do I know he won't come after me?<eos> With what?<eos> He's got nothing on you.
I'm not safe.<eos> I can't hold on.<eos> I can't fight it much longer.<eos> You don't have to fight it.<eos> Do you realize how ungrateful you sound?<eos> Others would kill for zero matter.<eos> Some people have killed for it.<eos> - And you just want to stuff it down?<eos> - I need to get rid of it.<eos> That is what I'm attempting to do, is take it from you.
We can't kill Vernon.<eos> He's an integral part of this operation.<eos> This is ludicrous.<eos> Have a little faith.<eos> My man Samberly can patch this thing right up.<eos> I'm not referring to the cannon, and I have every ounce of faith in Dr. Samberly's talent.<eos> Hey, thanks, Carter.<eos> Nice to hear that once in a while.<eos> What I'm speaking about is this man.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of climbing into bed with snakes.
What I'm speaking about is this man.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of climbing into bed with snakes.<eos> I couldn't care less who you're climbing into bed with.<eos> Let's say this works.<eos> We fix this device and then Vernon stops Whitney Frost with it.<eos> Then what?<eos> How do you think his priorities will change?<eos> He'll be after us the very next second.<eos> I know you'll have a hard time believing this, Agent Carter, but I have no interest in you.<eos> I won't kill you...

Anything?<eos> Not a drop.<eos> Maybe you should give him a rest.<eos> You mess with someone this long, his heart's gonna give out before you get what you need.<eos> I'm not shaking him down for cash, Joseph.<eos> I'm just saying, the guy's been put through the ringer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Kill the machine.<eos> I am at my wit's end with you, doctor.

Someone here to see you.<eos> Mr. Masters.<eos> One of his boys.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I know you.<eos> We met at your husband's fundraiser.<eos> Yes.<eos> Jack Thompson.<eos> Jack.<eos> So, Vernon sent you to deliver the weapon, hmm?
One of his boys.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I know you.<eos> We met at your husband's fundraiser.<eos> Yes.<eos> Jack Thompson.<eos> Jack.<eos> So, Vernon sent you to deliver the weapon, hmm?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> So he sent you to deliver bad news.
Of course he does.<eos> - He's just jealous.<eos> - I would be, too.<eos> Where's my cannon, Chief Thompson?<eos> It's at the SSR...<eos> Undergoing repairs.<eos> I'm here to buy a little more time to finish up.<eos> Vernon insists on having it up and running before we deliver it.<eos> To impress me.<eos> To ruin you.

Jack, what the hell are you doing? !<eos> Turn it on.<eos> Turn it on now!<eos> You want us to trust you, then you pull this crap?<eos> This isn't about trust.<eos> This is about making the hard choices.<eos> By killing an innocent person?<eos> Not one person in there is innocent!<eos> Jason Wilkes is.<eos> I'm doing what needs to be done, what the two of you won't do.
Tropical mango, dragon fruit. Strawberry mango fever?<eos> That's brand new.<eos> You know, I got plenty of choices, honey.<eos> If you don't see what you like here, I've got a whole garage full of stuff.<eos> - I can't even park in there anymore. It's crazy.<eos> Which one do you want?<eos> Actually, it's funny you mentioned Costco, because, um...<eos> Uh.<eos> I, um...<eos> Wondered if I could interest you in a, um...

Get me a glass of Kirkland and a Klondike bar, kid. - Okay.<eos> - Will ya?<eos> - Martha, shut the door.<eos> Wait, why were you talking to yourself in there?<eos> I was just practicing my pitch to sell Mrs. Baskets a Costco executive membership.<eos> Oh, honey, I've got the executive membership.<eos> I've got every membership ever offered by Costco.<eos> It was sweet of you, though.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you, Mrs. Baskets.<eos> I didn't mean to freak you out in there.
I didn't think he was gonna make it.<eos> - He shut down. - Hm.<eos> And then one day he came home from school, he said, "I taught myself how to juggle."<eos> And from then on he had a tiny life preserver.<eos> I knew he'd be okay.<eos> I know he should move on, but he never will.<eos> He was always a sensitive kid.<eos> So I need you here and now to promise me that you won't hurt that sensitive kid.<eos> Mama Basket... You know, I can't do any more damage.<eos> I wait for you in the car.
Mom, your car is being towed.<eos> Jesus Criminy.<eos> Can one more thing happen today?<eos> Here. This is for the collection plate.<eos> And we found a man crucified on a cross.<eos> He gave his body for our sins.<eos> Chip.<eos> Chip Baskets.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I noticed you earlier.

Ma cherie means my dear.<eos> Mon amour, ma cherie.<eos> Desire is longing, so to say "I long for you":<eos> Je te desire.<eos> I long for you.<eos> Hello, there, sir.<eos> How's your day going?<eos> Everything's good, thank you.<eos> Is there anything I can do to make your stay here more pleasant?<eos> Perhaps sign you up for a round of golf?
I can't make any promises.<eos> I'd feel more comfortable if you stayed.<eos> You scared of Kyra?<eos> I hear she's a monster.<eos> This is your left ventricle.<eos> It's just slightly larger in size.<eos> It was exactly the same for your twin brother.<eos> You can live with it and die at 100.<eos> Or at 27.<eos> I treated Lewis just like I treated you.
Don't be scared, Maureen.<eos> What happened to Lewis is very exceptional.<eos> You can get up.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> You just need to keep avoiding both intense physical efforts and extreme emotions.<eos> Like Lewis did...<eos> - I mean,... he built cabinets. - I know.<eos> He wanted to turn the house into a studio where he could teach and practice carpentry.<eos> He really considered it his future.<eos> I'll see you again in six months?
Connor?<eos> Tell Len and Mary that Arya passed the test.<eos> Oh, also, could you go on to my Paleta account and make sure that I'm signed up for the plan with the most snacks?<eos> I'm fucking starving every day.<eos> Hey, um, Susan, can I just... talk to you, real quick?<eos> Um, I just...<eos> I wanted to let you know, uh, 'cause I think... you should know that the, uh, reason Arya passed is because I... I helped her cheat.<eos> So it's taken care of?<eos> Yeah, it is. It's taken care of and...<eos> I guess I was sort of thinking, you know, since I came through for you, and helped the show not get shut down, maybe... you could do me a solid and take a look at this...
- I moderate focus groups.<eos> - That's awesome.<eos> Oh, for, like, movies or...<eos> Yeah, uh, sometimes for movies, mainly for food.<eos> Okay, so you get, like, people to tell you, like, what chips are the crunchiest?<eos> Yes, very perceptive, Jeffrey.<eos> - Give us your spiel.<eos> Let's see this.<eos> - Oh, okay, uh...<eos> I'd bring everyone into the room with all the brands, but then I would turn the labels away from you - so you're not prejudiced. - Sure.
Let's go and let's just see what it's like.<eos> And even if it's bad, we should write a good review because we're nice.<eos> Yes, I agree.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Well, should we, uh... should we hit the road?<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> - All right.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're so cute. Look at this.<eos> In a year, I'm gonna be bragging that I introduced you at your wedding.
- Oh, thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And can I get you guys started with some drinks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd love to get a glass of red wine, if there's anything you could recommend.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> We have a NorCal Malbec that I'm quite fond of,<eos> - right there.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> - And for you, sir?
Yeah. - The shower head started to leak.<eos> Bam!<eos> The shower head blast off!<eos> - It did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I'm sorry, but, uh, a shower head is the last thing I want coming at me when I'm naked.<eos> No doubt!<eos> Boom! Ahh!<eos> All right, here we are.<eos> Red wine for you, sir, and a sea breeze for the lady.
It's good, it's good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Can we switch tables?<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> I am so sorry about the air conditioner.<eos> Let's get you somewhere else before you freeze, huh?
This covers your activities in June 1944.<eos> I was in the war, same as you.<eos> If you want to compare war crimes, yours are a lot worse.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You have any idea what could do that?<eos> - Zero Matter.<eos> - Here's my business card.<eos> Thank you, Doctor...<eos> Wilkes.<eos> I want to thank you properly for saving my life.
Now!<eos> Where the hell's the car?<eos> !<eos> Where the hell is Samberly?<eos> That's the $64 question.<eos> No offense, Sousa, but next time I see that guy,<eos> - I'm gonna kill him!<eos> - Just pick a direction and run!<eos> You can run if you want, but why bother? !<eos> I know where you're going, and it's only a matter of time until I find you.
What's the verdict, Howard?<eos> You're a little anemic, Dr. Wilkes.<eos> Other than that, you're clean of Zero Matter.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Seems you are officially back to your old self.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Jarvis.<eos> But...<eos> I don't know if I'll ever be back to my old self.<eos> Things I've done...<eos> I threatened to kill you, Peggy.
I think we all have something in common.<eos> We're worried about Whitney.<eos> I mean, she's not herself.<eos> Normally, my Whitney is a very thoughtful, loving person.<eos> Who you kidding, Joey?<eos> You always went for the crazy ones.<eos> Jenny Boccabella... she tried to throw you off the 59th Street Bridge.<eos> Well, that was a... unique situation.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Mr. Manfredi, what is it that you think any of us can do for you?
No, don't worry about it.<eos> Just play along, okay?<eos> I'll make it up to you.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Now I'm gonna ask you a question, and I want you to be honest with me.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> How long have you been working for Little Tommy Fontana?<eos> I don't work for Tommy.<eos> I work for you.
- It's good.<eos> How's that?<eos> Great work.<eos> From a lovely pair of hands.<eos> Mr. Stark, don't kid.<eos> Mr. Stark's my old man.<eos> You can call me Howard.<eos> All right...<eos> Howard.<eos> I can call you Howard, right?
- Yes, look at us... developing exponentially more horrific ways to kill each other.<eos> Zero Matter, in the right hands, could've launched us a hundred years ahead.<eos> Technologically speaking, if we harness...<eos> Is he still whining about this?<eos> - Until the end of time.<eos> Sleep well?<eos> - I did.<eos> And I could sleep another week.<eos> Mnh-mnh. I'm sorry, Doc.<eos> But I expect to see you in the office, 8:00 a.m. sharp, come Monday.
Half a dance.<eos> I suppose that's better than nothing.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so glad I didn't miss you.<eos> Miss Carter.<eos> You were going to leave without saying goodbye?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> Well, I... Raised in a barn, my granny would say.<eos> Um, I... I didn't want to bother you and, um...
You were going to leave without saying goodbye?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> Well, I... Raised in a barn, my granny would say.<eos> Um, I... I didn't want to bother you and, um...<eos> I thought perhaps you might... might not want to see me.<eos> Mrs. Jarvis, I'm so sorry.<eos> I am home, and I'm safe, and I'm with a man who I adore, who is in one piece.<eos> Mr. Jarvis is a lucky man.<eos> I am, indeed.<eos> I'll just get Mrs. Jarvis settled, and then I'll be happy to take you wherever you need to go.
I am, indeed.<eos> I'll just get Mrs. Jarvis settled, and then I'll be happy to take you wherever you need to go.<eos> Oh, that won't be necessary.<eos> I've already rung for a taxi. It'll be here any moment.<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> But truly, you should stay here with your wife.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, of course it is.<eos> Fine, fine, fine.<eos> I beg you, allow him to take you.
Oh, Cal, you were always so good to me.<eos> What did I ever do to deserve you, hmm?<eos> I know.<eos> Like we always do.<eos> Sir, you can't give her those.<eos> Why not?<eos> She'll just try to use them to claw her face open.<eos> Hey!<eos> There's my beautiful girl.<eos> I'd be quite happy to take you on to the airport, Miss Carter.
Excuse me, Layla?<eos> Hey.<eos> I know this is a weird place to tell you this, but, um, I saw what happened in Atlanta with Jeff.<eos> You saw what?<eos> He wasn't alone on the roof.<eos> Juliette was going to jump...<eos> And he saved her.<eos> But when he did, he fell.<eos> You are Avery Barkley.<eos> I knew I recognized you from the magazines.
We've, uh, just been at home.<eos> Mostly spending time with our daughter.<eos> Have you two started thinking about a brother or sister for Cadence?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Yeah, just, uh...<eos> Oh!<eos> I'll have... I'll have a glass, thank you.<eos> Ahh. Okay.<eos> It's been kind of a strange day, and probably most strange for the two of you, because, once again, the family that you know is changing.
♪ Will lead you to the truth ♪<eos> You were the one... that almost got away.<eos> With patience and... stubbornness, here we are, finally.<eos> We've had our joys and our sorrows our memories and mistakes, but we've gotten through all of it 'cause together we're stronger and we're wiser.<eos> So I give you this ring, forged in the fire of our love.<eos> And I vow to be yours forever and always.<eos> ♪ And all that changes ♪<eos> - ♪ Is only everything ♪<eos> - By the power vested in me by the state of Tennessee,<eos> I now pronounce you...
Thanks for coming.<eos> Oh, hey, yeah.<eos> Wouldn't have missed it.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Oh, Juliette is, uh, so sorry she couldn't be here.<eos> Hope she's doing okay.<eos> - She's great, really.<eos> - Good.<eos> Yeah, I remember she was having kind of a tough time right after the baby was born.<eos> I imagine it might have been hard on both of you.
I just... I love him.<eos> Good.<eos> Excuse me. Is this yours?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> It is, yeah. - Oh.<eos> Thanks. They, uh, always seem to go missing.<eos> Oh, same here.<eos> Half her toys are on this playground.<eos> Do you live nearby?<eos> I think I've seen you two here before.
Thanks. They, uh, always seem to go missing.<eos> Oh, same here.<eos> Half her toys are on this playground.<eos> Do you live nearby?<eos> I think I've seen you two here before.<eos> Uh, just around the corner.<eos> You?<eos> Same.<eos> But other corner.<eos> Ah. Yeah, I think I've seen you here, as well.
I-I mean, that's not just an incredible debut album, that's a... that's a career-making album.<eos> This is a game-changer for you guys.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Yeah, the chemistry between you...<eos> There's not a false moment in the whole thing.<eos> The way your voices sound together, the harmonies...<eos> I mean, it's really spectacular.<eos> Well, we just want to say thank you for letting us make the album we wanted to make.
Come in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Listen, I can't tell you how excited everybody is about the album.<eos> Oh, me too.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you.<eos> You think there's any possibility of us choosing another song for the single?<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> I'm a little worried about launching a band that is a duo with a song that's really a solo.<eos> Gunnar and I are a team, and I think it's only fair that we're featured equally.<eos> Well, the song kind of feels like both of you.
You know, we should probably take a break right now, so, uh, stay where you are.<eos> We'll be right back with country superstar Mr. Luke Wheeler.<eos> Man, I'm so sorry about that.<eos> We'll try to weed out the haters next round.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I've been waiting for an hour, and I need to drive back to Nashville for a job I have tonight.<eos> - How much longer?<eos> - Mr. Barkley?<eos> Nice to see you again.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, at this point, um, maybe she's our best bet.<eos> We're gonna bring a very special guest up on stage tonight to share a few songs.<eos> Please put your hands together for our friend, Mr. Will Lexington!<eos> How you'll doing?<eos> Well, like the Xs, I've been doing a lot of traveling myself.<eos> Where'd you go, sweetheart?<eos> Kentucky, actually.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> I'm excited to perform some new material for you.
Definitely miss the days when all I got thrown at me were panties.<eos> That ain't funny.<eos> None of this is funny.<eos> Detective Hantz.<eos> If it's any consolation, your attacker could be in big trouble.<eos> Well, he doesn't seem too worried about it.<eos> We'll see you tomorrow, boys.<eos> Probably not his first time in handcuffs.<eos> No, but it's his first time facing a felony hate crime.<eos> I understand he shouted gay slurs at you?
Putting your feelings down on paper makes it easier to say it out loud.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'd be so embarrassed.<eos> The first lesson of becoming a woman, which you are, is learning to tell the man in your life what your needs are.<eos> Mr. Barkley.<eos> As I explained yesterday,<eos> Juliette doesn't feel as though she...<eos> I heard you before about her not feeling safe, and I'm aware of what she's up against.<eos> But she needs to hear how I'm feeling.<eos> Look, I'm afraid I have to ask you to...
It's an honor to meet you.<eos> Real fan.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You guys headlining tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, speaking of which, we should probably...<eos> - Yep.<eos> - It was really great meeting you.
- No way.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Harvard Elementary, Houston, Texas.<eos> Oh, and my first boyfriend also turned out to be gay.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's like we're the same person.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Welcome to The Bluebird.<eos> We have a special show for you tonight.
♪ It's a fragile thing, hangin' on a string ♪<eos> ♪ It don't take much ♪<eos> ♪ And a soul ♪<eos> ♪ It's a little bit stronger, takes a little longer ♪<eos> ♪ To use it up ♪<eos> Detective Gibbs.<eos> I'm Rayna Jaymes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, I don't mean any disrespect, but I-I'm just... I'm feeling like this Vita case is not a priority for you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Well, you just let me know about tomorrow.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> I-I-I will do that.<eos> Uh, g-good night.<eos> And... voilà.<eos> - Enjoy.<eos> - Juliette, you didn't have to do all this.<eos> Oh, it's nothing. Please.<eos> I just wanted to say thank you.
Honey, your sister wants to... wants to live independently.<eos> Does that mean she's divorcing us?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here she is.<eos> - Hi, Rayna.<eos> I'm David Mannis.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Sorry to hold you up a little bit.
So don't tell me I don't have any rights here.<eos> You would but establishing that legally would take months.<eos> We go to court in two days.<eos> Can we just talk to Maddie?<eos> We can ask the judge to order mediation at the hearing.<eos> I'm not talkin' about mediation.<eos> I'm just talkin' about... havin' a conversation with our daughter.<eos> I've checked with Maddie's counsel.<eos> They're unwilling to wait.<eos> We have no choice but to prepare you and your ex-husband as codefendants.
- Good to see you.<eos> Thanks for having me.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Nice<eos> - Oh, good to have you on the show.<eos> to be here with you good people and, ah, all you folks, ah, watching at home.<eos> How many of them are there that watch across the country?<eos> - I'd say a few billion or so.<eos> - I think I already knew that.<eos> But, um, so we may have a-a surprise in store for you today.
See you later.<eos> - See ya.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Yeah, she's, uh... amazing, all right.<eos> How do you feel about the headlines?<eos> Well, the studio's suing me.<eos> But it's the best decision I could have made.<eos> I get to see Cadence now whenever I want.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> How are things between you and Avery?
Okay.<eos> So, you two perform as The Exes, but you never speak about your personal relationship in interviews.<eos> How did it start?<eos> Tell me about your first date.<eos> Uh, we didn't really have one.<eos> No.<eos> It just sort of happened over time, I guess.<eos> Yeah, we... we were co-workers and writing partners, then roommates...<eos> And it hit you like a bolt of lightning?<eos> Or one of you made the first move?
She's just being manipulated.<eos> I just hope and pray that this judge is... is a reasonable person.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm gonna go upstairs.<eos> I'll be up in a minute.<eos> So, while you were still writing together and dating,<eos> Scarlett, you signed solo with Highway 65, and you had a single, "Gun for a Mouth,"<eos> - on college radio, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What made the two of you pursue separate recording careers?
- No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> I can't believe he chose her.<eos> I put everything on the line, and he didn't want me.<eos> I know it hurts right now, but you're going to be okay.<eos> You will.<eos> Just give it some time.<eos> It's only been a week.<eos> We both know it's been longer than that.<eos> See, this is why I don't like to leave you two alone.
Matter of fact, I am feeling pretty damn good about a lot of things lately.<eos> Hey. What are you doing?<eos> Hey!<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Why was he taking pictures?<eos> Was he paparazzi?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Mr. Weaver is expecting you.
How you doing?<eos> Hanging, you know?<eos> - Kesha, over here!<eos> - So, are you guys toge...<eos> There's Andrew.<eos> We're supposed to hang out them.<eos> We'll see you later, yeah?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey, girl.<eos> Ms. Barnes, they're ready for you.
My name is Alex Parrish.<eos> I'm an FBI agent.<eos> In July, a terrorist blew up Grand Central Terminal in New York.<eos> But before that, I was still a trainee.<eos> These people were my friends... or at least I thought they were.<eos> One of them is a terrorist.<eos> And now I'm racing to find out who they are before they strike again.<eos> Meet the class above you.
You all did well.<eos> You did very well.<eos> You accurately identified your peers' personality types and proposed strong approaches to turn them.<eos> But there's no substitute for real-life experience.<eos> The true test of your ability to cultivate human intelligence will happen in the field tonight.<eos> You will go to a location where the FBI has hopes of cultivating real sources which means you will approach a source with the goal of having them call the number on these cards and agree to cooperate.<eos> You only get one card because you only get one chance.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Where is Raina going?<eos> You know that the two of you can't be seen in public at the same time... you know that.
Here's my card... with my name.<eos> Trainee Parrish, you have just failed this exercise.<eos> What?<eos> You're an agent?<eos> The test wasn't "Can you turn me?"<eos> It was "Can I turn you?"<eos> I failed, too.<eos> What?<eos> Which is even worse than your fellow NATs that came up empty.<eos> Whenever you are approaching someone, they are approaching you, reading you, searching you for a weakness to exploit.
You fronted like the whole thing was wired.<eos> Was that bait? Or were you the bait?<eos> I swear.<eos> If you didn't set Mr. Axelrod up, who set you up?<eos> Nobody.<eos> It's a thing that happened, not something anyone did.<eos> That is the kind of thing I'd say.<eos> You vetted the info yourself.<eos> I did.<eos> Which means whoever put you up to this was careful and targeted.
That's what she builds, all day... killers.<eos> You're a good candidate.<eos> She'd make you unstoppable.<eos> Don't get your hopes up.<eos> You still got your shucking skills.<eos> Summer job on City Island when I was 14.<eos> For the record, I am not eating any of those.<eos> Any answers?<eos> Getting there.<eos> Marc was absolutely not conning you.
Who are you to those people upstate?<eos> - Chaos.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Axe Cap is the agent of chaos.<eos> You know what austerity means.<eos> You guys traverse moral and legal gray areas all the time, but you can live with it because you're rarely aware of anyone getting hurt by it.<eos> With this town, you know exactly who's getting hurt, and where they're gonna feel their pain. And how their lives are gonna spin out of control because of decisions made in your presence, at a fucking mansion in the Hamptons.<eos> I don't even know that it's wrong for him to do what he's doing... only that I don't like how it makes me feel.<eos> This is all connected.<eos> When a situation starts affecting you so much you can't sleep, you have to take action.
Shit.<eos> The mutton chop is the thing to order here.<eos> It's what they're known for.<eos> Mutton?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on, it's tradition.<eos> This place has a special character, doesn't it?<eos> You can almost feel all the history in this room, all the deals that've been made.<eos> It's where Senator Vandeveer brought me when she told me I was being appointed U.S. Attorney.<eos> And it's where I always thought I would take you when you'd earned the promotion to Head of Crim.
Is it possible you'll go the other way?<eos> Cash out, go private? That's not you. No.<eos> Sadly, I'm like you.<eos> Public servant for life.<eos> And it's in that role that I'm here.<eos> I have come across a wonderful young law student, Emma Foley.<eos> She's at Cardoza.<eos> Smart.<eos> Studious.<eos> And a clerkship with you would...
Then a bailout only seems right.<eos> Before I ended up in here, I would've said to you,<eos> "Let it implode. Raze the fucker."<eos> Let something new grow in its place.<eos> Prop it up and you're only delaying "the inevitable collapse."<eos> But now?<eos> You have to handle it right, or you'll be facing the same torches and pitchforks that landed me in here.<eos> Except that what I'd be doing isn't illegal.<eos> I did everything I could to make sure it didn't come to this. But still it went bad.<eos> Just don't forget... if they hate you enough, they will find legal grounds to fuck you.
I know things didn't work out the way we thought they would. And I know this is a bad situation for you.<eos> But I got to ask you to please not take it out on Marco's town.<eos> You know you've got a finder's fee coming to you either way.<eos> Come on, I don't give a shit about that. You can throw it right in if it changes anything.<eos> Bobby, I've known you since you're a kid.<eos> I don't know why you want to hurt all of these people who got so little as it is.<eos> These people, they're just like you while growing up.<eos> Now you've got everything. They're gonna have less than nothing.<eos> I can't have that on my head, and you don't want it on yours.<eos> I hear you, Bruno.
It's brilliant.<eos> It's bullet-proof all over!<eos> - Bullet-proof? Is it? - Yes.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - Yeah, sounds like it.<eos> - Tanks feel like that.<eos> OK, then, these are guns.<eos> Use them.<eos> - What, on you?
God almighty.<eos> I'm not sure that's possible.<eos> For...<eos> Is that...? You're in the way.<eos> It's a one-way street my way.<eos> It's a one-way street, yes.<eos> That's why me and the other cars are all coming this way.<eos> Please don't make me back up with this steering.<eos> Come on, it's a workout.<eos> Hammond, I am gonna kill you.
I was headed for the ferry port of Le Havre.<eos> The trouble is that logically, the others would be doing the same thing.<eos> Car, clear your throat, please.<eos> I'm out!<eos> Right, England, here I come.<eos> Clear your throat, car! Clear it!<eos> Or we shall be last.<eos> And then I shall have to sell you, and not to someone nice.<eos> You know that man who has sex with his cars and then puts pictures of it on the internet?<eos> I'm going to sell you to him unless you get going.
I like the quilted leather,<eos> I like the wood that comes from a cliff and all of that.<eos> But the exterior, I'm sorry, it's hideous.<eos> - Ugly.<eos> Pig ugly.<eos> - Yeah, well, hang on a minute.<eos> Because, do you remember, and it is a long time ago, when the Continental GT first came out, we all thought that was hideous... - It was. - ...and now we all love it.<eos> - It's one of the few things we agree on.<eos> - Yes. Yes, that's true.<eos> But I think this is more like you.

I said Nürburgring and it went "blink" - and I said, "Yes." But it's a similar name. - Don't blame the car!<eos> Well, I didn't pronounce it properly.<eos> That's like muddling up our names cos they both begin with J.<eos> Look, let's not get all bogged down with who's been a massive idiot and despite what he claims can't do anything properly.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Let's instead look for a race track near here.<eos> Why don't we try and find one?<eos> And that is exactly what Hammond did.<eos> Where?<eos> Well, it's all around you.
- What if he beats you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You'll die of shame and I'll die laughing.<eos> Try as he might, though, the old lady was losing time in the corners.<eos> The trouble is, it is a two-and-a-half-tonne fairly long car, and you can't change the laws of physics.<eos> That's not good.<eos> Oh, get it straight!<eos> Oh, no! I overdid it.<eos> Six minutes 16.<eos> So he was 16... 18 seconds slower than you and his car is £212,000.
From one place and reappear somewhere else.<eos> Makes your speech and mannerisms more human.<eos> We're not leaving you behind.
Now.<eos> Three was correct.<eos> One of the antimatter transducer feeds was compromised by an impairment in one of the particle accelerators.<eos> So... lucky guess?<eos> He's never spoken French before.<eos> That doesn't prove anything.<eos> Trina. What?<eos> !<eos> That was the name of the first girl you ever kissed.<eos> Her brother Draydon was in love with you.
Okay, so we all know what we're doing?<eos> The Android and I pretend we're leaving the ship to head into the station, then double back to the hangar to monitor the airlock.<eos> I'm with you Two, here on the ship, waiting for company.<eos> Good.<eos> Uh, well, what about me?<eos> What about you?<eos> Where do you want me?<eos> Back in your quarters.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> It's too dangerous for you.
You're lying.<eos> And you're under suspicion of having provided assistance in their terrorist actions. No.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Then why do you have this?<eos> It's an upgrade that allows you to pass as human.<eos> This is illegal tech.<eos> You are illegal tech.<eos> Why am I unable to move?<eos> Everything from your neural matrix to your physical form is state-of-the-art unsanctioned technology.<eos> I need to know who created you.
What happened to the stars?<eos> We're in a place where the stars are few and far between.<eos> A long, long way from home.<eos> This is the future?<eos> Yes.<eos> You've been doing some time skipping.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> To us?<eos> Very bad things.<eos> I've been waiting for you longer than I can remember.
Android...<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> - These are my friends.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We had a... unfortunate incident.<eos> Very unfortunate.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - My former owner.<eos> - How'd he find you?
I can do it again, if you like.<eos> They're scattered and buried, but your memories are still there.<eos> Show me another, please.<eos> She's awake.<eos> No, she's online, but still dormant until the process is complete.<eos> So it's working?<eos> The nanovirus I introduced is activating all her hidden subroutines.<eos> We should see the results in about an hour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't want you on this ship.
Hello, Rebecca.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Hello, Suki.<eos> It's good to see you functional.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Chase, The Caretaker.<eos> You know me.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> We suffered memory loss.<eos> We don't remember you or this place.
Well, this is a little awkward.<eos> She continued her tireless work for our cause, until her collapse.<eos> Scans revealed an inoperable brain tumor.<eos> There was nothing we could do.<eos> But you refused to accept the inevitable, and when the time came to say goodbye..<eos> You placed her in stasis.<eos> You stayed and grieved.<eos> And the others, driven by their new programming, eventually sought their freedom, until only we remained.<eos> I realized that the only way to help you move on was to give you just a little bit of her, someone to help you find your way.<eos> To everyone else, a simple level three utility model, but to you, and only you, so much more.
We need to go back to the lab.<eos> Rebecca?<eos> So you remember nothing of our time together?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Probably for the best, all things considered.<eos> I learned a great deal from Chase.<eos> The rest I was able to piece together myself.<eos> I assume he told you we've been down this road before, that your nanites offer only temporary reprieve.<eos> He did, but these are second generation nanites coursing through your system.<eos> I don't know if they'll cure you, but they'll buy you a little bit more time, at least.
- An android body?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They could build it to your specifications, that you would look like you, sound like you.<eos> And how do you feel about that?<eos> - It's not important how I feel.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Look... you said it yourself;<eos> With a machine body?<eos> You realize the irony of you pitching me this?<eos> Yes, I do, I do, but I'm pitching it to you anyway, because even I can see that this is a great opportunity for you.
And, like you, I didn't believe he'd actually do it.<eos> We've got to stop thinking of him as our friend.<eos> He stopped being that the moment he downloaded. Ryo Ishida's memories.<eos> The Four we knew is gone.<eos> Teku.<eos> It's been far too long, my old friend.<eos> Ryo...?<eos> Now Emperor Ishida Ryo of Zairon.<eos> Your stepmother?<eos> She'll no longer be a threat to you or anyone else.
Your stepbrother was too easily influenced, but, at heart, a good man.<eos> His death is unfortunate.<eos> His death was regrettable... but, ultimately, necessary.<eos> I still have enemies within the court, but they've lost their direct claim to the throne.<eos> They're disorganized and without purpose.<eos> It's only a matter of time before I uproot them.<eos> And then what?<eos> Have them take my place here in this cell?<eos> Why risk it?<eos> Your years as a fugitive have hardened you, Ryo.
They're disorganized and without purpose.<eos> It's only a matter of time before I uproot them.<eos> And then what?<eos> Have them take my place here in this cell?<eos> Why risk it?<eos> Your years as a fugitive have hardened you, Ryo.<eos> I can see it.<eos> What happened to the idealistic young man I used to teach?<eos> He's finally learned your lessons in political ethics.<eos> Now come, let's get you out of here before you make me change my mind.
That's not who we are.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> The shields are weakening.<eos> How's it coming along?<eos> I think this is gonna work.<eos> I'm gonna get the engines up in time.<eos> Unfortunately, Five, I'm afraid that's unlikely.<eos> The successive volleys from the Ferrous Corp. Destroyer have taken their toll.<eos> I estimate total shield failure in less than 20 minutes.<eos> Hey, I thought I'd lost you there.
[SIX] So we're supposed to just live here the rest of our lives?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's nowhere else to go.<eos> --So you're leaving.<eos> --No. No, we're just heading' down to the planet.<eos> We're gonna set things up.<eos> I'll be back. But if what The Android's saying is true, what's the point?<eos> The point is, you're still here.<eos> I'm not gonna abandon you.<eos> And I'm not gonna guilt you into paying me the occasional pity visit.
[TWO] You are just so cute!<eos> Your hot chocolate's getting cold.<eos> [TWO] Aww...<eos> Hm? No, we are not getting a dog!<eos> It would be great for... crew morale.<eos> We could screw up the timeline.<eos> What if the dog that we bring back is instrumental in finding a cure for Sokolsky Syndrome or something?<eos> [sighs]<eos> [TWO] What?<eos> This is the happiest I've seen you in a long time.
I'm fine, Five.<eos> But thanks for asking.<eos> I'll see you later when I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> See ya later.<eos> Six?<eos> Over.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You on your way?<eos> We're all here, except you and Wren.
So you think the colonies'll be okay with you holding their delegates hostage?<eos> I know how hard you worked for this, and I'm sorry.<eos> You're not a cop anymore.<eos> It's outta your hands.<eos> Hey!<eos> Good morning, Five.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was just fixing a faulty relay switch.<eos> No. Where were you last night?<eos> I waited for you.
I have one more pitch to make.<eos> He's awake.<eos> Come on.<eos> What did you get us into?<eos> You mean by saving your lives down on that planet?<eos> What's your conflict with Zairon?<eos> What does Zairon have to do with this?<eos> Ryo...<eos> Six.<eos> It's good to see you again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.<eos> [Victor] It's an upgrade that makes your speech and mannerisms more human.<eos> You go back to the ship and leave.<eos> We're not leaving you behind.
[Ryo] I don't have the ships!<eos> Then find them. And weaken my position elsewhere?<eos> That is exactly what our enemies are hoping for.<eos> [Teku] Temiken is the birthplace of ishida, the original capital of the empire, and it's still the spiritual home of our people.<eos> It is exposed.<eos> It requires too many resources to defend, and it has no strategic value!<eos> There's more to winning wars than strategy.<eos> You have to win the people.<eos> The people obey.<eos> Because they fear you.

I didn't come here to fight. You should not have come here at all.<eos> [The android] Well...<eos> I didn't have much of a choice.<eos> I'm here to rescue my friends.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> I have my orders.<eos> What? To protect all this stuff?<eos> [Security android] It is very important to my employer.<eos> He stressed that repeatedly.<eos> Tabor doesn't care about you.
!<eos> Where?<eos> In a safe place.<eos> [Adrian] Whoa, whoa, what the hell?<eos> You were only pretending?<eos> You were playing him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Same way I played tabor.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Same way I played you.
Maybe it wasn't a normal jump.<eos> Maybe they didn't go where they wanted to.<eos> Maybe it's simply a malfunction in the system array as a result of continued exposure within the nebula.<eos> All right, I'll go down and check the array.<eos> In the meantime, run that data through every analytical model you have.<eos> If it can tell us anything about what happened or where they went, I wanna know.<eos> Understood.<eos> All right, Das, how's it coming with that coil?<eos> You called me Das.<eos> You said you didn't want me to call you Emily.
If it's true, then as long as the tear persists, we may be able to use it to trace where they went.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm on my way back up.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> Shit.<eos> Not again.<eos> Five?<eos> We're receiving an incoming subspace transmission.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> Android, it's good to see you again.
I'm on my way back up.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> Shit.<eos> Not again.<eos> Five?<eos> We're receiving an incoming subspace transmission.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> Android, it's good to see you again.<eos> Four.<eos> Or should I call you Emperor Ryo Ishida?
We're leaving tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, we bribed a couple of crewmen on a longrange freighter.<eos> It's nine days in the hold, but it'll get us there.<eos> Well, II can't just leave.<eos> Why not?<eos> BeBecause of the old guy?<eos> His name is Baines.<eos> 'Kay, look...<eos> I know you think he's your friend 'cause he's teaching you how to fix all this junk, but you can't trust him.
And they will, but not with their lives.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.<eos> What?<eos> Where's Turrence?<eos> So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.<eos> Have to say, you surprise me.<eos> Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
Hey, there you are.<eos> Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.<eos> This spot gives me the best view.<eos> So what's your story?<eos> Wh-what do you mean?<eos> You're, what, 16?<eos> You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.<eos> - How'd you manage that?<eos> - I stowed away on their ship.<eos> Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Cowards!<eos> You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.<eos> So don't go start...<eos> Drop 'em.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Now!<eos> So what now?<eos> Now... you go back to the ship and leave.<eos> You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?<eos> We're not leaving you behind.
I didn't know how.<eos> I kept it on a separate storage device.<eos> And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.<eos> Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?<eos> Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.<eos> So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?<eos> Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.<eos> She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.<eos> You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.<eos> I know she wants to see you.
Yeah, not so tough now, are you?<eos> Put that thing down before you hurt someone.<eos> Oh, it's fine.<eos> Three took the bullets out.<eos> Oh...<eos> [Whirring]<eos> What the hell?<eos> [Grunts] I secured the marauder.<eos> Moving on to phase two.<eos> [Adrian] Oh, it's hard to describe exactly the feeling of having a gun pointed at you.
[Grunts] I secured the marauder.<eos> Moving on to phase two.<eos> [Adrian] Oh, it's hard to describe exactly the feeling of having a gun pointed at you.<eos> What a rush.<eos> It really puts life into perspective.<eos> I mean, just look at this sky. I...<eos> I've never seen it so blue and vibrant.<eos> Okay, can someone just knock me unconscious and drag me the rest of the way?<eos> I cannot listen to any more of this.<eos> I've already killed you once.
Well, I can do it in two.<eos> [Two] Yes, I bet you could.<eos> But we're gonna stick together.<eos> Look, we knew there was a chance that this could happen, but the android is prepared.<eos> Our best bet is just to sit tight and let this play out.<eos> Wow, you are different.<eos> My portia would be beating the crap out of me right now for information.<eos> We... that was more of an observation than a suggestion.<eos> [Two] Who else came over with you on the marauder?<eos> [Chuckles] Do I need to remind you that they used you and abandoned you?
...Everyone.<eos> ...What's that?<eos> We all hitched a ride when your raza made the jump back to this reality: Me, portia, Boone, Tash, the android.<eos> What about corso? Not so much.<eos> He's not really a team player.<eos> Well, what have you and your team been up to since you came here?<eos> Taking it easy, seeing some sights.<eos> There's a lovely adults-only botanical garden on rigel-9.<eos> Also setting up this score.<eos> Right. Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.
We're prepared for any complications.<eos> Besides, even if worse comes to worst, we still got one last card to play.<eos> [Gasping] Right now, aboard that ship, your little friends, they're in a whole world of trouble.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> [Three] Ah!<eos> You really think your Boone's gonna convince anyone he's me?<eos> Little while back, you had me convinced you were him.<eos> [Three] Yeah, but that's 'cause I'm a better actor.<eos> I do recall some performance issues.<eos> I bailed on you.
Previously on "Dark Matter"...<eos> You're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?<eos> I know she wants to see you. You're building yourself a whole world here, aren't you?
Previously on "Dark Matter"...<eos> You're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?<eos> I know she wants to see you. You're building yourself a whole world here, aren't you?<eos> I want this to feel like it's your home too.<eos> The independent colonies have organized much faster than we anticipated. It now appears they're getting outside help.<eos> We're not leaving you behind. Then think of it as leaving me to move forward.
All this time you've been talking about how you want to help people, convince us to do the right thing, and now that we do want to help, you won't let us.<eos> What?<eos> The colonists are in danger, and you won't do anything to help them because of some protocol?<eos> I won't take the chance of compromising the location of the summit.<eos> - Come on. - What are the chances that there's a corporate ship just hiding out there waiting to track us?<eos> They're small, but I won't risk it.<eos> What about the risk of not warning them?<eos> After the noaccess protocol is lifted, then...<eos> You're not making sense, and I'm beginning to worry that it's the neurotoxin affecting you.<eos> This isn't like you.
But that's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> No, Six, that's not what you're doing.<eos> What you're doing is dying.<eos> You're taking a lot of innocent people with you.<eos> Five?<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I come down here sometimes to think... when I'm sad.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I just don't know what I'd do without you.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I just don't know what I'd do without you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> That's what I thought before you decided to stay with those colonists.<eos> I thought I could help them.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Ever since you discovered you were a cop, you've been struggling trying to figure out where you belong.<eos> The answer's always been right in front of you.
No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Six.<eos> - You're losing him.<eos> - I can get him back.<eos> - He knows.<eos> Come on.<eos> The Android has disabled the "Marauder."<eos> Look, you need to calm down.<eos> This is the neurotoxin affecting you.
Trying to help people out of the goodness of your own heart?<eos> That alone should have set off the alarm bells.<eos> The neurotoxin has compromised your judgment.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought at first, but then little things weren't making sense, the labels, the monitors.<eos> I couldn't read them.<eos> I realize now that...<eos> I can imagine this, and I can imagine all of you.<eos> I just couldn't picture those details.<eos> You're suffering from extreme paranoia, a sign that your condition is worsening.<eos> We need to get you to the infirmary immediately.

I knocked you out.<eos> How?<eos> You're an android. That punch shouldn't have even fazed you.<eos> You're not real.<eos> No, Six.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> Okay, we're gonna have to take the direct route.<eos> Give us the coordinates.<eos> Where am I?<eos> What were you doing to me? We rescued you from a very bad situation.
They need help.<eos> He's heading for the bridge.<eos> Finally!<eos> You're awake.<eos> You're awake.<eos> Lara.<eos> You're back.<eos> I never left.<eos> You were the one that went away on assignment.<eos> We haven't seen you in over two months.
I never left.<eos> You were the one that went away on assignment.<eos> We haven't seen you in over two months.<eos> John Anders came by the house.<eos> He told me what happened on that space station, all of those people.<eos> Hyadum12.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> I don't want to do this anymore, risking my life, being away from you and Dane.
I was going to say "let it get to you."<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I'm with her, she seems really happy, you know?<eos> I know, that's terrible, isn't it?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> It's not easy being someone's entire world, you know?<eos> Why didn't you tell me when we were back on Hyperion8?<eos> What was I supposed to say? You used to have a happy family life, but you threw it away?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I guess I would've told you eventually, but at the time, I figured you had enough on your plate.
Did you have fun today?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah? Dad!<eos> You ready?<eos> Time to go home.<eos> The independent colonies are safe for now. The Galactic Authority has sent more ships to patrol the area, but that just opens up potential targets elsewhere.<eos> When this war started, I was all for letting the corporations destroy each other.<eos> But now I thinks it's time we need to choose a side.<eos> Does that mean you're sticking around?<eos> Unless you've already given my room away.<eos> Lucky for you, it's still available.
I should have come sooner.<eos> I have no excuse except to say that...<eos> It's been a rough month. For you and me both.<eos> So Three tells me you experience time a little differently in here. It's weird.<eos> Minutes can turn into hours, and I won't even notice, but if I stop to think about it, it's like starting the clock, and I am aware of every second.<eos> Well, you've certainly found a beautiful way to pass the time.<eos> It's... it's amazing.<eos> I can turn my environment into anything I want, create a world limited only by my imagination, but it's still not enough.<eos> You're lonely.<eos> Well, if Five could find a way to do this for you, there must be a way for you to reach out when you're having moments like these when you need somebody to talk to.
I...<eos> I wish I could, I really do, but I'm down to an eighth of a tank, and I'm gonna need every drop to find my son.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do me a favor, and just sleep on it, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> "There once was an owl who said, 'What, ' and not, 'Who.'"<eos> You're sure about this, right?<eos> You prefer to keep listening to them bitching about us being childish, or do you want to be a hero, and have Zoe be all," you're my Mr. Strong Man.<eos> - Yo, stop it!<eos> - "I want you, Ted."
Mrs. Raven, I'm not punishing you.<eos> I am trying to help you.<eos> Now, please kill the spider.<eos> Absolutely not!<eos> No! No!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Jay, come on. You were accused, too.<eos> They didn't throw you out. I made a mistake.
Previously on "The Mist"...<eos> This is not the first time nature's come alive."...<eos> She's worshipping a false god in your church.<eos> The rebar is in your brother's liver.<eos> I'm not killing you. Are you insane?
I'm so sorry.<eos> It looked at me, and it left.<eos> I don't want to be with those people anymore.<eos> What the hell you do that for, faggot, huh?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I thought this was Bryan Hunt's room.<eos> I'm Bryan Hunt.<eos> - Do you know who did this to you? - Jonah Dixon.<eos> Don't get attached to anyone.<eos> They'll just use you for their own good.
What are you doing here?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Is everything okay, man?<eos> Tell me who I am.<eos> Tell me who I am!<eos> - They will... find you.
She loved Him for the life He had given her.<eos> Please don't let her down by listening to Nathalie.<eos> Father, you're needed.<eos> She's talking about the Black Spring again, and they are listening.<eos> Father.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> It was interesting, you know, what we did.<eos> What, me beating the shit out of you?
What?<eos> The distraction.<eos> I still hate that jacket.<eos> Maybe we can distract the others as well.<eos> Come on.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> I think I'm gonna head back to the loading dock, show off my new clothes.<eos> I'm gonna throw out that jacket when I get back.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I love you.
All right.<eos> Let's go find him.<eos> I'm sorry... but it's been days now.<eos> So many people have died, and so many more will, unless someone can find a way to stop it.<eos> I'm trying, but I can't find a solution without... experiments.<eos> I'm not a psycho.<eos> I'm really not.<eos> The woman you found, she was already dying.<eos> So were the other people.<eos> And I never would've done anything to you if you hadn't...
Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Is anyone out there? !<eos> Somebody help me!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Everything has to be a pissing contest with you, doesn't it?<eos> People call you bitch long enough, one day, you decide to act accordingly.
Then they ate her.<eos> It reacts to us somehow on a physiological level.<eos> I just don't know how yet, but if I can find out, then I can save people.<eos> This will slow your metabolism and your hormone output.<eos> Maybe I can slow how the mist reacts to us.<eos> If it doesn't attack after around 30 seconds, I'll know I'm on the right track.<eos> What's the matter, sweetie?<eos> Is your mind playing tricks on you?<eos> You must get that from me.<eos> I got nothing from you.
I needed you.<eos> No.<eos> I understood why you left.<eos> Deep down, I was happy.<eos> You were finally free of me.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mm, baby doll.<eos> Every day, I tried to say it, but I could never get the words out.<eos> Say what?<eos> I love you.
Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, baby doll, yes, you do.<eos> You never realized, but we were always in this together.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> And you don't have to be any longer.<eos> You can stop running.<eos> There's no one waiting for you.
Sit down.<eos> He dragged me to the tower, and he hit me.<eos> He said he would hurt me again and again until I gave in to God's will.<eos> Nathalie, where is Link?<eos> All right, it's okay.<eos> You don't have to tell me, but...<eos> The mist came.<eos> It saved me.<eos> It saved me from him.<eos> Why did he attack you?
It's in process, but, Clarke, it isn't gonna be an easy ride.<eos> What don't I know?<eos> With the secret of praimfaya out, I sent echo and my army back to Polis to keep the peace.<eos> That's good.<eos> We need peace to distribute the cure.<eos> More than half of them deserted on the way.<eos> With the end coming, they want to be home.<eos> I don't blame them.<eos> Do you blame them for burning trikru villages as they go?<eos> That's funny coming from you.
- Jeez.<eos> - Mission failed. All work and no play makes raven a dull girl.<eos> Hey. All right?<eos> I have had enough of your stupid, little jokes.<eos> Why don't you take it easy, huh?<eos> You're just a self-loathing bottom-feeder.<eos> Abby's an idiot for trusting you.<eos> She doesn't know you like I do.<eos> You're a leech, Murphy, sucking people dry and taking whatever you can so that you can survive.<eos> At least I'm not a mental patient like you, raven.
I know the darkness.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> She'll be all right.<eos> Will you?<eos> The darkness can kiss my worthless ass.<eos> Congratulations. You're the new raven-sitter.<eos> Is it Octavia?<eos> Keep your eyes on the trees.<eos> She hasn't forgiven you, has she?
What happened to his guards?<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> I'll come back soon.<eos> I'm glad you're still alive.<eos> You won't be soon.<eos> Jus drein, jus daun.<eos> I killed no one.<eos> Wrong.<eos> You killed them all.<eos> And now they're gonna kill you.
Yeah!<eos> Let's kill him.<eos> You ok with all this?<eos> They're just blowing off steam.<eos> Blowing off steam?<eos> Is that what we were doing when we strung up Murphy for killing Wells?<eos> - Pour. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Against someone who tried to kill us!<eos> Yeah!<eos> They listen to you.
Is that what we were doing when we strung up Murphy for killing Wells?<eos> - Pour. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Against someone who tried to kill us!<eos> Yeah!<eos> They listen to you.<eos> Say something.<eos> Gotta do it now.<eos> Do it now!<eos> I want justice for the crimes he committed...<eos> With all due respect, your son would be ashamed of you.
Yeah, come on in.<eos> My mom told me,<eos> "Never judge someone until you walk a mile in their shoes."<eos> Or in this case, skates.<eos> I'm so happy to have this back.<eos> Read the inscription.<eos> "To L, my best friend."<eos> Uh...<eos> Larry, Larry, I got this. I got this.<eos> "To L, my best friend. I'll love you forever.
Hello?<eos> Is anybody here?<eos> You should be in the mess hall.<eos> I need to know what happened to my mother.<eos> You won't be returning to the mirror chamber anytime soon.<eos> But why?<eos> You just... Because last time you lost control.<eos> First you must learn to stop fighting yourself.<eos> The consequences could be deadly.<eos> And not just for you.
How many barons have you met?<eos> No, no, madame butterfly here, she needs more than a fighter at her side during the conclave.<eos> She needs a strategist.<eos> Now, I know all the players, and I know how to play.<eos> Also, I know how to follow orders.<eos> Hmm. If these are mother's wishes then, of course, I'll obey them.<eos> If anything happens to her, I'm holding you responsible.<eos> Well, no need for threats, tinker bell.<eos> If things go south, hell, I'll be dead, too.<eos> I couldn't have gotten this far without you.
That's the greatest gift you can give them.<eos> Hey, doc, it's Edgar.<eos> You in there?<eos> Edgar.<eos> Could you take a look at my hand?<eos> I guess I'll need some stitches, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're gonna need a whole bunch.<eos> You know what, Henry is sleeping.<eos> I'll stitch you up outside.
My fear was so potent, it felt like an invisible hand had thrust a stake down through my body, nailing me to the ground.<eos> That regent woke up, he saw me, and reached for his sword.<eos> In that split second I realized, I have a choice,<eos> I can die a forgotten coward, or I can live to be celebrated and remembered.<eos> Before that regent even touched his sword, I slit his throat.<eos> Four of his bodyguards stormed into the room, I clipped them all.<eos> To this day, before every battle, fear visits me,<eos> but now I embrace it as a friend.<eos> It's what makes you faster, stronger, smarter.<eos> As long as you control it instead of letting it control you.

Previously on "The Path"...<eos> - I'm moving into the city.<eos> I don't want to talk about it. I've already decided.<eos> It's a done thing.<eos> - I would like to invite you to climb to 2R.
- I do.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> Smart dude.<eos> Curious, just like you.<eos> He wouldn't like you.<eos> He wouldn't like me?<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> You're not just the babysitter.<eos> Dad wants to get back together, but I know they're not.<eos> - Hey, all that matters is that they both love you very much.
Sorry, sorry.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Consider this offering an act of solidarity.<eos> We're with you.<eos> We are you. The Light says that no man is better or worse than any other man, even though the circumstances of their birth may try to say otherwise.<eos> The Light said,<eos> "To be closer to me, you must humble yourself."<eos> And so we kneel before those we assume we are better than, and we wash each other's feet as a reminder that we are all the same.<eos> No more, no less.<eos> Why don't you get us some fresh towels? I'll take over for you.
Ah, well, it was in a war, and they were very scared.<eos> - Did they die?<eos> - It was a very long time ago, Johnny. - Can that happen here?<eos> - No.<eos> - But if it did, what would you do?<eos> - It's not gonna happen here.<eos> - But if it did.<eos> - I would go home as fast as I could and try to protect my family. - You'd leave me?<eos> - No. If you...<eos> If you were with me, I would... I would take you with me.
It won't be everything that we need, but it could show a sign of good faith while we ask others to sacrifice.<eos> - What about this place?<eos> - We try to keep it.<eos> - Sarah, why?<eos> - For the movement.<eos> For the future.<eos> And for my son.<eos> - You seen Noa?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was looking for you.
Yeah.<eos> In a way.<eos> I don't think you're living up to your full potential. - What?<eos> - I don't think you're doing everything you can for the movement.<eos> I know you and your mom don't have the easiest relationship, - but I think if you...<eos> - Stop. Stop it.<eos> - I mean, denying where you come from and who you are and all the good that money could do for so many people.<eos> - Don't do this, Hawk. - But you say you want to help people.<eos> This is how you can make the greatest impact.<eos> - Did your mom ever leave you stranded at a friend's birthday party for hours after everyone else had gone home?

 Look, let me just go get the kid, and then I will do whatever you want!<eos>  First, take us back.<eos>  Take you back where?<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about!<eos> You dosed me.<eos> You dosed...<eos> You fucking dosed me.<eos>  If you won't submit willingly...<eos> If you won't go willingly...  We'll guide you there.<eos> We'll guide you there.
Brenda is suffering from liver failure, And she's been placed in hospice care.<eos>  How long does she have?<eos>  We don't like to make predictions, but it could be any time.<eos> If you could help us contact him, that would be very help<eos>  Yes, I'll do that right away.<eos>  Where is he?  Mom!<eos>  Hi, baby.  You're hurting me.<eos>  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just so happy you're okay.<eos> Let me see you?
 Stop.<eos> Please.<eos>  What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> They had to, right?<eos>  You know, honey, I don't know.<eos> You and me, we're gonna find out, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos>  Okay.<eos>  Okay.<eos> I love you.
 That's right.<eos> Well, you just run your little heart out for me today, 'cause tomorrow morning...  You know, when I was when I was little, my mom used to take me to the mall and let me do a full belt at the top of the escalator,<eos> "Is that little girl making all that sound?"<eos> Now it's just a stupid job.<eos> Who cares?<eos>  Well, what if I told you Wait, wait, wait.<eos> People care.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> Your fans care.<eos> They love you.
- Hawk?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Summer will be so happy to see you.<eos> How bad is it?<eos>  What's wrong?<eos>  The money we owe.<eos> What?<eos>  Don't deny it.<eos> Just respect me enough not to deny it.<eos>  I cannot believe your grandparents would involve you.
 You should.<eos>  I should.<eos>  Cal.<eos> I'm so glad it's you.<eos> I have to tell you, um, your mom, she passed.<eos> They said that she went quietly and peacefully.<eos> Cal?  Yeah.<eos> I wanted you to know the check that we were hoping for, I can't I can't get it after all.<eos>  Did you hear what I just said?<eos> I know that I'm failing you.
I know that I'm failing you.<eos> Wish there was another way, but...<eos> Sarah, I don't I don't think that I could live with the person I've become Iif...  It's okay.<eos> No. No, it isn't.<eos>  Not right now, but it will be.<eos> I will see to it.<eos>  What did she need to tell me so badly anyway?<eos> Did you find out?<eos>  She wanted to apologize. She knows that she wasn't much of a mother.<eos> She loves you, and she's proud of the man that you became.
No. No, it isn't.<eos>  Not right now, but it will be.<eos> I will see to it.<eos>  What did she need to tell me so badly anyway?<eos> Did you find out?<eos>  She wanted to apologize.

I'm not a bad person.<eos> I know right and wrong.<eos> There's just something inside me... it makes me do these terrible things.<eos>  Cal.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Where's Luna?<eos> Do you know?<eos>  I let her go.  What?<eos>  She's gone. I told her to get as far away from you as she could.
E-B-B are my initials.<eos> - What's the middle B stand for?<eos> - It stands for<eos> "Better not ask if you like your face the way it is."<eos> - Wordy.<eos> - This is a clue she left for me.<eos> - What do you think's in Alaska?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Jenkins, do you have that rather sensitive but important piece of equipment I asked you to construct?
You hadn't mentioned her before.<eos> She did not choose me.<eos> She chose another.<eos> But I had already pledged my heart to her for all of the eternity, and a knight can never break an oath.<eos> Cassandra, you are beautiful, and you will find your love some day, but it just cannot be me.<eos> - Are we close?<eos> - Oh, I hope so.<eos> I don't think I can take another bug bite.<eos> Flynn, if you don't like hiking, why did you bring me out here?<eos> I didn't bring you out here.

Flynn, if you don't like hiking, why did you bring me out here?<eos> I didn't bring you out here.<eos> The clue in the ledger brought you out here.<eos> No, you did.<eos> Charlene didn't know the name of the Alaskan town I lived in as a kid.<eos> You did.<eos> You've been secretive, evasive, you tore a page out of the ledger.<eos> You, the Librarian, destroying a book!<eos> So tell me, why did you drag me out to the middle of the Alaskan forest?<eos> All right, the reason that I brought you out here is...
If we leave the grounds, we revert to darkness dwellers.<eos> Okay, then why did they last so long in Charleston?<eos> You will have full access to everyone.<eos> I want to know how this happened as much as you do.<eos> You can start with me.<eos> I don't know who could be doing this.<eos> I thought everyone was happy here.<eos> I mean, I admit that I sometimes miss the outside world.<eos> But this place, it's protected.<eos> It's our home, like your Library protects you.
I've known for half of my life that I was gonna die.<eos> Just didn't think it would be this soon.<eos> I always thought that when the time came I'd be ready.<eos> Turns out you're never ready.<eos> - I would give anything...<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Last time we spoke, you were at the anger stage of grief.<eos> Now you've moved to bargaining.<eos> You can't really bargain with a tumor.<eos> So what if... it could remain a part of you but you could go on living?
Don't you miss it?<eos> The world?<eos> We can leave here now.<eos> We can be who we were always meant to be.<eos> I am who I was meant to be.<eos> Time to taste Librarian.<eos> Jenkins!<eos> Where's Cassandra?<eos> Careful, hermana.<eos> I'm more powerful than you.
Careful, hermana.<eos> I'm more powerful than you.<eos> I've actually had a meal in the last 50 years.<eos> You don't know power.<eos> Little girl.<eos> You thought you could drive that through my heart?<eos> No.<eos> Then, what are you gonna do with it, huh?<eos> Give it to your sister.<eos> I love you, Tomas.
Then, what are you gonna do with it, huh?<eos> Give it to your sister.<eos> I love you, Tomas.<eos> - Estrella.<eos> - Cassandra.<eos> - Cassandra?<eos> - Step aside.<eos> She needs a hospital, now!<eos> You are so beautiful.<eos> Uh-huh. When the Library selected you, it chose wisely.
3-6-7.<eos> That's it.<eos> I figured it out.<eos> How did I figure it out?<eos> Um, guys...<eos> About that no-gift thing...<eos> Congratulations.<eos> They said your surgery was a complete success.<eos> Incredibly.<eos> When you collapsed and your friends rushed you off, I didn't know what to think.
It's a surprise, dear.<eos> Today's going to be a very exciting day.<eos> This is it.<eos> Mei went through here.<eos> Sure was nice of chicken boy to give us a skeleton key.<eos> I'm pretty sure it wasn't out of the goodness of his heart.<eos> You didn't even try to stop me from bashing that kid's head in.<eos> You've taught me a lot about futility.<eos> Nah.<eos> I think I just beat you to it.
You were told what you needed to know, and you've helped quite enough already.<eos> It's time you stopped looking for places to project your guilt.<eos> All you need to do now is sit tight, keep your mouth shut, and go home.<eos> Transport's on its way. It'll be here in a few hours.<eos> You make sure your bags are packed.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> You lied to me about Ganymede.<eos> You all lied about Travis.<eos> You've been lying to me this whole time!<eos> That's what's bothering you?
You used the protomolecule on children.<eos> What were you doing here?<eos> We made the protomolecule do what we wanted.<eos> We made it in our own image.<eos> And there's a lot more where she came from.<eos> Whoa, whoa! Hold on!<eos> Hold on, there, buddy!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> It's me, brother.<eos> Alex, I could kiss you on the mouth right now.
And it's the simplest thing.<eos> But it's the hardest thing to remember.<eos> Listen to your heart.<eos> No matter what.<eos> It'll always be the right call.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're kinda freaking me out, Dad.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sorry, man. I don't mean to...<eos> I don't mean to freak you out.
- Who the hell are you?<eos> Please put those down, and step away from the panel, right now.<eos> The hell I will...<eos> Station power's failing.<eos> There's no time for this shit.<eos> Move!<eos> Move!<eos> So where's the old lady?<eos> I was told...<eos> It's Madam Undersecretary to you.
There's no time for this shit.<eos> Move!<eos> Move!<eos> So where's the old lady?<eos> I was told...<eos> It's Madam Undersecretary to you.<eos> Or just Madam.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> You're with us because you betrayed your oath.<eos> Is that a habit for you?
We have confirmed rendezvous coordinates for Mr. Mao's ship.<eos> We will be departing momentarily.<eos> Nice of you to join us.<eos> Just making sure they didn't lose our luggage.<eos> When was the last time you left Earth?<eos> None of your goddamn business.<eos> Thought so.<eos> When you mysteriously vanish, no one will ever find your body.<eos> We used to use that for target practice.<eos> Ah, this must be weird for you.

I need to break it in.<eos> Well, sir, you're in luck.<eos> Scottish gold. It's 107 years old.<eos> Found in a shipwreck off Scapa Flow.<eos> Oh.<eos> 107 years old...<eos> I love that about Earth.<eos> Well, you know what, you take that bottle.<eos> But as for the protomolecule, Sergeant Draper was witness to a game-changing technology, and there can't be peace if one of us has it and not the other.<eos> I understand you, Pyotr, because...
You mean it veered off?<eos> Or went stealth?<eos> Nah, I mean it...<eos> It went dead.<eos> There's still a heat signature where it used to be, but it's all scattered and dissipating.<eos> I think someone blew it up.<eos> You gonna behave like a pack of animals?<eos> That's how I treat you!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> You push him again, I send you out the nearest airlock, sa sa ke?
- Yes.<eos> I actually kind of like this show.<eos> I hope there's another one.<eos> My dad used to make me watch it and I hated it then, but now I kind of think it's funny.<eos> - You watched TV with your dad?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Cool.<eos> Well, it's almost 9:00 PM, so...<eos> Come on, can we watch one more, please?<eos> I told your dad I'd get you to bed by 9:00 PM and he's coming back soon, so...
I'm gonna get you!<eos> Ah! What are you doing?<eos> ! No, stop it!<eos> I'm gonna get you!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> The fuck?<eos> Hello?<eos> Meg?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he come after you?
Oh, my God, Max!<eos> The diner people put money in our PayPal account!<eos> They say it's from Chestnut, but he's not allowed on the Internet when we're not home.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Me neither.<eos> The diner people are all we have in this world.<eos> And I used to have a closet just for scarves.<eos> No! That Randy's happy without me.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> I'm dragging you all over the country after some guy who isn't even interested in me anymore.

That Randy's happy without me.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> I'm dragging you all over the country after some guy who isn't even interested in me anymore.<eos> This is my worst idea since I told DeNiro to stick to comedy.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> So... I'm saying this is a mistake.<eos> Let's just go home like you said after that hyena knocked you to the ground and tried to hump you.
Somebody help.<eos> I think my robot's broken.<eos> It's an acting exercise, Max.<eos> It stretches out the mouth.<eos> Uh, I think all those teeth do the trick.<eos> I just want to be prepared.<eos> I mean, maybe I'm not just on this journey for you.<eos> Maybe I'm supposed to be discovered as an actress.<eos> Maybe something's finally about me.<eos> Everything is always about you.
Is "they" all of New York?<eos> Oi!<eos> Drop the brains, you zombie scum!<eos> Yeah, the script says "brightly," not "British."<eos> I mean, I can't move to LA.<eos> We've worked too hard getting the dessert bar to where it is.<eos> I can be happy with the long-distance thing.<eos> I mean, it's better than nothing, and I don't have to shave as much.<eos> Well, none of that's A-material, but it's how you feel, so just go tell him before he goes off again.<eos> I'm pushing you with my stub.
But she thinks I'm a mama.<eos> Well, she also thinks that Danny Glover is the president.<eos> Dadushki!<eos> Oh, my gosh, Oleg, did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You just said it.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It was Barbara.<eos> Barbara just called you Dadushki.
What are you doing?<eos> Do you have to pee?<eos> Because I find if you go in your pants a little and then a little and then a little, it's not that noticeable.<eos> I was gonna give you a hug.<eos> Mm. All right, bring it in.<eos> Ahh. - You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> My relationship is really over, and I'm starting to lose feeling in my downstairs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged you across the country.
I wanted to be here with you.<eos> Let's go home, Max.<eos> I'll tell Bonnie we're quitting, and we'll tell the press it was exhaustion.<eos> No.<eos> We're not going anywhere yet.<eos> We came all this way.<eos> At least one of us should get what they want.<eos> You are gonna be in this movie.<eos> Max!<eos> I won't forget about you when I'm big.

I mean, stability.<eos> See?<eos> Told you it was loose.<eos> I guess I have stick around as long as it takes until it's fixed.<eos> Oh, good, because I wouldn't feel safe pulling aggressively on anything until you do.<eos> Caroline!<eos> We got to get to the hospital.<eos> Oh, no, I'm fine.<eos> Bobby caught me.<eos> Not for you, Vanna Very White.
I'll take the rest of his clothing off from here.<eos> And can you get me a straw so we can share this morphine drip Mai tai style?<eos> You girls have two minutes, and remember, this is a hospital, so no messing around.<eos> Ooh, that's my coconut oil.<eos> Coconut oil?<eos> Great, now he's edible.<eos> Oh, my God, Max.<eos> This is very An Affair to Remember.<eos> I'm more of a Quickie to Forget kind of girl.<eos> No, that Randy came all the way to New York to see you and then got into a tragic accident and now here you are at his bedside.
Whoopi writes all about it in her book.<eos> It's very hard to follow.<eos> Max, these are like pajamas for couples who don't care anymore.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> These puppies care a lot.<eos> Oh, good, they're all gone.<eos> They left me zero room to sign his cast.<eos> I want to get back to the dessert bar while Bobby's still there and possibly working up a little sweat.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'll punch you out.
But if you keep leaving early, they're gonna make you work Christmas.<eos> Nurse, we need all hands on deck.<eos> We've got a 41 in here, and he's a squirter.<eos> You... you're up, girl.<eos> I had the last one.<eos> "Dear Randy, Nice ass.<eos> Nurse Barb."<eos> Well, that is good.<eos> Max.<eos> I didn't wake you, did I?
So you weren't here to see me.<eos> No, I was trying not to see you.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Max.<eos> You broke up with me.<eos> That time over the phone?<eos> You took that seriously?<eos> That's insane.<eos> The "This is a cry for attention" was implied.<eos> What I heard was, "This isn't enough for me," and since we can't make it work, it just... it's... it's too hard for me to see you.
Everyone said I was crazy because I thought I saw you and Caroline on set.<eos> My therapist put me on antidepressants.<eos> Yeah, well, joke's on them, 'cause it really was me hanging there.<eos> Max, that's crazy.<eos> Why didn't you say something when you saw me?<eos> Because you said you were in a good place and you want to move on, blah, blah, blah.<eos> And I don't want to hurt you anymore.<eos> But now I want to break your other leg.<eos> Max, look at us.<eos> I ran to the airport and got hit by a cab trying to get out of here because I was tempted to see you.
- Yes.<eos> Good, 'cause I was this close to calling my cousins to come in and tear this place apart.<eos> - I'm gonna call you.<eos> - Ciao mein.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Wow, look at you.<eos> I'm gonna have to put the brakes on that 40-Year-Old-Virgin sequel.<eos> I'm sorry I'm happy when you're not happy.<eos> I am happy... for you.
I know you said you didn't want to talk about it, but why don't you just go to LA to be with Randy?<eos> I can't go to LA.<eos> I mean, there's too much stuff here they don't have there, like... the Statue of Liberty.<eos> You know she's my girl.<eos> You never want to go.<eos> And she invited us when she said,<eos> "Bring us your poor."<eos> Plus, where would I find weed in California?<eos> I mean, the list goes on and on.<eos> I wouldn't leave you either.
No, I wouldn't have.<eos> Get us the fuck out of here.<eos> Rhoades is gonna flip one of your guys.<eos> When this is over, you'll be able to stand tall knowing that you did the right thing by cooperating.<eos> He has.<eos> I got word.<eos> Where do I sign?<eos> What do I do?<eos> - Flip him back. - How?<eos> I introduced you to a man who can get that done.
You wouldn't let him do what he wanted.<eos> Well, I fucking will now.<eos> Anything he says.<eos> You goddamned better, because I need you to gut this motherfucker Rhoades for both of us.<eos> I will.<eos> I'll get out here.<eos> When you get back to your country house tonight, go out back and take a sauna.<eos> Get focused.<eos> That's an order.<eos> You know, I usually get a full-on Woodrow Wilson going when I'm billing a client for hundreds of lawyer hours a week. But, every hour I spend with you, I'm aware little by little, you're getting wiped out, and that's even though I'm underbilling you.
Kaboom! There it is.<eos> Look at the balls on you.<eos> Yes on the comp, no on the stake.<eos> No one owns any of it but me.<eos> But a profit share and payout equal to one percent in the case of a sale.<eos> You were dug in the last time I saw you.<eos> Still pretty angry.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> So, what changed?<eos> When you came to my office, I asked you to back off, and you did.
I'll have my lawyers give you an official letter guaranteeing it, with dates certain and penalties attached.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you in the office tomorrow.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> That's why you filed those suits in the first place, so I'd cave and come to you with this deal.<eos> Well, not to restart our partnership with a lie... it's not the only reason.<eos> But yes, that was a scenario that I had gamed out.<eos> Our deal hold?<eos> Yes. But not for you. You want a session, see someone else.
But the guys have made it clear, through their results and their words, that they need her.<eos> I thought you had a new man.<eos> Wags convinced me to try him out, but Wags was pretty fucked up at the time.<eos> You're not thinking about bringing Wendy back. It's a done deal, isn't it?<eos> You're actually lying to me now.<eos> I'd like your blessing.<eos> Take it.<eos> Bobby, take the fucking call.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I love you.
I'm on my way out.<eos> Jury selection.<eos> So...<eos> Well, I'll make this quick.<eos> I was just thinking about something that Harry Houdini once said.<eos> "An old trick well done is far better than a new trick with no effect."<eos> Houdini have any other advice... like, how to get out of a straitjacket underwater?<eos> I'm gonna look for a way out in there.<eos> And when this is over, we need to have a talk about my future here.<eos> You know why I hired you?
Look, what if I agree that I, personally, won't see her?<eos> I'll draw a line.<eos> She and I will never have any sessions. That way, she'll never have anything on me.<eos> Can you live with that?<eos> I can try.<eos> There you go, gentlemen.<eos> - Congrats. - All right. - Well done.<eos> Top-drawer.<eos> On my account, pal. Enjoy it.<eos> Couldn't be happier for you.
Thank you for this tribute.<eos> It means a great deal, celebrating this victory with you both.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Enjoy the scotch.<eos> Hall!<eos> Sandicot's not getting the gaming license.<eos> The commission went another way, gave it to a town in the Catskills.<eos> I'm looking into what happened, but it's over.<eos> Are you there?<eos> I'm so happy for you.
Let's not do anything to spoil the tremendous day you've had.<eos> Yeah, it's too late for that.<eos> I went back to work at Axe Capital.<eos> And, um, are you gonna try to insist that you did it for me?<eos> No.<eos> I wanted to go back.<eos> Chuck. It's my work.<eos> And when I didn't have it anymore, it... it left a hole I tried very hard to fill, but couldn't.<eos> So yes, I went back for me, but in doing it, I found a way to help you, too.<eos> Well, I'm happy that it works for you.
But that obsession nearly had me out on the street.<eos> So now I have to ask what's the upside?<eos> Seeing that fuck in jail.<eos> You still want that, don't you?<eos> I want to see him in the ground.<eos> But I also want to see myself in Albany and you in here.<eos> So maybe there will be a time when the moment presents itself, and then I'll sign subpoenas and request warrants and we'll mobilize and we will take him.<eos> But that can't be now.<eos> I'm glad I stayed.<eos> I'm glad I let you.
He's got piss all over his big boy's.<eos> I'm just gonna play one.<eos> Maybe two.<eos> Foley doesn't fuck around.<eos> That's Ben Folds.<eos> No, even when he fucks around, he means business.<eos> - Mr. Rhoades.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mr. Foley would like to see you in the library.<eos> Your father's been telling me about you since you were in knickerbockers.
No, even when he fucks around, he means business.<eos> - Mr. Rhoades.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mr. Foley would like to see you in the library.<eos> Your father's been telling me about you since you were in knickerbockers.<eos> Don't think I ever wore those.<eos> No, he showed me the pictures.<eos> Must have been you.<eos> He'd never go around with photos of the bastards.<eos> He's put a lot of time into you.
We apologize on his behalf.<eos> That type of rudeness is unacceptable.<eos> You know, they say that a boy never really becomes a man until he's buried his father.<eos> Now, mine's been dead to me since the moment he walked out when I was 12 years old.<eos> I don't remember if I cried, but I do remember that I was forced to grow the fuck up.<eos> So it always warms my heart when I see a boy who still has his father's shoulder to lean on, his father's contacts to deploy, his father's balls clanking around in place of his own,<eos> Hold on to this man, Chuck, for one day soon, he will be gone, and then you will finally have to do something for yourself.<eos> Dad.<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> Son, everything I did was for you.

From the day I passed the bar, I have said those words to myself the first morning of every trial.<eos> - You can still say the words.<eos> - Hello. I'm Taylor.<eos> My pronouns are "they," "theirs," and "them."<eos> You see things differently.<eos> That's an edge.<eos> That's Camelot right there.<eos> That is a picture of a man running for office.<eos> - Our deal hold?<eos> - Yes, but not for you.
Try Taylor Mason.<eos> They have become something of a prodigy, a go-to.<eos> Anything big Axe is wading into, Taylor's there with a snorkel mask.<eos> I believe it's time, nay, long past time, to transform your charitable arm and engender a permanent foundation.<eos> Properly stewarded, it will write the name of your benevolence on the ages, alongside Carnegie, Vanderbilt. A creation of consequence.<eos> Because otherwise, what's it all for? Is that right?<eos> I don't pretend to answer that which lies in the realm of the theologians.<eos> Yet you just happened to pitch me legacy on my birthday?<eos> I won't claim happenstance.<eos> This is the time when a man like you allows reflection to dictate action.
But today is your lucky day, because I do want to set up a permanent foundation with you as its steward.<eos> I accept.<eos> With one urgent recommendation.<eos> Cancel your party.<eos> That's direct.<eos> You just offered me enough, so I have to be.<eos> You cannot throw a lavish party at the very moment when you're draining the meager resources of what amounts to a village of apple-cheeked orphans.<eos> That party was organized long before Sandicot got grounded.<eos> A change of course? That's reactionary.<eos> Weak. I am not hiring you to serve me weak tea.
Half my life now is ass-covering and optics, fucking optics of everything from parties to put options.<eos> I'm spending half a mil on some stuffed shirt to brush up my fucking image.<eos> Come on, maybe we should split for the weekend, now, before we need the goddamn Arque.<eos> And bail on the party?<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> We'll celebrate our way.<eos> No.<eos> Big occasions like this need to be marked, acknowledged, for posterity and for fun.<eos> You deserve to be celebrated.<eos> And you should be surrounded by your whole gang so they can honor you, too.
Not a lot of flights.<eos> You're rich.<eos> They're called private planes.<eos> I almost booked it.<eos> I just don't know if I can actually get on it.<eos> The carbon footprint alone is...<eos> You're really that worried about the world ending? Yes.<eos> What about your own world?<eos> Not so much.<eos> Well, before that existential dread racks you, buy some offsets.
and hope you are, you will get him... on something else.<eos> You know it's not the first time Axe has gone bad on something.<eos> What did Thayer give you, four points?<eos> I don't handcuff. You're free to go after Thayer if you want.<eos> But play out those dominoes first, and not just for Axe.<eos> Thayer takes a hit, the casino goes away.<eos> Those upstate jobs go away.<eos> It leaks that my father started things in Sandicot... and the last one falls on me.<eos> Chuck, Sandicot is a circle.<eos> Wherever you start on that path, it leads right back to you... to us.
But you made a mistake letting me go.<eos> You cut me, but you cut yourself worse in the process.<eos> You're not wrong, Victor.<eos> You were collateral damage.<eos> I regretted it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Briefly.<eos> And for a few moments after, which surprised me.<eos> You getting soft?<eos> I came all the way out here, Victor, on the recommendation of a dear friend, to look at you.
- Really?<eos> - Briefly.<eos> And for a few moments after, which surprised me.<eos> You getting soft?<eos> I came all the way out here, Victor, on the recommendation of a dear friend, to look at you.<eos> - What do you see?<eos> - A man who's stuck... at a boutique firm, a glorified day trader.<eos> Making good money, but not as good as it used to be.<eos> But that's not the sticky part.<eos> You can't be who you are, and it's ripping you up.
- A man who's stuck... at a boutique firm, a glorified day trader.<eos> Making good money, but not as good as it used to be.<eos> But that's not the sticky part.<eos> You can't be who you are, and it's ripping you up.<eos> Bit by bit.<eos> What do you have and what do you want?<eos> I want back in.<eos> Not with the main fund. I understand you can't do that, and I don't want you to.<eos> I want my own shop, a satellite.<eos> Terms will be very generous for you the first few years, and I will give you the prime fucking meats.
Kingsford?<eos> I think it's best we not discuss that.<eos> With your position, that would be unethical.<eos> But there is a solution.<eos> The chunk of cash I need is on a statement with your name on it.<eos> - The blind trust.<eos> - But, why tell me about it?<eos> Isn't the whole point to a blind trust that I'm not supposed to know what you're doing with the money?<eos> No, not this time.<eos> That trust was set aside for you and the children.
Yeah.<eos> Tight little body.<eos> Dad.<eos> Well, she's not vetting me.<eos> Thank God for that.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.<eos> You know what?<eos> You leaving is one thing, but taking my boys, what the fuck?<eos> I don't get pissed and look to punish you.

Leave a message.<eos> You know what?<eos> You leaving is one thing, but taking my boys, what the fuck?<eos> I don't get pissed and look to punish you.<eos> And, you know, whatever you think of Wendy Rhoades, she's good for Axe Cap, and what is good for Axe Cap is good for us.<eos> And what's good for us is good for you.
Yep.<eos> I'll make this look like the Rose Parade.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I went to Terry's bar.<eos> The memories came flooding back.<eos> Us there at the beginning, right after I got struck by the thunderbolt like Michael with Apollonia.<eos> And I was thinking about all that rail shit we used to drink, but we were already drunk from being with each other, so we didn't care.<eos> And then I flipped totally to the other extreme.<eos> To Paris.<eos> That rainy night. We wouldn't get out of bed even though the iPod was playing "With or Without You" on repeat, and so we ended up listening to it all night.
What would it cost to make you disappear?<eos> Five, ten, twenty million?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because the job means something to me.<eos> If it ceases to, I'll go, but money means too little to me and I have too much of it to make decisions that way.<eos> Bobby's the same.<eos> I know it.<eos> And you love it.<eos> You married a guy who does whatever the fuck he wants because he has no reason not to except you.
Quick catch up.<eos> You're my business partner. So you get the slice and a Coke on the arm.<eos> But that don't buy you a conversation with me.<eos> Anything else I can get you?<eos> No.<eos> Hi, it's Lara.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> You're punishing me.<eos> I get it.<eos> I get it. I have never punished you. Not once.
Yeah. Yeah, worth the trip.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How was the rest of your day?<eos> - It didn't get much better.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Last fucking thing I want to do is this.<eos> Honestly... that's great to hear I'm not the only one.<eos> I thought you fucking loved this stuff.<eos> Like it was oxygen to you.
Ma'am, American University is a fine institution.<eos> American University sounds like a made-up college in Egypt.<eos> Okay? I don't want my library there.<eos> Well, technically, it wouldn't even be a library.<eos> - What? - It won't be a library, ma'am.<eos> No, I heard her.<eos> You understand that, Amy, that even Richard has trouble understanding you?
No, I have to get going.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We'll fuck again tonight at 7:30 with less kissing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, no, 7:30 works.<eos> - I'm taking a Pop-Tart.<eos> - Can I ask you a question?<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my God, get to it.<eos> What? Did my missing ball freak you out?
And people are resting their...<eos> Like, their balls?<eos> Not just the beans.<eos> Also, the franks.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> They will be arrested.<eos> Will they?<eos> There's a lot there.<eos> There's a lot there.<eos> I got a lot of pictures to show you.
We'll see you in the tomorrow.<eos> - Bye, now.<eos> - Bye.<eos> And we are clear.<eos> - Jane, perfect as always.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> Hey, so, Danny, before I have a morning bagel, I just wanna make sure you don't wanna fuck that, too.<eos> Page six. - "Jane McCabe's boy toy steps out with beefy blonde."<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Yeah, I don't think Jane's gonna like you out with a younger woman.
- Yeah. She's gonna get into the school anyway.<eos> - She's Asian.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - He can't afford private school to begin with.<eos> - That's what I told him.<eos> It's like she doesn't hear me or even see me.<eos> And anytime she does, all she cares about is tearing me down,<eos> - and it's like she's trying to ruin everything.<eos> - Okay, Catherine,<eos> I know I'm not supposed to interrupt you, but do you realize these are the same complaints you've had for 15 years?
Who went pee-pee in his Coke?<eos> I'm sorry, Selina.<eos> The deal's off.<eos> But my speech!<eos> I...<eos> Colonel Al-Saleh felt that you could've been a bit more enthusiastic.<eos> What do I have to do, pull out my clit and cut it off in front of everyone to get anything done in this world?<eos> As we say in Qatar, "You should never build your house on shifting sands."<eos> Okay, well, everything's built on sand here, so that doesn't make any sense at all.<eos> The point is there will be other deals down the line for you, Selina.
- It's about time. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Until then, I'm Brie Ramachandran.<eos> And I'm Dan Egan, bringing you your morning every morning of every day for many mornings to come.<eos> And we are clear.<eos> Great show, people!<eos> What'd you think of that new sign-off?<eos> You sound like a Scientologist.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second...
Oh, right.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll go.<eos> Okay?<eos> But I am not gonna have a good time.<eos> And if one person mentions Tom James to me, I'm gonna go piss in that punch bowl.<eos> - This country doesn't deserve you.<eos> - I know it.<eos> Voting closes in five minutes and we're still missing votes.<eos> Well, well, well, sorry, boys, no votes today on legalizing tiny Fleshlights for micro wangs.<eos> Except for you, Gellardi.
Hey, Fuckleberry Finn!<eos> Christ, you got old.<eos> - You wanna work for that guy?<eos> - I really do.<eos> - Tom!<eos> Hi!<eos> - Madam President.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Can I have a private word with you?<eos> Would that be all right, or are you afraid that I'll rape you again?
I came to you in good faith and I asked!<eos> - Well...<eos> - I did the classy thing.<eos> Come on, we both know you were gonna go ahead and do it anyway.<eos> Of course I was, but I had the courtesy to seem like I might not!<eos> And then with that TV appearance.<eos> Me the aggressor?<eos> What is that? !<eos> That is sick, sociopathic shit.<eos> I'm worried about you.
He's not gonna get away with that.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ma'am!<eos> I'm back.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You really wanted me, didn't you?<eos> There were sparks practically flying out of your dick!<eos> Why am I getting this sense of déjà vu?<eos> No, no, no, I'm not talking about the Green Room.<eos> That was just a good, old-fashioned hate fuck.<eos> Selina, I do not and never have hated you!
- That was...<eos> You want to throw me onto this couch and pin my legs behind my head and do me.<eos> - I am a happily married man, Selina.<eos> - Oh, that's not an answer!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you? !<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Okay, wha... this!<eos> What do you want me to say, Selina?<eos> What do you want me to say, Tom, huh?<eos> That back when I was in the Senate, the only reason that I co-sponsored S-473 was because I had a crush on you?
- This is so inappropriate.<eos> - Excuse us.<eos> - It's not in here.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't have my diary.<eos> - Then look harder!<eos> - It's gotta be in there!<eos> - Shit.<eos> Mike, that diary is all you're good for.<eos> The diary should've lost you.
Who donated that whole wing to Hughes's library?<eos> Yeah, Quartie and I are dear friends.<eos> Our houses share a beach path and a vineyard.<eos> We don't let the public use it, of course.<eos> You had me at beach path.<eos> Yeah, Carly Simon is on the other side.<eos> You know, she has this tree. It just sort of hangs over the property line.<eos> Could you do me a favor?<eos> You think you could talk to Quartie about maybe donating a few mil to my library?<eos> I'll make that call for you.

- And what?<eos> Oh, no diary.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Mike, I am going to choke you to death with your urine-soaked jacket.<eos> It's not urine, okay?<eos> It's probably just water from the urinal.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> God, Jesus!<eos> I can tell you that the diary is not in your ass crack because I have had a very good view of the strawberry fields for the last hour.
- Well, the president...<eos> - Don't interrupt me, boy!<eos> Smoky bronze eye?<eos> God, don't you know that woman needs a pop of color?<eos> Classic red lip.<eos> - That's what she needs. - Hmm.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - How are you?<eos> You can't let your father talk to you like that.<eos> He's always interrupting you and insulting you.
I skinned it and I made a fur vest and matching boots for my G.I. Joe doll.<eos> Bam, sucker!<eos> Neat.<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mike and Amy texted that they had to head up to the National Archives.<eos> Okay.<eos> Richard, what do you know about jug bands?<eos> - Everything.<eos> - Ugh, what would I do without you?
I don't know who you are anymore.<eos> Stewart, is that you?<eos> Jesus, Mary, and Robert E. Lee, Gary!<eos> - You startled me.<eos> - What are you doing...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no.<eos> You snooping on me?<eos> - No, I wasn't snooping...<eos> - Oh, and what are you doing?<eos> Did your lady boss send you down to get her "tampoons," did she?
You are... you are a bully!<eos> - No, that's not it.<eos> - You're a big, fat, flaming bully!<eos> And you know what, you can take Teddy and Bobby and Stewart and the other Bobby, and you can be their daddy!<eos> - Eh, getting warmer. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna slow dance with Mama.<eos> Mama.<eos> Of course, Gary.<eos> Hey, everybody eat!<eos> Danny, where the fuck were you?<eos> I've been trying to call you all night.
Thank you, yeah.<eos> Hey, handsome.<eos> Let the record state I did try to call you.<eos> What is the Host of Christmas Past doing here?<eos> - Our interview.<eos> Checkers, bitch.<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> !<eos> Dan, you've heard the old saying,<eos> "You gotta keep your friends close and make your enemies take you out to Guy Fieri's restaurant in Times Square."
- What? I'm not on bed rest.<eos> - My cervix is as tight as a snare drum.<eos> - Oh, yes, it is.<eos> I'm not mentioned in this book until page 134.<eos> I once dry-shaved that woman's legs under her desk during a cabinet meeting.<eos> Yeah, I'm not in there till 213, and I wrote the book.<eos> (gasps) Ooh, page 93, suckers!<eos> "As Gary poured my tea, I realized the hostages..." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - Oh, yes!<eos> - Amy:<eos> How about you, Richard?
How about that? - We don't want to.<eos> - I don't give a fuck what you want!<eos> I have your ball, so you have to join my league.<eos> I get first pick, and I pick Graves.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Why are you picking me?<eos> Because you're so tall.<eos> Oh, God, who the fuck invited Dikembe Mutomtard?<eos> A little word of advice, Congressman, don't wear the shorts.<eos> Even Kobe Bryant wouldn't rape you in those things.
You know what I think? You sound like the world's gayest AM radio show.<eos> Now, guys, what is our move with Leon?<eos> - Well, he really likes Amy.<eos> Ew!<eos> No!<eos> She's all over his diary.<eos> She's in every page. You're kidding me.<eos> - No!<eos> - Amy, Amy.<eos> (scoffs) Come on, nobody's asking you to engage in some sort of human pleasurable activity.
It is tea so she could calm.<eos> Not!<eos> Not!<eos> Not!<eos> No!<eos> What happened?<eos> Unfortunately, you ... sick.<eos> It takes time to realize your wish<eos> Dead!<eos> I'll be with you.
He told me that it would not follow the ritual again<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Now you must know.<eos> My family is cursed!<eos> People you see in the room is what we are known as "Mother".<eos> He killed my mother and father paralyzed making.<eos> Why should it be me?<eos> His body was decomposed, and in need of a new body.<eos> The girl had to be involved as a family member.<eos> I should not have brought you here but he just wants us look for the photo in her diary.
Previously on "The Path"...<eos> - I want to apologize.<eos> - I would ask that you stop your campaign of false propaganda.<eos> The stuff that DeKaan puts in that water isn't going to show up on your average tests.<eos> - Can you find it?<eos> - Yeah, but it's not cheap.<eos> I told the people of Clarksville that I would test their water, and now I need the funds to do it.<eos> - She blackmailed you.
Our kid's locked up.<eos> No, no, I want a real lawyer, not your cult lawyer.<eos> - So that's what you think now, I'm in a cult?<eos> - Sarah, this is bullshit, okay?<eos> - This is our kid.<eos> - Okay, I need you to stay calm.<eos> Let me explain what's going on because it isn't good.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> - We're gonna get you out of here.
- He's being detained until they set bail.<eos> - When's that?<eos> - We don't have a date yet.<eos> They have 45 hours.<eos> - I re-listened to our sourcing session this morning, and some of your prior unburdening tapes.<eos> Your baby died.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That must be the most brutal thing in the world.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What... what if we could reunite you with your family?
- Just unburden.<eos> - I'm not the one who needs to unburden.<eos> I know why Kodiak went to Siberia. - To escape persecution.<eos> - It had nothing to do with me.<eos> - He wanted to get over you.<eos> - He got caught dealing marijuana.<eos> I'm not having this conversation. - I need to because having him here is throwing me off.<eos> - I'm with you, Hank.<eos> You...<eos> I always have been. Don't let your fears send you down that road again.
We're talking to Libby.<eos> - Look, I've called her, all right?<eos> She won't pick up.<eos> - Eddie, we will take care of this.<eos> - This is a family matter, Cal.<eos> Sarah, just get in the car.<eos> We're gonna go help Hawk.<eos> - Tell me what you need me to do, all right?<eos> I want to help you take care of this.<eos> - I can have him taken away from you, Sarah.
What?<eos> Sam?<eos> I'm sure Layla is fine.<eos> Let me know how she does, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Find anything?<eos> Beside the usual incongruities and Transgress.<eos> - Lots of Damage and despair.<eos> There's work to be done.<eos> Luckily we have some time for you today.
- I've thought about being back here so many times.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you seeing that girl from the hospital?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you and Cal?<eos> - No. We could never be together like that.<eos> I promise.<eos> - I'm worried about you.<eos> Hey. The hospital helped.<eos> - Did they put you on medication?
- It's really not my phone.<eos> I don't even know what that kind of phone is.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, what... What happened?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> - Look, she, uh, she had a meeting.<eos> Hawk, listen to me.<eos> I know... I let you down with me leaving, but... I want to make things right with you, okay?
You think there's more to it than whatever made the rest of us ill?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Why did you decide to cover for Annie?<eos> You saw Geoff at the cricket.<eos> He's hardly Zafar's biggest fan.<eos> I doubt he'd welcome his daughter seeing him.<eos> You knew?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Sneaking off to the cricket pavilion at lunchtime.<eos> Him bringing in stray cats just to see you.
Good boy.<eos> I got a call from Geoff Towler saying Munir broke his window yesterday.<eos> He said you were with him.<eos> That right?<eos> Come in.<eos> So, how long's it been going on?<eos> You and Margaret.<eos> Since you and me had that fight.<eos> I let you get that lucky punch in, remember?<eos> I'm not blaming you.
Since you and me had that fight.<eos> I let you get that lucky punch in, remember?<eos> I'm not blaming you.<eos> I was just...<eos> I was on my own, Sidney, and she was there.<eos> - Cathy was there.<eos> - It's not the same.<eos> I work.<eos> Cathy cooks.<eos> She loves you.
He didn't pray as he was supposed to pray.<eos> He loved someone... he wasn't supposed to love.<eos> He held firm when others told him to walk.<eos> The problem is, we don't all want the same thing.<eos> One man's happiness... is another man's sorrow.<eos> Zafar was killed because he didn't fit into somebody else's world.<eos> I'd like to say we should all be more like Zafar.<eos> The truth is... ..the world won't let us.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> - I wasn't expecting you.
I know.<eos> Isn't Bobby the cutest?<eos> Not smoking Chinese baby cute, but not bad.<eos> Max, I'm so excited.<eos> This is the first date I'll be going on since Julia Roberts could still open a romantic comedy.<eos> I'm still pissed at them for stealing my life story for "Pretty Woman."<eos> Jason Alexander's character was totally me.<eos> For our date, he's thinking of taking me on an afternoon picnic in the park.<eos> The pretty one, where you crotch punched that mime into a pond.<eos> You know the fact that Bobby's taking you on a day date is a bad sign, right?
Bobby, I have some good news.<eos> I don't want you to think I'm loose or fast or whatever the kids say, but I am available for a night date, like a person.<eos> Hey, really?<eos> That's great.<eos> I usually save my day dates for my grandma.<eos> She likes a noon dinner.<eos> - I like a noon...<eos> - No.<eos> Since we're going out at night, I can cancel all the romantic errands we were gonna run to the bank and my dry cleaners.<eos> Now I can take you to a movie.
Either way, I'm cutting a hole in someone.<eos> Okay you failed this quiz now twice.<eos> Especially the essay portion.<eos> I'm calling Bobby and canceling.<eos> Oh. They're home.<eos> He means, hey, girls.<eos> How did you get a key to our apartment?<eos> They specifically say on them,<eos> "Do not copy for Oleg."<eos> I find that when you go in a Home Depot pantless, they'll do anything to get you out quick.
Ashleigh!<eos> God, they're multiplying.<eos> Oh, you look so good!<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - You shut up!<eos> You guys should really listen to each other.<eos> Couches in movie theaters?<eos> I feel like Kate Middleton right now.<eos> I'm glad you're easily impressed.<eos> For Valentine's Day, I'll take you to the Super Target cafe.
I'm sorry, Bobby, but you know how turtles can sense if their turtle best friend is stuck upside down on its shell, its turtle legs all wiggling in the air?<eos> So it is drugs.<eos> Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.<eos> We went through that with my mom.<eos> It's a killer.<eos> We almost lost our house.<eos> No, Max and I are the turtles.<eos> And I can feel she's trapped on her back at the dessert bar.<eos> All right, look, I don't know Max that well.<eos> But I've gotten to know you a little bit and you have a really good, really beautiful head on your shoulders.
Let's get out of here and go get some dessert.<eos> I know a great place.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> And I was so worried you'd think I was crazy.<eos> Oh, you're bananas.<eos> But I like bananas.<eos> Not the fruit.<eos> The texture grosses me out.<eos> But you.<eos> I could kiss you for that.
♪♪ I know I've been talking about Bobby all morning, but another thing I love about Bobby is, he just gets me.<eos> Can he come get you right now?
Bobby, you are so sweet.<eos> This has skim milk, right?<eos> Oh, whatever!<eos> Uh, why are you using Max as a human shield?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> It's how my mom robbed all those Carvels in the '90s.<eos> I should get going.<eos> So... group hug?<eos> I'm still trying to figure out where to take you on our third date.
I'll see ya.<eos> Third date?<eos> You know what that means, don't you?<eos> Going by my last third date, he comes out of the closet, and we still date for two years.<eos> No!<eos> It means more neck action, just lower.<eos> Your between-legs neck.<eos> You're an adult, Max.<eos> It's called a noony-noo.<eos> And I thought sex was on the tenth date, after he accidentally says, "I love you."
Ah, see, Max?<eos> She likes my body.<eos> Tastes have changed since I got out of the game.<eos> And these panties are great to bounce in.<eos> The frills on the back really accentuate the twerk when you're doing the Swingin' Linda.<eos> Linda must have a bunch of back problems.<eos> Oh, my God. Do I have to do that?<eos> Whatever happened to lying down?<eos> That's a guy's job now.<eos> Skanks like us ruined that for you.
Like you used to, on my bed, while I'm trying to read?<eos> I like this sexless existence.<eos> I don't know what you've been complaining about.<eos> And besides, I can finally let myself go, hygenital-ly.<eos> So because you got hurt by Randy, you're never gonna have sex again?<eos> No, I'm never having sex again because I have no idea how to take off these pants.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Whoa... Bobby!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't wait till tomorrow night to see you.
No, I'm never having sex again because I have no idea how to take off these pants.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Whoa... Bobby!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't wait till tomorrow night to see you.<eos> I got this from a gay wedding; they were throwing them out 'cause they were the wrong shade of red.<eos> My God, this is just like The Bachelor.<eos> Except I'm not getting HPV from a lagoon.<eos> Hey, don't worry, Max.<eos> I didn't forget you.
Taking all that pain and anger and making it sexy.<eos> I thought this was about making my booty clap.<eos> We'll get there, Gavin.<eos> So tell me about this guy, Randy.<eos> Uh, there's nothing to say.<eos> It's not about him.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Did he bring you down low?<eos> Oh, sure he did. Real low.<eos> Shake you up?
I know, it's...<eos> Hot.<eos> Really, really hot. You look like a sexy pencil.<eos> But I bought all this really sexy, very zipper-heavy underwear to wear on our third date.<eos> Why would I see your underwear on our third date?<eos> Doesn't that happen on the tenth?<eos> That's what I said!<eos> You people are animals!<eos> But what was all that talk about our date being big and exotic?<eos> I was gonna take you to this Moroccan place.
Oh, I guess we'll just hang out here then.<eos> And since there's no pool...<eos> Ahh!<eos> Okay! Okay, fine!<eos> The party's not canceled.<eos> There's no sinkhole.<eos> No one's dead.<eos> Come at 4:00.<eos> Just please don't embarrass me.<eos> Uh, I think that was directed at you, Max.
Well, if there aren't gonna be any guys here, I'm gonna go smoke a J and do my jigsaw.<eos> Definitely popping by Denise's room later.<eos> Bobby, I can't explain it, but somehow, when you stock the Tab in the garage fridge, it just tastes better.<eos> Garage fridge?<eos> How rich are you people?<eos> You know who loved an ice-cold Tab?<eos> Jessica.<eos> Ma!<eos> Really?<eos> I specifically asked you not to bring up Jessica.
She just fell off the wall.<eos> Max, she is trying to destroy me.<eos> Where's my food?<eos> I'm starting to scratch my arms again!<eos> Okay, I'll fix the picture.<eos> Give her my plate.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Let me just take one more big bite.<eos> Give me a little of that.<eos> Oh, damn you, Jessica!
I don't want our meat order to fall into the wrong hands.<eos> No, you pile of felons. I'm closing the diner for Sunday only.<eos> Well, I'm keeping this stuff anyway.<eos> And I really hate it.<eos> My new therapist, Gary, says that I need to take a day off to focus on myself.<eos> Did he give you a magnifying glass for that?<eos> Max, Gary says you use your toxic, mean-spirited jokes to keep people like me at a distance.<eos> You know what else works?<eos> Putting my hand on your forehead.<eos> Max, Gary also says you have a fear of intimacy stemming from your father abandoning you.
Hey there.<eos> It's amazing, I'm somehow less clean now than when I went in.<eos> I gotta get going, babe.<eos> I'll meet you at the dessert bar.<eos> We're having lunch with his mom and his sister.<eos> I'm almost part of the family now.<eos> Well, if you were part of the family you'd be addicted to Diet Pepsi and get into mall fights on Black Friday.<eos> Then I might be a cousin.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> I'll walk you out. If Homeless Larry tries to grab you,
Well, if you were part of the family you'd be addicted to Diet Pepsi and get into mall fights on Black Friday.<eos> Then I might be a cousin.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> I'll walk you out. If Homeless Larry tries to grab you,<eos> - I can fend him off.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, careful, he's got barbecue tongs now.<eos> Look at those two.<eos> That PDA is making me want to M-A-S-T-U...<eos> Ah, I would stop you, but I doubt you know what comes after U.
- What's wrong?<eos> It's a text from Bobby's ex, Jessica.<eos> It says, "Call me about baby."<eos> Do Bobby and Jessica have a baby?<eos> Are they going to have one?<eos> And why does Bobby have a rose gold iPhone?<eos> Maybe he got it with his yearly mammogram.<eos> I knew this relationship was too good to be true.<eos> Looks like I'm not Negative Nancy, more like Reality Check Rita.<eos> Then why the hell have I been calling you Max?
I need your help.<eos> I told you three times, I don't fit up drain pipes.<eos> Listen, I just saw this text on Bobby's phone from his ex-girlfriend, Jessica.<eos> I think they might have a secret baby together.<eos> Wow, that would really devastate Caroline.<eos> More importantly, Bobby and I are rose gold buddies.<eos> I just have to make sure before I say anything to panic Caroline.<eos> I need to do some detective work, so you and I are gonna go down to Jessica's wedding planning business and pretend we're a couple.<eos> Obviously I'll be the groom.<eos> Max, this might come as a surprise to you, but I'm a very busy man.
Seems like everyone's in a fight except for me and Bobby.<eos> Oh, no, we're fighting now.<eos> I saw that text on Bobby's phone, and I didn't want you getting hurt.<eos> The only person who got hurt was me.<eos> I kissed Han on the lips.<eos> Ohhh. Max, you stalked his ex-girlfriend without me?<eos> Pretty shady move by your friend, Caroline.<eos> We may want to think about finding another roommate.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Denise, you need to go back and work for Ma, and not only because that's the only job you're capable of doing, but also 'cause Ma's lost without you.
I should get going, too.<eos> I gotta check some text messages.<eos> And why is my screensaver a shirtless Vin Diesel?<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know trust is hard for me.<eos> That's why I got kicked out of Cirque du Soleil.<eos> You're the first person in my life I can actually count on.<eos> Be so great if they made out right now.<eos> You were the first person I could count on, too.<eos> I love you, Max.
Hey, hey.<eos> You wanna cut that out?<eos> We want them to lose.<eos> If they win tomorrow, the season goes on for two more months.<eos> Haven't we already been here two months?<eos> The foot spray plays games with your mind.<eos> Max, can you come sniff me?<eos> I was hoping the sewer smell from our shower would cover the stink from the bowling alley, but I think they just joined forces.<eos> If you keep smelling like sewers and bowling alleys, we're gonna have to have sex.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, I won't be smelling like a bowling alley anymore because I'm gonna tell Bobby that bowling should be his thing.
I didn't hear you ring your sex bell.<eos> Well, we tried to, but he just seemed confused so I let him go to sleep.<eos> But I did put those hands to work.<eos> I didn't hear your hand stuff buzzer.<eos> I had him work on my laces.<eos> You didn't hear my laces kazoo?<eos> Hey, Max?<eos> I got all the knots out of your shoes.<eos> If I can teach him how to have sex and how to climb onto a bed, I'm locking this down.<eos> Hey, thought I'd surprise you, bring you some coffee.
Raising a baby alone.<eos> My mother was not...<eos> She wasn't around... so I know how it is to be raised by a dad who... It's the last thing that I wanted for Jay.<eos> But that's what he got.<eos> I had no idea what I was doing.<eos> I don't know how to... talk about things or teach someone how to be, you know... a person.<eos> And I messed up... and I raised a boy who...<eos> What?<eos> I think he did it.<eos> I guess that, part of me knew that first night, but when I went out there for you in the mist, I could feel it in every part of me.
You were just following the wrong law.<eos> Does it suit me?<eos> So beautiful.<eos> Come here.<eos> My gosh.<eos> I'm coming for you.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good thing I went with the bigger helmet.<eos> Wait. Let me get to you.
Hey, the woman lost her daughter.<eos> I don't need her gaslighting people into hysteria.<eos> The grieving woman is hysterical?<eos> That's how you're playing this?<eos> She has a point.<eos> I'm just trying to keep my mall safe.<eos> It's not your mall, mister.<eos> Where have you guys been?<eos> Just skating.<eos> Your mom's been looking for you.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> Who's that out there?<eos> It's Alex's dad.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did he give it to you, too?<eos> He always seemed a little light in his shoes.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> They are more of a family to me than you ever were.<eos> Not that that's hard with a psycho like you.<eos> You know Mom was afraid of you, right?

Not the cocksucking, though.<eos> She was okay with that.<eos> Hell, even I could have been okay if you'd only been just right in the head.<eos> You're lying.<eos> All those pills that she took, she couldn't stand to be around you.<eos> Stop saying that!<eos> I know what you said to her.<eos> I know what you called her.<eos> She told me.<eos> She wouldn't leave you.
I promised him I would keep them safe.<eos> Did you ever have kids?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> There's nothing on earth that makes you feel so big and so inadequate all at the same time.<eos> I know that Alex had nothing to do with the mist.<eos> I just couldn't take seeing her alive, happy even.<eos> It was you who set the fire.<eos> Jesus, Shelley, you gotta stop this craziness.<eos> They're starting to believe you.<eos> You have to confess, or I'll do it for you.
And the others?<eos> They were afraid to tell you.<eos> They didn't want to disappoint you.<eos> It's not that we don't believe you.<eos> We just... It's safer here.<eos> We want to wait and see.<eos> I understand.<eos> You do?<eos> Thank you.<eos> May She bless you.
The station is that way.<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> That is easy.<eos> I saw you and I followed.<eos> You followed me?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Act normal.<eos> Everything's normal.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is for you.
So good to see you again.<eos> You, as well.<eos> You have a beautiful home.<eos> So glad you could make it to my good-bye party.<eos> You're leaving us already?<eos> My work in berlin beckons, I'm afraid.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> When must you go?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I had my doubts bringing you to poland, But I was impressed with how you handled. The saboteurs at the refinery.
It will be a truly historic celebration.<eos> And he mentioned to me he'll be attending an exclusive gala.<eos> Inner circle only.<eos> I'm sure it will be memorable.<eos> They have a lot to be proud of.<eos> I'll let you know how it goes.<eos> Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt told me. That all the single men are asked. To bring a female companion.<eos> Purely platonic, of course.<eos> Someone who embodies the highest feminine values of the reich.<eos> What an opportunity for you.
Heidi.<eos> Heidi.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I need to change.<eos> Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt has organized a pheasant hunt. And I detest side-saddle.<eos> Do you have any riding gear to spare?<eos> You ride?<eos> Not for a long time, But I'd love to come along.<eos> Women don't usually go on the hunt.<eos> Except for you.
Come on.<eos> We have to warn the others!<eos> Off the hour. It's a warning.<eos> The germans must already be there.<eos> They were supposed to come by train.<eos> They didn't.<eos> Let's go back for the others.<eos> No time.<eos> I am coming.<eos> Setting explosives is one thing, But I made a promise to keep you out of the fight.
Strigoi 10, humans 0, bottom of the ninth.<eos> You know what Yogi said,<eos> - "It ain't over 'til it's over."<eos> - It's pretty much over.<eos> EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 350 5TH AVENUE, MANHATTAN<eos> You missed!<eos> Hey!<eos> Sit!<eos> Enjoying your new toy, I see.<eos> The Master has planned an activity for you today.
I heard there were quite a few around here and... some of them are still stocked.<eos> The guy with a Russian accent wants directions to a missile base.<eos> I gotta tell ya, I've seen a lot of shit over the last nine months, but you two coming in here like that, unarmed... wow, that just about takes the cake.<eos> Look, friend, we have a mutual enemy here, all right?<eos> We're on the same side; we should be helping each other out. In fact, fighting each other is how we got into this situation.<eos> You have pretty eyes.<eos> I know what you're thinking, pal.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> You're gonna take us back to your camp.<eos> And then we're gonna kill you and take your woman, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.
Zack, no.<eos> That is your father talking.<eos> Don't let his way of thinking hold you back.<eos> I won't. I just...<eos> I'm lonely.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> I'm always here if you need me.<eos> But you're growing up now.<eos> Listen to the Master.<eos> He knows what's best for you.
You two set off the bomb?<eos> - Who is this guy?<eos> - He was on the bus.<eos> On the bus?<eos> A human?<eos> ! You two are blowing up buses and you don't even know they use them to transport human prisoners?<eos> - How many? - Six.<eos> I'm the only one who made it out.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - For saving you. - Yeah, ok.
Yeah.<eos> My...<eos> My people back in New York, they're... depending on me, you know, and I feel like I'm failing them, you know?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Well...<eos> - No, no.<eos> Our luck is gonna change.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Hey, you'll see.<eos> What would I do without you?
They took her to turn her to their cause.<eos> Captured her.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm slave labour whenever they need a hole dug or a tire patched.<eos> You got...<eos> You got friends coming for you?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> I hope so.<eos> I had a lady, like you, then after the Illumination, I went out to find her.
- a government missile silo.<eos> - That's classified.<eos> So you did work at a government missile silo.<eos> Did you launch?<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you launch?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Hey, I'm... I'm just trying to make conversation, Roman.<eos> You know?<eos> Getting to know you?
It's not just surfing, okay?<eos> "Kookslams" is about kooks everywhere wiping out in hilarious and cool fashions and gaining notoriety, and... notoriety... is it notoriety?<eos> Yeah, you're gonna have no-toriety.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's toriety?<eos> Well, anyways, it'll make me super famous, and I'll get tons of beach babes.<eos> And I'm down for the beach babes, 'cause all I want this weekend is to get a hickey on my neck so when we go back to the office, everyone's like, "Did you see Ders?<eos> He had a freakend, for sure."<eos> I know that's important to you.
Did you get the footy?<eos> No, I don't have my phone!<eos> I left it in the car!<eos> I've been eating a lot of data lately!<eos> Little kelp!<eos> You can't go for a swim in jeans!<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> Pretty sure a J-Nats two-fly champion's not gonna have a problem.<eos> Come here!<eos> I got you!

You see it every day.<eos> I'm still gonna take a photo.<eos> In a world where superheroes and villains battle above us each day,<eos> Wayne Security brings you products that give the power back to the powerless.<eos> Like our revolutionary Joker anti-venom.<eos> - Emily Locke?<eos> - I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> You'll never believe what happened to me.<eos> My train literally went off the rails and the...<eos> I'm gonna cut you off here because I'm assuming you lived.
look at his reply.<eos> "Stop using my HBO GO password."<eos> No, that...<eos> What a joker.<eos> That's classic B-Dubs.<eos> Look at the one right before it.<eos> "Sounds good."<eos> Bruce Wayne thinks you "sounds good."<eos> Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> Business at Wayne Security is down, and I am looking to you, as our new Director of RD. To come up with a big idea, all right?
- No.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> But he did say because I did such a good job inspiring all of you, he wants me to stay here to continue inspiring you.<eos> I guess with great power comes living in a taint.<eos> Emily...<eos> I blame you.<eos> I blame you.<eos> You guys did it.<eos> You should be really proud of yourselves.<eos> We couldn't have done it without you.
I've got girls who can do the splits, they can cut hair, but I don't have a star.<eos> I need a star.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Okay, I'm... I'm sorry, I can't handle this, and I'm not acting anymore.<eos> Bullshit! You know what I think?<eos> You're pretty. You got big boobs, and those soap writers didn't count on you having brains.<eos> Am I right?<eos> You asked too many questions, you maybe improvised a few too many lines, and then, boom, Sleeping Beauty.<eos> Yeah, if you wanna do something more than nod and eat a salad, and make a pretty cry-face, you are punished.<eos> I don't wanna punish you, Debbie.
You're just saying that to get me to join your circus.<eos> Yes, true. But I mean it.<eos> Fuck salads. Fuck tiny moments in close-up.<eos> Fuck polite and comatose.<eos> - Is there a script, or...<eos> - I don't know why I'm asking.<eos> - What the fuck am I doing?<eos> - Just come down, check it out for an hour.<eos> You don't have to say anything, do anything.<eos> If you don't wanna be part of it, I'll drive you home.
Honey. Honey, come with me. Come on.<eos> Don't stand up straight.<eos> - I'm...<eos> - You have to be submissive.<eos> She's the Alpha and you're the Omega.<eos> - I'm...<eos> - You're gonna provoke her.<eos> - Let me just...<eos> - Sit down...<eos> She might kill you.
- She's submitting. - No, don't even talk to me.<eos> Look down. Get low.<eos> - Put your muzzle to the ground. - Okay, can... Can everyone just be nice?<eos> All right? Let's just be nice.<eos> - Okay, here you go. - Hi.<eos> Okay.<eos> - No, what is that?<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> I know, I know, I lied.<eos> It's not about the lie, it's about where the lie takes you.
Wow.<eos> Good. Good.<eos> Kick in the stomach, I like that.<eos> Swim coach, I don't know. We can lose him.<eos> We need a better assailant.<eos> What animal would kick a pregnant woman in the belly?<eos> What kind of person would ruin the life of a gorgeous, successful, pregnant woman?<eos> What kind of homewrecker would do that?<eos> Ruth!<eos> Doesn't seem like too much of a stretch for you.
It's hard to pass up a starring role.<eos> So, we need to pick up Randy from my parents' house, and I need chow fun from Two Panda Deli.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, uh...<eos> So, I'm fired?<eos> No! Are you an idiot?<eos> You're chum.<eos> You're blood in the water.<eos> Debbie's the hero and you're the villain.<eos> Everybody's gonna hate you!
You don't know who her clients were.<eos> We needs visions, Liv.<eos> I'll get the frying pan.<eos> Crawl over here, Piggie, and bring me my gloves.<eos> No.<eos> Someone's asking to be punished.<eos> Is it you?<eos> Here.<eos> I thought so.<eos> This is where you end up when your parents don't tell you they love you.

- Excuse me?<eos> Why don't we talk in private.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's.<eos> What about my boot?<eos> Sorry to interrupt your campaigning, but we're looking into the murder of Roxanne Greer.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You knew her as sweet lady pain.<eos> I don't think I'm familiar with...<eos> I ate her brain and had a vision of you wearing a gimp mask.
Ah... I was at a campaign fundraiser.<eos> So there must have been dozens of donors present that can confirm it.<eos> Why don't you just give me a few?<eos> You want me to do nine different sketches?<eos> Did you see the starting lineup of a baseball team murder someone?<eos> I'm assisting detective Babineaux with a murder investigation.<eos> An anonymous witness sent me snapchats with photos they took of possible suspects.<eos> As soon as I open the images, they disappear.<eos> You could've saved us both a lot of time if you'd just screen-grabbed the images.<eos> When I want your advice, I'll beat it out of you.
James Weckler.<eos> Crazy James Weckler.<eos> You know who flees from the police, crazy James?<eos> Guilty people flee.<eos> That's who.<eos> We could've just shut the camera off, Liv.<eos> Does she work here?<eos> You murdered her, didn't you?<eos> You found out she was recording sessions, and you figured you could steal the memory card and blackmail the other men on it, so you broke in.<eos> You didn't plan to kill her, but she caught you in the act, and you decided that you weren't going back to prison, even if it meant Roxanne Greer had to die.
I'll stay with major.<eos> I'll, uh...<eos> I'll make another pot of coffee.<eos> No.<eos> Get some rest, we need you on your game tomorrow.<eos> I'll be right down the hall if you need me.<eos> - Hey... - Shh.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> What happened?<eos> The pneumonia was gonna take you out, but we couldn't give you the cure until your combat wounds had healed a bit.
Go back to sleep.<eos> What happened?<eos> The pneumonia was gonna take you out, but we couldn't give you the cure until your combat wounds had healed a bit.<eos> What happened with Blaine?<eos> Did the memory serum work?<eos> It didn't.<eos> I'm so sorry, major.<eos> Then this is it.<eos> Once I heal up, I take the cure, and everyone I've ever known is wiped from my memory.<eos> Maybe the cure won't have the same effect on you. - Maybe you'll...
So if you have things you need to do, you should go ahead and do them.<eos> I'll be spending my day convincing the Senate to vote for me, so there's no speeches necessary.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do have some things to do.<eos> Some people I need to check in with.<eos> Tom.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ready, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> I'll have a car waiting for you.
-Macallan sealed his own fate.<eos> -I delivered Maine, Doug, which is more than you can say about New Hampshire.<eos> I'll owe you.<eos> Not enough.<eos> Has the president spoken to you about Aidan at all?<eos> No.<eos> Is he on a kill list?<eos> The United States of America doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.<eos> I am the only thing preventing Mac from releasing what he has.<eos> And my guess is, whatever it is, it'll implicate you, too.
And no matter what people have told you, the Senate is voting for Brockhart.<eos> -It's country over party, Claire.<eos> -Are you flexing?<eos> I'm stalling until the House vote happens and then the Senate votes accordingly.<eos> You'd do that to the party to which you've devoted your entire career?<eos> The country needs clarity and resolution.<eos> That's the most important thing.<eos> There'll be another election in four years.<eos> But look...<eos> I saw you when Francis was in the coma.

There's a darkness in you, Octavia.<eos> It's the end of the world, Kane.<eos> Darkness is all we have left.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> You won't survive out here alone.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You've helped enough.<eos> You spared my life.<eos> I owe you.<eos> I don't want anything from you.
Leave your things!<eos> Everybody inside!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Kane.<eos> Someone's outside.<eos> Come on.<eos> Louis.<eos> We're coming.<eos> Come on, come on. I got you, I got you. Come on.
I can't find my sister, but I do know where they are.<eos> Bellamy, stop.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No unnecessary risks.<eos> You come home safe.<eos> I got this.<eos> Raven says the black rain will be here soon.<eos> Raven's right.<eos> I used to love the rain. Now it terrifies me.<eos> I would have thought nothing terrified you.
You'll make the right decision.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Anything.<eos> If I take a life... to find a cure... does that make me a murderer?<eos> Abby, I...<eos> I don't know how to answer that.<eos> I wish I did. What if it can save us all?<eos> Would I be able to live with myself then?<eos> Taking a life should never be easy.<eos> I hope it's not easy for you.
Who you want to be doesn't always win.<eos> Storm's over.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You have somewhere to go now?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Back to my stupid sheep.<eos> Walk into the setting sun, and you'll find it.<eos> Or don't.<eos> Get on.<eos> I'll take you home.
MERRICK: This is a declaration of war. One we cannot let go unanswered.<eos> (SNIFFLES)<eos> (BREATHES DEEPLY) As Ryder's rightful and only successor... All powers of this Barony fall to me.<eos> Merrick, will you administer my oath?<eos> Put your hands on the blade.<eos> Do you pledge to uphold the twin pillars of the Foundation Treaty, peace through force, and justice without mercy?<eos> I pledge with my life. Grip the blade and join your blood to the sword of this Foundation Stone and the Barons who came before you.
Not with all the trouble that's brewing over there.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> One of my shipments went through a couple days ago. All the Barons are on high alert. They had some powwow to hash it out but it got crashed.<eos> Quinn showed up, gave his son quite a surprise.<eos> A sword right through the heart. Ended that boy's reign before it began.<eos> Quinn?<eos> I clipped him myself. Either you're not as good as you think you are or Quinn's got one hell of a healer.<eos> (HEAVY BREATHING)<eos> Wiping away the blood won't change what you've done. What kind of man kills his own son?<eos> (SCOFFS) Look at you. Holed up here like a rat pretending to play house with another man's woman and child. The child of the man who ran you through.

The child of the man who ran you through.<eos> How pathetic.<eos> Pathetic, hmm?<eos> Since the moment you first sucked air, you were a disappointment.<eos> Oh, there he is, huh?<eos> The mighty Quinn. You know, I used to think you were so strong. But you're weak.<eos> No wonder all the women in your life betrayed you.
Then why am I here?<eos> You know, there's a way to find out the truth.<eos> You get Henry, you put a knife... under his tiny little throat... (WHIMPERS) And you see what Veil tells you then.<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (GRUNTS) If you wanted to invite me for tea, all you had to do was ask.<eos> Quinn attacked the conclave. He resurfaced and all but declared war on the other Barons.<eos> Quinn is dead. JADE: He's very much alive.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> (SIGHS) There's something you need to see.<eos> JADE: Quinn did it. Cut him down.<eos> I know things were difficult between you both... But Ryder always loved you.
I had to defend myself. I... I had no choice.<eos> - He tried to force himself on me.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> It's the truth!<eos> Edgar would never harm a woman.<eos> And as pretty as you are, sweetheart,<eos> (VEIL BREATHING SHAKILY) you don't have the right equipment<eos> - (THUDS) - (SHUDDERS) that he liked to play with.<eos> Now, you kill a man, and you piss on his good name,<eos> I ought to clip you for that.

Well, you gonna keep me in suspense?<eos> I compromised at the conclave. I traded my principles for empty promises.<eos> But the lives of the innocent are at stake.<eos> I'm their only chance and their only hope.<eos> And I'm never gonna to let them down ever again.<eos> Which is why I'm making an alliance with Quinn. You can't be serious.<eos> Quinn is way too... Combustible.<eos> We tried it your way. Now, we're playing it mine.<eos> Now all you have to do is find Quinn.<eos> (SIGHS) And may the gods help you if any Baron beats you to him.
So, who else was in on it?<eos> Aside from her brother.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - Er, nothing yet, ma'am.<eos> They might remember a bit more when they're sober, mind.<eos> Er, we can ask around the market and I can talk to some of the bar staff.<eos> Aye.<eos> Then work your way down to the quayside.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - Nice little crawl for you, Kenny.

She's saying she's gonna miss me.<eos> She says we should run away together.<eos> I've no idea where any of this is coming from, so I pull the car over...<eos> just to talk, mind.<eos> - And er...<eos> - What, she makes a move on you?<eos> I swear, I didn't see it coming.<eos> Ah, well, how would you, love?<eos> It's all in her head.<eos> So I says, "Look, Mia, I'm taking you home."
Erin?<eos> Get this open!<eos> Erin, love?<eos> Erin, it's the police!<eos> Erin, love?<eos> - Erin, love...<eos> - I've got her.<eos> Kenny, get an ambulance down to Hinkin's field.<eos> It's OK, we've got you.<eos> We've got you, love.
Where's my tough guy?<eos> Huh? Where's my tough old Dutch?<eos> There he is.<eos> Huh? Now listen.<eos> Shut up and listen to me, okay?<eos> Because I know-- I know this isn't, you know, ideal, but you gotta pull yourself together!<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was a poor choice of words, but for Christ's sake, man.<eos> There's two dead men walking around there who stole from me-- i.e., my whores, and from you, i.e., your feet!
Slang for "detective," so not an insult!<eos> What is insulting is that you've kept me waiting for ten hours.<eos> I- - Sorry.<eos> I've had a busy day.<eos> I'll bet.<eos> I've had quite a busy day myself trying to shut down rumors I had anything to do with that bloodbath down in Long Beach.<eos> I wouldn't say "bloodbath."<eos> Although, now that I come to think of it, the easiest thing would be to just tell Len Trexler it was you.<eos> That would be pretty easy.<eos> But I have another job for you.
Yeah.<eos> So, uh, okay.<eos> See- - See ya around, or--<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You have a crush on her!<eos> What?<eos> No I don't. I--<eos> Yes, you do!<eos> That was the cutest thing!<eos> And I think she has a crush on you.
Odessa, I hardly recognized you.<eos> Doll to butterfly.<eos> Hardly recognize myself.<eos> It's quite a metamorphosis from the oil refinery.<eos> You should get back to the courtyard.<eos> Training's about to begin.<eos> Actually, I thought you could train me.<eos> I'm Regent now. I don't do that anymore.<eos> I have to protect Mother's interests.<eos> So why hasn't she taken you?
So why hasn't she taken you?<eos> I heard there's a big meeting with all the other Barons.<eos> She left me here in charge.<eos> Waldo went to protect her.<eos> The old man in a wheelchair?<eos> I thought The Widow was about empowering women.<eos> She is.<eos> Don't you think the world's been screwed over enough by men?<eos> Come on.<eos> She should have taken you.
That's so kind, Edgar.<eos> Uh, Henry needs his daily dose of sunshine.<eos> Could you let me into the ventilation room?<eos> Of course.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thanks, Edgar.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> It's gonna be hard at first, but I know we're gonna be fine.<eos> Wait.<eos> I saw you at the reception, but I don't remember training you.
To good food and new friends.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I just wanted to tell you how much I admired Sunny.<eos> He always inspired me and the other guys.<eos> No one would ever accuse him of saying too much, but when he went into action, it was a beautiful thing to behold.<eos> The grace ofis sword strokes, he made killing look so easy.<eos> Well, to Sunny.<eos> To Sunny.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't want to upset you. I meant it as a compliment.
Uh, she's bluffing.<eos> When are you gonna learn that my crusade won't end with my death?<eos> It will only signal its true beginning.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> You said you killed him!<eos> My son always had a slippery relationship with the truth.<eos> It's kind of you to keep my seat warm.<eos> Take my lovely young bride as your own.<eos> You even raided my closet.<eos> Is there nothing sacrosanct to you?
Take my lovely young bride as your own.<eos> You even raided my closet.<eos> Is there nothing sacrosanct to you?<eos> Kill them all.<eos> Waldo!<eos> Mother!<eos> Well...<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's your son.<eos> He's never been as strong as you, you know that.
Quinn, please don't!<eos> Quinn, please, please!<eos> Ryder!<eos> You can't run away from what you did, son.<eos> No forgiveness, no turning back.<eos> Remember?<eos> They called this god Cronus.<eos> King of the Titans.<eos> A prophet warned that he was destined to be overthrown by his own child's hand, so Cronus devoured his sons the moment they were born.<eos> I should have scraped you out of your mother's womb.

The world has been better without you.<eos> You should've stayed dead.<eos> Now that's more like the boy I always wanted.<eos> The Ryder I knew never fought like this.<eos> What did you do with him?<eos> You wanted to take power.<eos> Here's your chance.<eos> This time, do it with honor.<eos> Do it. Hmm?<eos> I didn't raise you to hesitate.
You came to kill me.<eos> No, I came to avenge my son.<eos> Our son.<eos> His death hurt me more than anyone.<eos> Well, then at least some good came from it.<eos> Did you find veil?<eos> We're still looking.<eos> Then don't return without them.<eos> It's treacherous for a woman and child to be all alone in the woods.<eos> Another pretty young thing has abandoned you?

You were never one for honeyed words.<eos> You always spoke your truth, no matter how foul.<eos> Maybe that's why you were baron of two territories before you cast me aside.<eos> Now look at you.<eos> Lord of nothing.<eos> And yet you came back to me.<eos> Only to put a dagger through your heart.<eos> Do it.<eos> Ryder hesitated when I gave him the chance.<eos> Yeah, this is why I loved you first.

Both you and sunny's boy.<eos> I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Heard you were the one who was gonna help us get out of the badlands.<eos> Um, well, that didn't work out too well, did it?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Perhaps I could help you find him.<eos> But first I need a favor.<eos> Do you think you could show me where Quinn kept you?<eos> I'm not asking you to go anywhere near there again.
Well, we'll get you another boy.<eos> Just forget about him.<eos> How do you know so much about them?<eos> I'll tell you in the car.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not going to the wall without that boy.<eos> Why won't you listen to me?<eos> Bajie.<eos> I'm asking you for your help.
Maybe if you'd listened to me once in a while, you wouldn't be living like a roach in a hole.<eos> I'd keep a very close eye on this one if I was you.<eos> Now... what do you want?<eos> Same as you do.<eos> The other barons dead.<eos> But I can't do it alone, neither can you.<eos> But together...<eos> The other barons would never suspect an alliance.<eos> And when it's just the two of us left standing?<eos> Then I expect you'll try to kill me before I kill you.
This isn't gonna last long.<eos> So get up and help me kick this asshole's asshole.<eos> Finish me.<eos> Any more luck with that book?<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> It's a pity.<eos> I offered you protection once.<eos> But you repaid my kindness by trying to turn tilda against me.<eos> I want to forgive you, veil.
Sunny, wake up. Sunny.<eos> Sunny. What's the matter, Dad?<eos> Nothing. It's just the wind.<eos> Hey, four fingers apart, straight lines, like I told you. I don't want to be a farmer when I grow up.<eos> I want to be a fighter. Why would you want to do that?<eos> Because then, no one could mess with me.<eos> Plus, girls like fighters. Is there a girl you're trying to impress?<eos> Maybe. Is she pretty?<eos> Her name's Artemis. I met her when I was playing in the woods. Ow!<eos> How about this? I'll race you to the pens.

I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!<eos> I beat you.
You want to go back in there?<eos> Why not?<eos> They'd never expect it.<eos> Yeah, and with good reason, we would be insane to try.<eos> Neither of us have our Gift anymore.<eos> It would be like walking in with our dicks in our hands and sorry, sorry but I'm not gonna put my dick in that position.<eos> How did Sunny hook up with an asshole like you in the first place?<eos> "Oh, how did Sunny..." You don't know the first thing about me, son. So now you're angry?<eos> Yeah, maybe I am. You know what?<eos> Maybe I'll stick you in the ground next to him.
Mommy.<eos> All right.<eos> Fine. I'll bite. What is on your mind, other than our friend back there?<eos> Why'd you leave the Monastery?<eos> Why did you leave the Monastery?<eos> I found out something terrible about myself.<eos> Around the same time I found out something terrible about the Monastery.<eos> Your turn.<eos> I left because of a girl, all right? She was my novice at the time.<eos> She was a mouthy little punk, just like you. When I found her, she was so small that I nicknamed her Flea.
Wait. They've surrounded the house.<eos> We can still make it to the tunnels.<eos> A for effort.<eos> The last time I stood in this room, you were just a Baron's wife.<eos> But you learn the game quickly, don't you, Baroness?<eos> Perhaps a little too quickly for your own good.<eos> I thought you didn't kill women.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But he might.<eos> It's always good to see you, Jade.
Book and a compass, huh?<eos> If we make it out of this alive, if... I am gonna kill you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hmm? You had it all, didn't you?<eos> A brief, shiny moment. You had everything I always dreamed of. Yours will be the story all the little Cog girls will tell each other.<eos> She was the one who came from the filth of the fields and... And the greasy stench of the kitchen to the velvety heights of the Barony.<eos> Only to be pushed from that pinnacle by her own ambition. Not by my ambition.<eos> By your blade. If you hadn't killed your own son, none of this would have happened.<eos> Oh, we're quite alike, you and I.<eos> - I am nothing like you. - Aren't you?
Oh, we're quite alike, you and I.<eos> - I am nothing like you. - Aren't you?<eos> We're both Cogs who rose to become Barons. Me by the strength of my sword, and, and you... Well, by deploying other weapons.<eos> Your beauty, which beguiled me. Your cunning, ooh!<eos> My compliments.<eos> But you were always so pragmatic, even to the point of, of marrying my weak, traitorous son.<eos> Why not admit it?<eos> The only difference between us is that, is that I'm honest about who I am.<eos> You are deluded.<eos> And I was only pragmatic in marrying you.
I mean, you can't be a day over 135?<eos> You haven't changed, Bajie. Still hiding your failings behind jokes.<eos> Well, I'm just, uh,<eos> I'm just trying to lighten the mood, you know?<eos> You were once my greatest hope.<eos> Instead, you have become my bitterest disappointment.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If it helps, I've disappointed a lot of people since you, old lady.<eos> And you, M.K.<eos> I sent three of our best to search for you and Ava.
It's a pity you rejected the chance for me to teach you.<eos> Have any ideas?<eos> Cut the novices.<eos> They'll attack the Abbots.<eos> M.K. Let's go!<eos> - Come on. - Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm taking Henry away from here.<eos> Away from you.
Where are you?<eos> Show yourself!<eos> Where's my son?<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> What did I do?<eos> You made him kill his mother.<eos> That wasn't my fault. It's yours.<eos> Do you know why you can't have the life that you want?<eos> This dream?<eos> All this time, you've been so worried the threat would come from outside, but it's been inside you all along. And now, it's in your son.
We're losing cogs by the hour.<eos> If this keeps up, we won't be able to fill our orders.<eos> Speed up production.<eos> Show yourselves!<eos> Hassan: Please.<eos> I'll support you.
We're losing cogs by the hour.<eos> If this keeps up, we won't be able to fill our orders.<eos> Speed up production.<eos> Show yourselves!<eos> Hassan: Please.<eos> I'll support you.<eos> I could have used your support at the conclave.<eos> Now I only need one thing from you, Hassan.
Well, have you got a better one?<eos> It's not like we can just stroll through a legitimate checkpoint, is it?<eos> We'll be caught, branded like animals and chained together for the rest of our natural lives.<eos> And I'm sorry but... I don't want to be chained to you again.<eos> I... I don't want to be.<eos> You can trust them?<eos> Well... No, not really. I mean, they're smugglers but our coin is good.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Unbelievable. The pair of you.<eos> How about, "oh, you're fantastic, bajie. "We couldn't have done it without you, bajie. "Thanks for everything, bajie."

Your bullshit's what got us here in the first place, remember?<eos> Guard?<eos> Wha... what are you doing? What are you doing?<eos> Hey! Yeah, you!<eos> Get over here.<eos> Take me to your baron now.<eos> She's gonna wanna see me.<eos> Chau: A killer who enjoys the classics.<eos> You are a rare find, sunny.<eos> What brings you back to the badlands?
You were once the deadliest clipper in the badlands.<eos> I want you to take up that mantle again and become my regent.<eos> I am done fighting for barons.<eos> But I have a proposal of my own.<eos> You're in no position to dictate the terms, sunny.<eos> I know how to lure the widow out into the open.<eos> I take her out, then she leads us to Quinn.<eos> In return, you give me my freedom.<eos> And why should I trust you to deliver?<eos> Because I'm the only one that wants Quinn dead more than you.
Why is she up there now, working by his side, plotting their next round of chaos?<eos> You and I both made mistakes. You had the chance to poison your mother. And I could have let Quinn die.<eos> And neither of us had the... The strength and now my little boy's paying for it.<eos> I need this boy.<eos> Chau: How are we going to reach the widow?<eos> She wants this boy. Why?<eos> She thinks that when he's cut, he unleashes a dark power.<eos> Ow! He doesn't. But she's convinced.<eos> Hey, what's wrong with you?<eos> He's selling you out, kid.
He's not part of the deal.<eos> Sorry, bajie.<eos> Bajie: You slimy, little bastard.<eos> I thought i had a line of bullshit, but you take the cake.<eos> I saved your life, and so did that kid.<eos> I have to get veil and the baby back.<eos> And what kind of man will you be when you do, huh?<eos> What will there be left?<eos> You're gonna fail.<eos> Moon was right about you.
Hey. What's that?<eos> Why don't you come and have a closer look?<eos> Uh-huh. Ah!<eos> The beauty and mystery of a female voice.<eos> Mother.<eos> I know. You're angry at me about veil.<eos> Well, it was the only way to form an alliance with Quinn.<eos> The widow: Well, but the truth, uh, the truth is i also wanted to punish her.<eos> For what?<eos> Trying to turn you against me.
If Quinn dies, his loyalists won't hesitate to take their revenge.<eos> I can't. I can't. I...<eos> And once we're done, I will find us a way out of here. I promise.<eos> I promise.<eos> So, is this your big plan?<eos> You gonna join forces with chau and sell me to the widow?<eos> Keep it down.<eos> Right, you're a regent again.<eos> Gotta follow orders.<eos> Look, I didn't rescue you from the abbots just to sell you to the widow.
Any friend of tilda's is a friend of mine.<eos> Did I say something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> Odessa. Odessa?<eos> Odessa!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> You have to stay away from him.<eos> That wasn't what it looked like.<eos> You think I'm jealous?<eos> I'm trying to protect you.
Feel free to judge me, but being adaptable is what's kept me alive.<eos> When's the last time you fought for yourself instead of for someone else?<eos> Whoever I fight for, I fight smart.<eos> You might try that yourself sometime.<eos> That isn't a plan, that's a one-way ticket to an early grave.<eos> My family doesn't have any other choice.<eos> If I taught you anything, it's to leave your emotions outside the equation.<eos> My emotions are what's kept me alive.<eos> All right, let's say you do make it through the tunnels, come face-to-face with Quinn.<eos> The man who took you in, made you regent, trained you to obey every word he says.
Just because the widow and I want the same thing, doesn't mean I trust her one bit.<eos> Where are you off to now?<eos> The armory.<eos> You'll have to pass the fort to get to Quinn's bunker.<eos> So why don't you stop in at my old clipper shed.<eos> You'll find everything you need inside.<eos> Consider it a farewell gift.<eos> So long, sunshine.<eos> Goodbye, Waldo.<eos> Now I remember why I married you first.
- Let him speak.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She's the baron's new wife.<eos> What?<eos> Veil wants to let you know that her son, Henry, recognizes Quinn as his true father.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> The widow is not your ally.<eos> If you march with her on Quinn, with her forces beside you, you march to your own death.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Quinn's afraid, he's just trying to turn you against me.
He's lying.<eos> Quinn's afraid, he's just trying to turn you against me.<eos> Says the woman who traded veil to Quinn.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Enough!<eos> Somebody put this filth out of his misery.<eos> The alliance is over.<eos> Take cover!<eos> Sunny!<eos> I am getting tired of saving you.
Somebody put this filth out of his misery.<eos> The alliance is over.<eos> Take cover!<eos> Sunny!<eos> I am getting tired of saving you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> A bookmark!<eos> That's your big idea to help save me, is it?<eos> Well, you escaped, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, no thanks to you.
M.K., my friend, it seems that dear mother fate has brought us together for a reason.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Shh, come on baby, come on. Shh.<eos> You can hear that baby from the other end of the bunker. He needs his mother.<eos> Veil must learn her lesson. Shh.<eos> Then find some other way to teach her.<eos> Don't punish Henry, too.<eos> Quinn, he's hungry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of my men will escort you to veil.
Afterwards, you'll bring Henry straight back to me.<eos> Yeah? Yeah. It's all right, Henry.<eos> I thought you said you knew where it was.<eos> It was here.<eos> Is this what you're looking for?<eos> Don't look so surprised, I have eyes everywhere.<eos> Hello, bajie.<eos> My little flea.<eos> My, how you've blossomed.<eos> I wish I could say the same for you.
My little flea.<eos> My, how you've blossomed.<eos> I wish I could say the same for you.<eos> You're cheeky as ever.<eos> I had a good teacher.<eos> At least something stuck.<eos> I give you shelter and this is how you repay me?<eos> All you care about is what I can do for you.<eos> And you think bajie's intentions are genuine?<eos> He'll abandon you the first chance he gets, just like he abandoned me.
You've been acting differently ever since veil was here.<eos> All right, you wanna talk about trust?<eos> Then where's m.K.?<eos> He wasn't in his room, so what have you done with him?<eos> He's safe.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> Do you really think I'd hurt him?<eos> What kind of person do you think I am?<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> Power's changed you.
You're no better than any other baron.<eos> Swindling people with declarations of goodwill, only to stab them in the back.<eos> What did I do to deserve such contempt?<eos> I gave you the world.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You've got everyone fooled.<eos> Minerva.<eos> Everyone, but me.<eos> Maybe veil was right.<eos> I should have poisoned you when I had the chance.
Have a good one, Raul.<eos> I'm Sanjay Desai, Chief Health Care Officer for The Partnership.<eos> Now, these donations you're making, they're vital.<eos> Vital to the society we are building all around you.<eos> A society that will benefit every living creature on this planet.<eos> There'll be no more violence, no crime.<eos> And we will all get to pursue our own happiness in peace.<eos> This is our future, my friends.<eos> And it's a bright one.<eos> Didn't I always tell you to watch your back?
I know this place is a dump.<eos> Not as clean as what's-his-name would keep it.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Take this chart down to ultrasound for me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, this is Nurse Greenwood.<eos> I'd like an update on that file that I gave you yesterday.<eos> She always changes her mind.<eos> You know, after you were born we were trying to decide on a name to call you, and she wanted to call you Herb.
It doesn't seem you can say the same for your $323 million.<eos> Yeah, well, nuclear war wasn't good for the economy.<eos> - No one wanted my gold certificates.<eos> - Or your paintings or all your other material trappings.<eos> Even greed has its limits.<eos> What about your book?<eos> The Lumen continues to be of vital importance.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Hey, I believe you, Professor.<eos> When the time comes, we're gonna need people like you.
Hi, Jeremy.<eos> Oh, hey, Miranda.<eos> We all set for tomorrow?<eos> Um, what's happening tomorrow?<eos> Don't get cute with me.<eos> You're bringing in the jizz fridge and, when it's empty, you're going to carry me back out in it.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> I know I said I would do it, and I want to do it.<eos> I mean, I want to help you--<eos> Look, they haven't stopped you once on your way out, no matter what you've been carrying.
Yes, you are, or do you want me to speak to Mr. Desai?<eos> Oh, you bitch.<eos> Yeah, I've heard worse.<eos> This is your air tube.<eos> Hide it here, they'll never be able to see it<eos> - from the outside.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Remember. The Olympian Club,<eos> West 54th Street.<eos> When I get out, I'm gonna come find you there.
Look, if I'm not back outside in two minutes, they're gonna come in here looking for me.<eos> I can't do it!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I can't breathe in there.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just need to stay calm and breathe slowly, okay?<eos> No, you go.<eos> I'm not leaving you here
You just left.<eos> I didn't know if you were coming back, or if you were even safe.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It was all so sudden.<eos> I needed to think.<eos> And you never came back?<eos> I got drawn into an urgent meeting.<eos> The kind I can't say no to.<eos> I slept at the office...<eos> Didn't want to wake you.
The kind I can't say no to.<eos> I slept at the office...<eos> Didn't want to wake you.<eos> What about her?<eos> We'll arrange for a nanny.<eos> Why?<eos> She isn't staying.<eos> I won't have that child in my house.<eos> You have to send her away.<eos> If I could do this for you, I would.
Three days of celebration.<eos> There will be public concerts, the theatre.<eos> Even films.<eos> I'm sure little Dagna here would enjoy her first motion picture in the big city.<eos> Have you ever seen fireworks?<eos> Still shy.<eos> It's perfectly normal.<eos> Such a beauty, isn't she?<eos> Those eyes remind me of yours at that age.<eos> I knew right away she was the one for you.
I know you meant no offense. Hmm.<eos> I'm going to take a walk for lunch to clear my head.<eos> - That sounds lovely.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Could you help me with something first?<eos> These need to be stored in the basement archives, and the door's so heavy, I can't do it alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> Get in the cell.<eos> Now! Heidi, this is...<eos> What's gotten into you?
Is she here?<eos> I haven't seen her.<eos> She must be late from lunch.<eos> - How is little Dagna settling in?<eos> - She's fine.<eos> Must be so hard for you.<eos> A new child in the house, especially when you're on your own.<eos> "On my own"?<eos> While your husband is here at night, having secret meetings.<eos> It must make things harder for you.
Deploying truth and trust as they serve your strategy... that he's willing to step into your parlour.<eos> And when he has relaxed just enough to expose his throat... you strike.<eos> Berlin Station Hauptbahnhof.<eos> Berlin Station!<eos> Welcome to Germany, Dagna.<eos> Her name's Ania.<eos> What a relief to be back home.<eos> On the next X Company...<eos> Stop him.<eos> Operation Marigold is more important than you or me.
You can't stop this.<eos> No. No, Emori. I'm not letting this happen to you.<eos> You have to.<eos> What?<eos> John, listen to me.<eos> Make them think you're ok with this.<eos> We make Clarke think you're still with her.<eos> Emori, I'll kill her if she even thinks about hurting...<eos> No. Damn it, John. Think.<eos> Don't give them a reason to pick you next.
I want you to close your eyes.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> - I want you to know this...<eos> - Currently?<eos> Yes.<eos> We are opening our sacral chakras.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your past does not equal your future.<eos> Though I am pretty sure my chakra's broken.<eos> I can book you in for a chakra-ectomy.
- This guy thinks I'm on steroids.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I was trying to clean glass out of his back.<eos> He was acting agitated, so I suggested a tox screen, and he just...<eos> Yeah, you said it with a smirk.<eos> Yeah, dude, you're wearing blue spandex.<eos> Just saying it's kind of hard not to smirk.<eos> Billy.<eos> You want something to do, go get Dev cleaned up.<eos> - I'm not leaving you alone with him.
I'll get the board off your back.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> - Hey. Your self-help guru just fired me.<eos> Guess that means I'm not getting my money back.<eos> Kidding.<eos> Her loss.<eos> So, um, I wanted to ask... h-how are you feeling after all that, anyway?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The same.<eos> Huh. I hate to admit it, but it's actually got me thinking - about a few things regarding you.
By taking an Uber?<eos> Come on, it's just a joke.<eos> This isn't.<eos> I know that.<eos> All due respect, whose hands do you think my life should be in right now?<eos> Mine.<eos> All due respect, Layla... this is the wrong choice.<eos> Ah, well, it's my choice.<eos> I'm choosing this.<eos> Why is that so important to you?
Come on, it's just a joke.<eos> This isn't.<eos> I know that.<eos> All due respect, whose hands do you think my life should be in right now?<eos> Mine.<eos> All due respect, Layla... this is the wrong choice.<eos> Ah, well, it's my choice.<eos> I'm choosing this.<eos> Why is that so important to you?<eos> It's not even gonna matter to you, why.
I don't know.<eos> There was a cat.<eos> - A cat?<eos> What cat?<eos> - The frigging cat, man.<eos> A cat ran out in front of me.<eos> What do you mean, what cat?<eos> I have to get to work.<eos> This isn't a good idea.<eos> So, if someone should see you like this, it's...
That's a trick.<eos> At least my version of one.<eos> Okay, that's the procedure.<eos> You're all done.<eos> You just stabbed me in the back?<eos> No...<eos> Well, technically, yes.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But I drained some of the excess fluid.<eos> We're gonna keep you monitored just for a bit, but I think you're gonna be just fine.
Thank you.<eos> I wanted to see how you were doing, check and see how those staples are healing.<eos> That just an excuse to see me?<eos> I really do believe people come into each other's lives for a reason.<eos> And I think that yours was to help me through this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's my job.<eos> No, your job is to cut people up and take out their disease.<eos> You went above and beyond and...<eos> I would really like to do the same thing for you, maybe help you move through whatever past you're running from.
He's all yours...<eos> Chief.<eos> Good morrow, Dr. Sekara.<eos> Oh, uh, hey.<eos> We're not supposed to see each other before the board...<eos> Relax, Dev.<eos> It's not our wedding day.<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> I went out last night, ordered the bourbon chicken, hold the chicken.<eos> - Uh-huh. - The Board call you in?
No.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Keep your schedule relatively clear.<eos> We'll notify you of a time.<eos> That is wonderful.<eos> Hey.<eos> You need to get back in bed. I haven't discharged you yet.
Great.<eos> Have you thought about my offer?<eos> To help you?<eos> 'Cause your energy is kind of like...<eos> It's like a fountain spewing gunk.<eos> Most people would understand it as a thick, disgusting, black cloud,<eos> - kind of just permeating everything.<eos> - You know what?<eos> You're just saying that<eos> - because I didn't discharge you.
I have a chili to prepare.<eos> Thank you.<eos> See you.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> "Lila Zila and the Watermelon Smash."<eos> Why did you like this book?<eos> Special delivery for Dr. Williams.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... can see you.
How does he perform said miracles?<eos> Well, you ask, he talks to ghosts.<eos> Hey. I didn't mean to, uh...<eos> Uh, it's just that this thing is, for sure, broken, like, won't go past 800, so...<eos> But, while I'm here, who talks to ghosts?<eos> First of all, you need to get back in bed.<eos> And, secondly, you really shouldn't be here.<eos> No, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to interrupt you... with yourself.
Spread 'em.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Remember me?<eos> That was wildly unfair.<eos> You just operated on me.<eos> You are relentless.<eos> Look, you know what?<eos> Hear me out.<eos> I have this, like, karma superstition thing, okay?<eos> So, if you're not going to let me help you for you, please, let me help you for me.
You will be able to make a statement when we've finished here.<eos> Well, let me save you the time.<eos> I quit.<eos> Oh, Charlie, what have you done?<eos> You know, Amos, I'm tired of convincing people that I'm not crazy.<eos> I'm, uh, tired of helping people that no one else can see.<eos> Basically, I'm tired.<eos> Ever since the day I was shot, which is a memorable day for me, I've been stuck here.<eos> I couldn't help him... my patient, who had a gun stuffed down his throat.<eos> And then I met you, and I thought,
Weird day.<eos> I blame the balloons.<eos> Why would you send me those?<eos> What?<eos> Send you what?<eos> The...<eos> Wait.<eos> So, you didn't send me this, either?<eos> Please.<eos> I wasn't that into you.
We're cool, right?<eos> 100%.<eos> I'm gonna go check on Patterson...<eos> I gotta catch up on these files.<eos> Reade's back.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> I think the time off did him some good.<eos> I'm not taking time off.<eos> Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to lethal injection you.
And... someone... told me to start with small choices, like coffee or tea.<eos> Looks like you chose for me.<eos> Well, you like coffee with as much sugar as it'll hold.<eos> I know you.<eos> So... unlike me, you don't have to start from scratch.<eos> Did our mother love us?<eos> I think so.<eos> In her own way.<eos> Then why would she wipe my memory?<eos> Um... maybe... maybe she thought it was the only chance she had left to get you back.
So, Turner could be in that car with Stepulov and whatever bomb he smuggled into this country.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Show me your hands and get out of the car.<eos> Hands up.<eos> Anton Stepulov... you're under arrest.<eos> Both of you, keep your hands where I can see 'em.<eos> You've been here for three months.<eos> How much longer are you gonna make us do this to you, Jane?
Keaton, you work out of here.<eos> We never got to finish what you started in Oregon.<eos> What I started?<eos> I don't hurt people unless I have to.<eos> - I'm not like you.<eos> - Says the daughter of the biggest domestic terrorist in American history.<eos> You think that I wanted to be there?<eos> Do you know how many of my daughter's basketball games I've missed?<eos> Dinners with my wife?<eos> I'd rather be doing anything than interrogating you.
I'd say getting your memory wiped was the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.<eos> This morning, you said Roman wasn't like me.<eos> All I know is Roman is alive because of you.<eos> Whatever hope that he has left is a gift that you gave him.<eos> So, how long you figure it'll be weird between us?<eos> Look, I'm not the one who tried to make out with my best friend, so don't put this on me.<eos> It's not like I'm in love with you or anything.
Tell me where you are, I'll come get you.<eos> Um... I'm somewhere downstairs.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Help me.<eos> All right, Erin, we're gonna find you.<eos> But I need you to do what I say, okay?<eos> Do you see any signs around you?<eos> Um, th-there's an exit sign and then one that says "South Court Stairs."<eos> I want you to follow the arrows to the South Court.<eos> - We'll meet you there.
You know... from a scientific perspective, psychological conclusions are rarely... well, conclusive.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> I know that there's a side to him that she can't see.<eos> But I'm not objective.<eos> Maybe that's the point.<eos> Weller wasn't objective, and he brought out the best in you.<eos> Maybe you can do that for Roman.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Really?<eos> Hey, let me get a double.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, Tasha, everything that's happened recently...<eos> Jones, the Akkadian, Sandstorm ambush, it... my... my head's been just... - Apology accepted. - All right.<eos> For real.<eos> Now, let's never talk about this again.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I think someone's checking you out.
Or... I don't know what we are anymore.<eos> I haven't seen him in weeks.<eos> Where the hell is he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Don't cover for him.<eos> - Whoa, whoa. - Freddy!<eos> Hey, seriously, I haven't seen him.<eos> - You're Edgar Reade, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, he said he was gonna crash with you.
Psychologically speaking, you don't know each other at all.<eos> We can't just wait for Phase Two.<eos> Sandstorm could launch their next attack at any moment.<eos> We have to chase down every lead that we've got, no matter how risky it is.<eos> If that means using Roman to get to Shepherd,<eos> I'd say it's worth the risk. Any objections?<eos> Good.<eos> Let's see how Roman feels about this.<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> This is a chance to prove your value to the team and get you out of this cage.
You remembered them this morning, just by looking at a photo and listening to an engine motor.<eos> Imagine what you could remember when you're out in the world.<eos> I used to hurt people, right?<eos> What if the old Roman kicks in?<eos> I trust the new Roman.<eos> Shepherd can't get away with what she's done to us.<eos> This is our chance to make her pay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why is everyone staring at me?<eos> We lost a lot of agents to Sandstorm, and they blame you.
But we won't need it.<eos> We're just going there to talk, okay?<eos> Let's go get you something to wear.<eos> Come on.<eos> What if they can tell I'm... different?<eos> Look, you did business with these guys.<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay?<eos> They probably...<eos> They probably didn't know you very well.
Remi and I have a business proposal.<eos> So... This is the infamous Remi.<eos> You still keep your brother on a tight leash?<eos> If only I could.<eos> He just does whatever he wants, whenever he wants.<eos> Right now, I want to see Abel.<eos> You really think that's a good idea?<eos> After you just vanished?<eos> He's gonna wanna hear this.<eos> Fine... if you're lucky, he'll kill you before I get a chance to.
To be so blinded by all of your feelings you just, you miss all the signs?<eos> I do, actually.<eos> More than you think.<eos> It's terrible, but you're not alone here, Patterson.<eos> You know, Dr. Borden fooled all of us.<eos> How could you not see this?<eos> Your whole job...<eos> Your whole job is to analyze intel.<eos> You were bugging his office, for God's sake.<eos> It was right there in front of you, but you were too busy listening to the people in the other chair.
I'm treating' that HMX as a bonus.<eos> We held up our end of the deal.<eos> Relax.<eos> We'll get you to the sale in plenty of time to kill your mom.<eos> Feels weird, you being back here.<eos> You know, when you didn't show up that morning...<eos> I-I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I did wrong.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> It was Shepherd.<eos> I've been angry at you for a long time.
Do you love me?<eos> Remi doesn't think we should see each other anymore.<eos> Let's just leave and start over.<eos> Start our own family.<eos> Let's go somewhere safe.<eos> I know that you're tired of doing everything that Shepherd and Remi tell you to do.<eos> I can't leave my sister.<eos> We protect each other.<eos> Always have.<eos> I love you.
We can still leave it all behind.<eos> Help me take down Shepherd.<eos> We can go wherever we want.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> You could have come back.<eos> After you woke up.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> You stayed with your sister.<eos> Kat...<eos> I love you.
Step out of the way.<eos> Shots fired!<eos> Moving in!<eos> Roman!<eos> Kat!<eos> Shh, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Roman...<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I love you.
We'll find it.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> This...<eos> this is all my fault.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> We both made bad decisions today.<eos> I'll take full responsibility for the HMX.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I covered for you with Pellington.

In the memory I had,<eos> Kat wanted to run away together.<eos> But I never showed up because you ordered me to call it off.<eos> Well, I wish that surprised me.<eos> I did a lot of terrible things.<eos> And I'm trying to make up for them.<eos> But if you spend all of your energy trying to dissect who you were then, you'll... you'll never be free to live as the person you are now.<eos> - I'm not free.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But I swear I am going to get you out of here.
We need a member who will talk.<eos> And no one likes talking more than Rich.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Looks like someone found religion.<eos> Looks like someone found all the religions.<eos> Children, let us pray.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Bless this mess.<eos> You done?<eos> We need to ask you for a little help.
Anyone else in Daedalus that we should know about?<eos> Well, there's probably one guy I should mention.<eos> No.<eos> N-N-N-N-No.<eos> You didn't tell me he would be here.<eos> I... if this is another one of your schemes to get me back, I swear...<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> You like nice, by the way.<eos> Don't talk to me, don't look at me...<eos> Don't look at you?
No.<eos> N-N-N-N-No.<eos> You didn't tell me he would be here.<eos> I... if this is another one of your schemes to get me back, I swear...<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> You like nice, by the way.<eos> Don't talk to me, don't look at me...<eos> Don't look at you?<eos> Come on, look at me!<eos> I'm a changed man because of you.
Oh, my God, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry?<eos> Once!<eos> You have to say it one time!<eos> Enough, you two!<eos> Can members take a date to this party?<eos> I mean, it's been a while since I've been available to attend, - but, uh, yeah, they sure used to. - Great.<eos> You'll go separately with a plus one.<eos> That way, have twice the eyes and ears in there.<eos> I'm sorry, but... why would I help any of you?<eos> 'Cause I can transfer you to Victorville.

Our priority is still Sandstorm.<eos> Nas will take you and Roman to all of Shepherd's old residences.
Thanks for the heads-up.<eos> What the hell are you doing, Gord?<eos> Mr. Riley, I'm the assistant...<eos> You know exactly what I'm doing here, Zach.<eos> I'm here for what's rightfully mine.<eos> Proof that I was the sole inventor of RileyShare, that you stole that code from me before you dropped out and moved to Silicon Valley, that your entire empire is built on a lie!<eos> That I, Gordon Meredith Enver, should be in your shoes, breathing your rarefied air as a beloved visionary instead of... lurking, nameless and thankless in the shadows, like some digital thug!<eos> Give us a moment.<eos> Gord... I'm so sorry... that you feel that way.<eos> But I didn't steal anything from you.
From this point on, every member is a suspect.<eos> This is all Rich's fault.<eos> Sends us on some wild goose chase because of a personal grudge he can't let go of.<eos> Okay, is there an alumni room here somewhere where we can get information?<eos> You know, it's always about Rich with Rich.<eos> He doesn't care about other people's issues.<eos> - He doesn't...<eos> - Would you shut up about Rich!<eos> You broke up, you just need to deal with it.<eos> At least your ex didn't try to kill you and then hand you over to a madwoman to be tortured and exploit your grief over your one true love who died because you wouldn't move in with him.
There's some heavy-duty stuff going down right now, and I need to help stop it.<eos> You're about to pull a gun on me, aren't you?<eos> Wha... what makes you say that, Gord?<eos> The fact that you left the Awakening Ceremony.<eos> You're not fleeing from the sound of gunfire.<eos> Also, there's a pistol-shaped bulge in your jacket.<eos> Jeez!<eos> You crazy?<eos> You could have hit me!<eos> You're lucky I need someone like you alive, Gord.
A lithium-rich country.<eos> With a government... about to collapse.<eos> Thad, come on.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> You dick around with pharmaceutical prices, not war!<eos> Business is business, and thanks to my recent acquisition of Riley motors, business just got very, very good.<eos> - Zach sold to you?<eos> - And a few other members.<eos> Lithium was getting too expensive, but we're not gonna have that problem.<eos> No, but the F.B.I.'s already onto you.
It's hard on the ears.<eos> Talk to me, man.<eos> We can reason with each other.<eos> That guy you shot?<eos> The half-muncher?<eos> Trust me, man.<eos> He's...<eos> He's impossible to kill.<eos> If you don't lay back and listen to reason,<eos> - he's gonna kill you. - Shut up!
That guy you shot?<eos> The half-muncher?<eos> Trust me, man.<eos> He's...<eos> He's impossible to kill.<eos> If you don't lay back and listen to reason,<eos> - he's gonna kill you. - Shut up!<eos> You are trespassing on US Government property!<eos> I'm not playing around, kid.<eos> No, you keep screwing around, that guy's gonna jack you up.
- Help!<eos> Please!<eos> - Hey!<eos> You back off!<eos> I said, get back!<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> She's just... overprotective.<eos> I...<eos> I can't do this.<eos> It's ok, she won't bother you anymore.
Sorry, but I'm still scared to be out here talking to you.<eos> I know a place we can go where there's no strigoi and it's super cool.<eos> I go there to be alone and think.<eos> You'll love it. I promise.<eos> Any sign of the tanker?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Maybe he got delayed at his first stop.<eos> So, where are you from?<eos> Before all this happened, I was living in New York.<eos> What brought you here?
Let's get the hell out of here!<eos> I am an American fighting in the forces which guard my country and my way of life.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Sniper down!<eos> Dukali, huh?<eos> You know Captain Roman, but... why didn't you answer him?<eos> What happened to your friends, kid?<eos> Strigs came.<eos> With people helping them.<eos> People like you.
You have no idea how much this means to me.<eos> No biggie.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Zack.<eos> Come in.<eos> How are you today, my son?<eos> I was thinking.<eos> Maybe I don't need the White.<eos> I mean I'm breathing just fine.<eos> What's troubling you?
No biggie.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Zack.<eos> Come in.<eos> How are you today, my son?<eos> I was thinking.<eos> Maybe I don't need the White.<eos> I mean I'm breathing just fine.<eos> What's troubling you?<eos> The people who work for you... is it true they don't get fresh food?
And not by her.<eos> No.<eos> Babies born in this facility are raised by non-B-Positive people because that's their job.<eos> Sophie's job, and the rest of the women here, is that more B-Positive babies... to increase the percentage of the population.<eos> She's gonna freak out.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> See...<eos> Sophie trusts you, so you're going to be right there by her side every step of the way, you're going to reassure her everything's fine, you're going to tell her that her baby's in the best of hands.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - I'm not gonna lie for you. - Miranda, look, I know that this place, it's not really your idea of paradise, but, you gotta believe me, there are places out there that... would be a living hell for a girl like you.
So, turn me down again,<eos> and that's exactly where you're going.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> If I say yes, then I am just as bad as he is.<eos> But if I say no, he's gonna send me away.<eos> You have to do it.<eos> - I can't be part of this.<eos> - It doesn't matter whether you're part of it or not; he's gonna do it anyway.<eos> If you turn him down, he'll just find somebody else to take your place.<eos> And you'll get shipped out to God knows where and nobody will ever hear from you again.
But I need you to stay focused, alright?<eos> I can't repeat myself.<eos> It's all gonna be working...<eos> Miranda!<eos> What the hell are you doing out here?<eos> Nurse Ratchet gave me a few minutes.<eos> - How is Sophie?<eos> - Peachy.<eos> Look, she's scared and emotional, and everything sucks, but she's going to be fine.<eos> I understand that this is very difficult on you.
Zack saw the whole thing.<eos> He didn't push the button 'cause he wanted people to die.<eos> He did it 'cause he was angry with me.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> I went looking for him in the aftermath, but he'd disappeared.<eos> Do you think he's still alive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some days I hope so.<eos> But if I'm being honest, there are other days where I think he would be better...<eos> I can get you to the SEPTA tunnel.
We need those guys.<eos> I need no one.<eos> On my own for over a thousand years. Yeah.<eos> Now how's that working out for you?<eos> Don't test me.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You don't like people, And most of them don't wanna share a beer with you.<eos> But what you're doing right now is stupid.<eos> All right? And you're only doing it because you're rattled.<eos> You almost died in that silo but I got you out.
Apart from all the others, the master blessed with me. With free will.<eos> He entrusted me. With implementing his vision of this world.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Abraham setrakian.<eos> Perhaps you can tell me his whereabouts. While you enjoy your meal...<eos> Or I can make a meal of you.<eos> Then the master will know everything.<eos> Your minions separated us. When they brought us in.<eos> I'm sure setrakian has been drained. And discarded by now.<eos> The very... System that you created. Has robbed you.
Of everything.<eos> Of our decadeslong conflict.<eos> Of abraham setrakian.<eos> Even on my deathbed, Your pettiness is nothing more. Than an annoyance.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> You're not going to die.<eos> Not yet.<eos> First, I need you to do something for me.<eos> Then and only then. Will I allow you to pass.<eos> I will do nothing for you.
Approximately?<eos> None.<eos> What?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Come on!<eos> You're telling me we risked our lives taking this convoy. So that you could get plutonium and we could get nothing?<eos> I wouldn't say "nothing."<eos> You have our undying gratitude.<eos> I'm guessing the partnership will do better.<eos> In fact, I'm fairly certain they'll pay a pretty penny. To get their plutonium back, along with you. And hairless,
- Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too.<eos> It didn't ruin anything.<eos> Yeah, only ten years of therapy.<eos> Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.<eos> She's right, pal.<eos> I love our life.<eos> And I'm scared of changing it, 'cause the truth is when I close my eyes and I think about our future...<eos> I see us with kids, Jack.<eos> Yeah.<eos> William Hill, I loved you and you left.
- Out of the way, coming through.<eos> Moving out.<eos> Watch your back.<eos> Let's go, we're losing him.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> I'm sorry. Do you know where room 412 is?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I keep getting turned around in here.<eos> This is what I get for flying across the country to surprise you.
Come on, please.<eos> Toby.<eos> I apologize, Nurse Ratchet.<eos> She's insatiable.<eos> She can't get enough.<eos> It's... come on, give me a kiss.<eos> You're belligerent.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> Did I get something on you?
Uh... Wife and I found out we're having triplets.<eos> Ooh. I'm sorry.<eos> No, no, no. I-it's an exciting thing.<eos> For who?<eos> Look.<eos> Anyhow, I, uh...<eos> I need a raise.<eos> I'm a hard worker.<eos> I've done good work for you.<eos> I've always... I've always... I've never let you down.
But you were right.<eos> So I went away for a while to try to find some authenticity.<eos> And I did it, okay?<eos> I found it.<eos> I did ayahuasca with a shaman in the Salt Flats of Utah.<eos> I howled at the moon with the prairie coyotes of Kansas.<eos> I fished with the lobstermen of Maine.<eos> I mean, you did all that in a month?<eos> But, look, I'm back now, and I am better than ever.<eos> For the play, and for you.
I want us to be together. Okay?<eos> I've changed.<eos> I'm, I'm ready for something real.<eos> Sorry, Olivia, but... we're dating now.<eos> Life goes on after you disappear. Yeah. Olivia?<eos> Ron.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We were dead without you.
- I think I'll pass. - No.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> And we need to talk about this.<eos> Uh, we... There's nothing to talk about, all right?<eos> He said medication was an option, so.<eos> Toby.<eos> - I'll leave you two alone. - Yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> This is serious.<eos> And this could kill you. Yeah.
Just perfect.<eos> He's not a handyman.<eos> He's a construction foreman.<eos> And he does very well for himself.<eos> Not well enough.<eos> Not for this.<eos> He cannot support three children.<eos> And you can't raise three children in a two bedroom walk-up.<eos> Mother, I'm not gonna sit here<eos> - and listen to you. - What?
I hate the word surgery.<eos> I hate, I hate surgeons.<eos> I hate sturgeon, the fish, 'cause it sounds like "surgeons."<eos> God, I'm freaking out.<eos> - Just breathe, babe. - Yeah.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just don't want you to freak out, okay?<eos> Well, don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you... is the thing.
Yeah.<eos> But she, um she did have kind of an interesting idea.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> She suggested that maybe once we have the kids,<eos> - Mm-hmm. - We move in with them.<eos> 'Cause they have all that space, and, you know, we could save money, live with them for a year or two.<eos> Hey-o.<eos> Oh, oh, you're serious.<eos> Um, uh... babe, you-your mother drives you nuts.
- Toby.<eos> Did you mean all that stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would totally marry you if that's something you're down with.<eos> You would?<eos> I'd marry the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.<eos> You would?<eos> Wait, just like that?<eos> Just like that.<eos> It was just like that from the moment I met you, kid.
Stop.<eos> And don't give me some damn story about your cat.<eos> I can feel it now, Randall.<eos> This cancer is coming for me sooner than later.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Now, Jessie can handle it.<eos> He's seen this stuff.<eos> He's been helping me make arrangements, taking me to some of the best state-funded nursing homes, trying to find a good place to go before this gets really bad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I will not put this on you, Randall.

For a while, really.<eos> Which kinda blows.<eos> Sorry, Father.<eos> Because the best moment of my life was the morning I met her.<eos> She rear-ended me.<eos> Totally her fault.<eos> I got out of my car to go scream at her... but I saw her face.<eos> And I walked right up to her and stuck out my hand like an idiot and said, "Hi, I'm Joe.<eos> Don't worry about what just happened.<eos> Could I take you out for a cup of coffee?"
There just... There are too many things in this house, and I need you<eos> - not to be one of them.<eos> - Babe, the house isn't...<eos> Wow.<eos> What? Nothin'.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Okay, so now I'm the crazy wife who's making your life totally miserable,<eos> - I'm not miserable. I'm just...<eos> I'm-I'm starting to get stress vertigo anytime we have a conversation about a... a grocery list or, you know, any conversation, - for that matter.<eos> - Huh. But... you are carrying my children, so I'm gonna leave you to your afternoon.
Well... it was really moving to see Mary play such a complicated mother...<eos> You don't see that often.<eos> Tony, Carl, this is my best friend, Jack.<eos> Today's his birthday.<eos> - Oh, happy birthday, man.<eos> - Happy birthday! - Thank you.<eos> - And his wife's pregnant with triplets.<eos> - Oh. - Ooh.<eos> Come on, it's not gonna be that bad.<eos> Oh, Jack, come on, now, I... I love you, and I'm excited for you.
All right, cowboy.<eos> So, I'll meet you in the bedroom in five minutes.<eos> - You know what to do. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Strip down to your birthday suit. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Okay. - Okay.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> It's my home, Peter.<eos> I'd appreciate if everyone spoke at full volume.<eos> Now, what's on your mind?<eos> Dad, we're officially worried about you.
Tradition is tradition.<eos> Peter and Alli came over today.<eos> He is your son, through and through, that's for certain.<eos> Stubborn as a damn mule.<eos> He thinks he knows something 'cause he's been married for... what, ten whole years?<eos> I love that boy, but... my God.<eos> Carol, I'm gonna say something now, and you have to promise now not to be mad at me.<eos> Every morning, I open the, uh, medicine cabinet, and I just stare at all your...<eos> Um...<eos> Baby, I don't know if I can keep doing this without you anymore.

I'm really not sure that I want to.<eos> God, I miss being with you, and I...<eos> Well...<eos> Duty calls.<eos> We'll, uh... finish this conversation another time, okay?<eos> I love you, baby.
- It was stupid. - Yeah.<eos> But also sweet.<eos> You ever wish we could just start over?<eos> Go back to where we started, like that first day, you know, just try to do it all fresh?<eos> Yeah, sometimes.<eos> All the time.<eos> It's all I want, honestly... to start over.<eos> Hi. I'm Samantha.<eos> Don't... worry about what happened back there.<eos> Can I take you for a cup of coffee?
Thank you.<eos> One laugh, that's it?<eos> It was... you can, uh, all thank my beautiful yet unfunny wife, Shelly, for that last one.<eos> Rebecca, actually, I have to apologize.<eos> For the first two months of your relationship...<eos> Jack bailed on me so much to go out with you that, uh, I started referring to you as Yoko Ono.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But then Jack started using words like "soul mate"<eos> and "forever."<eos> And he never really said stuff like that until he met you.
- You're welcome.<eos> So I'm on my way down to the basement with a load of whites, and there's Kevin trying to sneak a girl out the basement door.<eos> Ever since we moved him down there, it's like we gave the kid a bachelor pad.<eos> You know?<eos> You guys, honestly, it is so nice to be out to dinner.<eos> I mean, between the kids and the band now and your work schedule, I feel like we never get this kind of time for ourselves.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I pretty much have to go to a show if I want to schedule time with my wife nowadays.<eos> That's not really fair.<eos> Neither is Ben keeping you out till, you know, well beyond 11:00 most nights.
Do you have any idea how invasive that is?<eos> You better be dying.<eos> And soon.<eos> But you're not, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're glowing.<eos> God, that is so annoying.<eos> Why don't you age?<eos> Look, I only came here today to tell you to go screw yourself.
I forgot how much I love watching you eat.<eos> You eat like a truck driver.<eos> You just think that 'cause you eat like a rabbit.<eos> Maybe.<eos> So, why now, Kevin?<eos> Why did you come find me?<eos> Because I never stopped thinking about you.<eos> So, tell me, you know, everything.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I want to know everything that happened to you since the last time I saw you.
Good night, guys.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, so, uh, Wednesday.<eos> Wednesday, my place.<eos> Hey, uh, you okay?<eos> You seem off.<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.<eos> - I just have a lot on my mind.<eos> - All right.<eos> Well, uh, maybe this'll cheer you up.
I call marriage tonight.<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> - I need my teammate.<eos> - Beth.<eos> Marriage.<eos> Please take off that shirt, honey.<eos> It wasn't cool on Sisqo in 2001.<eos> It's just... it's not cool now.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> - Mm. - I love you.
But I...<eos> Do you remember what you wore the first day of fourth grade?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Overalls.<eos> You had on overalls, and you had one of those, uh, those scrunchie things in your hair and you had a Punky Brewster backpack.<eos> You walking into my fourth grade class, Sophie, that's the best thing that ever happened to me in my entire life.<eos> Actually, scratch that, that's not true.<eos> It's the second best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> The best thing that ever happened to me... was you telling me that you'd marry me.<eos> I'm still in love with you.

Here.<eos> Here.<eos> It's my grandmother's ring.<eos> It was my last surprise.<eos> So, um...<eos> I'm gonna get out of here, I won't cr...<eos> I won't cramp your style anymore.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Um, never did hear back from you last night.
- No, no, no.<eos> Not yet, not yet.<eos> - Please?<eos> - Almost.<eos> Almost, almost, almost.<eos> Okay. Step up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I got you. - Okay.
I do have one more surprise.<eos> I honestly don't know if I can handle any more surprises.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Our vows?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wonder if they still hold up.<eos> Hmm.<eos> "Rebecca... saying I do means saying I will.<eos> I will love you today and every day for the rest of my life."
But the moment that's burned into my brain and heart is the first time I saw you.<eos> "Rebecca, you have changed the way I think about love."<eos> Hmm.<eos> "I know things may not always be easy..."<eos> Ha. That should have been my red flag.<eos> Well, no take-backs now.<eos> - You're... - Ugh.<eos> You're stuck with me.<eos> "But our love has always been worth it.<eos> I will encourage you, trust and respect you.
- You're... - Ugh.<eos> You're stuck with me.<eos> "But our love has always been worth it.<eos> I will encourage you, trust and respect you.<eos> I will create a home with you, full of laughter and compassion.<eos> I will raise a family with you, I will grow old with you,<eos> I will share my dreams with you."<eos> So today, um... in front of, uh, everyone here,<eos> I pledge myself to you.<eos> "Jack, I fall a little bit more in love with you every day.
Previously on This Is Us...<eos> I've decided to have gastric bypass surgery.<eos> - Uh, I'm gonna do it. - Do what?<eos> The surgery.<eos> I just don't want you to freak out, okay?<eos> Don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you.
Kate, we have the rest of our lives to spend together.<eos> Or at least the rest of mine, I had a heart attack at 40,<eos> - so I'm going first, obvi. - Toby.<eos> Look, this is an incredible opportunity, and I want you to do it for yourself.<eos> And Dr. Singh doesn't want me travelling for at least another two weeks so I will just get to know the Big Apple a little bit.<eos> Do you know anyone in the city?<eos> Not a soul.<eos> But I will be fine.<eos> If Macaulay Culkin can do it, so can I.<eos> I love you.
We encourage guests to disconnect as much as possible.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, it's a family emergency.<eos> Hey, Kev.<eos> What's your emergency?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Wait, are you actually having one?<eos> I can feel Sloane's wrath.<eos> It actually has heat on it.<eos> Her wrath is making me sweat.<eos> This is not the first time a girl has been mad at you.
I know it's your birthday, but...<eos> Hey, wow! You guys look so great!<eos> Oh, my God, it's Madonna!<eos> Wow, Madonna!<eos> Have you seen my daughter, Kate?<eos> This is actually... this is her birthday party.<eos> And I know she would love to meet you.<eos> Dad.<eos> Kate!<eos> How did I not recognize you?
Why aren't you with all your friends at Kevin's party?<eos> No one wanted to learn how to Vogue. What?<eos> Why not?<eos> They all like Kevin more than me.<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> - Come on, no, that's not true.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - No, it's not true. - Yes, it is.<eos> - No.<eos> You think I like Kevin more than I like you?
Okay. Okay.<eos> Um...<eos> Well, you just come join the other party when you're ready, okay?<eos> Okay? We'll be over here.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me see if I got this.<eos> You had two amazing women,... - and you let them both go? - Yeah.<eos> I already know that much, thank you.<eos> Well, lucky for you, I am the king of romantic grand gestures.
Whenever you're ready.<eos> Could you plug this in to something and push play?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Uh, what's happening?<eos> When I was a little boy in Memphis, there was this record shop, Hoppy's.<eos> I hear they tore it down a couple of years ago.<eos> When I was a kid, that was the place.<eos> They'd let you listen to any record, even if you wasn't gonna buy it.<eos> One of the owners... Mo Moretti was his name... He could look at you and tell what song you needed to hear.
Okay. Um...<eos> Say, um...<eos> S... Say I can come in.<eos> I can't say that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you say you'll think about... meeting up with me?<eos> Maybe we can have a conversation, just... I want to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You always have to go big, don't you, Pearson?<eos> For you, Sophie... always.
You got this.<eos> Yeah. You've been driving for a good... 15 minutes, now.<eos> Ah, this is a dream come true, right here.<eos> Thank you so much, Randall.<eos> - It's my pleasure.<eos> - Wow. Watch me do this.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Oh, I could take a nap, now!<eos> Hey!<eos> Did I scare you a little bit there, son?
Yeah, well, we're gonna be fine.<eos> Now give your husband a kiss because it's Valentine's Day.<eos> - Fine. - Yeah.<eos> But only 'cause it's Valentine's Day.<eos> Hey, you know what? I'm really, really excited about your show tonight.<eos> You are?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Really excited. - Hmm.<eos> But don't get too tired from all the singing, okay?<eos> 'Cause I still want to take you out to O'Shannon's for dinner.
- Unless you want to shake things up... - No, no.<eos> Only O'Shannon's on Valentine's Day.<eos> That's our tradition.<eos> Best bacon cheeseburgers in all of Pittsburgh.<eos> You getting the onion rings?<eos> Hell yes, we're doing onion rings.<eos> Cool wife.<eos> Hot hubby. Mm.<eos> Well, that didn't take long.<eos> You know, uh, for a minute there, you actually convinced me that I was like you.
Uh, but I, you know...<eos> - Seriously.<eos> Who is this guy? - Well, uh...<eos> - Let's get out of here.<eos> - Katie.<eos> - Honestly.<eos> I got to play tennis with Salman Rushdie.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Hello?<eos> Did I wake you up? No.
Yeah, call Kate.<eos> She's really good with you when you're nervous.<eos> Sophie, I'm not nerv...<eos> Why would I be nervous?<eos> I know all my lines.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> I want to split your accounts between you and Sanjay.<eos> The medication isn't working anymore.<eos> I don't want to do this to you.
But I can't tell her that I think it's crazy, because then... she's just, she's gonna resent me forever.<eos> That's true.<eos> Yeah. And then this guy Ben, in her band.<eos> I've met him a couple of times.<eos> He has a thing for her.<eos> H-He, oh, he clearly has a thing for her...<eos> Jack.<eos> It's Rebecca.<eos> Wouldn't matter if this guy was Jeff Goldblum.<eos> She only has eyes for you.
But if I don't get an A on my Hamlet essay...<eos> Hey, I will write that Hamlet essay for you if you stop telling me this story.<eos> Come on, man, it's Valentine's Day.<eos> Go on a date.<eos> Kate, do we know someone desperate enough to go on a date with Randall?<eos> Randall, ignore him.<eos> He thinks he walks on water now because he's having sex with Sophie.<eos> What? !<eos> You're having sex?<eos> I disown you.
- And it's on sale.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> My good man, do you have this dazzler in a 56 long?<eos> All right.<eos> I love that you love flashy clothes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, like, when did that start?<eos> I don't know, I've always just had a thing for fashion.<eos> You know, sixth grade, a well-fitting pair of Z. Cavaricci jeans and I was done for.<eos> I love learning that about you.
Okay.<eos> Deal.<eos> - Mr. Pearson. - Yeah?<eos> - It's not my fault.<eos> - I know.<eos> - He got so mad at me.<eos> - It's okay, Jenna.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> William?<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
Uh... and for you, Mr. Buchanan.<eos> Uh, lots of, uh increases.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If you look...<eos> You know, if you're looking... at the growth of, um...<eos> Uh... through our position in... Dry Season and Wind Contracts, we've seen continued growth beyond all projections this quarter.<eos> Um... as, um... the precipitation levels were below, even the lowest estimates, uh, we plan to see profits rise as we maintain those contracts over the next few months...<eos> Jack?<eos> - Good to see you made it out to a show. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. - I haven't seen you in a while.
No.<eos> Time to hit the road.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Good luck, Mom.<eos> You're supposed to say "Break a leg."<eos> Oh, am I?<eos> Bye, baby.<eos> Bye, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, I love you.
You're supposed to say "Break a leg."<eos> Oh, am I?<eos> Bye, baby.<eos> Bye, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, I love you.<eos> I promise I'll call twice a day, every day.<eos> Have fun, Mom.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I will.<eos> I love you, Mom.

And even though we only had him for a few months, he's part of our fabric now.<eos> We'll remember things as "before William"<eos> and "after William."<eos> Hey, Kate.<eos> Come here, talk to me.<eos> Please, just not now.<eos> Toby, don't.<eos> Just don't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I should be comforting you.
What's in Cleveland?<eos> Oh, she's... following her dreams.<eos> No one's dreams are in Cleveland.<eos> Well, it's Cleveland, and then Boston, then New York, Trenton, Philly.<eos> She's on tour with her Ben.<eos> Her band.<eos> She's in a band, she's on tour with the band.<eos> I knew something was up.<eos> Nothing's up.<eos> Come on, Jack, I see you every day.
So, William seems to have really connected with the girls in a short time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what he did.<eos> With everyone he met, it seems.<eos> You know your father.<eos> Jack, I mean.<eos> He, um... he taught you a lot about honesty and courage.<eos> But the truth is, you came into this world pretty perfect.<eos> You always had this, uh... gentleness, this inner kindness to you, from the start, and I think... you got that from William.<eos> I really thought I was doing the right thing for you and for our family...
And then when I saw him again, years later, he was so much better.<eos> And you got curious.<eos> And I got scared.<eos> I always planned on telling you, I did.<eos> I would set an age in my mind.<eos> I'd say, "When he's 15.<eos> I'm gonna tell him when he's 15."<eos> And 15 would come and go, and I'd lose my nerve, and then I would decide on 16.<eos> Because the truth is, I was so terrified.<eos> Because I knew it would devastate you.

And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart that I am so sorry you didn't have more time together.<eos> That it is my fault.<eos> - you didn't have more time with him.<eos> - I-I got enough.<eos> I got enough.<eos> It was enough time to know that I loved him.<eos> I loved him.<eos> And I know that he loved me.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> I love you, Mom.

You know, I saw my family and...<eos> I saw you all the way back there and I realized<eos> I didn't come to New York to be in a hit play.<eos> I came to New York to win back my girl.<eos> My girl who would drag a crutch all the way across town after a 12-hour shift for a stupid joke.<eos> - 14-hour shift.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Great joke.<eos> I'm not messing things up with you again.<eos> And however long it takes for me to convince you of that, I--

Okay.<eos> You remember when I told you I... couldn't talk about my dad's death?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, that's because it's my fault.<eos> I'm the reason that he's dead.<eos> Hey, princess, it's Dad.<eos> I wanted to tell you something.<eos> I-I wanted- - I wanted you to know that you were right.<eos> I'm gonna fix things with your mom.<eos> I love you, Katie girl.
Okay.<eos> You keep up with your chess while I'm gone, you hear?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> You take care of him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Take good care of you, too.<eos> I'll send you a postcard.<eos> I love you.

Yes, William, I do.<eos> That's what family does.<eos> Pittsburgh isn't that far.<eos> It's pretty far.<eos> Oh, it's pretty damn far, isn't it?<eos> You be safe.<eos> You be good.<eos> If you want me to come, I will.<eos> No, no.<eos> I've kept you to myself long enough.
She worries about you.<eos> Yeah, that she does.<eos> That she does.<eos> You know, I didn't believe her at first when she told me about you having a breakdown.<eos> Is it okay to call it a breakdown?<eos> Lots of names for it.<eos> Anxiety attack, mental distress, nervous exhaustion, stress-induced trauma.<eos> You choose.<eos> It was quite a shock to see you so vulnerable.<eos> The night Kevin brought you home...
Hey, William?<eos> Uh, uh...<eos> Oh, see?<eos> My cousin the nun.<eos> Hey, man, y'all let him be now.<eos> If we was all as good as my cuz, Memphis would be a hell of a lot safer.<eos> A lot less fun, but a hell of a lot safer, right?<eos> Here you go, baby.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, look, I'm sorry about teasing you back there, cuz. You know, um, I get a little loosey-goosey when I... you know.
Well, we're here.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Soulsville right there is where I grew up.<eos> Used to have a girlfriend lived up there.<eos> See?<eos> Fresh meats that you could actually go and pick out the chicken.<eos> - He would kill the chicken...<eos> - What?<eos> ... defeather it, clean it, - and then wrap it up for you.
Yeah, I know the timing isn't great, with us taking off and all.<eos> Hey, your mama needs you, all right?<eos> Never apologize for taking care of family.<eos> I won't-won't be gone long.<eos> Mama's a tank.<eos> Yeah, she the bullets, too.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> I'm gonna come back with 60 new songs.<eos> 60?<eos> All right, I'm gonna hold you to that, cuz.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, no more of that, all right?<eos> No more looking away.<eos> Man, you see something you want, you don't look away... you go get it.<eos> You hear me, cuz?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Uh? - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, come here, you.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> I love you, cuz.
I had to go take care of her.<eos> Oh, come on, you think I don't know that, cuz?<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Cuz?<eos> Like cousin?<eos> This is your cousin?<eos> Yes.<eos> My son, Randall.<eos> Yeah, he look like you.
Yes.<eos> My son, Randall.<eos> Yeah, he look like you.<eos> I do?<eos> 'Cause, you know, I've had a few people say that to me, but I don't really see the re...<eos> I'll let you get to it.<eos> I wanted to come back.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> 'Cause I waited.<eos> For years, I waited to hear from you.
Hi, Mama.<eos> I told you not to come.<eos> Of course I came.<eos> I'm sicker than I let on, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You'll... be okay.<eos> It won't be long, at least.<eos> I don't want you getting stuck here.<eos> Your life is in Memphis.<eos> - I won't keep you from it.
- Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> - William.<eos> - Laurel.<eos> - Oh, no, William, I can't, I can't.<eos> - Come on, Mom.<eos> With the spoonfuls, I can't.<eos> Please.<eos> I used to love waking you up in the morning when you were a child.
I owed you that.<eos> Oh.<eos> And I owed you this.<eos> Now let's go.<eos> Hey, William.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You too sick to play?<eos> I'm never too sick to play.<eos> Wait.<eos> I know you, I know you.
Are you drunk?<eos> ♪ Yeah, I may be a little drunk ♪<eos> ♪ But that doesn't mean it's not true. ♪<eos> You sound good.<eos> I feel good.<eos> Beth, I got a whole other family down here.<eos> You got to see it.<eos> Well, take lots of video.<eos> I will.<eos> I love you, Beth.

♪ My sunshine away. ♪<eos> All right, old man.<eos> I let you sleep 'cause we had a late night, but those ducks ain't gonna wait all day.<eos> Well, actually they probably will, but I won't.<eos> So here's what I was thinking.<eos> We can...<eos> Hey, William.<eos> Hey. It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna get you to the hospital, okay?
No, no, no, no. You sleep.<eos> I spoke with the doctor.<eos> You knew you weren't coming home.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Leave the...<eos> I got something for you.<eos> In the front of my bag, go ahead.<eos> Waiting for the right moment.<eos> I'm gonna call Beth.<eos> I'll have the girls here hugging you within hours.
That's my boy.<eos> Now here's Clemente... 341 last year, 86 RBIs, and then in the World Series he hit .414...<eos> Hey, you've reached Jack, Rebecca, Kevin,<eos> Kate and Randall. Go ahead and leave us a message and we'll call you back.<eos> Jack, are you home?<eos> Oh. I was hoping you would be there.<eos> I miss you.<eos> And I wish you were here.<eos> Or I wish I was there.<eos> I love you.
- You've sacrificed?<eos> - Yet you don't know the half of the load that I have had to carry.<eos> Was it hard for you to make every decision<eos> - for this family, and watch me follow?<eos> - You don't know the things... - You don't know what I've given up.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You don't know the things I've had to do.<eos> - You want a family. - The crap that I've had to eat. You want a house, you want a kid.<eos> And I followed, followed, followed.<eos> - But you sacrificed? - Yeah, yeah, I devoted my life to you
I know what I want to do, you know, now that we're back.<eos> Like, for work.<eos> Oh, yeah? You gonna call your old boss or...<eos> No, I want to sing.<eos> Sometimes they'll make good decisions.<eos> It's just a meeting with a director, okay?<eos> It's not like I'm gonna get the part.<eos> Don't do that. I want you to get it.<eos> Sometimes bad decisions.<eos> I love you.
- Did I say something wrong?<eos> - No, no, no, no. Not at all.<eos> You seem like a really lovely guy.<eos> But I need to be singing tonight.<eos> Hello.<eos> You know, I was supposed to have another date the... night that we met.<eos> I ever tell you that?<eos> No.<eos> The woman that sold me the Chevelle, she set me up.<eos> But then I saw you and I stood the other girl up.
Nerd.<eos> - Morning, Kate.<eos> - Hi, Jane.<eos> She's gonna send the best ones up to Jacqueline, and then from there, I get my first writing assignment.<eos> Okay.<eos> Grab her.<eos> Whoa! Wait, why?<eos> We're supposed to be at the August presentation meeting.<eos> All right, calm down, Type A.<eos> We're gonna get you there, but first, we are toasting your ass.
Whoa! Wait, why?<eos> We're supposed to be at the August presentation meeting.<eos> All right, calm down, Type A.<eos> We're gonna get you there, but first, we are toasting your ass.<eos> For the past four years, the three of us have toiled away together in the assistant trenches.<eos> Actually, I was only in there for two.<eos> Kat, we're having Jane time now.<eos> Okay, fine, but my social media director salary - When we started together as assistants,<eos> I had no idea that you guys would also become my very best friends.<eos> Jane, we're so happy for you - and so incredibly proud. - Thank you.
That looks like Snapchat, which I thought was just for sending dirty pics.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, once.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, my friend has a big meeting<eos> - with Jacqueline today. - _<eos> - Lucky her.<eos> - And I... am color-coordinating macaroons.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna start dumping my problems on you.
- with Jacqueline today. - _<eos> - Lucky her.<eos> - And I... am color-coordinating macaroons.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna start dumping my problems on you.<eos> I know that's not what this is.<eos> Oh?<eos> And what is this?<eos> Did I not make it obvious?<eos> Well... I'm using you... for sex.
Tell me everything.<eos> What is the story about?<eos> My meeting with Adena was a disaster.<eos> Is Sutton not wearing a bra?<eos> Yeah, I don't...<eos> Why aren't you?<eos> Jane got a story approved.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> See, I told you.<eos> - Who's better than you, babe?
How did women used to do this?<eos> I can't believe we're driving slowly past Eric's house.<eos> I must be insane.<eos> You know what?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> Sir, can you please turn around?<eos> Sir, can you please ignore everything my friend just said?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - You're getting closure.<eos> Yes, and we're on a bridge.<eos> This is gonna be really good for you.
I think the odds are good enough that I have to check it out, so... will you please come with me?<eos> Please, please, please?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Lauren Park's office.<eos> I don't have her at the moment.<eos> We'll have to return.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wish I could, but I have to work really late - for the 60th-anniversary gala.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Can't you have somebody, like, fill in for you?
Tell that to my boss, though.<eos> Lauren Park's office.<eos> I very much appreciated the Snapchat lessons.<eos> It seems only fair I return the favor, so I'm gonna teach you how we used to do things.<eos> Describe your panties.<eos> Hold, please.<eos> This is really important, so... - um, I should probably... - Okay, okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.<eos> I will go alone, and I will call you later and tell you all about it.<eos> - Love you.
And...<eos> Yeah, he didn't... he didn't mean the weekend.<eos> He meant all of it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Really?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not fine.<eos> I was never taught how to handle this kind of stuff.<eos> I mean, between three brothers and no mom, I didn't exactly get the instruction manual on how to deal with it when the guy you love leaves you alone in a train station on your birthday, so...
This is Sutton.<eos> Hi, it's me.<eos> - Jane? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why are you calling me from an unknown number?<eos> It worked.<eos> You sound drunk.<eos> Yes.<eos> Correct.<eos> I, um... I got myself drunk enough to express my emotions, and it turns out I have a lot of emotions to express.<eos> Not at you.
You use humor to hide your real emotions.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna ask you a personal question.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why do you still wear a hijab?<eos> Isn't it kind of contradictory?<eos> I choose to wear the hijab.<eos> It does not oppress me... but liberates me from society's expectations of what a woman should look like.<eos> People tend to get uncomfortable when they cannot put you in a box.
- What is going on with you?<eos> - Um, nothing.<eos> I felt very confident giving you this promotion, but your energy this week has been off.<eos> - Maybe you're not quite ready. - No.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> And I'm so grateful for this opportunity.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> So when am I gonna get some material from you?
I know, but I don't want you to get hurt.<eos> Me neither.<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> Hey.<eos> You texted.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Well, I could answer that, or... I could show you.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry I had to ignore you before, but this... this is... - This is work.
Hey, Adena.<eos> It's so good to hear your voice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, okay, so...<eos> Eric.<eos> Jane.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm stalking you.
Jane.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm stalking you.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> It's a pretty crappy feeling, isn't it?<eos> Lauren Park's office.<eos> Sutton.<eos> It's Richard Hunter.<eos> I'm calling because I can't stop thinking about you, and I would really like to take you out to dinner.
Way to go, son!<eos> He's a bad kid.<eos> Why don't you listen?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> - You are stupid.<eos> - Stupid, stupid, stupid.<eos> You're an idiot!<eos> Yeah, you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached.<eos> Lose your damn head.<eos> Nobody cares about you.
He's a bad kid.<eos> Why don't you listen?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> - You are stupid.<eos> - Stupid, stupid, stupid.<eos> You're an idiot!<eos> Yeah, you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached.<eos> Lose your damn head.<eos> Nobody cares about you.<eos> Nobody cares about you.
We want to see what happens in your brain when you feel things.<eos> What things?<eos> Stop. Look, just...<eos> I want a lawyer, okay?<eos> I was willing to cooperate before, but now I'm tired.<eos> I'm just so... just...<eos> David, I need you to stay calm.<eos> You're afraid of me.<eos> David, please.<eos> I'm afraid for you.
Hey, where is he?<eos> Who, the kid?<eos> He's, climbing a mountain.<eos> He's got his... got his clampons on.<eos> Hey, would you... hold on.<eos> It's lady stuff.<eos> They've got this candy bar. It's new.<eos> I saw it on TV, with nougat and chocolate and, like, this crispy wafer.<eos> If you could... if you could buy one and, like, mail it to me, that'd be great.<eos> I was looking for you.
What was I gonna... spend the rest of my life popping pills from a little cup?<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> It's you that's got problems.<eos> They're coming for you, babe.<eos> Who?<eos> They know about the hospital.<eos> What you did.<eos> I didn't.<eos> What she did when she was you, had your powers.<eos> They're coming, and they're gonna kill you.
It's okay.<eos> It's just... you know, Ben, he's got to get to the garden tomorrow morning, you know?<eos> Sure. Okay.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Night.<eos> Good night.<eos> David?<eos> David?<eos> They're coming and...<eos> And then they're gonna kill you.
Where's the girl?<eos> What girl?<eos> Don't be clever, David.<eos> We know who you are.<eos> We know they came for her at the hospital thinking she was you.<eos> No, you took her at the hospital.<eos> You were there.<eos> No, David.<eos> It's clear now what happened.<eos> They came for you but got her by accident, and we've got you, but we want her too.
Is... is this...<eos> Is this real?<eos> I mean, what if we're back at the hospital?<eos> What if none of this ever happened and we're... please, I have to know.<eos> Are you real?<eos> I'm real.<eos> This is real, okay?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I came back for you.<eos> I love you.
Are you real?<eos> I'm real.<eos> This is real, okay?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I came back for you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> You gonna say it too?<eos> I-I love you.
Your brightness isn't up.<eos> Wonderful!<eos> You fixed it.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> Sit down.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I tried to call Ma today. She's still not answering.<eos> She's really mad at you.<eos> She's so mad at you, she even got mad at me.
Guard the door.<eos> No-one goes in or out without my say-so.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation.<eos> All relevant files are to be surrendered for copying by AC-12 officers.<eos> - T-10.<eos> Cheers. - OK.<eos> - T-11.<eos> On you go. - Thanks.<eos> Right, you're all familiar with this image.<eos> This is what Huntley's team's been keeping from you.
I have to inform you, Michael, that the witness was able to positively identify you from the video.<eos> Prior to the video identification, you denied the witness's allegations.<eos> I didn't mean to upset her.<eos> You're now admitting the allegations?<eos> Michael.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Will you tell her I'm sorry?<eos> Yes, we can do that, Michael, but first I need to ask you what you intended to do to this woman.
This charge will be included in the charges against you when you appear in court, namely for the murder of Baswinder Kaur, the murder of Leonie Collersdale, the kidnapping and attempted murder of Hana Reznikova.<eos> Do you understand these charges against you?<eos> Please answer.<eos> Yes.<eos> Time is now 10:20 and we're switching off the machine.<eos> I'd like some time alone with my client.<eos> I think we need to discuss the best way forward.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Michael.<eos> The charges against you are going to be hard to fight.
All right, you made your point.<eos> We're supposed to be exonerating Farmer, - not sending him down for longer!<eos> - No, we're meant to be investigating<eos> Roz Huntley, Operation Trapdoor and the murder of Tim Ifield.<eos> Huntley shut you out, - so you played up to her to get your undercover back.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - That's not what happened at all!<eos> - All right. Enough, the both of you.<eos> Now look.<eos> If there are concerns regarding the accuracy of this identification -- legitimate concerns, Kate, I might add -- then we can take you out, reveal you as an undercover officer and we can make them repeat the ID parade.
It was a specialist op, not many people knew about it.<eos> Well, it seems like no-one knew about it.<eos> He had the impression that you were at home ill.<eos> Roz, were you with someone?<eos> I love you and I've always trusted you, but for the sake of our marriage and for the sake of our kids... I need the truth.<eos> OK.<eos> AC-12 are investigating one of my cases.<eos> Looking for an angle to discredit me.<eos> Internal politics, 100% total bollocks.<eos> I'm sorry they involved you, but that is their kind of mind game.
I'll call you back.<eos> DS Steve Arnott, DC James Desford.<eos> I'm putting you two together on the Huntley inquiry. Is that OK?<eos> Any questions?<eos> No.<eos> Good. Carry on.<eos> Actually, it's Jamie, not James.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, it's good to be working with you, Steve.<eos> - All right to call you Steve?
It doesn't appear anyone was trying to cover it up.<eos> Still we should make a confidential request to examine the original samples ourselves.<eos> It's a crucial item and any irregularity...<eos> Is something to throw in Huntley's face?<eos> This isn't personal.<eos> She's at the centre of everything.<eos> I just want to get to the truth.<eos> Me too, mate.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Kate, Roz is asking for you.
'You've reached Nicholas Huntley of Webber and Barratt Partners LLP.<eos> 'Please leave a message.'<eos> Mr Huntley, DS Arnott. AC-12.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You've excelled yourself, Roz.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Trapdoor's been the toughest months of my life.<eos> I appreciate the backing you've given me, sir.<eos> You were a star in training college, then you put your family first.<eos> I'm only putting you back where you belong.
I've asked Rupal to fast-track DNA, see if we can match the body to Leonie Collersdale or to Kate's missing girl, Rikki Neville.<eos> - Jodie, you OK to liaise with Rupal? - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Right.<eos> And Neil, best to let the Collersdales' FLO know that we've found a body, but absolutely not to say anything to the family till we know more.<eos> Boss.<eos> Everything all right, ma'am?<eos> Sorry, I really wasn't up to coming in earlier.<eos> I think I've picked up some kind of bug.<eos> Grim night.<eos> Sorry to bring you in.
Sorry to bring you in.<eos> - This can't wait.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I got an e-mail earlier.<eos> AC-12 are going to serve you with a Regulation 15 Notice.<eos> Ted Hastings, usual story.<eos> He's got a bee in his bonnet.<eos> As good as told me you've been under disproportionate pressure to secure charges against Farmer.<eos> Executive pressure.<eos> I'm the one who's been shielding you from all the flak over Trapdoor.
- We were chasing a lead.<eos> The body that was still missing.<eos> Leonie Collersdale.<eos> You found her?<eos> Some of her.<eos> I should have borrowed someone else's phone.<eos> It got late and... .. I just didn't want to wake up the whole house.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Hey, now, hey, don't be daft.<eos> I'm just worried about you, that's all.
I'm not going to let things slide.<eos> - You're coming up on the rails.<eos> - Yeah, you...<eos> - Better watch out.<eos> Well done, mate.<eos> Kate.<eos> This is great news.<eos> Congratulations. Well done.<eos> Thank you very much, sir.<eos> I mean, you know, it's great for you, reflects well on the department, and, er...
Good night.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - No mobile or laptop found.<eos> - Oh, well. Thanks, anyway.<eos> - Long night.<eos> - No worries.<eos> Night, night.<eos> I thought I heard your car ages ago.<eos> I got called out again straightaway.<eos> I didn't want to wake you.
The body parts we found are the partial remains of<eos> Leonie Collersdale, the second prostitute that went missing.<eos> Unfortunately they were clean of anyone else's DNA.<eos> Small mercies, at least we're allowed to call them prostitutes again.<eos> Got you a big pint of that cats' piss that you young fellas seem to like so much.<eos> - That whisky's probably older than me.<eos> - Aye.<eos> And all the better for it.<eos> No, I just thought this would be a... a better way for us to discuss your ambitions.<eos> I know that if I put you on a case, you'll see it through to the bitter end, come what may.
I'm sorry.<eos> - Would you mind?<eos> - Uh, sure.<eos> OK.<eos> Thanks, Rupal.<eos> Come in.<eos> Ah, Kate.<eos> Yes, thanks for coming in. Hmm.<eos> I've considered your application.<eos> And you really are a tremendous asset to this department, but I just think you need to develop your leadership qualities a bit more before I can support you for inspector.
In which case, his credibility is completely undermined.<eos> I'm worried Tim Ifield was deliberately confounding the investigation to cover his tracks.<eos> And now AC-12 are doing his work for him.<eos> Between you and me, I was never happy with AC-12's recommendation to replace you.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Still, Operation Trapdoor belongs to Ian Buckells now, and he's looking at evidence exculpating Michael Farmer.<eos> Will he find any, do you think?<eos> The best he's got is a boot print from Farmer's home and that, in itself, does nothing to overturn the weight of inculpatory evidence against Michael Farmer, even if we do now have to examine Tim Ifield's role in all this.<eos> AC-12's inquiry seriously threatens the force's credibility.<eos> And if I were to go against their recommendations... if I were to reinstate you...?
Huntley's definitely hiding something about how the case against Farmer was handled. What, I don't know.<eos> There's the man you should be looking for up there.<eos> Not Michael Farmer.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I need to go back to work.<eos> What have you got against Michael Farmer, except him being retarded enough for you to frame?<eos> He was one of our own.<eos> I'm going to get on with finding the bastard that did this.<eos> I'm the senior ranking officer here, darling.<eos> I'm only putting you back where you belong.
If they had anything, they'd have held you.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - It's fine. - Hey, hey!<eos> They showed me a CCTV picture of some scary bloke in a balaclava.<eos> It's to do with this death, this murder.<eos> Why were they asking you questions about Timothy Ifield's murder?<eos> What haven't you told me?<eos> Jesus Christ, Roz, you've got a nerve.<eos> You're the one that's doing all the lying, not me.<eos> I'm going to ask you again.
They've got my car on a traffic camera a few hundred yards away from his flat.<eos> You still don't get it, do you?<eos> The late nights.<eos> The excuses.<eos> The brush-off in bed.<eos> I knew that you had to be with someone.<eos> You followed me?<eos> I didn't intend to.<eos> But you left your phone at home when you said that you were going to work.<eos> So I picked it up and I tried to catch you.
To our kids.<eos> To the life that we've built.<eos> For God's sake, Nick.<eos> I had this under control.<eos> Instead... my husband was prowling the area that night and now they're wondering if you set up one of their officers to be killed.<eos> That's conspiracy to murder.<eos> OK, so, what did you tell AC-12?<eos> Give me some credit,<eos> Roz, I didn't say that my wife was with another man, OK?<eos> I covered for you.
Come in.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's OK.<eos> I'm afraid it's bad news, Roz.<eos> AC-12 have issued you with a second Reg 15.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> If they're issuing a second one, it means they're citing a substantively different offence from last time.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll be honest, Roz.<eos> They're coming after you.

Hana Reznikova, I am arresting you in connection with the murder of Timothy Ifield.<eos> You cut yourself?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I just caught it on some brickwork.<eos> We're going to take a swab.<eos> Is that necessary?<eos> You should see a specialist.<eos> I have the authority to charge you with the following offences.<eos> Namely for the murder of Baswinder Kaur, the murder of Leonie Collisdale, the kidnapping and attempted murder of Hana Reznikova.<eos> Michael, the charges against you are going to be hard to fight.
And how long's Michael Farmer been in custody?<eos> Sir.<eos> Someone to see you, in your office with Kate, if that's OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who?<eos> - He wanted to introduce himself, sir.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> Steve!<eos> I hope you'll forgive me if I don't get up, sir.<eos> It's great to see you, but, you know, you really shouldn't have put yourself out like this.
Do you want a tea or coffee?<eos> No, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.<eos> All right, well, if you need anything, just call me on the mobile, save you having to... you know.<eos> Kate. Nick Huntley's alibi -- has someone actually checked that out?<eos> No, while you was away we stopped being capable of basic police work.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Actually, with all the files being recalled, it could've fallen through the cracks.<eos> I'll double check.<eos> Cheers, appreciate it.<eos> There's no evidence he's the man who attacked you.
I know, I know. His solicitor must have told him to cut his losses and go for a reduced sentence.<eos> But one of you have got to visit that prison and tell Michael Farmer that we are fighting his corner.<eos> Sir, sorry, after everything that's happened, why would Farmer trust a word either of us say?<eos> The word of any police officer.<eos> We're just waiting on your solicitor.<eos> You know, Michael, there are other solicitors, better ones.<eos> The first time, about Jade... .. I liked him.<eos> Your solicitor for your first conviction?<eos> OK.<eos> He might not be the best person, but I can check him out for you, if you'd like to see him?
Michael, I've arranged for you to have a visitor.<eos> Nana.<eos> Hello, Michael.<eos> It's lovely to see you.<eos> I've missed you, Nana.<eos> Michael, I'll see you after.<eos> I'll leave you all to catch up.<eos> How are you managing, Michael?<eos> It's horrible in here, Nana.<eos> I've always cared for you.
You lied about where you were when Leonie Collersdale disappeared.<eos> You were at the building when Steve Arnott was attacked.<eos> I explained all of that.<eos> And you were at the crime scene the night Tim Ifield was murdered.<eos> Outside!<eos> The only male suspect to be placed at the crime scene.<eos> No, no, wait.<eos> No!<eos> And you've lied about it to every police officer you've spoken to.<eos> - To protect you!
I don't know, Kate.<eos> You should sit down, ma'am.<eos> I can get you some more of your painkillers.<eos> No, I'll be all right.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I want some time with my client before we go through disclosure, - in a private room.<eos> - I'll see what I can do.<eos> You'll do better than that, detective.<eos> I'm glad to see you, mate.
I'm so glad you've resolved things.<eos> He is a good man.<eos> He's truly impressing his superiors here.<eos> Really?<eos> I shouldn't say, but, He has done the reich a great service.<eos> How exciting.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Rounding up. A nest of spies or something?<eos> Perhaps next year it will be franz. Receiving a medal.<eos> Well, I'll call on you tomorrow and see.
My arrangement was made with your superior.<eos> And I'm the messenger.<eos> The deal still stands.<eos> I get william; You get the recording.<eos> I don't like plans changing.<eos> You and me both, mate.<eos> Where is he?<eos> William sinclair?<eos> I work with your dad.<eos> I'm here to take you home.
What are the odds do you think?<eos> Of?<eos> Of faber keeping his word tonight.<eos> On principle.<eos> He's given us no reason to doubt him. Why?<eos> I'm just concerned.<eos> That, as his handler, The other night when the two of you were... Together,<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Heidi saw you in a compromising situation.
Do you?<eos> Months of planning, leveraging sabine, you working. To win schmidt's trust.<eos> Harry gave his life for this.<eos> All of that could end up being for nothing because.<eos> Of your relationship with faber.<eos> My relationship? ! Yeah.<eos> Not that it's my business.<eos> Unless you might be losing perspective. Don't...<eos> Don't lecture me.<eos> If it's distracting you. From the bigger picture.
I'll be back in 20 minutes, And we'll pretend this never happened.<eos> Well done, manfred.<eos> I knew you could do it.<eos> Here.<eos> You need to sober up.<eos> Remember when your mother was sick. And I could barely cope?<eos> You were so strong, will.<eos> You were so strong for ollie.<eos> You were so strong for me.<eos> Now I would not have. Made it through without you.
We need to go. Yeah, almost there.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It looks fine!<eos> Fine's not good enough.<eos> We get one shot at this.<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> Alfred, you've got to help me with this!<eos> Green light! Come on!<eos> Everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Jump or I'll bloody throw you out.
If the city's under fire, then they'll.<eos> Cancel the ceremony tonight.<eos> No, it's a contained attack.<eos> Nazis will downplay everything.<eos> They want to maintain the myth that they're untouchable.<eos> The show must go on.<eos> Which could work for us now.<eos> They'll be understaffed.<eos> I need you to know. That sending peter and david, Sending those two boys to die, was the hardest thing.<eos> That I've ever had to do in my life, but it was the only way this mission would survive. Stopping operation marigold is more important than you or me.
- Debbie. My new friend.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Let's fly, all right?<eos> - Go have fun.<eos> Hey, hey, Florian!<eos> We're throwing a party!<eos> Yeah, I got 20 people headed your way, okay?<eos> That's my butler.<eos> He gets nervous when I don't give him notice!<eos> I can't hear you, but I agree!
- Yeah.<eos> I know this sounds needy, but can you please never leave me alone at this party?<eos> - It that an "Asteroids" in a house?<eos> - We have "Caterpillar" in the master bath.<eos> I have to use the restroom.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Alcohol.<eos> Are you having fun?<eos> Just 'cause we're at a party doesn't mean we're at all okay.<eos> Talk to me again, I'll throw you through the window.
Stupid.<eos> He is so stupid.<eos> Flor... when you cheat on your wife... don't admit everything to her.<eos> Lie.<eos> Lie to her, Flor.<eos> Flor, I'm gonna sit down on the floor.<eos> I feel like I'm losing my mind every 20 minutes.<eos> Twenty minutes is... about as long as I can possibly pretend that everything's okay.<eos> And I don't have anybody to talk to about it.<eos> Except you.
This is for when you start puking.<eos> These carpets are really expensive.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, uh, can you help me with something?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'd have Mike fly her home, but he's on a beer run.<eos> Is your hair a dance floor?<eos> Let's get you off the dance floor.
You goddamn... wolf.<eos> - You just called me a wolf.<eos> - What?<eos> You just called me a goddamn wolf!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, most people call me a freak, so... thank you.<eos> I've worn this... or some version of this, every day for the past five years.<eos> It's not a costume.<eos> Just me.<eos> And what I do in the morning... what I put on, what I wear... it's not for you.
I'm Liberty Belle, the American hero. I'm a perfect ten, and you're a zero.<eos> I'm American as apple pie, and if you're not, I'll make you die.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> - I never thought he was right for you.<eos> - Oh, Mom.<eos> Now is not the time.<eos> Well, I just always thought he was very controlling.<eos> Please don't put me in the position of having to defend the man I just left.<eos> I'm not asking you to defend anybody.<eos> I'm just worried about you.
And the only way I could get it to stop was by shoving both of their toothbrushes into my anus!<eos> Get a life, you fucking hags!<eos> How does everyone know my fucking real name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - My hair.<eos> - For who?<eos> For me.<eos> Self-esteem, hello?<eos> I can't look at you anymore.
Yeah, it was good, I guess.<eos> You know, it's exciting.<eos> It's kind of...<eos> So...<eos> And fucking weird. I don't know.<eos> You know, you're with someone for a long time, and all you think about is all the guys you'd get to sleep with if he just, like, disappeared... and then he does.<eos> And you do, and...<eos> You just remember how much easier it is...<eos> How much better everything works when, um...<eos> It's someone you really know, and, uh, who really knows you.
Let's come together.<eos> We're gonna have some fun over this weekend.<eos> S'mores, you know, campfire stories.<eos> Talent show. Great.<eos> Let's get to know each other over this weekend.<eos> All the way.<eos> All right, McMillan, into the marsh.<eos> Let's come together, then let's head off to Luxembourg a fortified unit, and get this goddamn Denon deal done.<eos> Except for Lakeman, who's simply not going.<eos> So at this late stage, it's time to alert you to a paper work situation involving John Lakeman.
Yeah. He's lying about me now, too.<eos> Narc on him.<eos> But listen, I'm not fucking around about you being sure.<eos> I know.<eos> You've suffered brain damage and now we're asking people to trust your perceptions.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Monday morning, go do a full sensory reevaluation.<eos> Go to the spot.<eos> Do a full sensory recall.<eos> And if that's the way you remember it, if you remember that he pushed you, then that's that.
Okay.<eos> But are you?<eos> You seem to be under an unusual amount of stress.<eos> Maybe we're both struggling with expectations.<eos> You lied on your resume, John.<eos> Didn't attend Penn.<eos> Maybe you're not quite the All-American Boy,<eos> Not what meets the eye.<eos> Big whoop. Join the club.<eos> John, I'd like to embrace you and send you a non-verbal message to you saying "I get you, I know how you feel." You're just human. Hello, Club Member."
Yeah.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> - You're my husband.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I just, whenever I think about that, I feel so lucky.<eos> And I just say it.<eos> Okay, well, I have to tell you something, honey.<eos> Regarding... The task that we've been working on.<eos> Could I have a word with you?
Thank you.<eos> What are you... What are you doing?<eos> Removing your morphine drip.<eos> Well, let's not be hasty.<eos> How about it?<eos> I'm flying here.<eos> I... I'm... I'm just asking...<eos> Yeah?<eos> What?<eos> Does Dad ask you to kill people, John?
Okay.<eos> Do it in the ring. It'll look better up there.<eos> Okay.<eos> This way you can see what she can do. All right? Just watch, Debbie.<eos> So, I've been working on these opening moves called<eos> "the hammer and sickle."<eos> I'll just show you. I'll just show you. Um...<eos> So, it's... the hammer! I start with a body slam.<eos> You get back up, and then I sickle your feet so you... You:<eos> And then I get you here. I got you in a hammerlock.
You get back up, and then I sickle your feet so you... You:<eos> And then I get you here. I got you in a hammerlock.<eos> You get up, you turn it around on me. You lock me up, and you think you got me, but then I come back around with the soon-to-be-famous "rough toilet paper!"<eos> And then, you know, it's fight, fight, fight.<eos> I'm bad, you're good.<eos> I'm winning.<eos> You're winning.<eos> Oh, step off! She's still got me!<eos> Oh, you stupid American swine!<eos> You think you're getting away, but I get you by your hair.

Fuck religion. Don't touch my penis.<eos> Here we go. Say goodbye.<eos> It only hurts a little.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - His bris.<eos> Now that we're in America, we're free to be Jews.<eos> Is covenant.<eos> We celebrate.<eos> Well, if it ain't Miss America.<eos> You know, I think I seen you before.

We celebrate.<eos> Well, if it ain't Miss America.<eos> You know, I think I seen you before.<eos> Oh, darling. Where would we have ever crossed paths?<eos> No, I know I seen you.<eos> It was at the supermarket. They take all my food stamps there.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> - I saw you there in the frozen-food aisle. - That is impossible.<eos> I only eat fresh fruits and vegetables, bloody red steaks and, well, the occasional apple pie.<eos> Mm-mm. No, I know I seen you there.
Great.<eos> Hey... Can I get a little privacy, please?<eos> Hey!<eos> - What's up, old man? You need something?<eos> - Hilarious. Why don't you work on your wrestling skills?<eos> You've got the biting wit down pat.<eos> Yeah, why don't you work on your movies instead of selling out?<eos> What the fuck does that mean?<eos> How am I selling out?<eos> Uh, I don't know, by doing a wrestling show that's just a big casting couch for you.
I mean, shut the fuck up.<eos> I could be at home with my baby.<eos> Oh, my God! Not this again. Please.<eos> I mean, they don't party, they haven't traveled, they have no sense of irony.<eos> And you love this shit.<eos> You love being a temperamental star. I know you do.<eos> If you were at home with that kid, your life would become just anger and resentment.<eos> No work, no husband.<eos> You would burn up in a smoldering ash heap of rage and disappointment.<eos> You think that's good for you or your boring baby?
Look.<eos> - Ruth is the right match for you. - Sam.<eos> Because one, she's actually talented, and two, she's gonna make you look great.<eos> Hate her all you want.<eos> Shalom, everyone!<eos> Shalom! Mazel, mazel!<eos> I am Gittel, the Orthodox Warrior!<eos> It's all about the Jews now.<eos> - The fuck is this?<eos> - I will beat you with a chicken.
It's like a fucking trust fall, only I stare at your face and remember all the reasons I don't trust you.<eos> Look, if you miss, my body will break the fall.<eos> I'll take the hit.<eos> Okay.<eos> How'd that look?<eos> So great.<eos> Let's do it again.<eos> No, no.<eos> I was early.<eos> Let her jump on you.
I'm working on my costume, okay?<eos> Plaits, glasses, braces, and a bow tie?<eos> You're gonna look like that asshole in AC/DC.<eos> You're nervous about the match tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, I'm nervous.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The good-luck present I made you.
I scripted the match so you'll win.<eos> Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.<eos> We all saw it.<eos> Just go get ready.<eos> Now.<eos> What'd you do to her?<eos> Why is she framing you?
- What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.<eos> We all saw it.<eos> Just go get ready.<eos> Now.<eos> What'd you do to her?<eos> Why is she framing you?<eos> She's jealous, all right?<eos> She's just got a crush on you.
Oh, hi.<eos> - I haven't seen Bash for three days.<eos> - What? Isn't it your job to keep tabs on that guy?<eos> I answer when he rings the bell, but no one's rung the bell for three days, dude.<eos> Last night was breakfast-for-dinner night, and I was the only one who ate it.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if he rings the bell, tell Bash that I need to talk to him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes?<eos> I just wanted to assure you that what happened the other night was a fluke.
Oh, get it.<eos> Get it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can have some.<eos> There you go.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Signed, sealed, notarized.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> Hi, I love you.
Signed, sealed, notarized.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> Hi, I love you.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I don't accept this.<eos> How can you not?<eos> You're the one who served me.<eos> I was freaking out.<eos> I couldn't find you, I couldn't even talk to you.
It's Sheila's birthday.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> I mean, look, I'll go with you.<eos> We'll get a cake, it'll be a date.<eos> It'll be... It'll be fun.<eos> You don't actually like me, Sam.<eos> You're just afraid to be alone.<eos> What do you mean I don't like you?<eos> I just had period sex with you.
I'm fine.<eos> Birthday!<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> I can't shake my hips on skates.<eos> It does not work.<eos> - Where's Sheila?<eos> There she is.<eos> - Sheila! Sheila!<eos> Sheila!<eos> We were looking for you, girl.
- Maybe it was all the curly fries.<eos> - Could be all the disco.<eos> Or maybe you're pregnant.<eos> Well, feel better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm just glad no one's sprained their ankles.<eos> You know athletes usually get injured after practice, goofing off?<eos> We're not really athletes.<eos> We need six more.<eos> Carmen, how am I in a better mood than you?
You stopped talking to me.<eos> You stopped sleeping with me, which is not an excuse for anything that happened, but I remember thinking to myself:<eos> "How many days can she go without... touching me or asking how my day was?"<eos> Forty-two days.<eos> - Well, Mark, I'd just had a baby.<eos> - This was, uh... before Randy.<eos> Why did we start a family if we were so miserable?<eos> We thought we could make things better.<eos> And I think we still can.<eos> Can you let me hug you?
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> I had my own hostage situation here.<eos> Those hijackers have nothing on this little terrorist.<eos> I will be back at five.<eos> Don't make me wait, Mark.<eos> - Are you taking off?<eos> - I have practice in an hour.<eos> It's in an hour.<eos> I could have three meals in an hour.<eos> Um, well... I am not staying for you.
Come on down to that worthless property that you can't even get insured, because, hey, it's on a fault line.<eos> Another wise decision.<eos> Consider it a loan.<eos> Cut me a check and I'll pay you back.<eos> Since when do we talk so openly about money?<eos> What, are we Jews?<eos> Mom, I got a lot of people counting on me.<eos> This is important.<eos> And keeping poor black children off of crack is very important to me.<eos> I expect you at that party on time.
Maybe they're Fritos.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you really think the show might go away?<eos> Like, we'd all never see each other again?<eos> It's not sleep-away camp, I mean, it's... It's a job.<eos> All jobs are a crapshoot.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> What?<eos> Did you steal more of my shit?<eos> - I did not invite you.
Even if we get all the money we need, what is this gonna look like?<eos> Crap, probably.<eos> And who knows if anyone's gonna watch this?<eos> - We are not that good.<eos> - I know, but...<eos> Sometimes I'm so sad you took away the option of us ever being able to have a normal fucking conversation.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Sam?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> ♪ These magic moments filled with love ♪ I didn't recognize you.
Off with it. The jewelry, now!<eos> Robin, you don't know me?<eos> Enough talking.<eos> The jewels.<eos> It's not him.<eos> And the necklace, if you please, m'lady?<eos> Thank you.<eos> It appears it is time for me to go.<eos> Regina, they're after you.<eos> They're looking for you.
I just hope you know what you're doing.<eos> You and me both.<eos> H... How?<eos> How is this even possible?<eos> How...<eos> How are you here?<eos> How are you grown?<eos> I've lived a full 28 years.<eos> I was in a place where time moved differently, where the Black Fairy raised me.<eos> Did she harm you?
But I can't come back till I have a question answered.<eos> I know Robin isn't real here.<eos> But I need to know if... like everything else in this realm, is he better off without me?"<eos> There he is.<eos> The guy with the lion tattoo.<eos> That's him?<eos> Pixie dust doesn't lie.<eos> This is your chance at love and happiness.<eos> A fresh start, no baggage.<eos> You can let go of all the anger that weighs you down.
You know, I waited years for a moment like this...<eos> When I could finally tell my own father that I was better than him and stronger than him, so you go ahead.<eos> You show me.<eos> You think you know all about me.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I know your childhood is full of pain, just like mine.<eos> You want someone to pay for that?<eos> Make me pay.<eos> It is my fault, after all, is it not?<eos> I let the Black Fairy take you.

Now, on the one hand, you did help me escape from my prison.<eos> On the other, you kidnapped the woman I loved and starved her to death in a tower.<eos> I went looking for Belle and this is what I found.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> Not really. I...<eos> I'm not even from this world.<eos> Oh, I know that, dearie, but I have to hurt someone, and you seem like the best candidate.<eos> I may not be real, but I get a funny feeling I can still make you bleed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't wake you.
Sheriffs and knights and maybe Rumple, and...<eos> Is that it?<eos> This is it.<eos> That's how you're getting back?<eos> A tree?<eos> A magic tree.<eos> Oh, well, forgive me.<eos> Regina, we do have to go.<eos> Can you just give me a minute?<eos> I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.
Where's Robin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We... went in together.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Can I...<eos> Can I have a moment alone, please?<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> So, where exactly are we?<eos> Robin of Locksley, as mayor, I'd like to officially welcome you to Storybrooke.
What happened to you?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's all gonna be fine.<eos> We're just...<eos> We're gonna switch to water.<eos> What, for drinking?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoa.<eos> I could hear you all the way down the street.
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...<eos> - Look at that hand.<eos> - This is assault.<eos> A pediatric surgeon walking around this hospital.<eos> Do you realize what happens if you're convicted of a felony?<eos> !<eos> Mer, the trial's tomorrow.<eos> It could be our last chance for like 8, 10 years.<eos> Jo Wilson isn't my real name.<eos> That's why I couldn't marry you.

'Cause in front of the other prep-school moms, she wore pearls, but at the beach she didn't even wear makeup.<eos> That's my favorite.<eos> Anyway, my baby will get the casseroles, the swing set, the big room, the cartwheels on the beach... all of it.<eos> Sounds really nice.<eos> Do you want to know what I'm gonna name her?<eos> Sure.<eos> Ellie.<eos> Ellie?<eos> I love that.<eos> If you tell anyone I said all that crap, I'll kill you.
I'm bleeding.<eos> I feel it.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I'm bleeding all over.<eos> - It's not blood.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Hold pressure.<eos> All right, I'm gonna examine you now, okay?
Give us some room!<eos> Otis, Kidd, attach the webbing to the ladder.<eos> - Hey, hang in there, Pants! - Hey!<eos> You need to stay back until we get the pallets stabilized.<eos> What's your name, buddy?<eos> - That's Pants.<eos> - Pants?<eos> That's what everybody calls him... Pants.<eos> Pants, take a deep breath, relax.<eos> We're gonna get you out of there in just a minute.
Aah!<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Keep pulling!<eos> That's it!<eos> Hold it!<eos> Oh, god! Ouch!<eos> We got him.<eos> You did good, Pants.<eos> You know, taking a beer shower sounds great until you actually do it.<eos> I'd be happy to crack open a hydrant and hose you down.
We all gotta catch up.<eos> You know, me and Jay, you and Stella, we should grab a beer or something.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Okay, I'll see you later.<eos> Aha!<eos> I found it.<eos> "A player may strike the ball with his racquet, held in the racquet hand, or with his racquet hand below the wrist."<eos> In your face!<eos> That point should've counted.<eos> Whatever, I beat you by seven points.
I heard that!<eos> It's the good samaritan special.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Just looking out for you.<eos> You know, I, uh... I take my duties very seriously.<eos> - Your duties?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - As your emergency contact. - Ah.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it all goes off without a hitch.<eos> I'm gonna drive you to the hospital, I'll stay there the whole time while they... Pilfer your bone marrow, and when you come out, I'll be waiting.
I might've overreacted a little.<eos> Any particular reason?<eos> Gabby, and the DCFS agent are taking Louie to meet his birth father tonight.<eos> And you're not going, too?<eos> DCFS thought it'd be better for Louie to have as small a group as possible.<eos> - That doesn't seem right.<eos> - I didn't want to push back.<eos> Stress out Gabby even more than she already is.<eos> This has been rough on her, man.<eos> And on you.
Put in a call to the Intelligence unit.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Kelly, what are you doing?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Look, you'd better grab a jacket.<eos> You gotta come with us.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> What is this... What is this about?<eos> Kelly, you can either come with us now, or wait for some uniforms to come down here and put you in cuffs.
Are we, like...<eos> Are we inside my head?<eos> Ptonomy is what we call our memory artist.<eos> That's his gift.<eos> - Can I talk with her?<eos> - I mean, you can.<eos> But it's better if you don't.<eos> It changes the memory.<eos> Just take it in for now.<eos> This first time is about accepting that it's real, and then we can focus on work... taking you back to those moments in your past when you first felt your so-called illness coming on.
This first time is about accepting that it's real, and then we can focus on work... taking you back to those moments in your past when you first felt your so-called illness coming on.<eos> I'll show you that it was really just your gift.<eos> We're gonna make you whole again.<eos> Come on, Davy.<eos> Mom said home by 6:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, King.<eos> Can I... Can we...<eos> Can we follow them?<eos> Pretend we're in a museum... the museum of you.
Syd.<eos> She's in with Melanie doing talk work.<eos> That's the deal... you do memory work with me, you got to do talk work with Dr. Bird, figure out what it all means.<eos> Melanie thinks you're the key.<eos> What?<eos> The key to what?<eos> Winning the war.<eos> And other things.<eos> Dr. Vacon's Advanced Time Travel class has been canceled.<eos> She called you a "memory artist"?
That's not my deal. I'm the memory guy, not the talk guy.<eos> Take your time getting up.<eos> Like I said, first time's a bitch.<eos> The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a god.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't know how this is helping... the memory work.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I thought that too.<eos> When I got here, all I wanted was to get you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Don't give a newbie a bazooka... Bazooka and act surprised when she blows shit up.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> Well, they heard it... when I used your power.<eos> Melanie and the others... they heard it, and they came.<eos> And Division Three came because they heard it too.<eos> They thought they found you...
Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> Well, they heard it... when I used your power.<eos> Melanie and the others... they heard it, and they came.<eos> And Division Three came because they heard it too.<eos> They thought they found you...<eos> But it was really me.<eos> Surprise?<eos> I...<eos> I want to hug you.
Try to think of something or... or... someone you... Love.<eos> He gets back into town on Thursday.<eos> I think he's gonna propose.<eos> David.<eos> That's...<eos> Good job.<eos> "Good job"?<eos> No, I... that's great.<eos> I'm... I'm...<eos> I'm happy for you.
I'm... I'm...<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> You're sweet, but...<eos> I mean, I don't know for sure.<eos> Men, right?<eos> But who knows?<eos> Maybe... you and Philly...<eos> Yeah...<eos> I know she's nice, though... you know?<eos> I think she... she gets you.
Um... I'm fine.<eos> It's... you know...<eos> - It's a lot to take in.<eos> - I know.<eos> I was worried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was it... in the memory?<eos> Melanie won't tell me.<eos> It was just kid stuff.<eos> It's okay, though, that I brought you here?
Division Three.<eos> She's in trouble.<eos> I don't...<eos> I can't just... It...<eos> it... it's jumbled up.<eos> There is something wrong with me, I know, but I cannot just leave her.<eos> Stay!<eos> Do the work.<eos> Not long, just... enough to learn what you can do, what we can do, together.<eos> Then we can rescue her like we rescued you.
Take him in hand.<eos> I will not lecture the man whose army secured the Battle of Bosworth for Henry, on decorum.<eos> You would have me believe that that was an act of selflessness?<eos> It would be the Stanleys' first and last.<eos> I suppose we should look to you as our model for that particular virtue?<eos> I am selfless.<eos> My only interest is the will of God.<eos> How fortunate his will is so often in tune with yours.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> His will to place you here as mother of the King knows no bounds.
This boy is Richard.<eos> You cannot know that.<eos> He is your brother and the rightful King of England.<eos> You put me on the throne with Henry.<eos> You made me a Tudor Queen.<eos> I made you a York Queen.<eos> And now you would just take that from me?<eos> Is the truth you have always loved my brother more than me?<eos> Lizzie.<eos> I have loved you with all my heart for all of your life.
He is five.<eos> A precious age.<eos> Hold him close.<eos> I would so love for you to meet him, Lady Grandmother.<eos> Well, I will not return to England. Not while Henry Tudor's on the throne.<eos> But, if your aunt has her way we will all be restored by Richard.<eos> You are convinced it is him, then?<eos> And you are here to prove he is another imposter, of course?<eos> Another peasant picked from the fields?<eos> It makes me joyful every day to see you in my gardens.
Let no-one be in doubt about the task that lies ahead of us.<eos> But here today, at last, we have much to celebrate.<eos> My beloved Richard and Cathy Gordon are to be married!<eos> I suppose we should have guessed she would have something like this up her sleeve.<eos> Let's hope King James is better than his cousin, Lady Gordon, at spotting a peasant in silk.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Goodnight, my loves.<eos> Remember to say your prayers.<eos> I will.<eos> For you and Father.
I heard Lord Strange say so.<eos> I never want to hear you say that again.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Time for bed. Now.<eos> Is she unwell, mother?<eos> She is.<eos> Sleep well, my sweet boy.<eos> Lies are all my mother has, Henry.<eos> No one will believe her.<eos> England loves you.
They were Yorks.<eos> They were children.<eos> It was God's will.<eos> God's will?<eos> There is no divinity in this.<eos> Will you tell him?<eos> I must think.<eos> Jasper...<eos> He would not understand.<eos> You know he could never forgive you.
We are told we must not worry.<eos> The Duchess has revealed her plans.<eos> She hopes to win the Scottish army to his cause.<eos> There is no certainty of that.<eos> Or even any great likelihood.<eos> If Cathy Gordon was the highest born bride that she could buy for him, then Europe is little more convinced of his identity than we are.<eos> The girl is just a minor noble.<eos> If his claim is believed, you'd expect he'd win at least a French princess, if not a Spanish one.<eos> And Scotland is too poor to start a war.<eos> The Duchess may just be taunting you.
Then we learned that the soldiers tore our house apart. Slaughtered every boy they found.<eos> And then we understood the silence.<eos> That is how I know the boy in Burgundy is just another fraud.<eos> My brother is dead.<eos> Dead?<eos> Dead.<eos> Yet you have never told me this before.<eos> When we first wed, I was full of malice.<eos> Then my reasons for not telling you changed.<eos> I convinced myself I was shielding you.
You must rejoin the celebrations. Work hard with him, and the other heads of state.<eos> But we must have Scotland or we'll fail before we start.<eos> Elizabeth sends funds. Your mother.<eos> And I shall furnish you with ecus from my own gold stores. It is a start.<eos> I miss him too.<eos> I wish that he were here to share his wisdom with me.<eos> I'm lost without him.<eos> But three months have passed and...<eos> I cannot bear to...<eos> I cannot lose you and my uncle.
I fear that I shall die before I lay my own eyes on him.<eos> Or see my Lizzie again.<eos> Please. Bid her come to me.<eos> Lizzie.<eos> We have not had a chance to speak in private since my trip to Burgundy.<eos> What would we speak of, Maggie?<eos> Traitors to my husband's reign?<eos> The nightmares that my son has had since he witnessed the beheading of a man he loved?<eos> I'm told you've been to see my mother once again.<eos> She wants to see you, Lizzie.
No act of ours can change that.<eos> Your sacrifice for him has been immense.<eos> Losing those we love can test our faith.<eos> A pilgrimage will help you find your way.<eos> Rededicate yourself to God. Pay aims to the abbeys.<eos> Luke chapter 11, verse 41.<eos> "Give as alms what is within," "and everything will be clean to you."<eos> Godspeed, Your Grace.<eos> We're returning to our home in Wales.<eos> I have an honor to bestow upon you. I'll make you Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Arthur, Prince of Wales.
I regret that I did not see Jasper.<eos> He asked for me.<eos> And I shall never know what he would have said to me.<eos> Go.<eos> The boy has done what I would in his shoes.<eos> He sailed from Scotland to Land's End and<eos> 8,000 Cornish men have joined him, out of hate for me.<eos> My army gathers.<eos> I must go to them.<eos> I waited for you.
I waited for you.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What we have lived through together.<eos> Now Melusina sings for me.<eos> No. No, she doesn't.<eos> Please, Lizzie.<eos> Be there for your brother.<eos> He is gone, Mother.<eos> You think I have not been fair to you.<eos> It doesn't matter, I love you, Mother.
I will come for you both when I have won.<eos> Go. Go.<eos> Hey!<eos> Queen Elizabeth.<eos> What do you mean, they've deserted me?<eos> So few of them turned out for you that the ones who did feel torn and say they will not fight their own kind.<eos> Henry.<eos> Lizzie.<eos> She is gone.<eos> I had to see you.
Since when have Englishmen feared Gaels and Celts and run from warfare with their tails between their legs?<eos> They say he is the true king,<eos> Richard of York.<eos> If he were Richard, he would be my brother and I would tell you so myself!<eos> But he is here to kill your kin and rob England of what was never his!<eos> If you fear God then you will honor your true king, Henry Tudor!<eos> And if you will not do it for your King then do it for me!<eos> The daughter of Edward IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville,<eos> who has just passed from this life into God's hands.<eos> Your men are here and they support you.

When Prince Richard rises against him, I will call on both you and your conscience to join us.<eos> Where is the boy?<eos> A message from your Lady Mother.<eos> She has the boy.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Any fool can see he looks nothing like a York.<eos> Is the court assembled?<eos> They await Your Grace's favor.<eos> Your Grace, I bring you the cause of England's troubles.<eos> The money wasted, the lives lost, bringing you here.
And all for what?<eos> A peasant boy.<eos> I will enjoy your execution.<eos> You'll be hung, drawn and quartered,<eos> - You should kill me if you wish to stay upon my throne.<eos> I am the son of King Edward, the IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville.<eos> And I am rightful King of England.<eos> You thought that I was murdered, but I live.<eos> So, you will stand aside and return to me the crown and throne which have been stolen from me, or you will face the righteous wrath of Almighty God,<eos> who will rage against your sin and cast you into hell.
I need to see my husband.<eos> Richard.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Cathy.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> How did they find you?<eos> - The monks said...<eos> - Monks?<eos> - They've taken Edward.<eos> - Oh, Cathy, they've lied to you to bring you here.
- Your brother!<eos> - Read it, and your family will live!<eos> Do not read it, Richard.<eos> Don't deny your birthright.<eos> His child will be brought up by a family in London.<eos> - What?<eos> - You have no right!<eos> Oh, we have every right.<eos> If you come here and you threaten my life and my family's life, then your own son will be forfeit. No.<eos> God curses you.

No.<eos> God curses you.<eos> He curses you and you will go to hell.
What have you done with his child?<eos> Do not concern yourself with such matters.<eos> What?<eos> Am I to be protected from the truth again?<eos> As you and Jasper always thought I should be.<eos> What else do I not know?<eos> What Jasper would have told me in the hour before he died.<eos> It hovers on the edges of my mind.<eos> Sometimes in the night, I think I hear him whisper it, but as I lean in close to his lips, all I hear is the rush of the wind.<eos> He would have told you that he loves you.
What can they do to me that's worse?<eos> The Duchess of Burgundy is in London.<eos> She will find out where he is.<eos> - Please, get up.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Comforting her.<eos> How could you do it, Lizzie?<eos> Let the King's mother take their son?<eos> You are changing, Maggie, and I'm not sure I like who you've become.<eos> Your mother would be ashamed of you.
We, we must find another way.<eos> - There is no other way.<eos> - There is.<eos> There has to be, if we just think.<eos> Henry...<eos> Henry.<eos> I want the princes busy at their favorite pursuits today.<eos> They can do what they want but they must be kept occupied.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> I looked for you, earlier.
Then as now, two York boys with a claim in the one room.<eos> The boy is who he says he is.<eos> Then King Richard was careless.<eos> And now you must finish it and get rid of him.<eos> It is what is necessary.<eos> Mother,<eos> I am of your flesh.<eos> You made me.<eos> I have been advised by so many who do not know what it is to be standing where I am standing,<eos> to make decisions, to do what is necessary and I would be counseled by you because I believe that you do know.
Mother.<eos> I believe it was you who killed the boys in the Tower.<eos> - Your past actions would resolve me, help me to do what must be done.<eos> Was it you?<eos> Sometimes, Henry, politics takes place under the cloak of night.<eos> You did it.<eos> There are things that are necessary, for the greater good, things that must be done.<eos> And now you are resolved.<eos> We will be together on this, Henry.<eos> Let your mother guide you.
If you defy my orders, I'll have your heads myself.<eos> Oh, I've missed you,<eos> Oh, I can't breathe...<eos> I have missed you.<eos> I have brought you warm shirts and, um, fresh...<eos> Fresh bread and meat and apples.<eos> The duchess of Burgundy is close by.<eos> Cathy is safe with her.<eos> Armies gather for you.<eos> This tower will be torn open and they will carry you on their shoulders to Westminster.
In return for what?<eos> I, Perkin Warbeck, the humble son of a boatman from Tournai, confess to a plot to kill the king and the royal family.<eos> I did falsely impersonate the dead King Richard,<eos> - Duke of York, and I...<eos> - Stop, stop now.<eos> Henry, listen to me, all that people talk about is that there is a prince in the Tower and that they are ready to fight for him.<eos> So we show them this man.<eos> This man hangs at Tyburn, he confesses in public and what do people see?<eos> Not a prince but a criminal, a fraud, an imposter telling his crimes freely and so the rebellion is broken,<eos> there is no war because there is no-one to put on the throne instead of you.
That man there is "the other way" we had to find.<eos> And then what?<eos> The boy stays in the Tower.<eos> A nameless prisoner.<eos> He does not die, he lives out his life there.<eos> I will not sanction this.<eos> Take him away.<eos> The York lords will bring war if they believe he lives.<eos> They are bringing it now.<eos> I have loved you, Lizzie.

- I forbid it.<eos> They will have spies there.<eos> If you go, you look like a sympathizer.<eos> Perhaps I am!<eos> Are you carrying messages?<eos> You always said you had no interest in the court, that you wanted no part of it... And I don't, but I want my brother back!<eos> All my life I have been good.<eos> I have been biddable.<eos> I've been quiet.<eos> I married who I was told to marry and I thank God every day for you, I do, but I will not be biddable anymore.
England receive my blood!<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you give me no choice?<eos> The Earl of Warwick was executed for treason this morning.<eos> My aunt is returning to Burgundy where she will live a life of sober contemplation.<eos> Cathy Gordon is in the palace.<eos> She will become a permanent part of my household and I will care for her.<eos> Where is Prince Richard?<eos> Your husband begged for your life, Maggie.<eos> He begged for you.

Where is Prince Richard?<eos> Your husband begged for your life, Maggie.<eos> He begged for you.<eos> We were moved and we have chosen to be kind.<eos> The curse will come down on you.<eos> The curse.<eos> A widow and a virgin hurling oaths against their enemies because words are all they have.<eos> You will weep for your children, Elizabeth.<eos> All your hopes destroyed!<eos> That is the curse and it is on you!
You want me to take you there?<eos> No.<eos> I just want you to bring him home.<eos> Hi.<eos> Miss me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got you.
It's...<eos> Dav...<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> Tonight's movie is "Singing in the Rain."<eos> Bring your blankets and... for a... good time.<eos> Sydney?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What was I saying?<eos> Uh... you were saying...<eos> You were talking about how the death of your father affected you, and I think that's very brave.
Intelligence gathering.<eos> Let's see what happens next.<eos> So you're just gonna whip up some kind of peace accord, what, before lunch or by dinner?<eos> Babe.<eos> I don't care if you save me or the world... if you don't save yourself.<eos> You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia?<eos> - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.<eos> That's the trick.<eos> The mind killer.<eos> Your disease convinces you, you don't have it.
- Yes.<eos> I absolutely have to.<eos> If this thing fails, well... you didn't see all of Walter's blood pouring out of his eyes.<eos> All right.<eos> We move, then.<eos> Assume D3 knows our position.<eos> Execute Plan M. Just let me talk to him.<eos> We have a...<eos> - rapport.<eos> - He tried to kill you.
The... the halo is losing power.<eos> Hey, kid!<eos> And when it fails?<eos> Think of the Shadow King as a computer virus.<eos> It's been in David's head for decades.<eos> Learning his systems, bypassing his defenses.<eos> Now it's ready to override the original program.<eos> Meaning me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Meaning you.

Am I the tumor in this?<eos> Your Lenny mask is running.<eos> Oh, I've got other faces.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You're gonna help me escape.<eos> You want me out of David? Fine, I'm gone.<eos> But you have to help me get away.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because if you don't, I'll kill him.<eos> Not if we kill you first.
See?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's working.<eos> The only way you're gonna get me out without killing him is if I decide to leave on my own.<eos> Hold on, it...<eos> It's fighting back.<eos> No.<eos> Lenny.<eos> I was just wondering...<eos> What am I without you?
It's gone. Ah.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm...<eos> I think you ruptured my spleen.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did we win?<eos> Does it look like we won?<eos> You should not have done that, as much as I like kissing you.
Hey.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm...<eos> I think you ruptured my spleen.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did we win?<eos> Does it look like we won?<eos> You should not have done that, as much as I like kissing you.<eos> Woulda killed you.
All right, then.<eos> Then the next question is: how?<eos> How do we rescue them?<eos> We are just minds, after all.<eos> And their bodies... are in quite a jumble.<eos> Facing certain death, and all that.<eos> He's too powerful for me.<eos> Farouk.<eos> He's too virile, psychically.<eos> David could break you out of the dream, possibly all of you.
You want me to put a little bit more vodka in there?<eos> David.<eos> My device.<eos> I made a halo, randomly firing electromagnetic signals in a 360-degree radius, which should... if we can put it on David's head... the real David... in the now-frozen timeline, it should block the Shadow King.<eos> Isolate it and end the hospital fantasy.<eos> Unfreezing time and executing your friends in a hail of bullets, unfortunately.<eos> Unless we can physically change the dynamic of the room.<eos> Block the bullets, move the bodies.<eos> We're going to need everybody.<eos> May I introduce you to my friend, Jules Verne?
Which is... that's not better.<eos> David. - David. - Ah, ohh!<eos> - You're freaking out.<eos> Stop it. - Whoa!<eos> Oh, no, you're not... oh, don't tell me you're trapped in here with another thing...<eos> monster... whatever it is.<eos> - Hm? - No, he's up there.<eos> The monster.<eos> He tricked us into giving up control.<eos> Tricked you.
He tricked us into giving up control.<eos> Tricked you.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I-I got that part, man.<eos> But if you're not the monster, then...<eos> I'm you.<eos> Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown...<eos> a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.
Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown...<eos> a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.<eos> You did.<eos> Wha... ah...<eos> And you're British?<eos> Like I said, I'm your rational mind.<eos> - And I created you?
- Ask me anything.<eos> - Okay...<eos> Are you my biological father?<eos> What? What... What kind of question is that?<eos> Ask me if, uh, I like your outfit.<eos> - Actually, ask me something else.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Just answer yes or no.<eos> Are you my biological father?<eos> Of course not. You know I adopted you.
...almond milk, whole milk.<eos> And so I said, "Low fat, please."<eos> And then the clerk leads me to the dairy section where the milk is kept, and then he said to me, proud as can be...<eos> You look terrible!<eos> We're having allergic reactions.<eos> I feel... I feel quite terrible.<eos> As do I.<eos> Goodness gracious, Violet, you have huge, ugly, red patches on your skin.<eos> Klaus, your tongue is swelling.<eos> Sunny, both things are happening to you.
The owner of a respectable lakeside rental agency, or three runaway pip-squeaks who go around stealing boats?<eos> We only stole that boat to retrieve Aunt Josephine from her hiding spot so she could tell everybody about your terrible plan.<eos> Is this true?<eos> You were going to betray me?<eos> - Mmm. - After all the years we spent together?<eos> After all of those picnics by the shore?<eos> After all of those shredded beef tamales I served to your husband?<eos> After all the secrets we had shared?<eos> Yes!<eos> I was going to betray you, and these three children gave me the courage to do so.
- I don't see it.<eos> - Sunny!<eos> Lucky... would you like to send that log into that saw?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We want fair wages!<eos> You think you're so superior, with your fancy optometry degree and weird hypnosis thing.<eos> Well, I don't need a partner.<eos> I was better off alone, where my plots were simple and straightforward and didn't involve any high-concept science fiction gimmicks.<eos> Are you breaking up with me again?<eos> No, I'm breaking up with you... again!
Oh, no, you can't.<eos> Now put my sister down.<eos> Yes, you may have saved Charles, but there will still be a fatal accident at the Lumbermill tonight.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> If you want our fortune, you can have it.<eos> Just leave Sunny alone!<eos> You think you're so clever, but you only see in black and white.<eos> Just like your parents. They were shortsighted, too.<eos> With their, "You can't hypnotize people!" And, "What about free will?"<eos> And, "We're going to kick you out and have your license revoked, and if we ever have children, we're never gonna let you anywhere near them!"
He's brokenhearted, and he wants very much to forget the whole thing.<eos> So he isn't just knocking on Dr. Orwell's door because he needs something for himself?<eos> No. He's just in town, looking for Dr. Georgina Orwell, in the hopes of somehow making things right.<eos> Because life is so short, it is so rare to meet, to find someone who shares one's brilliance, one's charm, one's dubious moral code in a world gone gloriously wrong.<eos> Such people must stick together like comrades, like partners, like...<eos> You've changed your hair.<eos> Olaf.<eos> Georgina.<eos> I swore I would never let you darken my door again.<eos> I took a solemn oath that my office would be closed to you forever, even during regular business hours.
He's in there.<eos> He was on guard with the others.<eos> I don't think he's gonna survive.<eos> The Witness's men hit us hard before we drove them off.<eos> Sam?<eos> I just realized... you will always be ageless to me.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> I was where I was meant to be.<eos> Olivia found me... in 2023.<eos> She should have brought you to me.
James Cole.<eos> You're not going to die... at least not today.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, we've never met.<eos> And now... We never will.<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> This is exactly where we started here... yesterday.<eos> They reset our timeline.<eos> They're gone.<eos> We're here to take you home, Jennifer.
I hear you're out of a job.<eos> I was wondering who would come to me first.<eos> You, Katarina, Cassie.<eos> How is Dr. Railly these days?<eos> Did you notice the sky when you came in here?<eos> Clear blue.<eos> Leaves are green, no Red Forest.<eos> Looks like the Witness didn't come through for ya after all.<eos> The upper hand doesn't suit you.<eos> So he pushed you out... left you for dead, and now you want the Witness.
All the times we could've killed you and didn't.<eos> Yet you never asked the question, "Why?"<eos> If I could kindly take a sample?<eos> Katarina would like a word.<eos> James...<eos> I wouldn't worry about Cassandra.<eos> Nothing stays in a box forever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ah, shit.<eos> I'm sorry I killed you.
Can anybody hear me, God damn it?<eos> Ouch.<eos> You look worse for wear, kid...<eos> But you wear it well, just like your old man.<eos> You sure?<eos> 'Cause nothing's free.<eos> You give something 'cause you want something.<eos> Do you remember that guy on Wilmont?<eos> The strung-out scumbag type?<eos> One day, you and your brother come running up to me, and you tell me that he said something dirty to you.
A man like that is the pawn of other men.<eos> Don't be weak.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> One day... far from now, you'll be called upon.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Is... is this your big plan?<eos> Big-shot Scav King? You're gonna lie down and cough up blood?<eos> - Touch me again.<eos> - Or what?<eos> I never liked you so much as the day you started hitting back.
One day... far from now, you'll be called upon.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Is... is this your big plan?<eos> Big-shot Scav King? You're gonna lie down and cough up blood?<eos> - Touch me again.<eos> - Or what?<eos> I never liked you so much as the day you started hitting back.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Bleed out, slip away.<eos> Whatever he is saving you for, it ain't Christmas.
I wasn't, though, 'cause I always told you the truth.<eos> Except that... That you're the lie.<eos> You're not even here now.<eos> I just... I just needed something.<eos> I needed something to hate, I needed something to beat, and I got you, and I hate you.<eos> I hate the smell.<eos> You smell like Two Buck Chuck.<eos> I hate your voice.<eos> I hate what you did to me... and him and her.<eos> I hate that I look like you.
Some might consider us even.<eos> We're about as even as...<eos> Prime number?<eos> Your brain has a rhythm to it.<eos> The same way that fractals have...<eos> Stop that.<eos> What?<eos> Please stop talking like a super villain.<eos> My directness makes you uncomfortable.<eos> I stabbed you.
My directness makes you uncomfortable.<eos> I stabbed you.<eos> I pushed you into a pool.<eos> And still you didn't break.<eos> Only my spine.<eos> But a couple of months in the dark, and you break wide open.<eos> You think I'm proud of that?<eos> No, I think you're unbreakable.<eos> That's what makes me uncomfortable.<eos> Because of you, my friend is on a mission, and now I'm having these nightmares.
What?<eos> We were together, but I... I undid it.<eos> It never happened.<eos> Your Army of the 12 Monkeys,<eos> Titan, the virus, the Witness, Sam.<eos> It starts with you, brother, you and her.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why do you think you're still alive all those times they could have taken you out?<eos> No, no.<eos> They were protecting you and Cassie.
It starts with you, brother, you and her.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why do you think you're still alive all those times they could have taken you out?<eos> No, no.<eos> They were protecting you and Cassie.<eos> They wanted that baby born.<eos> That's why they took her to Titan.<eos> It's got to make sense now, brother.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I was trying to protect you.
Hey.<eos> I know I'm not supposed to be here.<eos> You're hurt.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> I don't think I can do this alone.<eos> I need you to come home, Cassie.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna find someone to help you.<eos> Wait right here.<eos> How do you know that this was meant for you?
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...<eos> Because of you, my friend is on a mission, and now I'm having these nightmares.
Butterfly.<eos> That wasn't there before.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our way home.<eos> I didn't come here to kill the Witness.<eos> I came here to kill his mother.<eos> The Witness... is your son.<eos> Olivia told Ramse.<eos> She knows.<eos> It's why he came after you.
How many antique cars does your father have?<eos> Enough to need a warehouse.<eos> He likes to collect things, keep them locked up.<eos> Was it weird?<eos> Pretending to be your mother?<eos> I didn't have to go all Method or anything.<eos> That'd require me being 100% more homicidal.<eos> We could change that... for you.<eos> It's 1989.<eos> Your mother tries to drown you in '91.
Yeah.<eos> We've been in smaller spaces before.<eos> When?<eos> Our bed in '59... that tiny, thin mattress.<eos> Squeaked.<eos> You remember all that, huh?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I know... the storms were coming.<eos> And that timeline... that... life had to be erased, but... we could've done it together.<eos> I didn't want to put you through all that.
It has to be in here somewhere.<eos> This is the last place.<eos> Well, we have to find it.<eos> Let's, uh, retrace your steps.<eos> These are my steps.<eos> Wait.<eos> I got it.<eos> Hate for it to not be there when you find my corpse.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you if you weren't.
I don't know!<eos> She just keeps staring at me and pointing!<eos> It's really got you rattled.<eos> 'Cause this is how it starts!<eos> Visions.<eos> People, places, things.<eos> And it always ends in a lock and a tiny, padded room.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look.<eos> No one... no one... is gonna lock you up.
To take them down from the inside, we need to be on the inside.<eos> If we want to get into this "First Gathering of the Faithful," we need to be recruited.<eos> Just like everyone else.<eos> Sister.<eos> You must really have taken me for a dim-witted schmoe.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> Had me fooled back in '44.<eos> Different this time, though.<eos> The way she looks at you.
Probably won't be the last.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, my God. I am so sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Go with her.<eos> I'll stay here.<eos> Go home to your family.<eos> In fact, when I call you in 61', just call me a douchebag, and hang up.<eos> Well, I don't know what a douchebag is, but I'll definitely call you something.
But not just memories of us.<eos> I see him there.<eos> Waiting for something.<eos> The Witness exists because of a past that shouldn't...<eos> Athan.<eos> I wanted to name him Athan.<eos> You want to mourn him.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I can't.<eos> Because to you, he's just an idea.
I don't think I've ever been like anybody.<eos> I don't think you're like me at all.<eos> I think you're better.<eos> But one day, I think that you will be the best of us all.<eos> Go.<eos> You can't have him.<eos> The Witness foresaw this very moment.<eos> That the vessel which made him would come to unmake him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, he rejected you.
Primaries are driven to insanity by it.<eos> They don't see the gift.<eos> Do I detect envy?<eos> Wouldn't you like to see the puzzle from above?<eos> Stay calm.<eos> You are quite safe.<eos> Eliza.<eos> Where am I?<eos> My home.<eos> I told the nurses I'd take you to a proper hospital.
I've been thinking.<eos> There are other places besides London.<eos> Besides now.<eos> What are we running from, Athan?<eos> Your past? Your future?<eos> I'm not running from anything.<eos> I'm just saying that there are other places where... where a woman like yourself would never be made - to feel less than anything...<eos> - Oh, fantasies.<eos> If I could show you...<eos> If I could take you there, would you come with me?
What have you done?<eos> It was the only way.<eos> These men were going to murder you.<eos> I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Not again.<eos> Again?<eos> I have been at your funeral, Eliza.<eos> I have laid jasmine and lavender on your coffin.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I killed them to save you.
I don't understand...<eos> It's broken.<eos> It cannot be set.<eos> The hands cannot be rewound or moved forward.<eos> There's only now.<eos> There's only today.<eos> And from this moment on, you are reminded that time is never to be manipulated.<eos> It is ungodly.<eos> I couldn't let you die.<eos> I would do anything for you.
Brainiac mental patient, CEO/corporate terrorist, future-psychic gypsy pirate, but I ain't no squatter, bro.<eos> Okay?<eos> I own this place now.<eos> Took me forever to find it.<eos> It's complete shite.<eos> Why do you want it?<eos> We all have a purpose.<eos> I'm supposed to be here.<eos> Fate's a real bitch that way...<eos> Rarely puts you up at the Ritz.
Sit down, you little shit.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> A scolding?<eos> A lecture, perhaps.<eos> I'm about to be talked wit and wisdom by two people younger and less traveled than myself.<eos> There's a turnout for the books.<eos> I thought you were inevitable. Written.<eos> Every little kick was like... a knife in my heart.<eos> When you left me, I felt... free.<eos> But then I saw you.
"Tomorrow, you will do such things."<eos> There is nothing that you can say or do, either of you, that will undermine my decision.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop.<eos> We've been here before, you and I.<eos> History's full of second chances.<eos> So get it right this time.<eos> Pull the trigger, or I will kill you both.<eos> No.<eos> Please. Please, I'm begging you.
They were evidence of his failure.<eos> And I thought to myself...<eos> "Well, shit, if you want something done right"...<eos> I was a fool to trust you.<eos> No, Katarina.<eos> You were the equal who made me better.<eos> You did what I couldn't.<eos> You killed the Witness.<eos> Ramse, Sam...<eos> It was all a game to you.
And though you have an army at your back...<eos> You are alone.<eos> That is why you will lose.<eos> Air raid siren<eos> This is an international multicast from the American CDC.<eos> Doctors at the Baltimore CDC are working day and night to develop a vaccine.<eos> We won't stop until we have one, but we can't do it alone.<eos> If you're one of the immune, you're vital to our research.<eos> The suit's repair is complete.<eos> I'm going to have to leave you now.
I'm gonna go back into Owen's house and take those phones that I found in his false wall.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> What, this false wall?<eos> You see, after our little chat the other day, I got curious and did some snooping, and it seems like your only lead... those phones... have vanished.<eos> Maybe this is a good thing.<eos> If the phones are missing, it means they're in play.<eos> Yeah, but you missed the window.<eos> The sale is over.<eos> The merchandise is gone.<eos> How can you track down something that you couldn't even get when it was right in front of you?
Yeah.<eos> Not even a minute after we got it.<eos> It's like something out of "Mission: Impossible."<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Doesn't feel like the right thing.<eos> This is a game-changer for us, the step-up that we needed.<eos> You said that there were three of you.<eos> Did you pull the trigger?<eos> No. That was León.<eos> - Then somebody up there likes you.
I've done a really good job at differentiating Shelby from Jane.<eos> Shelby drinks coffee, Jane drinks tea.<eos> Shelby reads, Jane watches television.<eos> You're calling yourself Shelby.<eos> That's not a good sign.<eos> Said by the woman who had her own sister use her name for six months.<eos> Has he told you any more about who he killed?<eos> No, but he said it's for my own good.<eos> Hmm. That's a good sign.<eos> He wants to protect you from it.
Kareem Johnson.<eos> He's a fund manager.<eos> Stand here with me for a second.<eos> Make him think he accomplished something when I talk to him.<eos> Who's yours?<eos> Got two.<eos> The Benchleys...<eos> - Brianna and Fred.<eos> - Okay, then.<eos> How do you know when someone's seducing you for information?
Bethesda.<eos> I know an out-of-the-way motel.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> See you then.<eos> Ooh, Carly Klapp.<eos> Well, that's one lucky lady with a very unfortunate name.<eos> So, what's the holdup?<eos> She looks wholesome enough.<eos> She's even wearing a cross.<eos> That's good for you.

I'm pissed at your assumption.<eos> I just... I thought you were different.<eos> No, you couldn't have thought I was that different, 'cause... you're here, trying to make this story end the way it did for you last time.<eos> You think I want something from you, and the only way I can get it - is to sleep with you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Do you know how archaic this whole scenario is?<eos> Like, the only thing a woman has to offer is sex, and men are so dumb that they're gonna give up anything to get it.<eos> I can get whatever I want without having to compromise myself, and if you couldn't, then you weren't a very good operative.<eos> You're saying no to a question I'm not asking, which means this is about what you want from me.<eos> And what is it I want from you?

Slow down, Alabama.<eos> I hope I didn't take you away from your marks.
That's not a long time, right?<eos> We met at a diner.<eos> We...<eos> We...<eos> We spent a holiday together.<eos> I've told you things about my life<eos> I haven't even told my own family.<eos> It's not normal for me.<eos> Something doesn't add up.<eos> Something about you.
Something doesn't add up.<eos> Something about you.<eos> Just because I'm interested in you?<eos> That's what a relationship is.<eos> I'd say it's a little more than interest, wouldn't you say?<eos> I mean, y-you sleep with me, you pull back, you leave me wanting more, and the whole time, y-you're searching and you're... and you're digging.<eos> I mean, who are you, really?<eos> W-What are you hiding from me?<eos> I know that you have skeletons in your closet.<eos> So do I, but I don't press you about yours, because I know you need someone who's not gonna judge you.
That is what I need, too.<eos> Look, it's okay that we met, and it's moving fast.<eos> You're different from anyone I've ever know.<eos> I-I can't explain it, but it's just...<eos> I know that I feel safe when I'm around you, and I hope you do, too.<eos> You know what?<eos> Here.<eos> Take my phone.<eos> Call anyone in there.<eos> Ask them who I am, and see if I don't add up to you, because I have nothing to hide from you.
You know, I just wasn't, you know, happy with my current look.<eos> So I'm... I'm trying something new, what do you think?<eos> Steampunk... or smoke-punk?<eos> Dude, just go "Waterworld,"<eos> take those clothes off.<eos> Yes!<eos> I love that.<eos> Hey, check me out, okay...<eos> - You're a genius.<eos> - I'm here for you, man.
- Yes.<eos> - Roasted.<eos> Oh, hey, Bill, um, remember, I need you to head to TAC-Long Beach and return those thermal hunting vision goggle things we borrowed for the sales demo, kay?<eos> Yeah, topped off the tank this morning.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Get going then.<eos> 'Cause you were late last time, and I had to deal with Roger from TAC-LBC saying how I run a loose ship.<eos> This ship isn't loose.<eos> It's full of holes and sinking fast.<eos> I'd like to toss you overboard and let the sharks rip you apart.
You see the look on his face?<eos> Total shock. We've got something that belongs to you.<eos> Where is Bill?<eos> He wasn't<eos> "eeling" well.<eos> We only deal with Bill.<eos> Well, I guess I can find another buyer for these. That's what I thought.<eos> Here. I'm going back.<eos> I have to free those turtle eggs.<eos> Bill, these people gonna kill you.
Baby, why wouldn't you tell me?<eos> I was insecure, but now that I know that I'm the love of your life, if it's okay with you guys,<eos> Okay, wait. I wouldn't expect you to understand.<eos> But this is for her happiness.<eos> Still weird for me.<eos> No, that's cool to me.<eos> Okay, well, I obviously don't want to watch, but I will out of curiosity sake.<eos> I'm watching. Thank you, baby.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'll always love you.

Thank you, baby.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'll always love you.<eos> I know, baby, go on.<eos> Oh, and now the main event.<eos> God,<eos> I've been wanting you for so long. Duh. Bill just has this animal magnetism.
I'll question Nels.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm usually pretty busy back here, so I can't really tell you much about her.<eos> There must be something.<eos> She was annoying, she was always flirting, always playing some sort of angle.<eos> It felt like she was hosting "the Yvonne show." Or something...<eos> Pepper vodka?<eos> Do a shot with me!<eos> It'll loosen you up.
Trouble, or...<eos> You know what I sensed?<eos> That she was a crap DJ.<eos> I DJ myself, so I know.<eos> I don't even know how she got hired.<eos> You're a DJ, too?<eos> Okay, so here's her check stubs.<eos> She started last month.<eos> All right!<eos> C'mon this one's for you, Clive!
What's it say?<eos> I'm not going to tell you, the whole point is...<eos> 'Cause it's bad?<eos> It's bad.<eos> You don't want to tell me 'cause it's bad.<eos> Oh, god. I'm a terrible person.<eos> Everything I put you through.<eos> Liv.<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> That letter, it says that good old major loved you like no one else ever.
- What?<eos> I was supposed to get ingredients for Ravi's memory solution, but I keep forgetting.<eos> Can I print this list out on your printer?<eos> Yeah sure, go crazy.<eos> This brain. I'm just, scrambled...<eos> Oh, speaking of which, how're those eggs coming, maestro?<eos> It's getting there. Sage...<eos> Where's the Sage?<eos> Sage?<eos> That woman slapped you because you slept with her husband?

Sage...<eos> Where's the Sage?<eos> Sage?<eos> That woman slapped you because you slept with her husband?<eos> After all I do for you, you go out and just screw some random guy, and his name is Sage?
Yeah.<eos> So you show up with the money and a bottle of wine.<eos> You were expecting a little something extra for your effort, - weren't you Joel?<eos> - Wine?<eos> - What makes you think...<eos> - We're detectives, Joel!<eos> We detect things!<eos> No joke. Does anyone have, like, an aspirin or ibuprofen?<eos> As Ms. Moore was saying, it appears you were hoping for something beyond friendship.<eos> You were totally into Yvonne, but she friendzoned you.
What are you doing?<eos> I just took your profile pic.<eos> You just joined a new app called Seek-A-Boo.<eos> I'm not going to search for women on the Internet like the way I shop for vintage German vacuum parts.<eos> This app works.<eos> I had three dates last week... steak, duck, and I'm seeing lobster again tonight.<eos> Dating is a numbers game.<eos> Do you know how many women I had to go through before I met Charlotte?<eos> Yes... our bedrooms are right next to each other.<eos> Muriel, may I escort you home?
Well, you know that I never kiss and tell, but I had sex last night, which involved a lot of kissing, and now I am telling you.<eos> Congratulations, buddy.<eos> My first one-night stand.<eos> I'm a hound.<eos> Hey, don't forget, I'm the one who picked her out.<eos> So I hope you thought of me last night while you two were...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Actually, Oscar, it wasn't the woman you picked.<eos> She wasn't my type.<eos> Ran out on you, did she?
I know.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I was scared of combining our lives, but knowing you want it as much as I do makes me feel good.<eos> Here's to our future together.<eos> We did it!<eos> We sure did!<eos> Oh, my God, what have I done?<eos> Hiya, hot stuff!<eos> Well.<eos> It is nice to see you in the hand-woven dress shirt that I was saving for a special occasion.
I'm going to show you something that you're really going to like.<eos> You've said that before with mixed results.<eos> It's your own shelf.<eos> For all your mysterious lady things.<eos> Okay, Oscar, what is going on?<eos> First you want to get closer, and then you run away.<eos> Well, that's because you drive me crazy.<eos> I drive you crazy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because I realized that I love you, Charlotte.

Give me your bag.<eos> You're clear.<eos> That's good.<eos> We need to move.<eos> Here it is.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Move your feet.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Whoa! That's a nice one.<eos> Next time, I'll teach you how to snap off a real curveball.
- They're murderers.<eos> They're the ones that attacked our house.<eos> They tried to kill your brother and sister.<eos> Because you were a collaborator.<eos> I collaborated to keep us alive!<eos> Stop it! Enough!<eos> They wanted to make a difference.<eos> To stand up.<eos> They wanted to fight.<eos> He did this because of you.
I got him.<eos> Get him out of my sight!<eos> Come on, move.<eos> Move!<eos> Just the guy I was looking for.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You got a minute?<eos> I came across something strange as I was going through the tuttle-Reid case file.<eos> A registration form for a karate class the kid, Wally, took a couple of years ago.<eos> For his "in case of emergency," he listed you.
Is that mustache real?<eos> No, I glued it to give myself more authority in situations like this.<eos> Well, you look like black Tony stark.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to your arm?<eos> Fighting off the ladies.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Or maybe you don't.<eos> So, that's it?<eos> A kid you had a few chance encounters with had you down as his "in case of emergency?"
Was that just so super bitchy?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Good god.<eos> It just really hurts me when someone hurts you, you know?<eos> You're like my best friend ever.<eos> For real.<eos> Wait.<eos> We're totally best friends, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is so you and Peyton.
He looked thin.<eos> He'll be back in a couple weeks and I told him I'd try to get you to make your paella.<eos> That's great.<eos> I think I might take Wally and go stay with Caleb when he gets back.<eos> Yeah?<eos> A restraining order's just a piece of paper.<eos> I'm afraid this is gonna be Rick's first stop when he gets out.<eos> Anna... I'm right next door.<eos> You've already done so much for us.<eos> I never want it to seem like I take you for granted.
- Previously on X Company...<eos> - You must be Sabine's father.<eos> Helene Bauer.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting you.<eos> He's a German agent.<eos> Where is he?<eos> This is me, asking you the nice way.
All the prisoners requested by the Resistance have been deported to the camps.<eos> Then I'll take a truck from the convoy, and go to the camps myself...<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> What happened?<eos> They've been executed.<eos> All six of them.<eos> There's no one to exchange for Brigadefuhrer Faber.<eos> That should do it.<eos> Your brother taught you well.
I should be here.<eos> - He's strong, Sabine.<eos> He'll find a way to come home.<eos> Maybe you should make sure everything is ready for him.<eos> Don't you have any friends out there that could help Franz?<eos> They were supposed to arrive by train yesterday, but they didn't.<eos> Of course.<eos> You were everywhere in Paris, but now, when we need you?<eos> Nowhere to be found.<eos> Untersturmfuhrer Edsel has arranged for someone to take you home, Sabine.
And Harry...<eos> The Gestapo's going to show up for the rendezvous at 4:00 PM.<eos> - Without the prisoners?<eos> - I couldn't get any more details.<eos> My guess is that they'll try to free Faber by force.<eos> - And when...<eos> - Morning.<eos> When the Resistance sees that they've been lied to, they'll try to kill him.<eos> I'll do what I can to keep him out of harm's way.<eos> Alfred, the mission can't lose both you and Faber.
The Germans won't make it that easy.<eos> No. But it might get us closer to the refineries.<eos> You're going to need some Polish papers.<eos> I'll see what I can find at the office.<eos> I'll meet you back here later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been gone too long.<eos> We never got to finish our conversation from the train.<eos> If you're going to ask about the guns, I've already told...<eos> I'm more interested in what brings you here, Fritz.
I know what she looks like.<eos> That's right.<eos> Your wife.<eos> I don't think it would be very hard to find out where she lives, where she sleeps.<eos> Tell me where the guns are.<eos> Or I will find her and do to her what your people did to mine.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> Here.<eos> They don't have the prisoners to trade for you.
Tell me where the guns are.<eos> Or I will find her and do to her what your people did to mine.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> Here.<eos> They don't have the prisoners to trade for you.<eos> They've been killed.<eos> No one here knows.<eos> They think the Germans are going ahead with the exchange.<eos> We'll find a way to set you free.
After he chased you out of my house, I thought... Good.<eos> Maybe we had a chance to leave all this business behind. And start again.<eos> A few days later, He comes home, "sabine, I've just met. With them.<eos> I'm going to help." another decision.<eos> Without even thinking to ask.<eos> I understand.<eos> That you're angry. I would feel the same way.<eos> But he thought it would be...<eos> He thought it would be safer for you not to know.<eos> He was trying to protect you.
He thought it would be safer for you not to know.<eos> He was trying to protect you.<eos> I'm not some porcelain doll.<eos> Of course not.<eos> And that's why we need your help.<eos> Franz, he needs your help.<eos> I don't know who franz is.<eos> Please, just come with me.<eos> I'm done taking orders.<eos> From you, from franz.
You know he's gonna get shot, that's the law!<eos> You don't know who my father is.<eos> There is no law.<eos> He can have franz exiled...<eos> Might be a little bit naive.<eos> There you go again.<eos> I'm a child!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Or are you gonna just shoot me?<eos> ! Your husband loves you very much.
Bread for the prisoners.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, father.<eos> Are you the "girl from the moon"?<eos> I assume you acquired your job at the royal care society. Through your sympathizer contacts.<eos> Who are they?<eos> We're already questioning your swastika club associate. At the bar, as well as the other patrons.<eos> They're mostly idiots.<eos> But you also have some sophisticated colleagues.<eos> Who provided you with the compact explosive. You gave klaus?

You gave klaus?<eos> Any other questions?<eos> Maybe I should make a list.<eos> The sooner you answer my questions, the sooner. You get some circulation back in your arms.<eos> Is that how this works?<eos> I just tell you what you want to know?<eos> They must have run out. Of manpower to promote you to sergeant.
I just tell you what you want to know?<eos> They must have run out. Of manpower to promote you to sergeant.<eos> If you were better at your job, you wouldn't be here.<eos> I'm impressed klaus frommer was able to get the bomb. Past your security.<eos> Kid was a little jumpy.<eos> He didn't need to die.<eos> You manipulated him.<eos> You seem to care a lot about a german you killed.<eos> He was your first, wasn't he?<eos> And they sent you in to talk to me.
Well...<eos> You came.<eos> I guess I didn't need to.<eos> You already have a date.<eos> Sweetheart, have you been drinking?<eos> I was told I had to come.<eos> No one said I had to be sober.<eos> You look wonderful.<eos> It means a lot to me that you're here.<eos> I'm not here for you.
This is what comes. Of aiding enemies of the reich.<eos> If any of you interfere, you will be shot.<eos> The sooner someone identifies rigaud, The more lives will be spared.<eos> No one?<eos> Madame?<eos> Last chance.<eos> Non.<eos> Does anyone have anything to say?<eos> Stay quiet.<eos> There's a car waiting for you at the gates.
Madame?<eos> Last chance.<eos> Non.<eos> Does anyone have anything to say?<eos> Stay quiet.<eos> There's a car waiting for you at the gates.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> You have friends on the outside that want to help you.<eos> I can get you to the gate.
Non.<eos> Does anyone have anything to say?<eos> Stay quiet.<eos> There's a car waiting for you at the gates.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> You have friends on the outside that want to help you.<eos> I can get you to the gate.<eos> There's a truck waiting.<eos> It'll take you to your safe house.
He even managed. To radio intelligence about potential allied landings in norway.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> I'm going. To make a recommendation to berlin to consider. Fortifying our ports along the north sea.<eos> It was an inspiring speech, franz.<eos> It's been a privilege serving with you.<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought I might stay here with my father tonight.<eos> We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> Please come home with me.<eos> Everything I do, every decision I make. Is for you, for us.
Come on.<eos> They're blanks.<eos> Don't! He's still disoriented. From the interrogation.<eos> A man with his training, he might have noticed a tail.<eos> But he was in a hurry to get here.<eos> Sure he was.<eos> We gave him a nice nugget to radio home...<eos> That the allies are preparing an invasion through norway.<eos> Keeps the focus off north africa.<eos> It helps when you let them underestimate you.
I don't know.<eos> Ready?<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> Normally with memory work we go systematically, back to front, step-by-step through your life.<eos> We show you that each instance of your illness was actually your power manifesting.<eos> In this way, we discover your abilities together.<eos> We learn what the triggers are, but because of your sister we don't have that kind of time.<eos> So let's focus on the big events.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means the shit that scares you the most.
It's like the soul, you know?<eos> No one knows for sure. Does it exist?<eos> But I've got proof.<eos> We're more than just this.<eos> I've been a Chinese man, a 300-pound woman, a five-year-old girl, but everywhere I go, I'm me.<eos> Well, I liked it.<eos> Being you.<eos> I mean, not at first.<eos> That was really weird and horrifying, but then...<eos> Looking in the mirror, seeing you...
Sorry.<eos> I know you were a bit of a lab rat at Division Three.<eos> I just don't like to be studied, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, could you hand me the thingy?<eos> - Me?<eos> - He means me.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> More needles.<eos> I could knock you out, if it'll help.
Dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> I was just, uh...<eos> Psst, kid.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> It's sweet, really.<eos> They think they can save you.
With these clowns?<eos> They're helping me.<eos> Oh, like the hospital helped you? No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not sick.<eos> I have abilities. - Huh.<eos> - They're showing me in my past.<eos> I have power. Oh, no.<eos> That's good.<eos> I'm happy for you.
Hey, if you learn to control that, you're gonna be a world-class badass.<eos> Hey, come on. Let's go.<eos> Are you sure he saw you?<eos> He had, like, a creepy perm and one milky eye.<eos> What?<eos> David, this is very important.<eos> You are not to go back there.<eos> I know, I know, I know, but maybe, maybe, if I can take Syd there, maybe I can bring Amy back. No.<eos> You surprised them.<eos> Next time, they'll be waiting for you, and one of two things will happen.
Great story, I just...<eos> I don't really care who he is.<eos> He has my sister, and we need to get her back.<eos> David, sit down.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> Honestly, I've never seen a mind like yours before.<eos> It's as if your brain is defending itself.<eos> Certain memories, certain parts of your story have been walled off or erased.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means I can't do what I need to do to orient you, to train you.
And then I want to use him.<eos> All I care about is Amy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> My instinct, given the resistance, is to slow down. - No.<eos> - I agree.<eos> I think your defenses are just getting stronger.<eos> I'm afraid we're gonna have to take a much harder approach.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - Meaning I want to sedate you.
- My hand!<eos> - Let me see.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not real.<eos> It's just a memory.<eos> They can't hurt you.<eos> I'm not so sure those are memories.<eos> David?<eos> - David?<eos> - Mad at you.

I won't.<eos> They're gonna torture my son in front of me,<eos> Neil.<eos> And when they do, I will talk.<eos> And that can't happen.<eos> You gotta get aurora to the finish line.<eos> Please, neil.<eos> Go!<eos> Stopping operation marigold.<eos> Is more important than you or me.
You gotta get aurora to the finish line.<eos> Please, neil.<eos> Go!<eos> Stopping operation marigold.<eos> Is more important than you or me.<eos> "aurora luft.<eos> Harry james.<eos> Tom cummings. Alfred graves."<eos> I saw him in paris and poland.<eos> They left you in charge?
One wrong word, one wrong move, And we can both be shot.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> The only way I could explain my contact. With the allied spies was to tell them. That I was fooling them the whole time.<eos> A triple agent.<eos> A triple agent?<eos> So now you've learned to tell three lies at once?<eos> You see that I had no choice, don't you?<eos> So now what?<eos> You do what they want?<eos> I do what I need to in order to protect you. And to protect myself.
I have the reichssicherheitsdienst outside if you'd care to come with me.<eos> Thank you, franz.<eos> I'll see you both shortly.<eos> Come on!<eos> Your car is early!<eos> Even your leader tried to spare himself this.<eos> You might follow his example.<eos> Not by suicide.<eos> Something more civilized, Like a conversation.<eos> I've seen you before.
My boss wanted to see his son,<eos> And I was here to protect him.<eos> How did you enter the country?<eos> Let's cut to the chase, alright?<eos> I've been out of touch with camp x a long time.<eos> You're not going to get much out of me.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Shall I call my man back?<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I said I saw you...
So much more beautiful up close.<eos> Helene.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was so forward.<eos> No.<eos> There is no need.<eos> Your forwardness, I admire it.<eos> I always have.<eos> You are intoxicating.<eos> I look at you and... I'm lost.
Maybe I can help.<eos> We were going to keep his son with us as leverage.<eos> We were going to send him back to canada. And make him work for us as a double agent.<eos> That's a good plan.<eos> It would have worked.<eos> It still can.<eos> Use me.<eos> My life in exchange for new intelligence.<eos> Our superiors wanted sinclair. Interrogated and executed as a morale victory.<eos> They'd want the same for you.
I can be that asset.<eos> My superiors didn't approve that arrangement.<eos> From the brigadefuhrer; why would they approve it from me?<eos> You lot really don't know what you're doing, do you?<eos> This is why we've got networks all over france; You've got nothing.<eos> You don't know...<eos> Forget it about it, mate.<eos> Go on, just get on with it.<eos> Salute, march, do as you're told.<eos> I mistook you for a spy, not a soldier.
Sabine... He fought the reich.<eos> He pushed a knife into its heart.<eos> He did an extraordinary thing.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> The first mission in the field, Your first time jumping out of a plane into empty space;<eos> It's terrifying, It sucks the breath out of your lungs, Your heart pounds into your ribs,<eos> Once you land, you have to make. Decisions on your own, Choices that nothing can really prepare you for,<eos> You'll disappear. And you might never come back.<eos> If you're caught, You're fair game for torture.<eos> There's no uniform to protect you.
Previously on "The 100"...<eos> The death wave will be here in 10 days.<eos> What I found was a fallout shelter, built to sustain thousands.<eos> Salvation lies within.<eos> The radiation doesn't care if you're Trikru or Azgeda.<eos> Azgeda will never see the inside.<eos> What if we share it?<eos> I can live with that.<eos> When the time comes to close the door, Azgeda will see that it's done.<eos> I'll take you home.

Get ready to move out.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - What? No. You can't.<eos> I'm sorry, son. Bellamy is right.<eos> We can't save them if they don't want to be saved.<eos> If Octavia was in there, would you let her stay?<eos> If Octavia was in there... At least I'd get to say good-bye.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> Skairipa.<eos> I saw you in Polis.
Wanheda is making a mockery of our faith.<eos> I'm trying to save us, your highness.<eos> You know that.<eos> Because you think we're savages in need of saving?<eos> Praimfaya is almost here.<eos> Then let's not waste any more time.<eos> Bring in the healer!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We don't know if this works.<eos> The flame could kill you.
Ok.<eos> Good.<eos> In the meantime, Bellamy has a lot of friends in the guard.<eos> We need to put someone on his door that wants to survive more than be liked.<eos> I think I know someone like that.<eos> They're just gonna keep him locked up for 5 years?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Clarke, this is his sister we're talking about.<eos> I think we both know he's never just gonna let that go.<eos> Look, all I need to know from you is...
Aah! No!<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> How do you think he's doing?<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> This'll go well.<eos> You'll talk to him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me out!<eos> I'll relieve you in 6 hours.
It'll spike with the death wave.<eos> But everyone here will be dead by then anyway.<eos> Oh, Monty.<eos> It's already happening, Harper.<eos> You're getting sick.<eos> If you come with me tonight, you'll get better.<eos> The bunker is safe.<eos> Then you should go there.<eos> Now while you still can.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.
The black rain is keeping the clans at bay for now.<eos> But when it stops and they find out what your people did... They stole the bunker.<eos> They're not my people anymore.<eos> I wondered why Kane was stalling.<eos> Indra, no.<eos> Skaikru dishonors us all yet again.<eos> When the people find out, you'll pay for this in blood.<eos> Skaikru wasn't the only clan that showed dishonor at the conclave.<eos> Was it?<eos> I know you were disguised as a warrior on the battlefield, and I know roan caught you.

Find out what?<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Answer me!<eos> - No. Don't take that off. Not for me.<eos> Don't take that off.<eos> No. This is not making...<eos> No. You need to let us go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Like hell I do. Get off...<eos> - Just go! Get off or I will never forgive you. Do you hear me?
This isn't a joke. This is real, you idiot.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> It's ok.<eos> If you feel it, then say it.<eos> No.<eos> No. Just stay with me. Stay with me.<eos> Hey. Jasper.<eos> Jasper!<eos> Jasper...<eos> I love you.
Let me help you.<eos> It's ok.<eos> If you feel it, then say it.<eos> No.<eos> No. Just stay with me. Stay with me.<eos> Hey. Jasper.<eos> Jasper!<eos> Jasper...<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
Oh, no. No.<eos> Jasper.<eos> No.<eos> Let us go.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Harper!<eos> No.<eos> Harper.<eos> Monty.<eos> I love you.
Hey, hey, hey, where's Emori?<eos> I haven't seen her.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Ethan!<eos> Ethan!<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> It's ok.<eos> - Emori!<eos> - John?<eos> Hey, did they hurt you?
You saved so many others.<eos> You saved me, and I don't mean just by opening the door.<eos> I don't know who I am anymore.<eos> The things that I let myself do in that lab...<eos> I told you, we will find our humanity again.<eos> I need you to pull 81 names from the bowl.<eos> Abby...<eos> When that door closes today, I need to be on the other side.<eos> Please.<eos> I just got you back.
You'll get used to it.<eos> Monty, do you read me?<eos> Over. Roan banished me.<eos> I heard.<eos> Monty...<eos> I was only trying to save my people.<eos> Monty, do you copy?<eos> Is that so wrong?<eos> Bellamy, come in. Do you read me?<eos> Yes, Monty. I read you.
Bellamy, come in. Do you read me?<eos> Yes, Monty. I read you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Two clicks outside Polis. Almost there.<eos> - Everything ok?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> Look, Monty. I hate to ask you this, but we broke down on the way to the island to get Raven.<eos> We need you to come reel us in.<eos> We save our friends.<eos> I love you. You know that?
We can still save everyone.<eos> Just not Raven.<eos> We got here as fast as we could.<eos> Clarke, you're exposed.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Let's get you into the Rover. - No, Monty.<eos> I'm fine. I'll grab the extra helmet.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> Planet ain't getting any less irradiated.<eos> Here. Come on. I got you.
Fight!<eos> Fight!<eos> Fight! Fight!<eos> Fight!<eos> Fight! Fight!<eos> Your people need you.<eos> Listen to them.<eos> They wanna fight.<eos> How do we stop them now?<eos> I'll do this for you.
He stays.<eos> No.<eos> The children, they stay, all of them.<eos> He goes.<eos> The son stays.<eos> No. She stays.<eos> She stays. She stays.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We're not leaving you behind.
- How?<eos> I'm not a leader.<eos> It should be you or Clarke or...<eos> O., stop.<eos> Neither of us could've done what you did, and it wasn't just winning a fight.<eos> You gave people hope when there was none.<eos> You're... you're Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and giving it back to the human race.<eos> Prometheus got chained to a rock so that eagles could eat his liver.<eos> Thanks for ruining my metaphor, O.<eos> I love you, big brother.
You suck at talking people into things. You know that, right?<eos> Anyone here still need to be talked into this?<eos> Good.<eos> Now we know the many ways we might die today, why don't you tell us what we have to do to live?<eos> How much further to the lighthouse?<eos> Oh, so you can talk. I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.<eos> What's your problem with me, anyway?<eos> What did I ever do to you?<eos> You mean, besides trying to kill my best friend after he got hit with a spear because he was keeping you awake?
Who knew you were a secret badass?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, watch your step.<eos> It's probably a bad idea to drop the thing that's gonna save our lives, huh?<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> Focus on me. Tell me about Harper.<eos> Hey, you guys seem pretty serious.<eos> You tell her you love her yet?<eos> I mean, now, today might be the day.<eos> I told her.<eos> Ah, it's crazy how it changes you, isn't it?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Wouldn't it be easier just to walk outside?<eos> Get out, Bellamy.<eos> Go back to the sky where you belong.<eos> I belong nowhere.<eos> You do that, you die a coward.<eos> I betrayed you.
Well, it'll make for an intriguing college essay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, I know we're moving out, but just a quick gut check here.<eos> Kirk is gone.<eos> But according to Reddington, he's, what, dead?<eos> Not dead?<eos> He's definitely not in jail.<eos> I don't know.<eos> With Reddington, I don't assume anything.<eos> He kept you from getting answers about who your father is.
I had no idea an attack was coming.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Look, I'm handling it.<eos> I'll find them. I...<eos> I have security camera footage from the attack.<eos> I convinced the police there wasn't any.<eos> Look, I know they sent you to warn me.<eos> Just... tell them, warning received.<eos> They didn't send me to warn you.
Yes.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Look, I'm handling it.<eos> I'll find them. I...<eos> I have security camera footage from the attack.<eos> I convinced the police there wasn't any.<eos> Look, I know they sent you to warn me.<eos> Just... tell them, warning received.<eos> They didn't send me to warn you.<eos> They sent me to replace you.
Marlin, call security.<eos> No, just... give us a moment.<eos> You and I are even.<eos> - Not quite.<eos> - The hell we're not.<eos> I halted my presidential campaign and launched a Senate hearing into Alexander Kirk's links to terrorism.<eos> And in exchange, you received a generous donation and an appreciable bump in the polls, and now look what's happened.<eos> Robert, the man you're replacing as the leader of the free world has a legacy he'll want you to help burnish by keeping certain people and policies in place.<eos> He'll want favors.<eos> To get them, this is one of the things he'll have to do for you.

Oh, my God.<eos> Liz, you've been pardoned.<eos> ♪ all of the thoughts we thought ♪ ...continue to speculate on what was behind the President's controversial decision to pardon Elizabeth Keen.<eos> The White House issued a statement that the President will not be commenting.<eos> - ♪ before the riot ♪ - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, I was thinking about what you told me.<eos> Well, like I said, I hope you're happy about it.<eos> There's someone else.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this, for us, for you.
I was there.<eos> I see.<eos> And did you see Agnes's mother's fall?<eos> Heard it.<eos> Found her at the foot of the stairs, ran and got Wilbur, he got an ambulance, but she was already...<eos> And yet, strangely, you didn't wake me up, did you?<eos> Why was that?<eos> I told you at the time, I wanted... I didn't want to upset you.<eos> An excuse that sounds as weak now as it did then.<eos> There's nothing weak about wanting to protect you.
However... ..that leaves you with a difficult, ethical obligation.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You are Inspector Mallory's only alibi.<eos> The only person who can exonerate him.<eos> You want me to tell my husband that I practically did a striptease in front of one of his colleagues?<eos> I'm not saying the conversation won't be awkward, but if you don't have it, he will hang.<eos> You whore.<eos> There's no need for that.<eos> I thought I'd told you to leave.<eos> And what about you?

Getting too old for you, am I?<eos> It's like Father Brown said.<eos> I'm invisible to you.<eos> Well, no, I didn't quite...<eos> You told her what?<eos> All I did was advise her to tell the truth.<eos> Sometimes, it has a way of setting you free.<eos> Free.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm leaving you.
Last time I saw him was a couple of days ago.<eos> He was having a barney with that tweedy girl from the library.<eos> Sounded like she was breaking up with him.<eos> Go on. Well, he's saying, "I'll do whatever you want, you can trust me."<eos> And she's not that sure.<eos> So he's like, "Of course I still want to be with you", and she says, "Well, I don't know.<eos> Everything's changed."<eos> And he's like, "What, because of a few stupid photographs?"<eos> And so she says, "Sorry."<eos> And he's, "Oh, please, Ada, I love you!"
No!<eos> You killed her!<eos> No, I cut this on a broken glass.<eos> She was pregnant!<eos> It's true.<eos> No, don't listen to him.<eos> It was Oscar!<eos> Now he's been arrested, we can go back to how things were.<eos> "How things were"?<eos> Before he tried to take you from me!
It was Oscar!<eos> Now he's been arrested, we can go back to how things were.<eos> "How things were"?<eos> Before he tried to take you from me!<eos> See, all this is his fault!<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> I knew Oscar would find out that you didn't write him that note saying you weren't going to elope together.<eos> So I went to your dressing room, to tell you how I felt.<eos> To tell you that you deserve more than him.<eos> That he can't love you.
To tell you that you deserve more than him.<eos> That he can't love you.<eos> Not like I can.<eos> But it wasn't you.<eos> It was her.<eos> She saw my pain... ..and all she could do was mock!<eos> That must have been very distressing.<eos> I knew Verity would've told you what I'd said just to humiliate me.<eos> I had to speak to you first.<eos> So I came here to Oscar's room to find you, but you weren't here.
- Why are you doing that?<eos> - Doing what?<eos> Telling those moms you're a dad to charm your way into the room, - using Samuel to... - It's my life.<eos> It happened.<eos> Yeah, it's my life, too, but I don't use it to... -<eos> To what?<eos> Help that dad make his decision?<eos> Help those moms find a little bit of comfort?<eos> April, if you don't like it, that is your problem.<eos> I'm not the one that asked you to come here in the first place.

Then we still would not have had enough time for the flap.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> You made your point.<eos> I was drunk, April.<eos> I get it.<eos> - I don't need you to monitor everything...<eos> - I'm not!<eos> I am just trying to come up with a fix for our patient, regardless of the fact that you don't even want me here.<eos> And yet you're still here.<eos> 'Cause you and my mother are such good friends that she chose you instead of asking me who I want.

The distinguished-hippie- former-surgeon Dr. Avery, who slings hash at the local diner?<eos> He's the whole reason we're here!<eos> No, I came here to help a patient.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> And worse yet, don't lie to Caroline and her parents.<eos> We are only here 'cause of your freakin' father, and now that kid is gonna die.<eos> - Night-night, baby.<eos> - Sleep well.<eos> Be good for Grandma, okay?<eos> Love you.

Could still show up.<eos> Pick something...<eos> uh, birthday, graduation.<eos> Show the hell up.<eos> That's what I was gonna say... all that.<eos> Then, uh...<eos> Then he...<eos> He looked me right in the eye.<eos> He doesn't know his own son.<eos> So make him know you.
Incredible, huh?<eos> Chicory.<eos> Listen to me, yapping away like some kind of idiot.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Anything, everything.<eos> I know nothing.<eos> Here.<eos> Here we go.<eos> God, it's good to see you.<eos> Look at you.
You okay?<eos> We are gonna do this.<eos> We're gonna do it, all right?<eos> You let me help my sister, she needs me.<eos> I know.<eos> That's part of a problem with twins.<eos> You really only need one of them.<eos> Lucky shot for a mutation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I survived you.

- Thanks for your help.<eos> - See you tonight.<eos> You'll be great, Sarah.<eos> Bye!<eos> Ah, I was meant to go grocery shopping yesterday.<eos> You're gonna have to buy something again.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - No, I'm an idiot.<eos> Felix came home from New York last night, right?<eos> Yeah, he's gonna be here after school, take you to Alison's, and I'll meet you guys after my test, yeah?
Anyway I'll see you in a bit.<eos> Okay.<eos> You've never even taken responsibility for yourself, Sarah.<eos> How are you gonna be responsible for two?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You said it was my choice, didn't you?<eos> Yes, but your choice does not a mother make.<eos> You need to show me you can be still.<eos> And I will be here for you.<eos> I will support you, whatever it takes.

He did a poop?<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> It's always when I eat he poops.<eos> - Sarah, hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You, um...<eos> You just got here?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> I've been trying to find the right words.<eos> - For you, for Siobhan.
Do you know what Helena gives the twins for toys?<eos> Rocks.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, no it's true.<eos> I, um...<eos> I had to take them away.<eos> Christ, serious?<eos> Thank God.<eos> She needs a little guidance, so...<eos> If you're not too busy, now that you're done your test, it would be nice to see you a little more often. Yeah?
Lying to my own kid.<eos> Same shit.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> I...<eos> I carry around all of these mistakes...<eos> I don't know how to be happy.<eos> There's no one left to fight, and I'm still a shit mum.<eos> You know the other day,<eos> Gemma was driving me so crazy.<eos> I screamed at her, I said, "If you don't clean up your room, I am going to string you up by your thumbs and stuff your dirty damn sock balls in your mouth."
Hey, that sounds nice, honey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I like it.<eos> Not exactly a striptease.<eos> Oh, I think it just turned into one.<eos> Oh, what's this?<eos> Oh, I like it.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Whoops!<eos> I love you.
Thank you.<eos> I like it.<eos> Not exactly a striptease.<eos> Oh, I think it just turned into one.<eos> Oh, what's this?<eos> Oh, I like it.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Whoops!<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
Nice, okay.<eos> You're joining them.<eos> Where's my fishing rod?<eos> Huh?<eos> Here.<eos> Darling, how many times do I have to tell you there are no fish at Shite Beach.<eos> - Mmm-hmm, there are.<eos> - Yeah, there are.<eos> There are shite fish.<eos> Mmm-hmm, and they're gonna eat you up.
I'm so sorry to be calling with, notsogood news.<eos> But I'll go ahead and just rip off the bandaid.<eos> I'm afraid your application for taxexempt status for taxexempt status has hit a bump, well, more than a bump.<eos> It's going to be... more complicated than I thought.<eos> I'm sorry if I overpromised, but they're telling me it's a nogo.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hope you're great.<eos> Um, bye then.<eos> Aren't you busy in the city?<eos> Yeah, I needed to see you. Yeah, I needed to see you.
No matter what you're wearing.<eos> Um... I'm gonna take this outside. Um...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> My parents are just inside.<eos> Are you... you going somewhere?<eos> It's work. It's work.<eos> There's a fundraiser in the city.<eos> You going with Cal?<eos> What do you want, Eddie?<eos> Look, I was worried about you.
It's terrible.<eos> Just terrible.<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> I don't want to. We were able to bring safe water directly<eos> We were able to bring safe water directly to the residents of Clarksville, but hopefully that's just the beginning.<eos> We want to be advocates for a longterm solution.<eos> But that's gonna require more resources.<eos> Suzanne, Matthew, I'm so glad you could come.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Listen, I have a question for you.
Cal, you're sorry, right?<eos> You thought you had a big fish reeled in, didn't you?<eos> Well, you just lost our business.<eos> I am not a business person.<eos> I am a religious leader.<eos> I don't think you're a leader at all.<eos> John.<eos> Looks like someone had fun tonight at least.<eos> So the evening wasn't a total lost.<eos> Should get you home.
Really?<eos> She was a few minutes ago.<eos> She was a few minutes ago.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I did not like that tonight.<eos> Him just trotting us out in front of all those people, his little success stories. His little success stories.<eos> That didn't feel bad to you?
Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I did not like that tonight.<eos> Him just trotting us out in front of all those people, his little success stories. His little success stories.<eos> That didn't feel bad to you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just so used to feeling ashamed of everything that's happened to me.<eos> Felt good to have someone show me off.<eos> Be proud of what I've been through.<eos> I don't want to take that away from you.

I got it, okay.<eos> I just<eos> I got it. It's...<eos> For you. Last night...<eos> We all made mistakes.<eos> Myself included.<eos> I got us into this financial mess, and when I had an opportunity to help get us out, I... II handled it poorly.<eos> But I've been thinking and making alternate plans.<eos> There are people we can reach out to to call on before we let the counsel know.<eos> I could turn you in, for Silas.
Here.<eos> In the city.<eos> What'd your mom say about it?<eos> She gets it.<eos> Oror she will.<eos> Eventually.<eos> She can't be... happy to see you go.<eos> Is her happiness the most important thing?<eos> I mean, I don't remember... her being happy being a rung on The Ladder. Her being happy being a rung on The Ladder.<eos> Well, her happiness is important to me and it is important to you.
What, about the chocolate?<eos> Please.<eos> But I don't. Not at all.<eos> This needed to happen.<eos> Hey. Don't let it in.<eos> Whatever real life thought you were thinking, Whatever real life thought you were thinking, don'tdon't let it in.<eos> Okay?<eos> Have a moment?<eos> So you talked to my mom? You honor The Movement with your dedication.<eos> We should honor you in return.

I don't know that a refrigerator qualifies as special favor.<eos> Thank you for letting me know.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> What're we doing here, Sarah?<eos> I don't know. You feeling guilty?<eos> You feeling guilty?<eos> About the girl, the woman, that you see?<eos> Why are why are you here?<eos> What do you mean, why am I here?<eos> I'm here because of you.
Thank you for letting me know.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> What're we doing here, Sarah?<eos> I don't know. You feeling guilty?<eos> You feeling guilty?<eos> About the girl, the woman, that you see?<eos> Why are why are you here?<eos> What do you mean, why am I here?<eos> I'm here because of you.<eos> 'Cause I saw you and now I can't stop seeing you.
Thank you.<eos> You haven't seen Kodiak, have you?<eos> No.<eos> You are clean.<eos> You are yourself before the neoself.<eos> I can't.<eos> We are not our Transgressions.<eos> I can't You don't understand.<eos> If you can't feel the Light's forgiveness, If you can't feel the Light's forgiveness, then I can't because of what I did to you. You had to do those things.<eos> If the man you murdered came back to murder you, what would you do?
Can you help me with something? Cut it off.<eos> What?<eos> Hawk, I was kidding before, I don't really think. Hawk, I was kidding before, I don't really think you're too high on yourself or anything.<eos> II get that.<eos> But... this isn't me anymore.<eos> But it's so pretty.<eos> Yeah. You really want me to do this?<eos> I've lost vision for The Movement.<eos> I'm stuck, and I'm having trouble moving forward.<eos> What do you think is holding you back? What do you think is holding you back?
I want you to close your eyes, Sarah. I want you to think about Eddie.<eos> I want you to imagine him.<eos> Hold his image.<eos> You have it?<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> His beautiful eyes.<eos> Looking into me.<eos> Good.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now he's going to turn away from you.
How do you feel?<eos> All right, I'm...<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good money.<eos> Hey, I think that's the morphine talking.<eos> Are you going through a dry spell?<eos> shut up.<eos> So you're scheming on guys passed out in the hospital?<eos> Something's wrong, Tasha.<eos> I was worried about you.
You got people out.<eos> 12 agents are dead, Kurt.<eos> None of us saw that coming.<eos> None of us.<eos> Shepherd...<eos> Shepherd never wanted to destroy the power grid.<eos> No, she wanted to destroy the team.<eos> Yeah, but not all of us.<eos> By faking Allie's emergency, she...<eos> she was protecting you.
- We'll find her.<eos> - Roman might be able to help.<eos> Maybe he knows where Borden could've taken her.<eos> What?<eos> You're still in contact with Roman?<eos> While you were raiding the compound,<eos> Shepherd had me tied up in front of a projector.<eos> She wanted me to watch you die.<eos> And then she wanted Roman to kill me, but he couldn't.<eos> He chose you over her.
How could Borden do this?<eos> Have we got an APB out on his car?<eos> Yes, but no sign of it yet.<eos> It's Roman, he's finally picking up.<eos> Hello?<eos> Roman, please don't hang up, okay?<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - I'm your sister.<eos> Are you that woman from the car?<eos> Yes, but I didn't shoot you, okay?
Yes, but I didn't shoot you, okay?<eos> I want to keep you safe.<eos> Can you tell me where you are?<eos> What the hell happened to me?<eos> I promise, I'm going to tell you everything, but it's gonna have to be in person.<eos> Roman, look in your pocket.<eos> There's a coin in there, it's a very special coin.<eos> I gave it to you when we were little.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> Because I know you better than anyone, and I know exactly what you're going through right now, and it's hell.
Sir, are you all right?<eos> Take the girl, get out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> Hey there, Roman.<eos> Your sister sent me to pick you up.<eos> You know my sister?<eos> She's worried about you.<eos> It's not safe here.<eos> I should wait here for my sister.<eos> I'm gonna take you to her.
Go.<eos> Hey there, Roman.<eos> Your sister sent me to pick you up.<eos> You know my sister?<eos> She's worried about you.<eos> It's not safe here.<eos> I should wait here for my sister.<eos> I'm gonna take you to her.<eos> Roman, it's fine.<eos> We gotta get you out of here.
Everything.<eos> Including that I ZIP-ed him.<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> - Tasha.<eos> You guys can stay here and talk to the forgetful terrorist, but I'm going to go find a real lead.<eos> Jane, you can't tell your brother that you ZIP-ed him.<eos> How can he trust me if I lie to him?<eos> Well, how can he trust you if you don't?<eos> Think about it, Jane.<eos> When you came out of that bag, how'd you feel about the people that put you in there?
- You're crazy.<eos> - Tasha.<eos> You guys can stay here and talk to the forgetful terrorist, but I'm going to go find a real lead.<eos> Jane, you can't tell your brother that you ZIP-ed him.<eos> How can he trust me if I lie to him?<eos> Well, how can he trust you if you don't?<eos> Think about it, Jane.<eos> When you came out of that bag, how'd you feel about the people that put you in there?<eos> You hated them.<eos> He will hate you for doing this, too.
For your own sake, just...<eos> Stop this, it's inhumane.<eos> Please, a perforated eardrum heals.<eos> Meaning I can do this again and again.<eos> So... answer me this.<eos> What does the FBI know about me?<eos> About my organization?<eos> What do you know about our microchip?<eos> I know you're gonna kill me, so just do it already.<eos> I don't want to kill you.
I will do whatever it takes to get you reinstated.<eos> I'll talk to the head of the NSA.<eos> Yeah, and they'll deny any knowledge of me and Zero Division.<eos> Just... just go find Patterson, okay?<eos> What do you know about...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Are you slow or something?<eos> I think I made it pretty clear I'm not answering any of your questions.<eos> I'm loyal... unlike your children.<eos> First, Jane turned on you, and now it sounds like Roman did, too.
Weller!<eos> Her foot's trapped!<eos> Weller, he's getting away.<eos> No, he's not. I'll get him.<eos> You two get Patterson!<eos> Patterson?<eos> Here!<eos> You're okay.<eos> We're here now.<eos> Let's get you out of here.
You know me better than anyone else.<eos> It... it makes sense, Tasha.<eos> We're friends.<eos> That's all.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I thought you might want a warm meal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is only temporary.<eos> I promise.<eos> I... I have something else for you.
- So, you're saying she's hot?<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> So, you just fuck anything, then, right?<eos> Is that your deal?<eos> You just go around delivering meat lovers pizzas willy-nilly wherever you go?<eos> No, no, no, I did not say that.<eos> - Didn't do it a second time?<eos> - I didn't do a first time. - Why not?<eos> She didn't ask you?
No, I didn't say that.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> So, you just fuck anything, then, right?<eos> Is that your deal?<eos> You just go around delivering meat lovers pizzas willy-nilly wherever you go?<eos> No, no, no, I did not say that.<eos> - Didn't do it a second time?<eos> - I didn't do a first time. - Why not?<eos> She didn't ask you?<eos> - No. So, she asked you to fuck her?
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...<eos> There is a fundamental flaw in how we are teaching our residents.<eos> And we have got to fix this.<eos> Who is Dr. Eliza Minnick?<eos> Minnick's kind of a legend.<eos> You'll just be observing the first few days anyway, getting a sense of how it works.<eos> I thought you two were working together.<eos> Bailey, who's running this program... me or Eliza Minnick?<eos> She thinks she's the new Residency Director, like she's Richard Webber's boss.<eos> You don't want to hear my opinions about a program that I built, that I trained you in.
You don't want to hear my opinions about a program that I built, that I trained you in.<eos> I made a decision about what is best for the hospital moving forward.<eos> Look at that hand.<eos> This is assault.<eos> A pediatric surgeon walking around this hospital.<eos> Do you realize what happens if you're convicted of a felony? !<eos> Mer, the trial's tomorrow.<eos> It could be our last chance for like 8, 10 years.<eos> Jo Wilson isn't my real name.<eos> That's why I couldn't marry you.
- Just get him inside.<eos> As soon as I'm done with this, hang two more units.<eos> - Murphy, where's my art line?<eos> - I'm in.<eos> All right, bandage, and get me a blood gas.<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Mindy? Mindy, it's Dr. Robbins.<eos> - Can you talk to me? - Ow. Ow.<eos> What... What's happening?<eos> You were in a car accident and you were pretty badly injured, but we're checking you out now.
I'm... I'm... I...<eos> Say hi to her for me, okay?<eos> Oh, honey, your face.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> It was me.<eos> In the other car...<eos> I hit you.
It was me.<eos> In the other car...<eos> I hit you.<eos> What?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Okay, Bryan, we need to get started.<eos> Oh, no, wait, wait...<eos> Mindy, you're gonna feel a little drowsy...<eos> Mindy, I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you... so much.
You're not okay.<eos> What?<eos> That hockey kid today?<eos> He dropped a lung.<eos> We had to take him up to the O.R.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was in Path.<eos> I was getting a culture.<eos> Come on. You've been in your head all day.<eos> It's fine, 'cause I covered for you, but... talk to someone.
I need to wash off this day.<eos> So you keep going.<eos> You don't give up.<eos> You stand tall.<eos> You fight.<eos> - Aah!<eos> Alex? ! - What the hell, Mer?<eos> Alex?<eos> You always show up to save the day.<eos> Wait. I've been looking for you all day.
Everybody wants privacy for themselves.<eos> Do you have any idea how many places I've been looking for you?
- Absolutely not.<eos> No, he's, uh... great.<eos> - DeLuca.<eos> - This case is a slam dunk.<eos> It's a slam freakin' dunk.<eos> I'm sorry to waste your time.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Andrew called off the trial?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - For you?
But I am a dragon.<eos> I'm your dragon.<eos> And you should feel free to unleash me, should you wish to.<eos> Call me if you need backup.<eos> I'm a dragon, too.<eos> Dr. Reynolds, extension 2216.<eos> Dr. Reynolds...<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Boy, am I glad to see you.<eos> - Mwah! - Oh, I didn't expect you till tonight.
Hey, what happened last night?<eos> Do we have all the attendings with us?<eos> Uh, well, Hunt...<eos> I'm not sure where he stands yet.<eos> Well, what about Riggs?<eos> Uh, Riggs, we can ask after he's done talking to your mom.<eos> Whenever he's done doing what?<eos> - Talking to your mother.<eos> - My what?<eos> Your mom, your mother, uh, the one that raised and fed you?
And you.<eos> - Well, there she is.<eos> - Yes!<eos> I was just sitting here, and in walked your...<eos> Richard.<eos> - So, you met my mother.<eos> - I did.<eos> We've been having the nicest chat.<eos> That's so great.<eos> Well, um, I, uh, just came to take you to your appointment, so, um, if you don't want to be late, we should...
Webber was the program since I've been here.<eos> Really, Karev?<eos> The second I give you your job back?<eos> Look, since you've been here.<eos> Get out of my office before I change my mind.<eos> Go!<eos> Just promise me you won't turn her into a fish-lipped monster with an immobile forehead.<eos> That's not something I do.<eos> I'm just reminding you that you swore a sacred oath as a physician to give sound medical counsel to women who are already beautiful.<eos> To you.
- Go.<eos> I'll text you when I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, firstly, I do agree with your daughter.<eos> You look terrific.<eos> But that doesn't mean there aren't some things that you might like to change.<eos> So, I'd like to start with just a brief conversation so that I can get a better sense of...<eos> I always taught my daughter, if she wanted to know something, don't ask the Internet.<eos> Find the smartest person in the room.<eos> And if they're not smarter than you, find another room.
She makes some good lasagna, though.<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> Bailey hired an interim chief of General?<eos> Bailey replaced you?<eos> With who?<eos> Kepner?<eos> Kepner.<eos> Amelia?<eos> Every day you don't open the door, it gets a little easier to stay inside.<eos> I can't pull you out anymore.
Are you seeing this?<eos> Bailey hired an interim chief of General?<eos> Bailey replaced you?<eos> With who?<eos> Kepner?<eos> Kepner.<eos> Amelia?<eos> Every day you don't open the door, it gets a little easier to stay inside.<eos> I can't pull you out anymore.<eos> No one can open this door but you.
When we were in our car, on the way to the seaport.<eos> Matty kept complaining about his stomach.<eos> It's been off and on for the last few days, but it kept getting worse, so we just turned around and came back here.<eos> I mean, it's probably just a stomach bug, right?<eos> We're going on a cruise.<eos> Ooh, that's fun.<eos> It's called an Explorer Cruise.<eos> It's all-inclusive, three ports of call.<eos> And they have rock-climbing walls and even movie nights.<eos> And they teach you to surf right on deck!
- Maggie!<eos> - I thought you were with us.<eos> I thought you were with Richard.<eos> And then you go and do this?<eos> I took a job!<eos> It was an opportunity!<eos> It's aiding the enemy!<eos> I'm not saying I agree with what Bailey did...<eos> But you are saying that it's not a deal-breaker!<eos> Not for you.
Then you fired Grey.<eos> I suspended Grey.<eos> Does the umbilical port get closed with a deep or superficial closure?<eos> - Both.<eos> - Both. - Okay.<eos> You know, pretty soon, you're gonna find yourself out of teachers.<eos> It's tough to be a leader when there's no one to lead.<eos> I'm not afraid to be unpopular, - for the good of the hospital.<eos> - Oh, that's not you.<eos> I know that Catherine put you up to this.
You chose wrong.<eos> But it's not too late.<eos> You could still resign.<eos> You could still tell her that you made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't make a mistake.<eos> I have a duty to this hospital.<eos> My chief asked me to step up, so I...<eos> Did she?<eos> Or was that my mom again?<eos> Telling Bailey that she should pick you.
What was his name?<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.<eos> What... What... What do I do next?<eos> Okay, so, if you think you're gonna lose it, then I'll jump in.<eos> I think I'll be fine.<eos> I just...<eos> I guess I'm off the hook.<eos> I have a tip for you.
It's Karev.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Welcome back, Karev.<eos> My name's finally on the O.R. schedule again, and I'm not even allowed to do any of the surgery.<eos> Yeah, welcome to phase two.<eos> Prep the patients and run labs?<eos> That's resident scut.<eos> Sucks.<eos> Well, the good news is I'll be right there with you.
You got to interrupt her. She'll never stop.<eos> I'm not the one in charge.<eos> They are.<eos> If you don't have anymore questions, then Dr. Edwards and I will see you in surgery.<eos> Uh, just one thing...<eos> Tell my son it is mandatory to kiss his mother before she goes under the knife for him.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - It's mandatory, dude.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, Doctors Karev and Webber will be in in a minute to prep you for surgery.
You hear me?<eos> I have rights!<eos> Hey, why don't we sit down?<eos> Why'd you bring him here?<eos> - I'm sor...<eos> - Why would you do that? !<eos> Cynthia, do you want to sit down?<eos> - Hey, big transplant today.<eos> - Don't talk to me.<eos> - I'm mad at you.
I...<eos> I wanted him to stay right where he was.<eos> I wanted Minnick to add value, but she wouldn't work with him.<eos> So, you sided with Minnick and tossed Richard aside?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I had a choice to make, Grey, and I didn't want to make it, because, yes, Dr. Webber built this place.<eos> But I have to keep building it.<eos> So I do that by asking myself 100 times a day<eos> "What would Richard Webber do?"<eos> But how did Eliza Minnick win you over so quickly?
From... from who?<eos> It was an anonymous directed donation.<eos> It's a perfect match, and Chris is responding really well.<eos> I can't believe it...<eos> That people are... are that good...<eos> That they can be so good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, it looks like she's responding to meds.<eos> That's good.<eos> The family has you to thank... for that pacemaker idea.
Don't "nun" me.<eos> The nun detail was a little bit much, but please.<eos> Please. Come on.<eos> I need you.<eos> You're the best.<eos> And don't tell me that you don't miss the O.R.<eos> Just one little clip, and you can scratch that itch.<eos> Just one little clip.<eos> You'll be in and out.<eos> And I'll make sure that Owen doesn't see you.
I mean, are you really telling me this is good management, Mom?<eos> You think this is good for morale?<eos> Maybe if you hadn't talked the entire staff into forming a coup, you might have listened.<eos> The patient getting coagulopathic.<eos> Mayo scissors.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You have no clue about management.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot you got a new minion in the deal.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What is it you want to learn from my mom exactly... how to get an entire hospital to turn against you in a day or...
Uh, page someone from neuro, please.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> It's fine. I'm... I'm...<eos> Well, this looks like it's gonna be an uphill climb, and if you're not actually back...<eos> Owen, stop.<eos> Edwards, show me the skull fracture.<eos> I just spent the day trapped on a case with my wife and Jackson and April.<eos> - Yikes.<eos> - Yeah. So, if I may, I would love to take you up on your offer, after all, and stay at your place, enjoy some good company, and get a good night's sleep.
Rodney...<eos> Maybe you should go.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll come back in a bit.<eos> - Just shoot me a text and...<eos> - No.<eos> I know you meant well, but my father is...<eos> I can't.<eos> It's all I'll ever think about when I look at you.
This is why you called me all the way in here at this hour?<eos> He went behind my back.<eos> He lied to me.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> We ready?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Look, I don't trust him.<eos> I don't want him in the O.R. with me.<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Dr. Karev has raised a complaint against you.
So, what was that?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're just giving in to this new way of teaching?<eos> I was teaching a capable resident, same as I always have, long before Minnick.<eos> No. No. In there, that was...<eos> Look, we can win this thing, all right?<eos> There are strings that I can pull, you know?<eos> - I have a voice.<eos> - Jackson, don't do it.<eos> It'll tear you and your mother apart.
Jim loves Dad.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Pam, it was an accident.<eos> Uh, which way?<eos> How could you do that?<eos> How can you do this to somebody you care about?<eos> Jackson, you need to stop this foolishness.<eos> What?<eos> I just need to know.<eos> I need to know if business is really that much more important to you than family.
What?<eos> I just need to know.<eos> I need to know if business is really that much more important to you than family.<eos> This has nothing to do with family.<eos> Of course it has to do with family.<eos> Look, I get it, all right?<eos> Business is business.<eos> If you need to fire someone or replace them, do it.<eos> But if it's someone you love, you just...<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?
I am so happy with who you are.<eos> I am.<eos> I just wish you were, too.<eos> Saved the baby.<eos> Huh? Excuse me?<eos> The... The baby, the one that Karev and I were...<eos> Anyway, the kid's alive.<eos> Oh, well, that's great news.<eos> Okay. Now you're the one being the jerk.<eos> Well, because Alex was right about you.
About you?<eos> Actually, I think a lot of things.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No banter. No more quips.<eos> I'll tell you what I think.<eos> I think about you... a lot.<eos> Okay? I can't stop.<eos> And I'm telling you I am in... if you are.<eos> I am in this.<eos> So, I'm just... I'm just gonna ask you outright.
You can't sleep?<eos> Wide awake, all hours.<eos> This chair's the only place my stomach and back can get comfortable, so...<eos> What are you doing up?<eos> I have three kids.<eos> I don't sleep.<eos> Motherhood.<eos> I always wanted more kids so Maggie could have a sister or a brother.<eos> I was worried when she wanted to move out here.<eos> She was happy in Boston, but... I'm really glad she found you.
And we would work to prevent that using other options.<eos> Sure, pump her with more chemo.<eos> Well, a second ago, you were worried about stopping her chemo.<eos> Just take out the met!<eos> You're asking me to perform a procedure...<eos> You can barely see it on the scan.<eos> ...that will not only cause her pain, but put her at risk<eos> - It's my mother!<eos> - for many complications.<eos> I'm asking you to think beyond the standard and typical.
And it's successful?<eos> The trial's next phase was rushed into approval due to favorable outcomes.<eos> And your mom meets the criteria?<eos> Once we remove that met that's obstructing her bile duct, her liver enzymes will go down, and she's in.<eos> Um, Meredith doesn't feel that surgery is wise.<eos> Meredith is no longer on the case.<eos> And now that I know about this trial, there is even more reason to do the surgery.<eos> And I'd like one of you to do it.<eos> You know, um, I think we should read up on the trial... Mm-hmm.<eos> Does that sound good to you?
It's okay, Mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I just heard... an esophageal tear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hopefully, it's contained and I don't have to open her chest.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I should do the EGD.<eos> You're too close.<eos> Go take care of Maggie.<eos> Let me do this for you.
You need to shake it up a little.<eos> Be a little lazy or a little slutty.<eos> Make a mistake.<eos> I have a job.<eos> Well, you're never gonna look back and say,<eos> "I wish I'd been more uptight."<eos> Okay, Mom, you have to be still, or else I can't finish this.<eos> And stop always saying what everyone wants to hear.<eos> Tell someone off.<eos> It's good for 'em and better for you.
It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Your father gave it to me.<eos> He'd want you to have it, too.<eos> So, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want you to fall in love.<eos> And it has to be somebody who's worthy.<eos> Find a decent man who loves you just a little more than you love him.
Jodie Bashar.<eos> Lili Brenner.<eos> Maia...<eos> Maia Rindell?<eos> How are you doing, Maia?<eos> Good.<eos> No, no, no, here, you take these.<eos> Say hello to your parents for me, will you?<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh, by the way, this came for you this morning.
And, uh, I'll check in with Diane later.<eos> No, Mom-Mom, it's okay.<eos> Love you, sweetheart.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee, Lyman,<eos> Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan...<eos> Enough with the lilies.<eos> You know, some of us have allergies.<eos> Oh, I'm actually a new associate here.<eos> Good for you.
Your parents called.<eos> Oh, God, I told them not to.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> They're worried you might be being ostracized.<eos> Oh, they have got to stop. Really...<eos> It's okay.<eos> There is an empty office downstairs that I can...<eos> No, no, please. Oh, come on,<eos> I-I don't want anything.<eos> come on, let your godmother spoil you a little bit.
Diane became an assistant district attorney.<eos> She made her reputation as someone who fought hard for the truth, and after five years, she was recruited into...<eos> Oh, my God, was I ever that young?<eos> I can't believe you're leaving us, Diane.<eos> Oh, not in spirit.<eos> If you ever think of coming back, you don't go anywhere else first.<eos> I promise, Renee.<eos> Wait a minute... you promised me.<eos> Oh, Ethan.<eos> We have partners I'd throw out the door to make room for you.
They've impounded our computers and they're looking for documents on your parents' business.<eos> I think it's about your dad.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen, can you put that down please?<eos> Ma'am, we need you to get off the phone.<eos> I'm an assistant state's attorney, sir. I have the right to use my cell phone.<eos> We'll discuss your rights after you hang up your phone.<eos> Maia, I have to call you back.<eos> Dad, the FBI are searching my apartment.<eos> They say it's about you.
But I steered people to them.<eos> The Women's Fund, all their money.<eos> I even told Emily's List to put their 401k there.<eos> I know there's a lot for you to process, Diane, but we need to think about a few things and act fast.<eos> The escrow? Yes.<eos> There will be a penalty, but we must get out of it now.<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> And you need to delay your retirement.<eos> The government might freeze your account and put you on a living-wage budget.
Look, if you want to stay on as an emeritus, we can discuss that.<eos> And lose my equity?<eos> What is to keep me from taking my clients out the door with me?<eos> Where would you take them?<eos> I just brought Cook County and their 32 million a year to you.<eos> Let's see how you feel when you lose them.<eos> You're her, aren't you?<eos> No.<eos> You're a Rindell.<eos> I lost my retirement because of you.
Thank you for coming in early.<eos> No problem.<eos> This is the bi-yearly review?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How'd I do?<eos> You kicked ass.<eos> You have the most billable hours on the floor.<eos> All of the partners praise your work.<eos> Lucca, we don't want to lose you.<eos> We'd like to move you to a bigger office and put you on the partner track.

Put some lights on in here.<eos> You going out?<eos> To get my hair done.<eos> Michael won't see me at the salon anymore, but... he does it at his home.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'll bring home dinner.<eos> I love you.
Your Honor, this joker is an anti-Semitic provocateur.<eos> No, he is not.<eos> And-and this is just an amateurish attempt to try and undermine some damaging testimony.<eos> What-what I find offensive is that you think the judge could be so easily manipulated.<eos> She's right, Mr. Dincon.<eos> Go sit down.<eos> Your motion is sustained, miss.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Thank you, Maia.<eos> I didn't want to push it, but I really wanted to see you.
I'm glad you're here, too, Diane.<eos> - That...<eos> - That must be...<eos> Rupert.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Thank you, Maia.<eos> For what?<eos> Not judging us, not judging me.<eos> Do you love Dad?<eos> We had troubles and, um... we never wanted to bother you with them, but, um...
Do you love Dad?<eos> We had troubles and, um... we never wanted to bother you with them, but, um...<eos> Yes, I love your dad.<eos> This will be a hard time.<eos> The trial?<eos> No.<eos> Your father's agreed to a 35-year plea.<eos> What?<eos> When? Tonight.<eos> That's why he called you to come home.
And your mom... and everyone.<eos> Everyone knew.<eos> We paid off the SEC.<eos> We paid off anyone who got suspicious.<eos> That's Rupert.<eos> I'm...<eos> I am so sorry... to disappoint you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You never could.<eos> I love you.
The video.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's... let's not.<eos> What?<eos> I was talking to you like you were eight years old and you're... - you're Sully or something.<eos> - Diane, please.<eos> I don't like it when people... make a big deal.<eos> I represent unscrupulous people, and you... you save children.<eos> You...<eos> I was calling you to ask you to dinner.
I don't like it when people... make a big deal.<eos> I represent unscrupulous people, and you... you save children.<eos> You...<eos> I was calling you to ask you to dinner.<eos> - Are you sure you'll be all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Come in.<eos> Stay the night.<eos> Don't drive back to the city.<eos> I love you.
Bitch.<eos> Fucking bitch.<eos> I know where you live.<eos> I know where your family...<eos> This is for Maia Rindell.<eos> I'm gonna rape you and your dyke girl...
See you tomorrow.<eos> Bye, Mia.<eos> It was just was a scare.<eos> Dr. Trotter found another lump.<eos> But he thinks it's nothing.<eos> Good.<eos> Is that why you called?<eos> Yes, I mean, I was told the cancer had spread to your lymph nodes.<eos> Well, that's the fear.<eos> It's good to see you, Maia.
Dad, you still haven't done that?<eos> They haven't updated their paperwork since Joe was born.<eos> Uh, God forbid something bad should happen to them... we don't even know who'd they want to raise Joe.<eos> Will you stop scaring her?<eos> I spend more money on eyelashes than most of you do on health care.<eos> Fine, we'll do it today.<eos> What better way to start the new year than by preparing for the worst?<eos> Speaking of alive dads,<eos> - there's mine!<eos> - So good to see you! - Oh!
Yeah, Lorraine used to bring out - the holy terror in Phil.<eos> - Oh. It seemed like he wanted to be spanked by her.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> How long has this been going on?<eos> Well, we reconnected earlier this year on jury duty.<eos> I was the lone holdout - on a triple homicide case.<eos> - Mm. You can just feel - when someone is innocent, you know?<eos> Mm-hmm. But Lorraine said she'd go out to lunch with me if I changed my vote, so here we are.<eos> - Phil, did... did you ever dream...<eos> - No. Last time I saw you, you came up to here.
She did five minutes on my nose at Thanksgiving.<eos> I mean, it's a little big, but to say that it has its own zip code, that was too much for me.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - No, that is...<eos> "If I ever go missing or am found dead, "it was my husband"?<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Ay! Calm down.<eos> It was when we had our first big fight.<eos> Of course I knew that you were not going to kill me.<eos> I was just going to run away and frame you.
What?<eos> No way.<eos> Yep.<eos> There's only one thing shaped like that.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> There's a million things...<eos> Rubik's Cube, sewing kit, souvenir tire keychain from Smokey-Top.<eos> I can't think of anything that's not shaped like that.<eos> Let's assume for a moment that I am right and that was a ring box.<eos> Maybe it's worth exploring why the idea of your dad remarrying is setting you off like this.
Or she pretended to be so that I wouldn't have to admit how scared I was.<eos> I have a hunch that she's not the only one who's trying to protect my feelings today.<eos> You seem to be rambling, son.<eos> When you hugged Claire earlier, she felt a ring box in your pocket.<eos> What?<eos> That wasn't a ring box.<eos> It was...<eos> I'm so old and confused.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm not gonna say seeing you with Lorraine wasn't a little bit weird for me.
Why is there a blue turkey going into the house?<eos> It's a peacock.<eos> It's really plowing through the Cheez-Its.<eos> Oh, we forgot to put the apple the new pig's mouth.<eos> Oh, just leave it.<eos> Now that's your answer to everything, isn't it?<eos> I deserve that.<eos> I was a fool to think I could get through this without you bringing up the way I left.<eos> Well, you broke my heart.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you, Cameron.
Hi, Uncle Jax.<eos> Maia.<eos> How are you these days?<eos> Good.<eos> Very good.<eos> Glad things are going so well for you, Mom.
No, Henry, no.<eos> Henry, no!<eos> Come on, come on, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good-bye, Dad.<eos> Good-bye, sweetheart.<eos> Maia, what did he say?<eos> Maia, what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He just said... "I love you."
Go ahead.<eos> I like extra onions, peppers.<eos> Done.<eos> You're losing.<eos> This one's a slam dunk.<eos> Good.<eos> I like helping men with their self-esteem issues.<eos> Good lawyer?<eos> Very talented.<eos> So how far does a smile get you?
- Stop pretending, Ted.<eos> It has your photographs, the photographs I let you take of me.<eos> - You linked them to... - Okay, Maia,<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about, but why don't you make an appointment...<eos> She wants to talk to you now.<eos> So this is your new girlfriend?<eos> No, but that shouldn't matter.<eos> I mean, I'm not gay, but I could be.<eos> It's harassment, Ted.<eos> I'm a lawyer, and I could sue you for everything you have.
- It's right here.<eos> - That's fake news, Roger.<eos> I don't care what it is; it was on my Facebook page.<eos> "$45,000 missing from liquor store."<eos> That doesn't even make sense... I work here, I don't work at a liquor store.<eos> But it's your name and your picture.<eos> Look. Roger, any hacker could do that; I could do that.<eos> Please don't let me go.<eos> You got to go talk to the police, Ted.<eos> It says that they're looking for you.
Can you show me on this doll where he touched you? It was everywhere.
I picked up, but you hung up.<eos> No.<eos> No, that must've been an accidental dial.<eos> I'm a... think my phone is...<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I was gonna call you anyway, um...<eos> I have a favor.<eos> I've agreed to give a speech on ballistics to the police union.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that doesn't sound like you.
But the problem is, I'm an associate.<eos> I don't control my own fate.<eos> Come by tonight.<eos> I'll make Irish coffees.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.<eos> I really have to go now.<eos> Diane is calling me.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> "Think we wouldn't chop you up, too, and do the s..."
Diane is calling me.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> "Think we wouldn't chop you up, too, and do the s..."<eos> Wait, stop.<eos> Read the whole thing again.<eos> - Read-read that again.<eos> - Okay.<eos> "You're such a hypocrite."<eos> You chop up baby parts and drop them in dumpsters.<eos> Why don't you think we wouldn't chop you up, too, and do the same?
For me, it'd be Zendaya.<eos> Threat.<eos> Clearly a threat.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> He didn't actually threaten to rape her.<eos> It seems to me he's talking about a movie.<eos> Are you seriously defending this?<eos> No, I'm not defending this.<eos> I'm making a legal distinction between a threat, a real threat, and a crude, misogynistic comment.<eos> You're saying the person has to say, "I want to rape you"?

"I want to" instead of "I'm going to."<eos> Actually, we can do anything we want.<eos> Mr. Gross owns these sites.<eos> He can legally set whatever terms he wants.<eos> Yes, but the terms have to be fair.<eos> Okay, so, here we go.<eos> - "I want to..."<eos> - Rape you.<eos> I want to come to your house and ra...<eos> If this were another century, I could fuck you until you bl...

There was a baby in a stroller.<eos> Okay, what do you want to know?<eos> - How do you become an investigator?<eos> - Get a license.<eos> I can't investigate unless I have a license?<eos> Well, you can, but you'll get caught.<eos> God, that's what's killing initiative in this country.<eos> Everything needs a license.<eos> Well, you can always assist a licensed investigator.<eos> Like you?
- Well, then, maybe I'll come to you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Let me see if I can arrange another night.<eos> Maia, please, we need to talk.<eos> Tell me on the phone.<eos> No, it's better if we do it in person.<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> Let me see what I can do.<eos> Love you.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, anything you want to talk about?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, come on, it's your dad.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> It's just...<eos> I can never quite tell where that line is, you know?<eos> Between the legal and the illegal.<eos> What issue?<eos> He asked you about work?
Shout her down, embarrass her.<eos> Why do you need funds for that?<eos> Why do you need funds for that dress?<eos> Because I don't want to end up in that jacket.<eos> I will see you in court.<eos> Again, why do you need funds to shut someone down?<eos> I can't think of anything funny, so I decline to reply.<eos> Well, after you wrote that, these posts were sent to Ms. Mills.<eos> - "We're coming to get you, be..."<eos> - Sure to lock your doors, 'cause the Second Amendment was made for people like you.
You were wearing a wire.<eos> If I told you a lie, there was a reason.<eos> Talk to me like I'm your daughter, okay?<eos> I am right here.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Why isn't it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we are.<eos> I'm not doing this to save my skin.<eos> - They're coming after you.
Mere puffery.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I haven't used it since law school, but, hey.<eos> I, I don't think I've ever used it.<eos> Mere puffery.<eos> Does that even work?<eos> We will find out if it works.<eos> My guess is they call you next.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Yikes, who pissed you off?
And you?<eos> I don't want to die in prison, Maia.<eos> I want a chance to see you have kids.<eos> I want to hold my grandkids.<eos> What was the deal?<eos> Ten years.<eos> Don't testify against Diane. What?<eos> I have to.<eos> Dad, if they're offering ten years, they must have a weak case.<eos> It's for you, too.

What?<eos> I have to.<eos> Dad, if they're offering ten years, they must have a weak case.<eos> It's for you, too.<eos> You do this, Dad, and if I ever have any kids, you'll never see them.<eos> I'll never let you see them.<eos> I love you.
What, you got grand juries all over your butt, man.<eos> - That's because we're doing our jobs. - In the meantime, I have to.<eos> Find out from the L.A. Times that you just signed with one of the whitest companies in Silicon Valley.<eos> You really complaining because we brought in a company worth $86 million a year?<eos> Yeah, two percent black employment.<eos> We don't have anything to do with that, Carl.<eos> We have to make a living, Carl.<eos> Now, in the meantime, I've been receiving these calls from these clients who are feeling - that they're being neglected. - Who?<eos> - Tell me, who? - Nigel.<eos> He says he can't get you on the phone.
I'm invoking Article 4. What? Excuse me?<eos> I'm demanding a full partnership vote on the leadership of this firm.<eos> We're going in another direction.<eos> And you're the new direction.<eos> Is that it? Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I'm taking my firm back.<eos> You've driven it to the ground, and in this day and age, we can't afford to let it drift.<eos> You got old, Carl.<eos> And you're betraying me right now. But you know what?<eos> I still honor you. Everything you've done in the past.
Tell the paramedics he fell, okay?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Do you think it's all right that rap lyrics are homophobic, because it's cultural?<eos> I don't know, Clarence.<eos> By the way, congratulations.<eos> It'll be good for the firm.<eos> What'll be?<eos> Being on his arm as he runs for office.<eos> It's like de Blasio.<eos> Doesn't just work for him, it works for you.
We're aware that you have done business with, Mr. Selkirk's right-wing legal foundation,<eos> First Charter Choice. And we're also aware that Selkirk subsidized this "lawsuit,"<eos> to embarrass the good reverend. You're taking money from the alt-right, Mr. Kovac, and you edited the drug dealer from that video.<eos> I think we're... we're about done here.<eos> And we are prepared to file a civil suit against you and your client...<eos> for extortion!<eos> Why aren't you answering my calls?<eos> I've been busy.<eos> My family is insane.<eos> Why do you think I didn't introduce you to them earlier?
Any last-minute advice?<eos> Nope.<eos> Just tell the truth.<eos> Anything you admit here can't be used against you, so take advantage of that.
Go around, go around!<eos> Painters.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just go out that door.<eos> Door you came.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We're just...<eos> There's just painters, so...<eos> Okay, here's my advice.<eos> She is not your friend. She's trying to catch you in lies.
There's just painters, so...<eos> Okay, here's my advice.<eos> She is not your friend. She's trying to catch you in lies.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> I understand.<eos> I know you're trying to protect your parents, but she can see you're doing that.<eos> So don't talk about Jax being with Hannigan unless you have a specific memory.<eos> I don't want to hurt my dad.<eos> I know.<eos> But your proffer only covers you if you don't lie.
I know this has been hard...<eos> I know these months have been hard on you, and you feel, rightly or wrongly, guilty for your parents' actions.<eos> No, that's not what this is.<eos> You don't even need to be conscious of it, Maia.<eos> Your guilt could just be coloring your memories.<eos> You could be seeing yourself as more culpable than you are.<eos> It's your Catholic guilt.<eos> You are condemning yourself.<eos> That's fine for the confessional, but here, it has real repercussions.<eos> They could put you in jail.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> Robin...<eos> Robin of Locksley, I'd like to officially welcome you to Storybrooke.
We've barely even talked.<eos> Well, there's some things you should probably tell him.<eos> Like, for example... he has a daughter.<eos> It's not his daughter.<eos> Exactly my point...<eos> they're different people.<eos> But there could be a part of him in there.<eos> He was able to cross into the real world.<eos> That... that has to mean something.<eos> Regina, I want this to work out for you.
But there could be a part of him in there.<eos> He was able to cross into the real world.<eos> That... that has to mean something.<eos> Regina, I want this to work out for you.<eos> You deserve this.<eos> I'm worried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> Well, this is a surprise.<eos> What brings you here, Captain?
Yeah, me too.<eos> Family... is... everything.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> You've forgotten your father.<eos> You were barely my father.<eos> You were a drunk who died when I was 6 years old!<eos> I owe you nothing!<eos> You don't truly believe that.<eos> Is this... is this why you're here?<eos> I've spent my whole life trying to forget you.
Nottingham?<eos> No.<eos> Well, fancy that.<eos> The Sheriff of Nottingham.<eos> Now wait.<eos> Look, I heard you were back.<eos> Look, I'm not that man here.<eos> Nobody calls me that in Storybrooke.<eos> I'm not from Storybrooke.<eos> You know, I could've killed you with that arrow.
Our second deal is now complete.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "Small things can hold great power."<eos> Someday... may we all be reunited with our sons.<eos> Emma's here.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Hey, love, what happened to the canoe trip?<eos> Henry.<eos> I love him, but he forgot the life jackets, and you're the one always going on about boat safety.<eos> I can't let you in there.
Someday... may we all be reunited with our sons.<eos> Emma's here.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Hey, love, what happened to the canoe trip?<eos> Henry.<eos> I love him, but he forgot the life jackets, and you're the one always going on about boat safety.<eos> I can't let you in there.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I just really desperately need<eos> - to kiss you right now.
The truth is, um...<eos> I'm a bit out of sorts...<eos> - because of Archie.<eos> - Archie?<eos> Y-Yeah, I paid the Cricket a visit because I needed to talk to him about... about you.<eos> I thought you were gonna die.<eos> And that does something to a man.<eos> It changes the way he thinks about things... about us...<eos> And he reminded me how important it was to share my feelings.<eos> And I didn't want to let you in the shed without sharing them, so... feelings shared.
Now, why was I here?<eos> Life jackets.<eos> Right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Good work.<eos> - Didn't feel good.<eos> - Well, it was.<eos> Now let's find out who murdered my father.<eos> My hand's really not that bad.<eos> I didn't bring you here for that.
What the...<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Does that mean you're lying to me?<eos> No.<eos> You know where my boy is.<eos> Tell me right now.<eos> Tell me!<eos> James?<eos> I've come to bring you home.
Tell me right now.<eos> Tell me!<eos> James?<eos> I've come to bring you home.<eos> I don't want to go!<eos> My father wants me to be a knight.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> - James...<eos> - I don't want to kill things.<eos> What if I bring you to my home?
Hey, there!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Run!<eos> Stop!<eos> Go! Run!<eos> Come on, go! Go!<eos> Faster, go!<eos> Yeah, this is definitely the coin, and it was the last I saw of him when he left with the boy.<eos> And, honestly, I never...<eos> I never put you with him, David.
Okay.<eos> You don't want me to go after him, do you?<eos> You really have changed how you feel about vengeance.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> I didn't think you'd see it, but, yes.<eos> I would try and stop anyone setting out on revenge if I could.<eos> Is that...<eos> You found him.<eos> You found my son.<eos> Please, let me reward you.
I am glad he doesn't respect me.<eos> I am detecting a weary trace of mount of vokaya.<eos> Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalari, Mr. Chekov?<eos> It is a match, sir.<eos> It's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew are being held at Krall's base of operation.<eos> Can we beam them out?<eos> No, sir.<eos> There is some geological interference... That is blocking transporter signal.<eos> Well I guess we are gonna have to go and break in the old fashion way.<eos> You can not go to this place.
Have you gone completely mad?<eos> - Yes or no?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Captain, my familiarity with the interior of those ships, however brave makes me more qualified for this away mission.<eos> Spock, you're still hurt.<eos> She's right, Spock.<eos> I acknowledge and respect your concerns.<eos> Perhaps you will feel more confident if I were accompanied by someone with familiarity of both the ship and my injury.
Spock, we read you.<eos> Captain, from what I can assertane, these ships do with the shared cyberpathic link... Which coordinates their actions.<eos> Patching it through now.<eos> That's what they signalize.<eos> They weren't jamming us, they were talking to each other.<eos> How do we get them to stop talking?<eos> What about an electromagnetic focusing?<eos> We can use the transporters to disturb their network.<eos> Focus might be too specific.<eos> If you can plant some sort of disruptive communication signal inside the swarm it might inversely effect capacity the way it coordinates.
Weapon's in the chamber.<eos> Captain we have to stop the processor now... Or everything breathing in Yorktown is dead.<eos> You can't stop it.<eos> You will die.<eos> Better to die saving lives... Than to live with taking them.<eos> That's what I was born into.<eos> - Scotty.<eos> - Captain, I think we can redirect it.<eos> There's a seal construction, perhaps that will let you vent the weapon into space.<eos> Now we can override the locks, from out here, but you have to activate the hatch.
And all the cold went out of me.<eos> I reached down, I grabbed that sickle. I threw it as far as I could throw it, and me and him commenced to wrestling.<eos> We wrestled for...<eos> Carry the six...<eos> Three days and three nights!<eos> Now, I don't know where I got the strength from, 'cause every time he tried to get the best of me, I reached way deep down inside myself, found the strength to do him one better.<eos> Every time Troy tells that story, he find different ways to tell it, different things to make up.<eos> I ain't making up nothing, woman.<eos> I'm telling you the facts of what happened.<eos> I wrestled with Death for three days and three nights, and I'm standing here to tell you about it.
Working every day, can't get no credit.<eos> I come back here, Rose'll tell you, madder than hell, trying to figure out what to do.<eos> Come a knock on the door.<eos> I ain't been living but three days, who know I'm here?<eos> I open the door. Devil standing there.<eos> Bigger than life.<eos> White fella, got on good clothes and everything.<eos> Standing there with a clipboard in his hand.<eos> Now, I ain't got to say nothing. First words come out of his mouth,<eos> "I understand you need some furniture and can't get no credit."
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?<eos> How much the man done charge you?<eos> Hell, I done paid for it. I done paid for it 10 times over.<eos> Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.<eos> Troy lying.<eos> We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.<eos> He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.<eos> Hell, woman, Bono know I ain't that big a fool.<eos> I was just getting ready to say, I know where there's a bridge for sale.<eos> I'll tell you this.
He's got to make his own way.<eos> I made mine.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand when he get out there in the world.<eos> Times have changed, Troy.<eos> People change.<eos> The world changing, and you can't even see it.<eos> Woman, I do the best I can do.<eos> I come in here every Friday, I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.<eos> You all line up at the door with your hands out.<eos> I give you the lint from my pockets. I give you my sweat and my blood.
That's what you tryin' to say.<eos> I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.<eos> I know what you tryin' to say.<eos> I know what Rose means to you, Troy.<eos> I'm just tryin' to say I don't want to see you mess up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I appreciate that, Bono.<eos> If you was messing around on Lucille, I'd be telling you the same thing.<eos> That's all I got to say.<eos> I just say that 'cause I love you both.
Let him down With a golden chain.<eos> And every night I call his name.<eos> Go on, Blue, you good dog you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go on, Blue You good dog you.<eos> Blue laid down and died like a man.<eos> Blue laid down and died.<eos> Blue laid down And died like a man.<eos> Now he's treeing possums In the Promised Land.<eos> I'm gonna tell you this Just to let you know.
Would you like the job?<eos> Yes!<eos> Can you start immediately?<eos> Yes!<eos> Good.<eos> Then let's go and meet Will.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Okay. Um, sure.<eos> The hours are 8:00 to 5:00, Monday to Saturday.<eos> If, for whatever reason, you're running late or you need to leave early, - please call and let me know. - Okay.
Okay. Um, sure.<eos> The hours are 8:00 to 5:00, Monday to Saturday.<eos> If, for whatever reason, you're running late or you need to leave early, - please call and let me know. - Okay.<eos> I must stress that Will should not be left alone for longer than 15 minutes.<eos> And, uh...<eos> You might want to wear something a little less revealing.<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> This is the annex.<eos> It was the stables before we had it adapted for Will.<eos> Um, I'll give you a set of car keys, and put you on the insurance.

William, please.<eos> Hello, Louisa Clark.<eos> I'm Will Traynor.<eos> You appear to have a problem with your skirt.<eos> You're a bad man, Mr. T.<eos> G'day.<eos> I'm Nathan.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to get on.<eos> Miss Clark, Nathan will talk you through Will's routines and equipment.
Where do you have in mind?<eos> Well, I was told that you had a car that was adapted for wheelchair use.<eos> And you thought a drive would be good for me.<eos> A breath of fresh air.<eos> What do you usually do?<eos> I don't do anything, Miss Clark.<eos> I sit.<eos> I just about exist.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I could get you your computer.
I don't do anything, Miss Clark.<eos> I sit.<eos> I just about exist.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I could get you your computer.<eos> Have you found a good quad support group I could join?<eos> Quads "R" Us?<eos> The Tin Wheels Club?<eos> Or perhaps we could get to know each other a bit.<eos> You know, because then you could tell me what you do like to do.
You know, because then you could tell me what you do like to do.<eos> May...<eos> Maybe.<eos> Here's what I know about you, Miss Clark.<eos> My mother says you're chatty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can we strike a deal?<eos> Whereby you are very un-chatty around me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll just be in the kitchen if, you know, need anything.
Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?<eos> Well, there's our relaxed dining area, and there are stalls outside.<eos> The Pig in a Poke does a nice hog roast in a bun with apple sauce.<eos> Sharon.<eos> Can I call you Sharon? Yeah?<eos> So it's a quiet Monday afternoon and you've got a lot of empty tables.<eos> We want to buy a really expensive meal.<eos> We don't want to eat pork rolls at a stall, even with apple sauce.<eos> Oh, I'm really sorry.<eos> You need a Premier Area Badge.
Oh, I'm really sorry.<eos> You need a Premier Area Badge.<eos> It's policy.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> So how much for a Premier Area Badge?<eos> What are we talking, like, another 10?<eos> Another 20?<eos> We don't sell badges, madam.<eos> This is a restaurant.<eos> You'll have to go to the ticket office.
Anyway, anyway, must mingle.<eos> It's good to see you, Will.<eos> And you, Miss Clark.<eos> He's a nice guy.<eos> He fancies you.<eos> He needs glasses.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Well, you don't look so shabby yourself.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen. I give you the bride and groom, Mr. and Mrs. Rupert Collins!
Seven years we've been together, Lou.<eos> You've known him five months.<eos> But he needs me.<eos> And I don't?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, you got him here.<eos> - Cheers, mate.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Bienvenue.<eos> Let me show you to your rooms.
I had Destiny's Child reunite only to have them come over to my personal living room so I could watch them break apart again.<eos> How did I get to my success level?<eos> What's my secret?<eos> I worked myself silly.<eos> Okay, number one.<eos> You work your ass off to get what you want.<eos> Number two.<eos> You do not let other people drag you down.<eos> 'Cause they will.<eos> They are an anchor in your life that you do not want.
You're sweet, Kimberly.<eos> Now, you're gonna remember what I told you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Stocks are gonna go up and down.<eos> The big money's in the long game.<eos> - Thank you so much, Michelle.<eos> - Thank you, Tom.<eos> You're so sweet.<eos> We're actually gonna miss you around here.
Don't tell her that.<eos> Unless you're Hannah.<eos> Hannah, you're gonna stick with it.<eos> Don't...<eos> You know what? Let's...<eos> And I got a hunch that your mom should've stuck with it.<eos> She wouldn't be so pent-up and angry.<eos> That's my hunch.<eos> Let's change the subject.<eos> We brought you guys some delicious homemade brownie treats.

Look at this!<eos> We brought treats, everybody!<eos> Let me ask you one question.
We brought you guys some delicious homemade brownie treats.<eos> Ooh. Look at this!<eos> We brought treats, everybody!<eos> Let me ask you one question.<eos> When you sell a box of cookies, what do you get?<eos> You get points that can apply to your canoe trip.<eos> Wrong, you get a big plate of bullshit!<eos> That is 100% right, you beautiful giant!<eos> Now, at Darnell's Darlings, we don't think that's right.<eos> We think if you go out and sell a box of cookies, we should give you 5% commission.
Well, actually, we were gonna build a dirty badger nest in a tree.<eos> My God.<eos> My God!<eos> And I was making that up.<eos> I was trying to think of the worst possible scenario on Earth.<eos> What the hell is going on in here?<eos> I leave the room for one minute to talk to my landscaper and the meeting goes into the toilet?<eos> Sorry, Helen, we're almost done.<eos> Okay, you guys, the best part about Darnell's Darlings is that, for each box sold, an extra 10% will go into a college fund for you.<eos> We are gonna help you save for your college education.
Good job.<eos> It's just, a little common courtesy would be nice, you know?<eos> If she ever returned my calls, I would know about these press days in the middle of nowhere.<eos> Mom, look!<eos> Congratulations, Claire.<eos> Honey, why don't you, um, go on inside, just look both ways before you cross, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> Looks like you and Michelle have built yourself quite a little empire.<eos> What do you want?
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, amazing!<eos> This is Chrystal.<eos> It's one of the Darnell originals.<eos> She's a giant.<eos> I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I have eyes.<eos> Isn't that fun?<eos> Come on with me.<eos> I got a surprise for all of you guys...<eos> I think you're gonna be very excited about.
- Yeah.<eos> - Well, wouldn't you know it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why are you dressed like that?<eos> What are you dressed as?<eos> I'm glad you asked me.<eos> I am actually a demon.<eos> I'm a phoenix.<eos> Pretty cool, right?<eos> Are you into demons?
And I'm gonna go look for Max, no matter who's with me.<eos> So...<eos> Who's with me?<eos> All right, fine. Fine.<eos> Oh, come on, guys.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> When I got my claws caught in the curtains who pulled me down?<eos> Max did.<eos> Buddy, Mel.<eos> When you were fixed, who taught you to sit the comfortable way?
Start hanging out with him.<eos> After a while, you'll think it's him you'll be done.<eos> We are not just giving up!<eos> We're dedicated. We're loyal.<eos> We're easily the greatest pet ever.<eos> We're dogs!<eos> Cat.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Well, congratulations!<eos> Today you're dogs, whether you like it or not!
Hey, Gavin.<eos> Did Jack give the okay to cut this deep?<eos> Don't worry about Jack.<eos> Just keep cutting.<eos> Who said it was okay to be here?<eos> I just go where they tell me.<eos> Where's Jack?<eos> There he is!<eos> This is so out of line, Jack.<eos> You're not supposed to be cutting anywhere near this deep.
Guys, move. Sheriff!<eos> Sheriff!<eos> Sheriff! Jack.<eos> No, out of the way. Back off.<eos> Sheriff!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Sheriff!<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Jack, what's so big I had to call out the cavalry?<eos> You really have to come inside and see this.
Folks looked high and low but, it was nowhere to be found.<eos> Some said he flew to another forest, far, far away.<eos> But those were just stories.<eos> Time marched on.<eos> Children got older.<eos> Trees growed taller.<eos> Tales growed taller, too.<eos> By and by, even the best ones come to an end.<eos> But I know someone, who would tell you otherwise.<eos> There's one little boy who could tell you the whole story.

No, I'm good thank you.<eos> That knee injury, must have hurt, huh?<eos> Pretty much killed my career.<eos> You're doing pretty well now.<eos> That's good.<eos> May I give your dog a bone?<eos> Here, Brutus. For you.<eos> From me.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> Well, you have a lovely day.
- The "new-new"?<eos> - The "new-new."<eos> They want that new-new.<eos> No!<eos> What if I could sell this Tequila to a customer?<eos> - Would I have your order then?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> And I'm just gonna pick a customer at random.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Do you enjoy the taste of Tequila?
Excuse me?<eos> Are you allowed to do that?<eos> Nice, respectable, smart girls!<eos> Keep you in line.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you insane?<eos> - Oh, you're kidding.<eos> You are not screwing up this wedding.<eos> Do you hear me?
Nice, respectable, smart girls!<eos> Keep you in line.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you insane?<eos> - Oh, you're kidding.<eos> You are not screwing up this wedding.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Mom, do you hear this river of horse shit coming out of dad's mouth?<eos> We don't want you showing up stag and riling each other up!
Here's a t-Rex!<eos> "Life finds a way."<eos> Jeanie!<eos> Eric!<eos> Hey! Hi!<eos> Sorry, I lost Eric.<eos> I wasn't lost.<eos> Just driving at a reasonable pace.<eos> Stay there.<eos> We'll come to you.
You just killed the TV.<eos> I was aiming for it.<eos> We are such idiots.<eos> We are so stupid.<eos> We ruined your whole wedding... And we finally just realized that.<eos> All right. Please just stop talking, okay?<eos> Not another word.<eos> My head hurts so bad.<eos> Jeanie, Eric.<eos> We can't let you not get married just because we fucked everything up.
Not another word.<eos> My head hurts so bad.<eos> Jeanie, Eric.<eos> We can't let you not get married just because we fucked everything up.<eos> We love you so much, jeanie.<eos> We love you, Eric.<eos> We just want you guys to love each other.<eos> - Just love each other. - That's it.<eos> Jeanie, Eric.<eos> We can't let you not get married.
Excuse us.<eos> Could we have your attention, please?<eos> My husband and I... Want to thank four very incredible people... For saving the day.<eos> Mike and da ve ha ve asked to say a few words... So we would like to invite them up.<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> Thank you, jeanie.<eos> We never got to give our speech at the rehearsal dinner.<eos> Because we ruined it.<eos> With fights.<eos> But we just wanted everybody here to know... Exactly how we feel about you.
You're awesome, Judy!<eos> Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> Well, he was right about one thing.<eos> I don't know when to quit.<eos> Listen up, cadets.<eos> Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits.<eos> Sahara Square...<eos> Rainforest District, to name a few.<eos> You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets, or guess what?<eos> You'll be dead!
"...to anyone." So, beat it.<eos> You're holding up the line.<eos> Hello?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else, meter maid.<eos> Actually, I'm an officer.<eos> Just had a quick question.<eos> Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucus... with their cookies and cream?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't want to cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream... with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3 health code violation.
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck. That's the truth.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> I'm sorry, pal.<eos> Got to be about the worst birthday ever.<eos> Please don't be mad at me.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> Officer, I can't thank you enough.<eos> So kind, really.<eos> Can I pay you back?
Excuse me. Pardon.<eos> Bon voyage-e, flat foot!<eos> Hey, stop right there!<eos> Have a donut, copper!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you see those leopard printjeggings?<eos> I love your hair.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come to papa.<eos> You're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else... Mrs. Otterton. Okay?
But, to be fair... you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen moldy onions.<eos> Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions.<eos> Those are a crocus varietal called midnicampum holicithias.<eos> They're a Class-C botanical, sir.<eos> I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing.<eos> Shut your tiny mouth now!<eos> Sir, I got the bad guy.<eos> That's my job.<eos> Your job is putting tickets on parked cars!<eos> Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.<eos> The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off.<eos> Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed!<eos> No, let's not tell the Mayor just yet.<eos> And I've sent it and it is done, so I did do that.<eos> Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.<eos> Us little guys really need to stick together, right?<eos> Like glue.<eos> Good one.<eos> Just call me if you ever need anything, okay?
Hello? Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is...<eos> You know, I'm going to hit the pause button right there... because we're all good on Bunny Scout cookies.<eos> No.<eos> I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.<eos> I'm looking for a missing mammal, Emmitt Otterton, right here... who may have frequented this establishment.<eos> Yeah, old Emmitt.<eos> Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.<eos> But, hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend.<eos> Darling, I've forgotten your name.<eos> Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?<eos> I am... doing... Just...<eos> Fine?<eos> ...as well as... I can... be.<eos> - What...<eos> - Hang in there.<eos> ...can I...<eos> - I was hoping you could run a for you...
He attacked.<eos> Otterton?<eos> Otterton.<eos> He went crazy.<eos> Ripped up the car, scared my driver half to death... and disappeared into the night.<eos> But he's a sweet little otter.<eos> My child, we may be evolved, but deep down... we are still animals.<eos> You want to find Otterton, talk to the driver of that car.<eos> His name is Manchas... lives in the Rainforest District.<eos> Only he can tell you more.
Two days to find the otter... or you quit.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> Badge.<eos> - But, sir, we...<eos> - Badge!<eos> No.<eos> What did you say, fox?<eos> Sorry.<eos> What I said was, "no."<eos> She will not be giving you that badge.
Great idea.<eos> Tell the public.<eos> And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor... who is a lion?<eos> I'll be ruined!<eos> Well, what does Chief Bogo say?<eos> Chief Bogo doesn't know.<eos> And we are going to keep it that way.<eos> No,no,no!<eos> Someone's here.<eos> Sir, you need to go, now!
You don't understand.<eos> I was trying to protect the city!<eos> You were just trying to protect your job.<eos> No.<eos> Listen, we still don't know why this is happening.<eos> It could destroy Zootopia.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> Ladies and gentlemammals.<eos> 14 mammals went missing... and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit... who will speak to you in a moment.

Do you think I might go savage?<eos> Do you think I might try to... eatyou?<eos> I knew it.<eos> Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me.<eos> Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.<eos> No.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick!<eos> Officer Hopps!<eos> Were you just threatened by that predator?
They thought it would be better... if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face that you see... when you walk into the ZPD.<eos> What?<eos> They're gonna move me to records.<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> It's by the boiler.<eos> Hopps!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Our city is 90% prey, Judy... and right now they're just really scared.<eos> You're a hero to them.<eos> They trust you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you guys only grew carrots.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.<eos> Okay.<eos> How?<eos> Know this guy?<eos> I told you. I know everybody.<eos> Step right up.<eos> Anything you need, I got it.
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered the market on Night Howlers.<eos> You got Doug here.<eos> What's the mark?<eos> Cheetah in Sahara Square.<eos> Got it.<eos> Serious?<eos> Yeah, I know they're fast.<eos> I can hit him.<eos> Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through the open window of a moving car.<eos> Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
I implore you... try.<eos> Try to make the world a better place.<eos> Look inside yourself... and recognize that change... starts with you.<eos> It starts with me.<eos> It starts with all of us.<eos> All right, enough!<eos> Shut it!<eos> We have some new recruits with us this morning... including our first fox.<eos> Who cares?<eos> You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir.
I can't feel my legs.<eos> We need help over here!<eos> Help me.<eos> I can't feel my legs.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Wallace?<eos> What do they call you, Wally?<eos> Huh?<eos> You're the boss, boss.
Well, then we don't have to depend upon the kindness of monsters.<eos> There are ways we can help each other.<eos> Would you step into my office here?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's your wish list?<eos> Uh...<eos> Access to the wreck of the crashed Kryptonian ship?<eos> Done.<eos> The complete remains of the dead alien for testing.<eos> You want Zod's body?
Um...onaseriousnote , thelibraryof Metropolis...<eos> Go to the stairs. You saw them on your way in.<eos> Down the stairs.<eos> Butatonetime, dadcouldnotbuy them. No.<eos> Myfathercouldnot afford booksgrowingup .<eos> Hehadto rootthrough thegarbagefor yesterday'snewspaper.<eos> All right. You got the kitchens on your right.<eos> Doa left.<eos> Right in front of you. That's where you want to be.<eos> May I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Hello.<eos> Good.<eos> Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.<eos> Ow!<eos> Wow!<eos> That is a good grip!<eos> You should not pick a fight with this person. Huh.<eos> So, after all these years, we finally got you over to Metropolis.<eos> Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.<eos> Well, you're welcome. You should hop the harbor more often, though.

- Let's go!<eos> Keefe.<eos> You made bail.<eos> Open two.<eos> Who paid?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Just a man.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, what the fuck do you want?<eos> To help you stand for something.
Yes.<eos> - Enjoy.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's a fake.<eos> The real one was sold in '98 on the black market.<eos> And now it hangs...<eos> Over the bed of the sultan of hajar.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, miss.<eos> The other night you took something that doesn't belong to you.
Stealing's not polite.<eos> Is it stealing if you steal from another thief?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Someone interested in the same man you are.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> As it happens, no, I didn't.<eos> The data you copied has military-grade encryption.<eos> You know, i bet with that dress, 9 out of 10 men will let you get away with anything.
Please, Ineedto speaktoher.<eos> Please,madam. Ibeg ofyou!<eos> Pleasedon'tdo this!<eos> Thisisso important!<eos> Comewithme .<eos> Don'ttouchme !<eos> Please!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She wouldn't leave.<eos> I didn't tell you the truth.

You mean like stop at a restaurant?<eos> We just got in the car.<eos> - We could go to a place in the old city.<eos> - No, I'm in a hurry, remember?<eos> Oh, you're late?<eos> No, they didn't tell me you were late.<eos> No, we should be going this way if you're late.<eos> [HONKING]<eos> [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO]<eos> - Do you like Chicago?
Aw, that's...<eos> I'm having a squabble with the chairs in this kingdom.<eos> - Sit with me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is better.<eos> - So you're from Relyand?<eos> - Recently, yeah, yeah.<eos> We hope to supply the city with its IT.<eos> But I'm trying to get an idea of the timeline of when the king will come in.<eos> I hope they didn't make any promise to you.
No.<eos> No!<eos> I figured I'd be executed at customs.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> - Do you have good Wi-Fi here?<eos> - Uh, sometimes, yeah.<eos> But, you know, Wi-Fi is the least of our problems.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Olive oil?<eos> - That's what you tell anyone who asks.
- Okay.<eos> - [LINE BEEPING]<eos> [COUGHS]<eos> ALAN:<eos> Dear Kit, you say that your mother has always been emotionally unreliable.<eos> That's true to a certain extent.<eos> But who among us is completely stable all the time?<eos> [REWINDING]<eos> Dear Kit, from this godforsaken hotel room 5,000 miles away,<eos> I offer you this confession and ask you for your forgiveness.
I offer you this confession and ask you for your forgiveness.<eos> I've made your short life one of burden and worry when you should have been living carefree.<eos> My penance for blowing it is my being here, a salesman, back going door-to-door, with my own burden being this mini hump on my back, which is either a disease about to eat my spine...<eos> - Dad!<eos> - ...or a sack of spiders growing under my skin.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Your mother would be pleased either way.<eos> Stop this, please.<eos> Stop smoking, Kitty.<eos> ALAN: So, forgive me for not being the father you deserve, for not providing you with the means to follow your dreams.
Ah.<eos> [SPITS, COUGHS]<eos> - Are you available?<eos> - Alan, you sound terrible.<eos> Were you run over by a camel?<eos> - Can you take me to KMET?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Are you missing your shuttles on purpose to spend more time with Yousef, your guide and hero?<eos> You are using too many words.<eos> Hey, do you like reggae?
[SPEAKING IN ARABIC]<eos> - Her again.<eos> - Why do you talk to her like that?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - That lovey-dovey way.<eos> [IMITATES ARABIC WITH HIGH VOICE]<eos> - [LAUGHS]<eos> - It's like she is your girlfriend.<eos> She's a sweetie, you know?<eos> - You need to sit down with him.
- That lovey-dovey way.<eos> [IMITATES ARABIC WITH HIGH VOICE]<eos> - [LAUGHS]<eos> - It's like she is your girlfriend.<eos> She's a sweetie, you know?<eos> - You need to sit down with him.<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - You need to sit down with him, and you gotta look him in the eye and you have to tell him you haven't done anything with his wife.
Ooh.<eos> Would you take offense if I tried something else?<eos> I wouldn't take offense, but I... prefer if you didn't.<eos> [SNORTS]<eos> [SLAPS BELLY]<eos> - So this is frustrating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What do you think we should we do instead, then?<eos> Would you like to hear a really good joke?<eos> - Hey, you like Elvis Presley?
- I don't think so, he's in New York.<eos> - New York?<eos> - What about Hanne?<eos> - Hanne?<eos> Danish girl, works in payroll.<eos> - I...<eos> - I'll be all right.<eos> Thank you, Maha.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can I help you?
Alan Clay.<eos> I'm with the Relyand Group.<eos> Karim Al-Ahmad.<eos> Karim...<eos> Karim Al-Ahmad?<eos> - You're not in New York?<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> My apologies, Mr. Clay, but I have to leave for a meeting and I'm already late.<eos> [SCOFFS]<eos> Why don't you join me and we can discuss a few things along the way?
- Yes, I was on a late shift.<eos> I had just finished an operation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> YOUSEF:<eos> Alan!<eos> Alan.<eos> Yousef.<eos> - Salaam alaikum.<eos> - Alaikum salaam.<eos> - Oh, God, I called you, too.
[BALL BOUNCING]<eos> Nice and easy.<eos> So, is it really happening today?<eos> [SPEAKING ARABIC]<eos> A great pleasure, Your Majesty.<eos> Your Royal Highness, distinguished members of the royal family.<eos> For centuries, business has been done in the same manner as friendships have been made.<eos> With culture and language separated by the mere distance of a handshake.<eos> In Boston, Massachusetts, your friends at Relyand have developed a new technology for virtual encountering on a global scale.<eos> Allow us to give you a demonstration.
"Dear Alan, I actually might have left something.<eos> I'm thinking a sponge?<eos> Or maybe part of a snack I ate during the surgery.<eos> I think I need to see you again.<eos> Perhaps out of the hospital?<eos> We don't want to worry your insurers.<eos> Zahra."<eos> [COMPUTER CHIMES]<eos> "Dear Zahra, that's a very good idea.<eos> But to tell you the truth, I have no idea how this is done in the KSA.
And you didn't have a fire?<eos> No fire.<eos> Just each other.<eos> And in the morning?<eos> We taped our jackets back together and went home.<eos> [LAUGHS]<eos> Good.<eos> ALAN:<eos> Hey, Kit.<eos> I'm writing to tell you that I'm postponing my return to the United States and I don't know for how long.
Good.<eos> ALAN:<eos> Hey, Kit.<eos> I'm writing to tell you that I'm postponing my return to the United States and I don't know for how long.<eos> The deal I was working on here in Jeddah didn't happen.<eos> A competitor from China offered the same technology a lot faster and at half the price.<eos> I shouldn't have been surprised, but there I was, surprised.<eos> So, Kit, the money part of our lives is not solved just yet, but I'm working on it.<eos> I've taken a new job here which pays pretty well.<eos> It should be enough even to get you back into school next semester.

When you coming home?<eos> It depends .. Jilly.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> Lingerie.<eos> Same thing I always wear when I pick up Emma from school.<eos> That's why the good grades you get.<eos> Hello?<eos> Billy?<eos> - Listen, I gotta go.<eos> I will call you later.
Respiratory negative.<eos> Ready to defibrillate.<eos> Loading panel.<eos> Free.<eos> Free.<eos> He's dead, sir.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Doctor, I'm so sorry, but this man says he is from the government.<eos> Dr. Franks, I have only one job at the moment...<eos> Which is to get you on an A400 Airbus sitting on ..back in Dover in ACB.
Now if he comes from nothing like Billy.<eos> Like Billy.<eos> Jericho?<eos> Jericho?<eos> Jericho.<eos> Jericho.<eos> Jericho take it easy.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> My head...<eos> I've just gave you an injection.
- Skills, routines.<eos> - Routines?<eos> Yah!<eos> Routines.<eos> If routines. Basically what we do in life I is reduced to subconscious routines.<eos> It is these things that make the leap of Bill Pope to Jericho.<eos> He makes it with money.<eos> A bag which is driving him.<eos> Offer that money.<eos> And he will give you everything you want.
Does this have something to do with...<eos> Yes... Yes.<eos> Jilly. I need a car.<eos> And the key to the book.<eos> Oh! Sure..<eos> We'll have Jill money, lots of money.<eos> I wish I could keep him.<eos> Emma, come upstairs, please.<eos> I am coming.<eos> Come, You must take a shower.
Your man is not there.<eos> They do not have.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I just said they dion't have it.<eos> I just told you. He's up there.<eos> Alright.<eos> They do not have...<eos> I'll go.<eos> Go to the airfield.<eos> You need to get out of here.
- Painful?<eos> Give to Heimdall Vigilant Shield is fucking crazy.<eos> Elsa<eos> - I got it, I'm on my way.<eos> The Dutchman and Jericho are dead.<eos> Good girl. I'll be waiting for you .<eos> Elsa?<eos> Elsa?<eos> LONDON UNIVERSITY<eos> Do you need an ambulance, sir.
Where is she?<eos> I ended up with it.<eos> She is dead.<eos> Fuck her.<eos> I have what you wanted.<eos> This is what will happen.<eos> Are you dictating terms to me?<eos> That's right, psycho.<eos> Get the little girl.<eos> I will send you instructions.
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.<eos> Mowgli, go back to the den!<eos> A man-cub belongs with man.<eos> We raised him as one of our own!<eos> - He'll have the boy, either way.<eos> Maybe I can be of help.<eos> The boy's right.<eos> Maybe it's time he found another people.<eos> - No.<eos> -I'm the one who brought him to you.
He was very impressed.<eos> He was?<eos> We both were.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've never seen anyone get that close to an elephant before.<eos> So, listen, kid.<eos> I gotta talk to you about something.<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Now that your friend has shown up... Maybe it's time... For you two to just mosey along.

You can't or you won't?<eos> I can't!<eos> You will!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Anybody?<eos> Excuse me... Am I in the right monkey temple?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Is that king Louie?<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> The legends do you no justice, sir.
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...<eos> Throw him off the cliff.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I have no problem with that.<eos> I don't have any problem with that.<eos> I came up here without an invitation.<eos> It was extremely presumptuous of me.<eos> Let me interrupt myself.<eos> I just gotta say... You guys are so much handsomer in person than anyone knows.<eos> No one ever gets up close to you.
Ma-Ma-Ma-Margaret...<eos> Margaret!<eos> Johnny!<eos> Janet!<eos> Billy!<eos> Hello, how was your day?<eos> Not good.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> It's a long story, I'll tell you later.
Yes Mom, I'm getting it.<eos> - Johnny, brush your teeth - I did already.<eos> Come on, Billy.<eos> I'm coming mom.<eos> Whoah, where'd that come from?<eos> Camilla and I made it at school.<eos> That... doesn't look right.<eos> It really works, I swear.<eos> We already asked it all sorts of stuff.<eos> Come on, I'll show you.
You'll be alright.<eos> Are you ready for this?<eos> I guess so.<eos> It's December 21st, 1977.<eos> This is Ed and Lorraine Warren, sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson, also present, is Maurice Grosse.<eos> Alright, let's get started.<eos> If there is something here that would like to communicate with us, we are all ears.<eos> Speak up.<eos> What do you want with this girl and her family?<eos> It says it won't talk, if you all are looking at me like this.
It's on the far side.<eos> Here. Come on.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - It's in there.<eos> We're gonna need more guys.<eos> What is it? A bear?<eos> No.<eos> Just open it up and look.<eos> Grab that.<eos> You're going to need, like, 12 more of those things.
You don't like that truck?<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch this.<eos> See?<eos> It can't hurt you.<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> Yeah. We're working for Terravex.<eos> We had something crash through our fences last night.<eos> No one got a good look at it, but it was big, whatever it was.<eos> You get any reports of anything like that in the last day?
Not so tough, are you now, landsquid?<eos> You are so smelly.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Get back here!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> If you scratch my truck, so help me!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I understand you had an incident last night, but the local authorities didn't believe you.<eos> Explain why you care?
No, no, no.<eos> Get back here!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> If you scratch my truck, so help me!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I understand you had an incident last night, but the local authorities didn't believe you.<eos> Explain why you care?<eos> We're looking for something unusual.<eos> Something dangerous.<eos> What are you looking to do with it?
What are you looking to do with it?<eos> Make sure it doesn't hurt no one.<eos> I thought I heard something.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> Must have been a coyote, or something like that.<eos> Did this coyote come back?<eos> No.<eos> - Mind if we take a look?<eos> - Yes, actually.<eos> Because it's private property and you're not allowed to go in there, but go ahead and look around, if you want to.
So, it all checks out. Just keep walking normally.<eos> Get your hands off us, slimebag.<eos> Okay, it's not slime, it's sweat.<eos> I sweat when I'm nervous.<eos> Thanks for calling attention to it.<eos> Look. - I'm on your side.<eos> - What? Spiritually.<eos> Okay, I'm messing this up. Sorry.<eos> I'm a scientist, a geologist.<eos> But I want to help you.
Let him know you're the one steering.<eos> Right.<eos> Gentle but firm.<eos> I'm the one steering.<eos> Go do this. Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Weathers.<eos> Hope you picked something up from watching me.<eos> A week ago, you were riding a bicycle.<eos> Welcome to Geldon Dodge.<eos> Can we get you a cup of complimentary coffee?
The Eye.<eos> It may not lie...<eos> But don't think for a moment that it can't be lied to.<eos> Seeing is believing.<eos> But is it truth?<eos> People see the Horsemen as noble Robin Hoods.<eos> Are they?<eos> Or are they common thieves?<eos> Depends on your point of view.<eos> Here's what you know.
Which is a crime, might I add.<eos> Have you seen that man's face?<eos> Much as I appreciate the addition of some femininity to the group, over and above what Atlas provides, I think the real issue is we've been in this...<eos> Yeah, the issue is that we have been rehearsing for months for something... We don't even know what it is.<eos> And you're going to keep working until...<eos> Until we work as a single organism. I know, I've heard you say that.<eos> The thing is, when you say that,<eos> I think what you're referring to is us, not you.<eos> Listen, I'm getting my orders directly from the Eye.<eos> Okay? And then I give them to you.
No, thank you.<eos> I mean, I admit, from the neck up there are issues. But from the neck down, the David.<eos> Owen Case.<eos> Good morning, Octa-lites.<eos> Now, I've made the claim... Now, I've made the claim that Octa 8 is pure magic.<eos> But the truth is, that's just one of those things I say...<eos> You know, the truth is, that's just one of those things I say when in fact I mean something else.<eos> ...when in fact I mean something else.<eos> What else do I mean?<eos> Well, here to fill you in on some of my fabulous lies and hypocrisy, and to perform some of the most dazzling feats of magic you have ever seen...
You sent agents to Detroit and Philadelphia.<eos> You've been crying wolf so we wouldn't send them here.<eos> - Boss, please.<eos> - Keep working on the doors.<eos> Please tell me that you haven't bought into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.<eos> Before we start the show... We had Owen agree to a few terms and conditions of our own.<eos> So, everything that he had once considered private... That he thinks is really private...<eos> Yeah, everything that he once considered private is now...<eos> As the Horsemen like to say, magic is about controlling perception.<eos> You see them as champions of the truth, but are they?
I do not understand what is going on right now.<eos> At all. Okay, let me break it down for you.<eos> You jumped off a rooftop in New York and you landed in Macau. AKA the Vegas of China.<eos> And presto-changeo.<eos> Don't you just love it?<eos> The "greatest magicians in the world"<eos> are the object of someone else's magic trick?<eos> Isn't that poetic?<eos> No?<eos> You know what, I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.
- That's a very good question, Atlas.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Just follow the guards.<eos> They'll take you to my boss.<eos> Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse with you, broski.<eos> Meow.<eos> Have fun at the Sands.<eos> - I am so, so, so sorry. - Yeah, you should be.<eos> Don't ever accuse me of betraying us again, okay?<eos> Do you guys ever think that the Eye is watching this?
He had me kicked out of my own company, and now he goes around taking credit for a chip that's not just the key to one computer, but every computer system on the planet.<eos> It can un-encrypt anything, crack the defense firewall, manipulate markets, and spy on anyone.<eos> And now it's being sold to the highest bidder.<eos> If you're so rich, why don't you just buy it?<eos> So he gets the money? And the pleasure?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Besides, why would I buy it when I could have you steal it for me?<eos> Oh! It's being previewed tomorrow to the various suitors, which will include your targets, a crew lead by a South African gangster.<eos> South African gangster.<eos> Yes. How your team gets past security, that's up to you.

It's being previewed tomorrow to the various suitors, which will include your targets, a crew lead by a South African gangster.<eos> South African gangster.<eos> Yes. How your team gets past security, that's up to you.<eos> But once you do, you just need to inspect it and steal it.<eos> That's it?<eos> Come on, this is perfect for you, isn't it?
Yes. How your team gets past security, that's up to you.<eos> But once you do, you just need to inspect it and steal it.<eos> That's it?<eos> Come on, this is perfect for you, isn't it?<eos> You're magicians and thieves.<eos> What makes you think we would even consider doing this?<eos> Oh, wait, I had a reason. What was it?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You see, back home, you're wanted criminals. But here, I control the police, the casinos, the media.<eos> I can give you a new life, out of hiding.
How have you been?<eos> I trust my people implicitly.<eos> What they say goes.<eos> Certainly.<eos> But I'm sure you'd like to see it for yourself.<eos> Hold it in your hands, check the build quality.<eos> Or not.<eos> Also fine.<eos> Well, if you'd like to follow me.<eos> You'll have to remove all your metal. Watches, rings, etc.
Do we have alcohol wipes? Your hands need to be sterile if you intend to get any closer.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> - Sorry. We couldn't...<eos> - No, I'm fine. ...take his medicine into the country.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Can't risk any contamination.<eos> You're gonna have to stay away from the inner workings.<eos> Thank you very much. Thank you.<eos> - All right. If you're done...<eos> - Oh. Here you go.
That's great stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> You guys are pretty serious about your security, huh?<eos> Okay.<eos> Do I have all my things?<eos> I feel like I came in with more stuff.<eos> Did I come in with more stuff?<eos> You don't think so?<eos> Sir, I think you still have my wallet.<eos> Remember, I, uh, gave it to you when I came in?
Your father used to come here when you were young.<eos> Can I please get some space here?<eos> If you think you're the only one who'd wondered for 30 years what happened you're not.<eos> Lionel was a master magician.<eos> Either he gamed the hinges, so he could kick the door and they would pop out, or he had access to the lock from the inside so he could pick it.<eos> Word is the safe was made from cheap metal, and it bowed.<eos> Still, he always had something up his sleeve.<eos> Unless he'd reached the limit of his capabilities and his clock ran out.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My grandmother has something you might want.
- And what does the stick do?<eos> - The stick can unencode anything. It can open up a back door into any computer on the planet.<eos> - Including his.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, we not only make him think that we have it, but that we're going to use it to expose and destroy him.<eos> We need a plan.<eos> But we don't have time.<eos> We have each other and there are five of us.<eos> But we also need supplies, right? And resources. And probably more than five people.<eos> Do you really think you don't have help?
Whoever you want.<eos> Well, we want all of them and all their friends.<eos> Anyone who wants to work stationed throughout the city, so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hey!<eos> My name's Jack Wilder.<eos> Goddamn, it feels good to be back.<eos> All right, gather around.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> I wanna talk to you about something real quick.
Hey!<eos> My name's Jack Wilder.<eos> Goddamn, it feels good to be back.<eos> All right, gather around.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> I wanna talk to you about something real quick.<eos> You all know Three Card Monte, also known as "Find the Lady"?<eos> Trick performed by street hustlers all over the world.<eos> And why street hustlers?<eos> Because as soon as you walk up to the table, you lose.
And get out of my chair.<eos> Hello, everybody!<eos> Come close, come on!<eos> All right, all right, so listen.<eos> Tonight, I am going to make something fly using actual magic.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> I'm going to take a very large vessel, I'm gonna make it fly over there and land on the Thames.<eos> Can you handle that?<eos> Same rules apply as before.<eos> All you need to do is keep your eye on the Queen.
So, let me just make something small fly, like...<eos> Fly, fly, fly!<eos> Wow, right?<eos> Look at that!<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Tough crowd.<eos> You, fly!<eos> - Me?<eos> - Check your fly.<eos> You like that?
Fly, fly, fly!<eos> Wow, right?<eos> Look at that!<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Tough crowd.<eos> You, fly!<eos> - Me?<eos> - Check your fly.<eos> You like that?<eos> You support that relationship? That guy had a bird in his pants.
Lula, go!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Out of the way, FBI!<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Get some men in that park!<eos> Men in the park, now!<eos> You gonna fill up on appetizers? Or save room for the main course?<eos> Where the hell are the Horsemen?<eos> You can chase them all you want, you're just gonna wind up holding your own tails.<eos> Or, you can let them come to you.
Our act was that of rivals.<eos> I was the hard-eyed realist. He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.<eos> We thought it was the perfect misdirect.<eos> Yes, in public, I did goad him.<eos> The only thing we didn't count on was it going so wrong.<eos> Why? Why didn't you ever say anything to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Give it a name.<eos> Shame, guilt. Regret.<eos> Hey, guys, you might wanna come take a look at this.
Look, I like this kid.<eos> We're not supposed to have opinions like that, but I do.<eos> He's resourceful, he's resilient.<eos> I'm not saying these things haven't affected him.<eos> - He's guarded, he has sleep issues.<eos> - Of course.<eos> But for all he's been through, he hasn't let it turn him into a victim.<eos> Which is what made me think of the two of you.<eos> Now that you've been approved, I think you'll make wonderful foster parents.<eos> My question for you is... are you ready for this?
Sports thing?<eos> It's got a censor on it, so there is no controller.<eos> Whatever you do, the little dude does.<eos> You can swing, you can throw, you can kick.<eos> And the little guy does it.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Great.<eos> It's pretty neat.<eos> It doesn't look like much.<eos> We want you to decorate it the way you like it.
And he's angry with me.<eos> For replacing him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We talked about something like this at the beginning, when Mark wanted to sell the house,<eos> - but you refused because...<eos> - I felt like he was still there.<eos> You said you saw him sometimes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> The thing you need to understand about dreams... even lucid dreams, which can feel very real while we're having them.
Tell me what was she like?<eos> I don't remember her.<eos> How did Sean go to heaven?<eos> We wish he hadn't.<eos> As like I'm sure you wish your mom hadn't.<eos> He looks fun.<eos> Are you in fear of losing your car?<eos> Sounds familiar?<eos> If you owe more than ten thousand dollars to the bank or the IRS, then you're qualified for a debt relief program.<eos> Call us now to speak to a debt relief coach who can help you right now.

I'm giving him Zolpidem.<eos> It's a paediatric Ambien.<eos> Just a pill before bedtime should do the trick.<eos> It's just to get him started.<eos> We can't let him stay up for days on end.<eos> Sleep deprivation at this age can do real damage.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Can I help you guys?
I'm sorry I asked about that.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's...<eos> You have the right to know.<eos> It's just important to you also know that... nothing like that is ever going to happen to you.<eos> You okay?<eos> I don't think I am.<eos> You're a great mom.<eos> That kid up there... he needs a great mom.<eos> You need a kid.
That's not going to happen.<eos> I need to find out more about him.<eos> About his dreams.<eos> You've heard this before.<eos> There are several great support groups in here, and a few therapists who specialize in domestic violence.<eos> I want you to reach out, get some help for your situation.<eos> And I never want to see you again.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hi, can I help you?

Wouldn't know about them.<eos> They disappeared a year ago.<eos> Much like your wife.<eos> What are we talking about here, miss?<eos> We're talking about what happens when he dreams.<eos> I've seen it, too.<eos> You have now?<eos> I watched it... take my husband.<eos> I wouldn't say that around here.<eos> They fit you for slippers.
I'm more of a chaser, really.<eos> Hear my words.<eos> And heed my warning.<eos> And laugh if you dare.<eos> Witches live among us.<eos> We have to fight together for the sake of our children.<eos> For the sake of tomorrow.<eos> What do you say to that, friend?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can I help you, sir?
- MR. - Mr. Kowalski.<eos> What do you propose to offer the bank as collateral?<eos> Collateral?<eos> Collateral.<eos> There are machines now that can produce hundreds of donuts an hour.<eos> I know.<eos> I know. But they're nothing like what I can do.<eos> You...<eos> The bank must be protected, Mr. Kowalski.<eos> Good day to you.
No-Magic.<eos> The non-wizard!<eos> Oh. Sorry, we call them Muggles.<eos> You wiped his memory, right?<eos> The No-Maj with the case?<eos> That's a Section 3-A, Mr. Scamander.<eos> I'm taking you in.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sorry, but I do have things to do, actually.<eos> Well... You'll have to rearrange them.
Why would you be finished?<eos> I'm the one that's...<eos> I'm not supposed to go near the Second Salemers.<eos> What was that?<eos> Uh, moth, I think.<eos> Big moth.<eos> Hey!<eos> Quiet down!<eos> I'm trying to get a statement.<eos> I'm telling you, it's a gas explosion again.
Okay.<eos> That's it!<eos> Thank you.<eos> We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.<eos> We're not difficult to find.<eos> Until then, we thank you for your time.<eos> Hey, boy!<eos> You dropped something.<eos> Here you go, freak.<eos> Why don't you put that in the trash where you all belong?
So where would you say that a medium-sized creature who likes broad open plains, trees, sort of waterholes, that sort of thing.<eos> Where might she go?<eos> In New York City?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Plains?<eos> Central Park.<eos> And where is that exactly?<eos> Where is Central Park?<eos> Well, look...<eos> I would come and show you, but don't you think it's kind of a double-cross?
Because I'm dying in that canning factory.<eos> Everyone there's dying.<eos> It just crushes the life out of you.<eos> - Do you like canned food?<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> That's why I wanna make pastries.<eos> You know, it makes people happy.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> So did you get your loan?
Lion.<eos> You know, New York is considerably more interesting than I'd expected.<eos> Put this on.<eos> But why would I have to wear something like this?<eos> Because your skull is susceptible to breakage under immense force.<eos> But we made 'em cocoa.<eos> All right.<eos> Here, you just, um, pop this on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now there's absolutely nothing for you to worry about.
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.<eos> It was good to make your acquaintance, Jacob.<eos> And I hope you get your bakery.<eos> You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.<eos> Mr. Graves.<eos> You were thrown out of Hogwarts for endangering human life.<eos> - That was an accident.<eos> - With a beast.<eos> Yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion.<eos> Now, what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?
But it's not what you think.<eos> I managed to separate it from the Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.<eos> So I wanted to take it home to study it.<eos> But it cannot survive outside that.<eos> It could not hurt anyone, Tina.<eos> So it's useless without the host?<eos> Useless? Useless?<eos> That is a parasitical, magical force that killed a child.<eos> What on earth would you use it for?<eos> You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.
It could not hurt anyone, Tina.<eos> So it's useless without the host?<eos> Useless? Useless?<eos> That is a parasitical, magical force that killed a child.<eos> What on earth would you use it for?<eos> You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.<eos> You brought this Obscurus into the City of New York in the hope of causing mass disruption, breaking the Statute of Secrecy and revealing the magical world.<eos> You know that can't hurt anyone. You know that.<eos> You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal of your fellow wizards and are sentenced to death.<eos> Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you...
It was a big scandal.<eos> It's him.<eos> 'Cause love drives all of us wild<eos> So...<eos> You're the guy with the case full of monsters, huh?<eos> News travels fast.<eos> I was hoping you'd be able to tell me if there've been any sightings.<eos> Tracks, that sort of thing.<eos> You got a pretty big price on your head, Mr. Scamander.<eos> Why should I help you instead of turning you in?
That's your reward.<eos> I'm done with you.<eos> Modesty?<eos> Modesty.<eos> There's no need to be afraid.<eos> I'm here with your brother, Credence.<eos> Out you come now.<eos> Credence.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I trusted you.
I thought you were my friend.<eos> I thought you were different.<eos> You can control it.<eos> Credence.<eos> I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.<eos> Is that it?<eos> That's the Obscurial thing?<eos> That's more powerful than any Obscurial I've ever heard of.<eos> If I don't come back, look after my creatures.<eos> Everything that you need to know is in there.
A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear, lest we risk discovery.<eos> I ask you, Madam President, I ask all of you...<eos> Who does this law protect?<eos> Us?<eos> Or them?<eos> I refuse to bow down any longer.<eos> Aurors, I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves of his wand and escort him back...<eos> Accio!<eos> Revelio.<eos> Do you think you can hold me?
That venom has incredibly powerful Obliviative properties.<eos> We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.<eos> Now, get that case out of New York.<eos> Yes, Madam President.<eos> Is that No-Maj still here?<eos> Obliviate him.<eos> There can be no exceptions.<eos> I'm sorry, but even one witness...<eos> You know the law.<eos> I'll let you say goodbye.
- Uh, we'll take him, sir.<eos> We're off-duty...<eos> - Not you. You stay.<eos> Let's get the neighbor back to the house, too. He's famous enough out here already.<eos> No smoking on my crime scene.<eos> Go ahead, sir.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Where?<eos> Just get out of the car.<eos> Box wants you to take him to the station.
What happened?<eos> What, you can't tell me nothing?<eos> Or you don't know nothing?<eos> Ain't that... That's where that girl lives, right?<eos> I mean, what happened? What'd he do? What, he kill her or something?<eos> I'm just playing, I'm just playing.<eos> But for real, what happened?<eos> You can't give out any information?<eos> Have a seat, sir.<eos> Someone will be right with you, all right?
Yeah.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Just walking.<eos> On West 87th Street a block from the park?<eos> The fuck is that supposed to mean?<eos> Is this her?<eos> Yeah, that's her.<eos> Is he on this?<eos> I just told you that was him out there on the floor, like, hours ago.<eos> What more do you want from me?
Instead, we bring them death.<eos> Kill them all!<eos> Position! Throw!<eos> Hold this line!<eos> Tribune!<eos> We have Barabbas!<eos> Bring him!<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh's you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God, chooses us over you.
Of course.<eos> So, I been pardoned by the Prefect.<eos> Pardoned.<eos> Nothing can be done to me now.<eos> I said what they...was proclaimed.<eos> Say it again.<eos> What?<eos> To see how your tail matches your legs.<eos> We were attacked in the night while sleeping, by the rabid assault...<eos> Sanhedrin paid you to say this.
And stone flew like a leaf and all of a sudden, the sun... rose in the tomb.<eos> That was the sun.<eos> It was... it was everything.<eos> I could not gaze upon... it wasn't a man.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> And there was this voice all around, I could not phantom.<eos> And we were running so far.<eos> Running...so far, until... until we could think again!<eos> Then we went told the priest because that's what you made us do.<eos> And Caiaphas paid you for a different story.
Sir! Tribune!<eos> We have them.<eos> It's the Romans!<eos> Hurry! Hurry! Quickly!<eos> That's the house.<eos> That's where I lost him.<eos> Lost?<eos> I believe that's where he went!<eos> Believe?<eos> Yes, so... I was coming to tell you.
But why are they looking for something we did wrong?<eos> That turned out right.<eos> It didn't turned out right for the Airline and their insurance company.<eos> We should expect some blowback.<eos> Oh like what they can say?<eos> That we shouldn't have saved everybody?<eos> That's not personal.<eos> The're just doing their job.<eos> Relax, calm down.<eos> Sully, they should give you a medal and send you back to work.
Yeah, I'm just tired, that's all.<eos> How are the girls?<eos> Oh good.<eos> A bit overwhelmed, sounds like you are too.<eos> Yeah, I'll be alright.<eos> The whole world is talking about you.<eos> Sully, I can't believe this.<eos> Lori, I'll have to stay here,<eos> Until the investigation is over, Did I tell that already?<eos> And I apologize if I didn't told you already.

Ok, we're done.<eos> That was from my mom.<eos> Her name's Brenda, She told me to say thank you and she's single!<eos> Well, tell Brenda thank you, but I got a girl at home.<eos> Lucky woman<eos> Sully, SULLY!<eos> Sully, where are you?<eos> I'm standing here calling your name.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> You need to get focused, because the media requests Avalanche continues.
Well, tell Brenda thank you, but I got a girl at home.<eos> Lucky woman<eos> Sully, SULLY!<eos> Sully, where are you?<eos> I'm standing here calling your name.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> You need to get focused, because the media requests Avalanche continues.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in and run Shotgun with you the rest of the way<eos> Thought you might need a friend.
Thought you might need a friend.<eos> He will take you to NTSB now.<eos> AirBus completed computer simulations aswell<eos> Good, Good, that will help!<eos> There's something else<eos> The Agency called, The left engine was still operating<eos> Not possible, I felt it go.<eos> It was like it stopped in mid-air.<eos> They said there's a chance it was sub-idle.<eos> I'm just letting you know, since the NTSB already does.
Look, I just finished training on the AR320, And I can tell you the only reason the plane operated so well<eos> Is because the Captain turned on The auxiliary power unit on<eos> He simply followed the QRH<eos> No, no he wasn't.<eos> He wasn't following proper procedure at all.<eos> And I know because I had the QRH in my hands.<eos> He switched to APU immediately after engine blowback.<eos> According to the Airbus that's the 15th thing to do.<eos> If he followed the damn rules, we would be dead.<eos> Maybe that's the part you don't like.
Captain Sullenberger?<eos> First Officer Skiles?<eos> Not this time.<eos> I would like to go over the parameters.<eos> We'll make them available for the Union.<eos> And once the Investigation is complete, we'll be able to share the actual computer simulations<eos> For now, they remain confidential.<eos> We cannot afford a leak to the press.<eos> There has been far too much talk for the press already.<eos> When the complete cockpit voice is compiled, alongside with onboard transcripts we'll call you back.
Ask Lori<eos> So what's the first thing you heard from the cockpit?<eos> Brace for impact<eos> Now, ever heard of that before?<eos> No, actually no<eos> Ever heard of that in any aspect of your life?<eos> Take this show away from me.<eos> Jeff was relaxed and fine.<eos> He should be getting over with other requests.<eos> Are they paying you?
Nothing together.<eos> We'll find a way.<eos> Here we go:<eos> 22A, 6A and 6C<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> Glad you made it!<eos> You're on 6 Jeff.<eos> Oh no that's Jimmy, I'm gonna get some sleep.<eos> Are you going to sleep here?<eos> Not close to you.
Seatbelts.<eos> What do you think it was?<eos> I think it was a bird strike.<eos> We'll have to turn back to La Guardia.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get out the QRH<eos> We've lost both engines.<eos> Mayday, mayday this is Captain 1549, we hit birds.<eos> We've lost both engines, we're turning back to La Guardia.<eos> Ok, you need to return to La Guardia?
I repeat, maintain control.<eos> Avoiding to stall.<eos> 1, check your heading.<eos> You're not going to make the runway!<eos> I got it.<eos> That was a hell of a landing sir!<eos> Didn't think we were gonna make it!<eos> I'm gonna start charging for this stuff, alright?<eos> Hear me?<eos> Hey, let me know if you need anything.
Alright,<eos> I'm alive.<eos> Shary, I can't believe I'm talking to you.<eos> Captain, Captain I'm here to escort you to Mayor Bloomber and Police Officers.<eos> If the Mayor want to say hello, he'll have to come down here.<eos> Sully, I refused to send you with a cop!<eos> Jeff!<eos> I need a count!<eos> We've got to have a count!<eos> There's no way to give you a count.

Carl.<eos> You didn't blown up today, did you?<eos> We're here, that's all I know at the moment.<eos> Oh This is Miss May, from the Hotel.<eos> Would like to have a quick word with you.<eos> This won't take much time gentlemen, this only to say that our staff is committed to protect your privacy.<eos> If there's something you need, at all...<eos> If it's possible, I'd like to have my uniform cleaned and ready.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I'd give you this whole hotel if I could!
I got shaving cream, razor blades, two pairs and some clothes.<eos> Do you think we're ninjas?<eos> It's seven o'clock in the evening.<eos> You find the Merch Brothers!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sully.<eos> What are you still doing in uniform?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Look guys, it's been a long day.<eos> Why don't you just get some rest?
What if they show the exact same result?<eos> If they do, I'll hang myself in.<eos> It's everything about timing Larry.<eos> You can accomplish anything in a hurry.<eos> Sure as hell I agree with that.<eos> Now the CBR is on Wednesday, that's 36 hours.<eos> Can you make it happen?<eos> I'll try.<eos> I'll give a phone call.<eos> It's already late, so you better get started.
We almost lost you.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Please tell me that this is almost over.<eos> It's almost over.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too<eos> I'll call you when they're done with me.
For the record, this is the CVR of the Flight 1549, January 15th, 2009.<eos> Birds!<eos> Shit!<eos> We got one rolling back<eos> We've got both of them rolling back.<eos> Ignition start.<eos> Get out the QRH.<eos> Lost both engines.<eos> Mayday Mayday, we lost both engines, we're turning to La Guardia.<eos> Okay you need to turn to La Guardia?
All right, let's put the flaps down, flaps down.<eos> Couple of flaps, want more?<eos> No, it's good.<eos> You got runway 2-9 at Newark, it's gonna be 2 o'clock, 7 miles.<eos> You got any ideas?<eos> Actually not.<eos> I'd need to take a quick break.<eos> What do they think?<eos> Seeing what I just done?<eos> I'll tell you what I think.
We did our job.<eos> Alright, we got to get this hearing back to order.<eos> Could you settle please?<eos> Take your seats.<eos> That was honestly, the first time I was listening to a crash recording.<eos> While actually sitting with the Captain and First Officer.<eos> It's extraordinary.<eos> That was no simulation?<eos> No it wasn't.<eos> Gentlemen, I want to inform you that the left engine was recovered.
And it's you, Captain Sullenberger, removing you from the equation of math, just fails.<eos> I disagree.<eos> It wasn't just me, it was all of us.<eos> Jeff, Donna, Shila and Dureene.<eos> And all passengers, rescue workers.<eos> And Traffic Control, Helicopter Crews and Scuba Cops.<eos> We all did it!<eos> We survived.<eos> First Officer Skiles, is there anything you'd like to add?<eos> Anything you would have done different, if you had to do it again?
- Not that one.<eos> Theonenexttoit.<eos> - A body's a body.<eos> - Yeah, well, I pick that one.<eos> What's that for?<eos> - To make sure he's dead.<eos> There used to be a time it was hard to tell a comatose person from a dead one.<eos> So coroners tied bells to everybody in the morgue.<eos> So if they heard a 'ting' they knew somebody down there wasn't quite ready to go.<eos> - So, why do you have one?
Oh, you meant Leah.<eos> Right.<eos> Very funny, Doris.<eos> And she tells me not to worry.<eos> It's only three days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm not due for two weeks.<eos> The walking away ain't quite so easy this time.<eos> Hey, I got this.<eos> You go and you do what you have to do and we will be right here when you get back, okay?
Thank you.<eos> Sir.<eos> Thank you, Mike.<eos> Thank you very much, Lynne.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Benjamin, thank you for coming.<eos> We're grateful you could make it.
Oh, God.<eos> Get down, sir.<eos> Jacobs, take the wheel.<eos> Got it!<eos> - Get in!<eos> - Got it.<eos> Mike, on your left!<eos> Get him!<eos> Not really where you wanna be right now.<eos> Fuck you!
Jacobs, take the wheel.<eos> Got it!<eos> - Get in!<eos> - Got it.<eos> Mike, on your left!<eos> Get him!<eos> Not really where you wanna be right now.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck me?<eos> Fuck you.
Raza's not feeling too well at the moment.<eos> He's a little bit fucked up.<eos> Yo, what's this dickhead's name?<eos> This is Kamran.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Hey, Kamran.<eos> My name's Mike Banning.<eos> You are the one with the President.<eos> Bingo.<eos> So why don't you boys pack up your shit and head back to Fuckheadistan or wherever it is you're from?
Sir, Jacquelin.<eos> MI6's finest.<eos> Don't fuck with her.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hmm.<eos> The phones are down.<eos> That said, it did allow us to pick up this.<eos> Mr. President, Banning.<eos> I hope this finds you well.<eos> Mike, we got your message and I'm sure you don't know who you can trust, and all prior authentications may be compromised, so I offer you this...
Negative.<eos> Okay, well, stay sharp.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Box Command.<eos> No sign of the President yet.<eos> Box Command, we've found them.<eos> The President's alive.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yes!<eos> Did I ever tell you?
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sir, I got you.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Banning.<eos> That all they got?<eos> Kind Of looks like it.<eos> Lieutenant, this could be the missing link to Barkawi.<eos> I'll get it to Box Command right away.<eos> Next time I tell you to blow it, just blow it.
Next time I tell you to blow it, just blow it.<eos> Good job, Lieutenant.<eos> You, too, Banning.<eos> Safe journey home.<eos> If that's possible for you.<eos> Next time you wanna leave town after betraying your country, how's about you steal a car to take you to your getaway vehicle?<eos> Preferably one without a GPS, 'cause that just takes all the fun out of it.<eos> You forgot to delete your access logs.<eos> Your authorization code's there, bright as day.<eos> The security cameras show you logging on.

- Fucking pigs.<eos> This is me with some free booze.<eos> And this is me with me finger up an African boy's ass.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Go back.<eos> Let me see.<eos> - What?<eos> It's the assassin.<eos> Listen, London were fab.<eos> But I missed you lot.
You can't do a secret mission on heroin.<eos> Not to worry, all right?<eos> Just leave the spying to your brother.<eos> Sebastian?<eos> No, he's currently on couch, smacked off his tits.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - I'm his brother, Nobby.<eos> Can I help?<eos> Nobby, I need you to listen to me.<eos> You are going to have to take his place.

There you'll meet a driver... from Tshukaru Bush Lodge.<eos> When you meet him, your alias is Mr. Shelton.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> I'll send the information to your lens.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Open the door!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Okay, you need to head inside, find Lina Smit and seduce her.<eos> - What, and cheat on Dawny?<eos> Never. - You need to seduce her... in order to find out what Lukashenko bought from her husband.
You don't wanna get any brown shrapnel on your clothes.<eos> Brown... Brown shrapnel?<eos> This.<eos> You see?<eos> Hard, soft, hard.<eos> May the best man win.<eos> - I go in there now.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Let's get acquainted.<eos> Has anyone ever told you... that you're a very beautiful woman?
You'd rather make love to a maid than me?<eos> Maid?<eos> Banu, out!<eos> - Sorry, Mrs. Smit.<eos> - Mrs. Smit?<eos> Get out, Banu.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now, let me show you how wild this animal can be.<eos> Did you really think I'd let you sleep with my wife, Mr. Graves?
Let's go.<eos> Sebbo?<eos> Sebbo?<eos> Sebbo!<eos> Seb.<eos> Got you.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Maelstrom are sex traffickers.<eos> Listen to me. You've gotta get out... before they sell you to the highest bidder.
Got you.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Maelstrom are sex traffickers.<eos> Listen to me. You've gotta get out... before they sell you to the highest bidder.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out now.<eos> Out.<eos> Out. Quiet.<eos> You don't have to live like this.
Why bomb the final?<eos> Bomb?<eos> There is no bomb.<eos> It's a disease.<eos> It's a virus called RD-9.<eos> Or as I like to call it, WorldCure.<eos> At the end of the game, everyone in the stadium will be infected.<eos> It should take two to three weeks for symptoms to start showing up.<eos> By which time, 96,000 fans from almost every country in the world... will be back home, spreading the disease.<eos> Why are you doing this?
What?<eos> Sharon Osbourne?<eos> She's gonna release this deadly virus... and it's gonna kill poor people like us... because she thinks that we are scum.<eos> Bloody hell, Nobby, we are scum.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, you are, Pete.<eos> You're a registered sex offender.<eos> That's not a compliment.<eos> So we're scum, are we?<eos> Well, let me tell you something about scum:
Middle East peace symbol Schlomo Khalidi is in custody... following the murder of MI6 agent Jeremy Chilcott.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> I've had the worst ******* week ever.<eos> **** Israel. **** Palestine.<eos> **** all of you.<eos> England fans in high spirits after Cup final victory.<eos> Rogue MI6 operative Sebastian Graves and his brother Nobby Butcher... died at the scene while preventing the release of a deadly toxin.<eos> In other news, a South African hotel maid has filed a suit alleging sexual assault... by Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher.<eos> Gallagher is also being sought for abusing an elephant... in conjunction with Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel.<eos> Naturally, you'll both be needing new identities.
You want to eyeball my girl?<eos> Ten fights waged. Ten fights won.<eos> The Winged Warrior.<eos> The Bird of Prey.<eos> The Angel of Death.<eos> ANGEL!<eos> Let's hear it for the fat man!<eos> Our next challenger... comes straight... from the Munich Circus.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the only one that could take on an Angel... is the Devil himself.<eos> I give you... the amazing... the fantastic...
Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> My grandfather planted that tree when he was five years old.<eos> I used to swing... from the branches of it, myself.<eos> I think that was probably my favorite tree.<eos> Does that mean I'm expelled?<eos> On the contrary.<eos> You're enrolled.<eos> Do you sell rugs?<eos> You're not allowed in this area.
You cannot keep me here, in this...<eos> Actually, I can.<eos> A psychic event just destroyed every nuke from here to Moscow.<eos> That event emanated from exactly where we found you.<eos> At the home of the world's most powerful psychic.<eos> So, you are going to tell me, where is Charles Xavier?<eos> It's not him you should be worried about.<eos> There's someone else.<eos> Someone more powerful.<eos> If you let us out of here, we can help you.
Military ID.<eos> Expked.<eos> Thirty-eight bucks.<eos> And a toothbrush.<eos> But no home address.<eos> In other words, homeless.<eos> Aggravated assault is a second-degree felony in this state, Mister... Reacher.<eos> First name Jack.<eos> No middle name.<eos> You're looking at 10 to 20 years once those boys you beat out there are fit to testify.
Just stopping by to see Major Turner.<eos> Well, that's a problem.<eos> Major Turner's been relieved of her command.<eos> I spoke with her a few days ago.<eos> She's been arrested.<eos> Court-martial's pending.<eos> On what charge?<eos> Espionage.<eos> I'm assuming her duties until a replacement is assigned.<eos> Something I can help you with?
Sergeant Greene, sir.<eos> Now, say if Sergeant Greene were having legal troubles, would you be able to recommend an attorney for him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Definitely.<eos> I'd recommend Colonel Moorcroft over at Fort Dyer where the high-security prisoners are confined, sir.<eos> Colonel?<eos> You're the assigned counsel for Major Susan Turner.<eos> I'm Jack Reacher, former commander of the 110th.<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna show up.<eos> Major Turner requested under no circumstances are you to be granted visitation privileges.
I meant the kid.<eos> I don't have a kid.<eos> I've never heard of Candace Dutton.<eos> I'm here about Major Turner.<eos> What evidence do they have?<eos> A hard drive containing classified information found in Major Turner's residence.<eos> The inference being she's selling secrets.<eos> And that's it?<eos> What do you want, a picture of her wearing a burka having drinks with the Taliban?<eos> What did she tell you?
You were right, Major.<eos> I am tired.<eos> But I'm not stupid.<eos> Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.<eos> Two weeks ago, Major Turner dispatches them to Afghanistan on an investigation.<eos> They file reports daily.<eos> Two days ago, they're both found dead near Bagram Air Base.<eos> Shot at close range.<eos> And the next day, Major Turner's thrown in prison.<eos> What do you know about Parasource?
We have no idea if any of these things are connected.<eos> We need to get her out.<eos> And might I reiterate, she does not want you involved.<eos> Do it now.<eos> And I'll call you tonight.<eos> People question the value of enhanced interrogation techniques.<eos> Enhanced interrogation techniques don't work.<eos> But torture, on the other hand, works very well.<eos> Attorney-client privilege goes back to the earliest days of English Common Law.<eos> It means that Major Turner told you in confidence a great deal about what she learned from her investigation in Afghanistan.
- I didn't eat this morning, feel lightheaded.<eos> Could you get me something from the officers' mess?<eos> Sandwich, maybe.<eos> Open the door, please.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Move.<eos> Open BA201.<eos> Ma'am, these men are here to transfer you.<eos> Who are they?<eos> I asked you a question.
Never met him.<eos> He left before I was born.<eos> Where was he stationed?<eos> Around D.C., I guess.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Candy won't talk about him.<eos> - Candy?<eos> - My mom.<eos> Just says he was a big hero and a total asshole.<eos> We're beginning our descent, so if you need to stretch your legs or use the lavatories, you should do it now.
...who thinks that he's smarter and tougher...<eos> You've been relieved of command. I am the commanding officer here!<eos> You are a fugitive from military justice.<eos> So are you!<eos> So we're both criminals.<eos> I'm going.<eos> That's a bad idea, Major.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Prudhomme?<eos> Look, I told you people I don't know where he is, okay?
Go for it.<eos> And now you're wondering how you're gonna make me talk without tipping her off.<eos> You can't torture me.<eos> You can't kill me.<eos> And you're definitely gonna have to kill me.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> Wait.<eos> Toss it over.<eos> FeHas?<eos> I told you people, I don't like being followed.
If he's a vet, that's where he's gonna be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have money for Daniel Prudhomme!<eos> How much?<eos> More than he needs.<eos> Well, how much?<eos> You know Prudhomme?<eos> It depends.<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> What do you want with him?
Who were those guys on the plane?<eos> Who tried to kill me in my cell?<eos> Here's a name for you.<eos> Parasource.<eos> Here's a couple more names to think about. Baghdad.<eos> Basra.<eos> It's not our first rodeo, is it, Captain?<eos> You think I want to be in this position, ma'am?<eos> I have a job to do, and I'm gonna do it.<eos> I'm gonna take a leap of faith that you don't have anything to do with this.
Open it.<eos> Open it.<eos> Open that one.<eos> Open it.<eos> Open it.<eos> Open that one.<eos> I said open up that crate!<eos> Open it.<eos> Lieutenant, do your goddamn job and place this goddamn woman under arrest.<eos> Sorry, Major, you're gonna need to come with me.
Stop him!<eos> Take him down, now!<eos> Deep breath, son.<eos> Pure opium.<eos> Now the numbers add up.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Hello.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm looking for a man, a woman and a little blonde teenager.<eos> I'm so sorry. I don't think I can help you with that type of information.
It begins like so many stories<eos> With a boy... too old to be a kid... too young to be a man.<eos> And a nightmare.<eos> It has two fundamental constants:<eos> E, the base of the natural logarithm system.<eos> It is a number.<eos> It is a number that emerges from our scheme.<eos> What is the mathematical function or thing which describes things...<eos> By the rate which they change is proportional to their magnitude?<eos> If you do that mathematically, it will give you this fundamental constant.
What do you know about anything?<eos> I know everything about you, Conor O'Malley.<eos> No you don't.<eos> If you did...<eos> You know I don't have time to listen to stupid stories from a stupid tree... that is just a dream.<eos> A dream?<eos> What is a dream, Conor O'Malley?<eos> And who is to say that it is not everything else that is a dream?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I came to see you today, because I thought...
If you want to be seen, O'Malley, this is not the best way.<eos> I'm not invisible. Did you hear me?<eos> I'm not invisible.<eos> School rules dictate immediately exclusion.<eos> But how could I do that and consider myself any kind of a teacher?<eos> Go back to class.<eos> We will talk about this one day, but not today.<eos> You're not punishing me?<eos> What could possibly be the point?<eos> Well, let me give you an example of emotional wellness.
- I think you mean "she".<eos> - "He".<eos> But we talked about this.<eos> The children are afraid of us.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> - Are they going to eat us?<eos> I even smiled this time.<eos> Well dad Best present ever<eos> You sir an education in matrimonial excellence.<eos> I'm really going to miss you guys when we leave.
Meena!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> What do you think you're...<eos> Uh-huh. Yeah.<eos> Let's go to work!<eos> And cue the crazy old lizard.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Moon.<eos> Indeed it is, Miss Crawly.<eos> Top of the morning to you.<eos> I made you some coffee.
I wanna see what $100,000 looks like.<eos> - Me, too! - Yeah, go on. Open it, Mr. Moon.<eos> Sure, I'll open it.<eos> Wait.<eos> What did you say?<eos> He said $100,000.<eos> A hundred...<eos> I forgot my keys.<eos> Koala be right back.<eos> For the last time, Miss Crawly, I'm not going to fire you!
This contest is war!<eos> This stage is the battlefield.<eos> Your song is your weapon.<eos> Now you only get one shot to blow that audience away, so choose carefully from the list of songs I've selected for each of you.<eos> Ah, talked some sense into that boyfriend of yours?<eos> Lance is an artist, but I wouldn't expect you to understand that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't understand that at all.<eos> Now, you'll notice each list also includes my costume and performance suggestions.<eos> Okay? Miss Crawly will show you to your rehearsal spaces.
I'll fix that.<eos> Hey. Mr. Moon?<eos> You probably don't remember me, but I auditioned yesterday and I...<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Do you think, maybe, you could reach the ledge?<eos> That ledge?<eos> That's a heck of a trunk you've got there!<eos> Thanks a lot, kid!<eos> Uh, Mr. Moon?<eos> My name is Meena, and I baked a cake for you and, uh, I was wondering if you'd, maybe, give me a second chance to...
Eddie, you can't come visit your nana without bringing her some flowers.<eos> Here.<eos> - What?<eos> No! Buster, no!<eos> - Don't go in there!<eos> Yes, can I help...<eos> Buster!<eos> Ah, Nana!<eos> Just look at you, dear.<eos> You don't look a day over 90!
This stage is about to explode with major piggy power!<eos> I am so sorry. I have no control.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Okay, come on, you can do this.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Okay, Johnny!<eos> Let's get you out here!<eos> And you guys, you've got to work on that routine!
I mean, I lost any chance of ever speaking to my dad again over this show.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Oh, Mr. Moon, don't...<eos> Forget about it.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Come on, let's get out of here.<eos> Mr. Moon?<eos> Meena, please...<eos> I baked a cake for you 'cause... Well, I know you're sad right now and probably afraid to try again and...
Please, you guys, please.<eos> Please sit down!<eos> Hey! Put your shoes back on right now!<eos> Zoe, I saw that!<eos> Stop it!<eos> And, Leo, that is disgusting.<eos> Well, John, I've covered many disasters for this network, but this is sure to...<eos> Oh, they're about to start.<eos> Okay, guys, listen up!<eos> Look, I gotta tell you, um, there's not much of an audience out there tonight.
Ash!<eos> Ash!<eos> What about that?<eos> We just witnessed the birth of a genuine rock star!<eos> Moon, you've got some stuck here.<eos> He may be tiny, but there's no denying his enormous talent.<eos> Would you please welcome to the stage, Mike!<eos> What are you doing back here?<eos> Relax, sweetheart.<eos> Just came back to show you bozos how it's really done.
We have had every assurance they will not discriminate.<eos> And you trust the word of a Nazi?<eos> I've never met a Nazi. Have you?<eos> Come to think of it, when was the last time you played 18 holes with a Jew or a Negro?<eos> Come on. The situation here is hardly comparable.<eos> It's not?<eos> You want to pull out of the greatest sporting event in the world because of a few rumors.<eos> It's been a tough few years here, too.<eos> The American people need champions to remind them what they're capable of.<eos> I'm surprised you can still see the American people from all the way up there in your skyscraper.
I was at the service station.<eos> What, were you pumping gas?<eos> Look, Coach, I need this job.<eos> I got a lot of people counting on me, all right?<eos> VVeH, lguess I misunderstood.<eos> 'Cause I was under the impression when you stood in my office and you looked me in the eye, that you made me a goddamn commitment!<eos> You think you know everything?<eos> Got nothing left to learn, is that it?<eos> Huh? No, sir!<eos> Look, I know I ain't as fast as I want to be, but you need to figure out a way to feed and put clothes on my baby girl.
Yeah, the facilities are great.<eos> No problem with the facilities.<eos> But the one thing that puzzles me is you don't allow Jews to be members,<eos> and that's the only way they can qualify for the games.<eos> We have several, very promising Jewish athletes we expect to compete.<eos> Look, I'm not here to tell you how to run your country.<eos> I walk in a man's house, I'm not gonna piss on his rug.<eos> But I don't expect him to feed me manure and call it foie gras.<eos> You wanna use these games to sell your nasty little ideas to the world, and I'm here to tell you no one is gonna stand for it.<eos> You gotta clean up your act.
Thanks, Coach.<eos> See you at 9:00 a.m. sharp.<eos> Ten seconds.<eos> Okay?<eos> I want you to count that to yourself. Ten seconds, fellas.<eos> That's all you get to run the 100.<eos> Sixty strides, and every single one of them counts.<eos> There's no margin for error, all right?<eos> You could fall down in the 400, pick yourself up and still place.<eos> Now, if you're over-striding, if your cadence is too slow, it can cost you a quarter of a second the whole race.
Him, you need to watch out for.<eos> He clocked at 9.5 against Villanova.<eos> There you go.<eos> He's slower. A tenth of a second slower, Jesse.<eos> Two-tenths, Coach.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> Relax.<eos> I won't let you down in front of Cromwell.<eos> Mr. Owens.<eos> Mr. Owens, we have a couple of questions for you.
Mr. Owens.<eos> Mr. Owens, we have a couple of questions for you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Come on, let us through.<eos> How does it feel to be the world's fastest human?<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Owens.<eos> Good afternoon, and welcome to Los Angeles, where the great Jesse Owens, no doubt, hopes to make good on his unprecedented streak of four world records.<eos> I'm telling you, the skirt in LA...
The minister Goebbels merely asks for reassurance we can count on your support.<eos> Oh, I've made my position clear.<eos> In the meantime, might we ask that you grant us the benefit of your considerable experience in construction, and review these plans of our new embassy in Washington?<eos> You know, last time I looked, I was worth close on $15 million.<eos> You tell him I can't be bought.<eos> You can't afford me.<eos> A bribe?<eos> No.<eos> A business proposal.<eos> The minister would be greatly obliged to you.
A business proposal.<eos> The minister would be greatly obliged to you.<eos> There aren't many companies like yours that could handle a project of this size.<eos> Well...<eos> The architect is Albert Speer.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Impressive.<eos> But these towers won't pass DC zoning laws.<eos> You can't build higher than 130 feet.<eos> You see, this is exactly the kind of expertise we need, if you're interested.
Evening.<eos> Jesse, this is Representative Davis of the Ohio State legislature.<eos> He's here on behalf of the NAACP.<eos> The What?<eos> The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.<eos> Oh, well, hello.<eos> This is my wife, Ruth.<eos> Hello.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Our secretary, Mr. Walter White, has asked me to deliver this to you personally
'Cause you know, out there on that track, you're free of all this.<eos> The moment that gun go off, can't nothing stop me.<eos> Not color, not money, not fear, not even hate.<eos> There ain't no black and white.<eos> There's only fast and slow.<eos> For those 10 seconds, you are completely free.<eos> Now, here you come telling me I can't do it, that I'm letting down my race if I go.<eos> What's that supposed to do for me?<eos> God gave you a great gift, Mr. Owens.<eos> Maybe he can tell you what to do with it.
I love you.<eos> You get your sea legs yet?<eos> Coach?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I mean, someone's gotta keep an eye on you.<eos> Can't have you laying around all week getting fat.<eos> No turning back now.<eos> I'm gonna go find my room.<eos> Coach.<eos> You're headed the wrong way.
Uh-huh.<eos> The man can jump.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's got a hell of a home-field advantage, too.<eos> What do you think this is?<eos> Mardi Gras?<eos> Get back to work!<eos> You got something you wanna say to me, boy?<eos> Now, hold on a second.<eos> "You're not fit to train fleas on a dog." You actually said that to Dean Cromwell?
Jesse, what do you want?<eos> I wanna be able to train the way I'm used to.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> And I want my coach back.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> No way.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Mr. Snyder is not a registered Olympic trainer.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I hope you know all the words to the German national anthem, because you'll be hearing it every time one of those Nazis win a medal I would've won.
I'm sorry, sir, but your friends will have to use the service entrance.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You know who this is?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I mean, they're holding the dinner for him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Owens, sir, but those are the rules.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, well, your rules are bullshit!<eos> You know that, yeah? How about you go inside and get your boss or someone that can actually help us out... Coach, Coach.
Things don't get settled the way they do on the inside!<eos> Give it time.<eos> Stuff starts to make more sense each day you're out.<eos> We should bury him.<eos> Disposal regulation. They'll give me hell.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> Our drugs are locked up now.<eos> Go out the way you came. Ain't nobody got to know about this.<eos> Charlie you need help?
Go out the way you came. Ain't nobody got to know about this.<eos> Charlie you need help?<eos> Want me to call you somebody?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> - Why won't you..<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, now, there's a Van outside. I'll get you anywhere you need to go if you're in trouble.<eos> Hey, miss.<eos> Miss!<eos> You gotta, you gotta stop here.
Want me to call you somebody?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> - Why won't you..<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, now, there's a Van outside. I'll get you anywhere you need to go if you're in trouble.<eos> Hey, miss.<eos> Miss!<eos> You gotta, you gotta stop here.<eos> You're gonna help me find him.<eos> I can help you if you just..
It's perfect.<eos> Good.<eos> I figured you gonna need 'em.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> If you wanna sleep in the closet, it's okay with me.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Mr. Lundy!<eos> You're a hard man to get on the phone.
Even, what's her name?<eos> With the big ol', With the hair?<eos> You gotta know who you are, as an artist.<eos> I mean, that's what they're, they're voting' on when, when America looks at 'em.<eos> They wanna know who that singer is. Where he or she's been.<eos> I wanna look into that person's eye and go "i know your story."<eos> I can relate. That's true.<eos> I mean, it's as simple as that.<eos> It's the difference between a winner and a loser. Honesty.<eos> We reserved the honeymoon suite for you all. Here's the deal.
Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Maui always has time for his fans.<eos> When you use a bird to write with... it's called tweeting.<eos> I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.<eos> You are not my hero.<eos> And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!<eos> I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!<eos> And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back!<eos> Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me... which is impossible because...<eos> I got stuck here for 1,000 years... trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals.
You're welcome<eos> Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me<eos> You're welcome<eos> You're welcome<eos> Well come to think of it<eos> Kid, honestly I could go on and on<eos> I could explain every natural phenomenon<eos> The tide, the grass, the ground Oh, that was Maui just messing around<eos> I killed an eel, I buried its guts<eos> Sprouted a tree Now you got coconuts
Fixed Synced by bozxphd.<eos> Five months in Brazil.<eos> You're a hard man to find.<eos> You even have the accent right.<eos> I do say so.<eos> The principal I represent has an offer for you.
Cubo-futurist totalitarianism.<eos> Of course it's magnificent.<eos> Like, uh, dinosaur bones.<eos> It's ugly.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> I'm here to talk.<eos> Lose your cell phone?<eos> I should've hired those guys from Houston.<eos> All right, what is it that you want to talk about?<eos> I want to help you avoid an accident.
I want to help you avoid an accident.<eos> Krill, Cook, that was you.<eos> I warned those guys that one day Crain would come after all of us.<eos> Cappuccino?<eos> Espresso?<eos> Espresso.<eos> No sugar.<eos> Krill was a warlord, but also the number-one arms dealer in Africa.<eos> Cook used his mining empire as a cover to control the Asian franchise.<eos> You have got Europe and most of South America.
Cappuccino?<eos> Espresso?<eos> Espresso.<eos> No sugar.<eos> Krill was a warlord, but also the number-one arms dealer in Africa.<eos> Cook used his mining empire as a cover to control the Asian franchise.<eos> You have got Europe and most of South America.<eos> North America, too, if you count Mexicans.<eos> That didn't leave much for Crain.<eos> So I have a deal for you.
You have got Europe and most of South America.<eos> North America, too, if you count Mexicans.<eos> That didn't leave much for Crain.<eos> So I have a deal for you.<eos> Hmm. Well, I'm a dealer.<eos> We can talk about it.<eos> I've been called a lot of ugly names over the years, Communist, socialist, racist, fascist...<eos> None of which is true, of course.<eos> Well I'm certainly not a communist.<eos> You just admire their architecture.
We both need him gone.<eos> The question is, how do we accomplish that?<eos> He's got an army around him.<eos> We need something tempting enough so that Crain uses his men to go after it.<eos> - What do you have in mind?<eos> - Your submarine pen.<eos> Have them search for weapons, treasure...<eos> Your corpse.<eos> What?<eos> You'll have to die.
Were there any survivors?<eos> No.<eos> So Bishop never made it.<eos> Even legends die.<eos> Dear Mei.<eos> I'm back in Cambodia with the kids.<eos> The water filter's working.<eos> Thank you so much for your generous gift.<eos> You have to come here someday.<eos> I think you'd like it a lot.
What, what?<eos> - The girl.<eos> It's all about the girl, isn't it?<eos> - Yeah, the girl, yeah.<eos> - And you're gonna use somebody else's art to get her?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> We're just starting.<eos> We need to learn how to play.<eos> Did the Sex Pistols know how to play?<eos> You don't need to know how to play.
Cool.<eos> You've got really good cheekbones.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you should let me do your makeup.<eos> - Really? -Yeah.<eos> Now this light's gonna be really harsh on camera.<eos> It'll take the edge off.<eos> I'm actually wearing some right now.<eos> In fact, you should all be wearing makeup.
See you.<eos> Let's make another video sometime.<eos> Nice blouse!<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> You have to imagine it's not as...<eos> Shit?<eos> This will be good.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You just need some proper cameras and a good director.
But once...<eos> I was a fucking jet engine!<eos> Back in a second.<eos> Need to go to the bathroom.<eos> Ngig.<eos> Can you move that mic stand over<eos> - a bit more, all right?<eos> - Are you expecting her soon?<eos> I thought she was coming, but I don't know where she is.<eos> Right, so you better get something filmed.
How are you, Kim?<eos> Welcome to the Stan.<eos> My name's Nic.<eos> I'll be doing your security.<eos> I'll take your bag.<eos> Fahim.<eos> The police are giving me shit for parking here.<eos> They just want money.<eos> Wait, oh, no.<eos> Do you need money?
Thanks, Fahim.<eos> You really are a fixer.<eos> Moon's out.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Suck my dick!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means, "What a terrible event!"<eos> Miss Baker.<eos> Colonel Hollanek is coming to Norton tomorrow to check on some of our PRT work.<eos> And you and your crew are clear to tag along.
And I'm black.<eos> The Russians are blacks now.<eos> If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.<eos> Kim, I was talking to some of the younger men.<eos> They say the Taliban came at night.<eos> I don't care. No.<eos> I drank too much water and I have to pee.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> I am engaged to be married.<eos> Okay, Fahim, I know you like your women to be, like, beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?
I am engaged to be married.<eos> Okay, Fahim, I know you like your women to be, like, beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?<eos> But we urinate, Doctor.<eos> Out of our vaginas.<eos> You think you urinate out the...<eos> No.<eos> I know it's a separate thing!<eos> God!<eos> Just please help me.<eos> There is nowhere for you to go.
Shit.<eos> You wish to interview me, Mr. Ahmadzai?<eos> I do, Mr. Sadiq.<eos> Yes, on camera.<eos> Mr. Ahmadzai, I am a person of, of no consequence.<eos> Well, you soon might be the second most powerful person in Afghanistan.<eos> Mr. Ahmadzai, I run a small department inside the Interior Ministry.<eos> What possible interest could I be to the Americans?<eos> Because your Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and the Encouragement of Virtue sounds a lot like the Taliban's old Ministry of Vice and Virtue.<eos> Don't you think?
Kim Baker.<eos> When the Taliban was in power, they enforced their version of sharia.<eos> One of their edicts was a rule that all men must shave the hair of their pubis.<eos> They would walk the streets carrying a small wooden rod, a dowel, which they would roll along the front of a man's trousers.<eos> If a man's pubic hair was long enough to curl around the dowel, they would beat him.<eos> Now, I ask you, do I look like a man to walk the streets carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?<eos> No, sir, you do not.<eos> I returned to this country to save it.<eos> I am a friend of America.<eos> Which is why you should let me interview you, so people can understand that.

When was the last time I saw you?<eos> Since June?<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't get back last month.<eos> I can be in New York by Thursday.<eos> I miss you and I want to see you.<eos> And I...<eos> I have...<eos> Not again.<eos> I hate this fucking airport.<eos> Can I bring you guys anything from New York?
Can I bring you guys anything from New York?<eos> Just bring us back a six pack?<eos> - This is Kim.<eos> - Kim Baker?<eos> It is Sadiq.<eos> Mr. Sadiq, hi.<eos> How about an interview with Pacha Khan?<eos> Pacha Khan, the warlord?<eos> Pacha Khan is a businessman.<eos> Would you like that?
That sucks.<eos> That sucks for women.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Congratulations on your promotion,<eos> - Mr. Attorney General.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> As I said, we could have done this over the phone.<eos> I'm just looking for a statement on sharia in Kandahar.<eos> I understand that you are no longer with your special friend Chris.<eos> Who told you that?

Dolphins?<eos> What a joke.<eos> I'll come with you in the car if there's room.<eos> Oh, great, we're all going to Kandahar!<eos> I can make some calls.<eos> We can take my car.<eos> Kim, if we are going to Kandahar, you will need to buy some new clothes.<eos> I can't...<eos> It's so pretty, I don't even want to vote.<eos> I'm flipping you the bird in here right now.
Hey, it's all right.<eos> Oi.<eos> Now, that there was a bit of fun.<eos> - Are you mental?<eos> - Okay, mate...<eos> I'm not your mate.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again, are you fucking mental?<eos> - Come on, Iain, it's not his fault.<eos> - What's your job again?<eos> Because if I hadn't come back to see you lot because I stole a bottle of sake from a Japanese travel writer...
Jerry's expecting you.<eos> Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.<eos> - Can I take your bag?<eos> - Yes. Please.<eos> - Would you care for some water?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I should've Googled you.<eos> I've been... I've been using all the wrong swear words.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't ruin your big moment.<eos> Look, Geri, I don't know what Tucker has been telling you.
Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.<eos> - Can I take your bag?<eos> - Yes. Please.<eos> - Would you care for some water?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I should've Googled you.<eos> I've been... I've been using all the wrong swear words.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't ruin your big moment.<eos> Look, Geri, I don't know what Tucker has been telling you.<eos> He said that you're upset about the air time you're getting.
I'd like to rent a car.<eos> Aye, thank you.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> Thank you. Thanks a lot.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Welcome to Glasgow International Airport.<eos> Outside temperature's 18 degrees Celsius.<eos> Local time is 15 hours.<eos> There will be an airline representative to assist you to your luggage.
The whole point of kidnapping is to get money, right?<eos> As far as I understand, Iain was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Can this half-assed country not even do kidnapping right?<eos> ISAF does not think this was an upper-tier organization.<eos> So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.<eos> Now is when you're supposed to say "I told you so".
You know, especially with SEALs and Delta out there.<eos> I mean, what week goes by they don't see those assholes on TV, am I right?<eos> And then next time Congress votes on a Pentagon budget and there's this pesky little 10% line item for the Marines, next thing you know, you guys are just part of the Navy.<eos> Although, sir, you would look spectacular in one of those pretty white uniforms.<eos> God, you know what?<eos> It's just occurring to me that, unlike JSOC, you guys allow reporter embeds.<eos> Which means that a cameraman could go on a FORECON mission.<eos> Don't you think that would be great for the Corps, sir?<eos> That kind of exposure?<eos> Pretty good for you, too.
We're not likely to get an address, but...<eos> When you have something concrete, come back and we'll get kinetic.<eos> Please tell Mr. Sadiq that his "special friend" is here.<eos> What can I get for you?<eos> Some tea?<eos> The new PlayStation?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I just need a moment of your time.<eos> We still friends, Sadiq?<eos> Well, that is up to you, Kim.
Good on ya, Kim!<eos> Let's go, load up!<eos> Let's go, move, move, move!<eos> You drink Tennessee whiskey, Miss Baker?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> Tall Brian?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hang tight, sir.<eos> I'm gonna get you that ride.
Take the opportunity to make your case.<eos> We're all open to hearing your arguments.<eos> If they're valid and you persuade us, I'm sure we'd all be willing to change our minds.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Use your words.<eos> Ah!<eos> Yes!<eos> Thanks, dad! You're welcome.<eos> You guys need a hand?
I tell the truth to my kids.<eos> Protecting children from certain concepts that they are too young to understand is not lying to them. Guys!<eos> We have neighbors, okay?<eos> Look, it's a... it's a very hard time right now.<eos> Everybody's still a little raw.<eos> Can we just try to, come on, put this to bed, all right?<eos> I apologize.<eos> I'm sorry for not respecting the way you guys do things in your home.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> I know Leslie had been sick for a long time, but I cannot imagine how difficult this time must be for you.
They told me that she also loved gardening and classical music, particularly Glenn Gould's versions of the Goldberg variations.<eos> She also liked walks in the moonlight on the beach.<eos> And she loved her husband Ben and their children...<eos> First of all, Leslie practiced buddhism, which to her was a philosophy and not an organized religion.<eos> In fact, Leslie abhorred all organized religions.<eos> To her, they were the most dangerous fairy tales ever invented, designed to elicit blind obedience and strike fear into the hearts of the innocent and the uninformed.<eos> To her, the only thing worse than death would have been the knowledge that her rotting flesh was to be trapped for all eternity inside a big box... and buried in the middle of a fucking golf course.<eos> Although the absurdity of being eulogized by someone that didn't even know her has exactly the kind of comedic flourish that Leslie would have cherished.<eos> If nothing else, she had a sense of humor.<eos> I want to read something to all of you, so you'll know what I mean.
She's going to need a neck brace and a cast, but otherwise she's fine.<eos> Uh, this is the top vertebrae here.<eos> This dark line... it's hard to see... but that's the fracture line.<eos> What was she doing on a roof?<eos> Just playing.<eos> Well, for a girl her age she's unusually strong.<eos> Yeah. There's seven vertebrae in the neck.<eos> A break to any of the first four, a tear to the spinal cord...<eos> I mean, if this had happened just a few millimeters lower, we'd be talking about death or paralysis.<eos> You're a very lucky man.
I'm gonna call it a night.<eos> Sure, Dad.<eos> I'm a little tuckered out myself.<eos> Well, I will see you all in the morning.<eos> Would you like to share a cab?<eos> That would be fine.<eos> Where are you staying?<eos> I'm at the Westin.<eos> Well, so am I.<eos> Could I interest you in a nightcap?
You're in my car.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wait, he's...<eos> He's not moving.<eos> Did they bring my guitar?<eos> Nice to see you, too.<eos> Sorry, I'm not exactly myself this morning.<eos> That's a matter of opinion.<eos> - They brought it to me.<eos> - To you?
Right, yeah.<eos> Okay, mate.<eos> It's all right.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Allergic.<eos> Animals.<eos> -Ironic, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You should go.
22 pounds.<eos> I thought she said this place was free.<eos> Not the drugs.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> Hang on.<eos> That's all I've got.<eos> Come on, he's really sick.<eos> All right, wait.<eos> - This is my food money for the next week.<eos> - It's up to you.
Thank you very much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I hope you don't mind I got Bob a little something for Christmas.<eos> Look at that, Bob!<eos> You want a bit of that?<eos> - And I made him a little something.<eos> - You shouldn't have.
If I do, then I'll get arrested again.<eos> And then I don't know what will even happen to Bob.<eos> If you can't sing, you can't make any money.<eos> And if you do sing, you'll get arrested.<eos> And all you're thinking about is what happens to the cat!<eos> When you sell our magazine, you get out what you put in.<eos> You know how they say weed is a gateway drug?<eos> Yeah, I'm a little familiar with the concept.<eos> Well, The Big Issue is a gateway opportunity.<eos> I'll start you off with a handful of free ones.
Well, The Big Issue is a gateway opportunity.<eos> I'll start you off with a handful of free ones.<eos> Just like a pusher, right?<eos> You sell them, the next ones you buy from us.<eos> Sell those, make a little profit, buy even more.<eos> After a while, you get better territories, work your way up, etcetera.<eos> Before you know it, you're Rupert Murdock except not a dickhead.<eos> If you can't sell them, we don't buy them back.<eos> So you gotta plan.<eos> You get one designated territory.
- This is your official ID.<eos> - What animal?<eos> I don't see an animal.<eos> This is my co-pilot.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look this way.<eos> Say "cheese," Bob.<eos> You know what?<eos> I might have just the right thing for you two.
Come on, Bob, look at the camera.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> He wants to give you a high-five.<eos> High-five, Bob.<eos> - High-five there.<eos> - That's £2.50.<eos> I've only got £2.30. ls that all right?<eos> - I can see that's £2.50.<eos> -l'll owe it to you.
- Can I take a picture of you and your cat?<eos> - Please?<eos> - Yeah, sure. Sure.<eos> It's okay, Bob.<eos> He likes your hat.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Can we buy a magazine?<eos> Sorry, it's not my patch.<eos> You've got to speak to that guy.
- Thank you.<eos> Can we buy a magazine?<eos> Sorry, it's not my patch.<eos> You've got to speak to that guy.<eos> We really wanna help.<eos> - You can't--<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Have a great day. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> And you.
- He's not for sale.<eos> Obviously this isn't the best environment for an animal...<eos> - Please. -...<eos> living on the street and all.<eos> - Yes, all right, darling.<eos> - We've got a flat--<eos> We'd be able to give him all the things you can't...<eos> -... like a decent home.<eos> - He's not for sale.<eos> - I'm sure you could use cash.
Luckily for me I had some very important companions to help with my second chance.<eos> And then she said to just tell the truth.<eos> And that's what I've done.<eos> - Absolutely loved it, mate.<eos> Well done.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Little paw print there.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - You enjoy that?
Nothing is the same.<eos> And we have a lot of catching up to do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Come on, man!<eos> - Right, man.<eos> - Hey! Sorry to interrupt the love fest, but, uh, we got to get out of here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, Chunk.<eos> Mike, I really want to thank you and the guys for saving me from that contraption back there.
Hey, what are you guys doing?<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> - He's still delirious.<eos> - Bring him in here.<eos> Get down! Get down!<eos> Sir?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You have a visitor.
The body count was immense and there was no cure.<eos> It's bad shit.<eos> We tracked the source of the Tall Man... and we've been fighting him ever since.<eos> But...<eos> You know, I'd never stop looking for you, Reg.<eos> What a fine use of our time that was.<eos> You know what? I cannot tolerate this anymore. I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here. I'm done, okay.<eos> Fire in the motherfucking hole.<eos> You have a visitor.
- You know this is a trap.<eos> - Well, I... we got him just where he wants us.<eos> Boy!<eos> My need for you is now finished.<eos> Mike!<eos> Okay, then, let her go.<eos> That loyalty again.<eos> You can use your weapons, but all you destroy is this flimsy skin sack.<eos> There are thousands of me... tens of thousands.<eos> I'm in dimensions you cannot possibly imagine.
She just quit.<eos> She what?<eos> She just told me she got another job.<eos> Shame.<eos> I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.<eos> Mmm.<eos> So did I.<eos> - Hey, it's Tom.<eos> - Sorry I missed you.<eos> I'll get right back to you.
I need you to focus here.<eos> Don't fucking talk to me like that!<eos> Rachel.<eos> There you are.<eos> Cathy, I'm sorry.<eos> I need to get my shit together.<eos> You must be Ms. Watson.<eos> I'm Detective Riley.<eos> This is Detective Gaskill.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.
It wasn't him.<eos> This man was different and they were kissing.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?<eos> You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband?<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night.<eos> Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson.<eos> Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child.<eos> Let me give you some advice.
Don't go back to Beckett Road.<eos> Don't contact your ex-husband.<eos> Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby.<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> You don't live there anymore.<eos> Stay away.<eos> You know, I lie all the time.<eos> I lie to Scott.<eos> I lie to you.
Fuck.<eos> Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> It could...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's a good thing.<eos> Could mean she's all right.<eos> She just ran off with someone.<eos> Right.<eos> Has she talked to you?
Oh, no.<eos> Um, I haven't heard anything.<eos> You know her well enough to know where we live.<eos> Megan doesn't have many friends.<eos> Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and I...<eos> We took... We took...<eos> We took Pilates together.<eos> I think I should go.<eos> I feel like I've taken up too much of your time.<eos> So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way...
You're experiencing blackouts?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> Do you wanna tell me about them?<eos> Mmm...<eos> Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done,<eos> it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do.<eos> I feel bad about it, but, um...<eos> But it's like it's so far removed that I have a...<eos> I just don't feel bad enough.<eos> You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it.
Look, um...<eos> Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree. But these are texts, they're not threats.<eos> She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house.<eos> A lot.<eos> Yeah. I'm aware.<eos> There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much.<eos> If you could bring me something more solid...<eos> What more do you need?
I can smell her skin.<eos> I can feel how cold she was.<eos> Forgive yourself.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of being alone.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You and your baby will be fine.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I could ask you the same question.
Lady, I live here.<eos> I'm always in that tunnel.<eos> But what did you see?<eos> What happened that night?<eos> What did you see?<eos> All right.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You busted your ass.<eos> You fell.<eos> I felt sorry for you. I tried to help you up.
Come back to bed.<eos> Whore!<eos> Rachel's down there.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Come here.<eos> Hey, get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here!<eos> You're okay.<eos> You just need some help.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> You just need to get a little help up.
Yes... I'll hold.<eos> Sounds like somebody's choking back there.<eos> Okay, chérie.<eos> Maurice, meet my friend Vincent he's also from Paris.<eos> My love!<eos> I'm bored.<eos> Dance with me.<eos> You're utterly crazy, Madame Berne.<eos> Yes.<eos> You could do with being a little crazy yourself.
Have you been waiting long?<eos> Herr Hobar will see you now.<eos> My husband's trying to cut down.<eos> He says the war makes everyone smoke too much.<eos> I've only heard good things about him around town.<eos> Good things.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Your husband doesn't speak English?<eos> Only a little.<eos> Your wife has asked if she could bring you to the Ambassador's Ball tomorrow.
That's rather poetic.<eos> Oh, for goodness sake!<eos> Honestly, I'll miss the Blitz.<eos> I will. No one cares who does what to who.<eos> So we should be drinking to war.<eos> And freedom.<eos> - To war!<eos> - To freedom.<eos> Marianne, I would offer you my congratulations, but I've known Max a long time.<eos> I'll just wish you good luck.
Yes, everything crosses my fucking desk.<eos> Max, this is now an operational mission.<eos> If Marianne is indeed a German spy...<eos> - My wife is not a spy!<eos> - If she is, we need to keep her in place for 72 hours so that we can identify her handler and clean out the rest of her circuit.<eos> No.<eos> Now we've got that out of the way, perhaps we could discuss the operational details of the next 72 hours?<eos> So, this is gonna be a standard "blue-dye" procedure, blue dye being...<eos> I know what a "blue-dye" is.<eos> Tonight, you will receive a telephone call at exactly 2307. Repeat the time, Wing Commander.
You will take the call and you will write down a message somewhere your wife can read it.<eos> It'll be false information, only you will have it.<eos> But it'll appear to be of a high grade, so she will have to pass it on quickly.<eos> By midday on Monday, our agents will have decoded enemy traffic from the weekend.<eos> So if the false information is among the batches sent from London, we shall know for sure.<eos> If you are right, Max, the information won't appear on the transcripts, and all this will be forgotten.<eos> But if it is proven that your wife is a spy,<eos> routine procedures in cases of intimate betrayal will apply.<eos> You will execute her with your own hand, and if we discover that you are an accomplice in any way, you will be hanged for high treason.<eos> Wing Commander Vatan, do you understand?
We'll need to get some drinks for tomorrow night.<eos> I'll pick some up in the morning.<eos> It's like they're watching us.<eos> Honey... Honey, give me my arm. Honey, give me my arm.<eos> Hampstead 235.<eos> Wing Commander Vatan.<eos> - Honey, do you have a pen?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Yeah, I got it. I'll dispatch it in the morning.<eos> Don't think I'm going to let you sleep, Mr. Vatan.
Sinners don't make demands.<eos> They make confessions.<eos> Septa Unella.<eos> Our other guests need you.<eos> There.<eos> Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.<eos> I'll speak with her.<eos> My brother, can you tell me how he is?<eos> It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.<eos> Your husband misses you dearly.
You're not our prince.<eos> My son Trystane...<eos> Your son is weak just like you.<eos> And weak men will never rule Dorne again.<eos> I told you I'm not hungry.<eos> We're not here to feed you.<eos> We're here to kill you.<eos> You want her to do it or me?<eos> We are family.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
Got the deposition tomorrow and I need you to cover this.<eos> Get Jake Coburn in legal.<eos> I want a strategy before I leave.<eos> Sir, we advise you against answering any questions at this time.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Emily?<eos> Emily!<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> Emily!<eos> I'm gonna grab you some dinner.
I'll call in the usual.<eos> Don't step anywhere inside this house. Don't touch anything.<eos> Get security up here right now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> So there was no more contact after you left the park?<eos> I figured it was just another call for attention.<eos> That's all.<eos> Yeah, it could be.<eos> Jane is the advisor we retained. Private org. Kidnap and Rescue.<eos> I should advise you, sir, to involve the FBI.
We'll have snipers cover the exterior.<eos> Snipers?<eos> We don't need snipers.<eos> I've got the cash.<eos> Let's do this civilly and quietly.<eos> I'm right behind you.<eos> You tailing him?<eos> Yeah, I've got eyes on him.<eos> Do not turn around. Do not acknowledge that you can hear me.<eos> Wait for them to approach you, Mr. Denning.
You tailing him?<eos> Yeah, I've got eyes on him.<eos> Do not turn around. Do not acknowledge that you can hear me.<eos> Wait for them to approach you, Mr. Denning.<eos> You have him?<eos> He's out of my line of sight, Jane.<eos> Relax.<eos> I know this is hard, but I need you to stay calm as ice.<eos> Approaching on your right.<eos> She remind you of someone you know?
I'm worth this case.<eos> You know why that's worth 68 grand?<eos> Because it has a reputation. It has a name brand. It has an identity.<eos> We get a case like this, a litigation at this level, I need lawyers who kill.<eos> Lawyers with reputations walk into a courtroom and intimidate.<eos> I don't see you in that picture, Mr. Cahill.<eos> Mr. Abrams, I fight to win.<eos> Some of your other senior partners like Hill, they're a little soft.<eos> They work within limits.<eos> You need someone who isn't afraid of the wrong thing... for the right reasons.
Five maybe?<eos> A decade's worth.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Why do we use so much paper?<eos> I mean, do we really need to print out this much?<eos> Electronic copies can be tampered with.<eos> Until the courts figure that nonsense out, this firm uses paper.<eos> We depose Denning in two days.<eos> This is three weeks' worth of research to comb through. You need a strategy.

You taught me that.<eos> Okay, we are under compulsory evidence origin disclosure order.<eos> Okay, in a case this massive, all evidence has to be obtained legally.<eos> Look, if I caught this trail, others will, too.<eos> Okay, you gotta get your shit in order. Just listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> The entire case rests on this.<eos> We have a case here, and we're gonna win it.<eos> Yeah, well, you are playing with fire.<eos> Okay, I don't know what's going on between you two, but you gotta stop it.
Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Don't ask a question you already know the answer to.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> You made an enemy you don't want.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Why don't you tell Arthur Denning that this is some real amateur-hour bullshit.<eos> What do you want?
Don't ask a question you already know the answer to.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> You made an enemy you don't want.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Why don't you tell Arthur Denning that this is some real amateur-hour bullshit.<eos> What do you want?<eos> For you to drop this case.<eos> I'm not dropping this case.<eos> You will recuse yourself and resign from your firm.
These are for me to remember you by.<eos> Get off me.<eos> I thought you said we were just getting started.<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> Now, before I call the cops and show them how bad you beat me.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Get it together.<eos> Sir, this is Dr. Kroeher.<eos> I can understand what you must be going through. It's a lot to handle, but I can tell you this.
I want you to leave.<eos> Now, before I call the cops and show them how bad you beat me.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Get it together.<eos> Sir, this is Dr. Kroeher.<eos> I can understand what you must be going through. It's a lot to handle, but I can tell you this.<eos> You won't survive another day without coming in.<eos> Doesn't matter if it's this hospital or not.<eos> You need medical attention.
It's the only lead I got. And what if it doesn't lead anywhere?<eos> In the next few days, they're gonna find Emily's body.<eos> The police are gonna get involved and I'll have to admit everything.<eos> So what do we do until then?<eos> We act as normal as possible, okay?<eos> You go to work. I go to work. Until I can figure something out, we'll just leave her there.<eos> Do you want some coffee?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> She remind you of someone you know? Yeah.
I'd prefer if we spoke off the record.<eos> Okay.<eos> New events have come to light that change the nature of this allegation.<eos> Such as?<eos> Well, I could elaborate, but I would prefer if Mr. Cahill did.<eos> It's curious, isn't it, that she was drawn to us both?<eos> What the hell you talking about?<eos> What is this?<eos> I understand you're in possession of files that were illegally stolen from my computer.<eos> Everything was obtained legally and submitted to you in discovery.

Did you two have sex regularly?<eos> How is that relevant?<eos> Well, she's still missing, so everything is.<eos> She mixed quite a cocktail for herself.<eos> Oxy, Rits, Vics, Ads, uptake inhibitors, and a whole lot of colors I have never seen before.<eos> So what are you getting at?<eos> Well, she either spontaneously developed every mental disorder on the planet, or something in her life, maybe someone, was scaring her.<eos> Yeah, I know what you're getting at.<eos> I own a pharmaceutical company, but I didn't prescribe those, okay?<eos> So why aren't you out there looking for her?

It doesn't seem like you even care if we find her.
Oh, I just spent three hours with detectives.<eos> I don't know if there's anything more I can say.<eos> We just have a few more questions.<eos> Did your husband ever mention Emily Hynes before?<eos> I'm sorry. Who exactly are you'?<eos> I'm her attorney.<eos> Joe Bilson.<eos> My associate, Jane Clemente, Kidnap and Rescue.<eos> So you're not cops?<eos> We're privately contracted by Arthur Denning... She has no comment, and you have no place being here, so I suggest you leave.
My associate, Jane Clemente, Kidnap and Rescue.<eos> So you're not cops?<eos> We're privately contracted by Arthur Denning... She has no comment, and you have no place being here, so I suggest you leave.<eos> You do realize the woman discovered dead in this house was a woman her husband was having an affair with?<eos> Mr. Denning is willing to offer aid in her legal expenses if she's willing to help us find him.<eos> You're not gonna touch her.<eos> We spoke with Emily's neighbor. What was her name?<eos> Amy Campbell.<eos> Seems Ms. Campbell saw Ben at Emily's loft on numerous occasions.<eos> Ms. Cahill, you may think you have the complete picture, but you don't.
Come on. Don't die on me. Come on.<eos> Oh. God... Don't die on me now.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Next time, you should phone me before you come here.<eos> Article 7-14 of the standard practice of Code of Ethics says we may not talk off the record.<eos> All right, here's what's gonna go down.<eos> We're gonna settle.<eos> I'm gonna give you everything that I got, all the evidence that we got against you, legal, illegal.<eos> And the manner in which you were able to cover up all the shit that you've done.<eos> I'd love to help you but there's just one small problem.
Reputation, Mr. Cahill, is an idle impression, is "oft got without merit, lost without deserving."<eos> There's some Shakespeare for you.<eos> - Yeah. - Can you handle it?<eos> I'll take care of my reputation.<eos> What's gonna really bog us down now, buddy is you thinking, having the audacity and the profound ignorance to think you can take me down.<eos> We got company.<eos> The State of Louisiana from 1979 till now, has executed 659 criminals, some of them guilty, with eight waiting in line, queued up, ready to go next.<eos> I'm waiting for you to join them.<eos> My profound ignorance uncovered something.<eos> You been working with Arthur Denning the whole time, taking bribes, throwing cases for him for years. And now he's hanging you out to dry. You are done.

He thinks he gave me the slip.<eos> And why are you so sure he's wrong?<eos> There was this man early on in the crossing and he and Robbie were arguing, and the man pushed Robbie and Robbie fell, and other people saw this, not just me.<eos> And we were going to get off the boat together.<eos> He said he'd show me around.<eos> And you've got no way of contacting him?<eos> You haven't got a phone number, or...? He had mine.<eos> Right, look, I don't have his number.<eos> I don't know where he lived.<eos> I don't even know his last name, but I am telling you... he never got off that ferry.
Oh, aye? Where is she from?<eos> SHE is from Glasgow.<eos> Lowrie, do you know a man called Craig Cooper?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you had any contact with him in the last few days?<eos> Yes.<eos> Could you... elaborate?<eos> Well, he brought me a deer back from Aberdeen.<eos> It had been hit... by a car.<eos> Why would you want a deer?
He tried to make out like it was no big deal, but... you could see that he was shaky and upset.<eos> He said that he wanted a drink, so we got some beers and started talking.<eos> I think that Robbie felt safer with other people around... in case the man came back.<eos> So we talked and... you know.<eos> Hung out and... at some point, I fell asleep.<eos> And when I woke up, Robbie was gone.<eos> Go on.<eos> He said he'd show me around... so I waited... but he never got off the boat.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is there anything else you want to add?
Okay, I'm Detective Inspector Perez.<eos> Do you have records as to who you sold those to?<eos> Actually, they weren't sold.<eos> I gave them to a friend.<eos> - Well, would you mind telling me who?<eos> Michael, this is Detective Inspector Perez.<eos> He's been asking about your rings.<eos> Yeah, we're looking for someone who was involved in some minor altercation on the ferry the night before last...<eos> - somebody that fits your description. - Oh.<eos> - I just want to ask you a few questions.
Flower arranging. Of course, sir.<eos> I'll chase it up.<eos> It's just you and Miss..?<eos> Brawton, Roselle.<eos> And Mr. Swopes.<eos> My brother-in-law. He's a mute.<eos> His lungs.<eos> He was home on leave when Coventry got bombed.<eos> Wonderful what the surgeons can do, but even so. So what?<eos> He helps you out, does he?
Her boyfriend said she came up and helped out with your act. - Really? - You don't remember her, then?<eos> - No. I'm sorry.<eos> - No.<eos> All right, thank you, Mr. Newton. That'll be all for now.<eos> Next!<eos> This way, sir.<eos> Miss Hicks?<eos> I'm only to use it in an emergency.<eos> Any message, if I find him?<eos> I'll leave you to get on, Miss.
What happened, I...<eos> I can't change yesterday, but... ..a better tomorrow, yes?<eos> - For all of us. - Sir.<eos> I think I met Bixby. Briefly.<eos> Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.<eos> And there was never anything between you? No.<eos> Not on my part.<eos> And there's no reason you can think of why he'd have a photograph of you on his bedroom wall.<eos> None.<eos> You told someone last night that you believed your husband was involved with a bus conductress. - I told Morse that in confidence.

A friend.<eos> Elva Piper.<eos> Friends like that.<eos> Did Miss Piper give you the name of this woman?
Tony Donn and my wife will confirm that.<eos> What about Thursday?<eos> Play any golf, my Lord?<eos> I'm afraid I side with those that think it's a good walk spoiled.<eos> And the evening?<eos> I had some drinks in town with Tony. - Why?<eos> - There was a woman found dead Good Friday morning on the Lake Road about two miles from here. Jeannie Hearne.<eos> Did you know her?<eos> No.<eos> Whatever gave you that idea?
If you would be so good.<eos> Your brother-in-law, Mr. Swopes, might he have seen anything?<eos> He would have been backstage, preparing the props for the next bit of the show.<eos> Anyway, his eyesight is rather poor.<eos> We can agree that this pistol has worked.<eos> Roselle.<eos> Inspector.<eos> You must stay perfectly still.<eos> Behold.<eos> I show you a mystery.
Yeah, I hears it right now.<eos> What does the dream say?<eos> Well... The boy, he's dreaming that the tellyphony is ringing in his house.<eos> His da, he answers it and he says,<eos> "Yes, this is Mr. Goulash speaking."<eos> And then, he's gasping like he has a lobster stuck in his throat.<eos> And he's saying, "Who?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, sir, I understand.<eos> "But, surely, sir, it is me you wish to be speaking to, not my little boy."
Well, no, it couldn't be could it, ma'am?<eos> Draw the curtains.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Oh!<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> There's a small girl standing on the window sill.<eos> Is there not, Mr. Tibbs?<eos> There is indeed, ma'am.<eos> She is standing right there, ma'am.<eos> You didn't dream it.
Stand down, gentlemen, please.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Dear, come here.<eos> Your Majesty, I am your humble servant.<eos> Your Majester, I is your humbug servant.<eos> I'm so pleased to make your acquaintance.<eos> Oh, Majester.<eos> Oh, Monacher.<eos> Oh, ruler of... straight lines.<eos> I's come, with my little friend Sophie to give you a...
You are in Bombay Hospital.<eos> Where's Michael?<eos> He's talking to the doctor.<eos> You are lucky to be alive, Mrs. Harwood.<eos> I just can't bear life without him.<eos> I had a daughter once.<eos> Anushka.<eos> She fell into a pond while trying to pick some plants.<eos> I was looking away for only one minute.<eos> What if I could bring your son back to you just one more time?

Take the ashes of your son... spread them on the steps of this temple... lock yourself inside... and when night comes... he will come to you.<eos> And you will be able to talk to him through the door of the temple... say your final goodbye.<eos> I will leave you two alone.<eos> I was so scared I lost you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> If we do this... you have to promise me one thing.<eos> When Oliver comes to you at the temple, you will be able to speak to him.
Are you coming out to play, Stanley?<eos> I can't.<eos> Someone painted the wall pink...<eos> I got the blame.<eos> Detective Calamity at your service, sir.<eos> Do we have any clues?<eos> He did it!<eos> He did it!<eos> What is it, Winston?<eos> Sounds like you need a detective.
She is here to take Oliver back to the world of the dead.<eos> And she will destroy anything that comes in her way.<eos> Oliver is no longer your son, Mrs. Harwood.<eos> Do you understand what I am telling you?<eos> He is evil.<eos> Burn every possession of his.<eos> Destroy every photograph.<eos> Get rid of anything which is an anchor for him to this life... and pray that he will return to the world of the dead.<eos> You are out of your mind.<eos> I should never have told you about the temple!

Okay.<eos> Are you all right, sweetheart?<eos> Mommy was hurting me.<eos> No, no.<eos> Mommy's just not herself right now.<eos> But she loves you very much.<eos> And so do I.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're going on a little adventure.<eos> What do you want?
Have you ever been trapped?
Let me..<eos> I'm not ready for this.<eos> Just take a deep breath.<eos> You have this.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> Okay, um..<eos> What do you have to say about your action?
- All right.<eos> - So I'm bipolar, right?<eos> It's too early to say for sure.<eos> But, you know, I do see serious signs of mixed episodes, meaning extremely high highs and very low lows.<eos> But, I happened to aggre with Dr. Samson.<eos> I mean, you have a lot of going on in your life right now.<eos> Sometimes they come across as manic and depressive elements.<eos> Typical of bipolar disorder.<eos> But just because you got a bruise on your face, doesn't mean you've been punched.<eos> So, I'm gonna give you a prescription for Olanzapine.
Can you simplify what you were saying?<eos> To put it simply, her brain is on fire and under attack from her own body.<eos> Okay, so what happens next?<eos> We can treat this.<eos> We got this in the very early stages.<eos> I think she will be fine.<eos> She will be getting 90% of her cognitive abilities back.<eos> So, we may get her fully back.<eos> As I said, Mr. Cahalan there's a serious possibility, but let's just hope that her body welcomes the treatment.<eos> Thank you so much.
The thing is...<eos> It's complicated. It's a big step.<eos> Already it's complicated?<eos> It's a... small step... for humanity... but a big step... for a man.<eos> Oh, Mike, you really are a mess, you know?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This is Oxen... we don't see any guerillas in your area, Alpha Margo, but if you stick your heads up, they'll come looking for you,<eos> The new position for the extraction is away from their shelters... and sandstorms,<eos> We can't use helicopters and the mission doesn't include ground transportation.<eos> II you have to cross the desert... the dunes will keep changing shape... so the radio won't always work.
It's me. It's Mike.<eos> Copy.<eos> Copy, Alpha Margo 4...<eos> The convoy for the extraction is on the way.<eos> Echo Bravo 3 is coming in your direction, Sergeant...<eos> The convoy is requesting...<eos> Eco Bravo 3 and is still under fire. They are delayed.<eos> The new ETA for the extraction is now 17 hours.<eos> Did you copy that, Sergeant?<eos> You've got to last another 17 hours, Sergeant.
And you know the best thing in jail?<eos> Violent anal sex?<eos> Yeah, You are pretty quick for an American.<eos> Jimmy used to go out with this dancer,<eos> Jacqueline Hollis.<eos> Rumor is he shacked up with her.<eos> You have an address?<eos> No, but...<eos> I do know that she works at... the club "Knockout".<eos> This means that you, unfortunately, will have to
Rumor is he shacked up with her.<eos> You have an address?<eos> No, but...<eos> I do know that she works at... the club "Knockout".<eos> This means that you, unfortunately, will have to<eos> "Work".<eos> Don't talk to me like that. I will kick your ass to China.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Cocktail "Cocksucking Cowboys".<eos> My balls still hurt. And I didn't do you anything.
It's real.<eos> Going up.<eos> Playboy Mansion!<eos> Break!<eos> Whatever it is, it's happening down town 1pm tomorrow.<eos> Don't ask me what.<eos> Who is doing the driving?<eos> The guy is formerly known as prince.<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> Something I forgot to tell you:
Don't look at me:<eos> I hate murder.<eos> - Don't I Terry?<eos> - He hates murder.<eos> They really upsets me.<eos> But more important: where is the money?<eos> Stashed it.<eos> How much do you want?<eos> All of it.<eos> - Fuck you !
You have to do a lot better than that boys.<eos> It can get a lot worse, fagot.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Worse, you say?<eos> It can get a lot worse, haa?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna cut me?<eos> You gonna abuse me?<eos> You gonna rape me?<eos> Let me tell you a little secret.
You are pleasant company.<eos> Terry, that was sarcasm!<eos> The lowest form of humor, Bob.<eos> Sayonara!<eos> Arigato!<eos> Godbye!<eos> So Mangum got his sharks involved, huh.<eos> I must say, I am disappointed.<eos> I feel like you let me down.<eos> You can't harass people like that and think you can get away with it.
Not everything Bob says is true.<eos> Yes it is.<eos> That's my greatest fear actually. Death by a jellyfish.<eos> Your greatest fear is death by jellyfish?<eos> It is not funny.<eos> Random death by jellyfish..<eos> A friend of mine caught a jellyfish, put it in a jar, went out.<eos> And when he returned ... he reached for, what he thought, was a glass of water.<eos> And now he is dead!<eos> I am glad that you find it amusing.
So what do I know.<eos> I love this car.<eos> It's indestructible.<eos> Like I always say Bob:<eos> if it ain't broke Break it.<eos> Detectives ...<eos> Glad to see you again.<eos> Do you like westerns?<eos> I don't have your 800 thousand dollars.<eos> I was never going to give them to you.
Will you stop going on about that?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just a little Botox.<eos> It's your business.<eos> Very good.<eos> You seem surprised.<eos> Better like this?<eos> Michèle, some other time, I have to take off.<eos> No. not yet.<eos> My mother told you she's HIV-positive?
You bet it's interesting.<eos> Tell all.<eos> - Bubbly, 4 glasses.<eos> - No. a bottle!<eos> It's set in a time when dogs have been wiped out by a virus.<eos> So people have robotic canines as pets.<eos> The player's the Spartacus of the robot-dog world.<eos> Original.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I have something to tell you all.
- I mean, she's stable...<eos> - This is real?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No. I mean...<eos> There's no way she's faking it or playing it up?<eos> You're medically certain this is for real?<eos> I'm sorry, but yes it's for real.<eos> In fact, there's a strong probability your mother will not wake up.<eos> But as I say, she's stable right now.<eos> I suggest you get some rest.

Welcome to my home.<eos> Want to give it a try?<eos> No, thanks, I'm no gamer.<eos> Really?<eos> - I'd love a go.<eos> Show me?<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Can I get you a drink?
Have you met Richard?<eos> Some time ago, Richard pitched a very interesting idea.<eos> You two working together could make something fabulous of it.<eos> I think, at least.<eos> Talk it over.<eos> This isn't charity?<eos> You should know me better than that.<eos> Go on, tell him your idea.<eos> So, it's set in a...<eos> Let me get you a drink.
Hi.<eos> You found a buyer?<eos> I took a bit of a hit, but not too bad.<eos> The realtor did a great job.<eos> I'll give you his details. If ever you...<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Stuff piles up.<eos> I wanted you to know...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm very sorry for all you've been through.
I'm going to attempt not to kill you.<eos> That will have to do.<eos> To whom do you want us to offer safe haven and amnesty?<eos> - To Selene the Death Dealer.<eos> - The same Selene who murdered Viktor?<eos> I need no reminder, Cassius, of what she has done.<eos> Shame on you, sir.<eos> I will not hear her name spoken again.<eos> Cassius, I share your outrage.<eos> Whatever has possessed you?
I will not hear her name spoken again.<eos> Cassius, I share your outrage.<eos> Whatever has possessed you?<eos> If we don't act decisively... the war will be at your gate within a fortnight.<eos> And that is precisely where it will remain.<eos> No Lycan pack would dare to attack our coven.<eos> Our defenses would rip them apart.<eos> An ordinary Lycan pack, perhaps... but Marius has gathered a force far more powerful than any...<eos> Unsubstantiated hyperbole.<eos> You need Selene.
Find Selene, and we find her daughter.<eos> My own invention.<eos> One of the first things a Death Dealer must learn... is how to fight in a confined space.<eos> Of course, the one thing this training session lacks is unpredictability.<eos> Perhaps you'll indulge me and give my students... I should say your students. A lesson in combat's unpredictability.<eos> It would not only honor us, but it would be invaluable to their training.<eos> - I don't...<eos> That's enough.<eos> Gather round.<eos> We are going to school you... in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.
You think I can get a glass of water from you?<eos> - Where's your accent from?<eos> - I'm from Bakersfield, ma'am.<eos> - California.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You're a long way from home.<eos> Long way.<eos> But you gotta do what you gotta do, you know.<eos> Um, I'll get you guys a glass of water.
How long we walked now?<eos> Five, six miles?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - A little dehydrated, ain't you?<eos> Six or seven miles in this is pretty good.<eos> It could be worse, you know?<eos> - Okay, you can come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Just for a moment.<eos> - Thank you so much.
- A little dehydrated, ain't you?<eos> Six or seven miles in this is pretty good.<eos> It could be worse, you know?<eos> - Okay, you can come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Just for a moment.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Excuse the mess.<eos> Destiny had a birthday sleepover.<eos> I'll just grab you something to drink, and then you can tell me about the contest.
- Just for a moment.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Excuse the mess.<eos> Destiny had a birthday sleepover.<eos> I'll just grab you something to drink, and then you can tell me about the contest.<eos> Okay.<eos> - This is a beautiful house.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yeah. Thanks so much for letting us in.<eos> We have just about everything. What would you like?
Hey.<eos> I don't allow language like that in my house.<eos> Well, I don't live here.<eos> You know, it's been really hard for us emotionally since my mother threw herself in front of a cow truck about four years ago.<eos> We've been trying to acclimate.<eos> - That's not even funny.<eos> - Hard to adjust emotionally.<eos> No, it's not funny.<eos> I'm just trying to give her some insight as to why you're acting out.<eos> Okay, I think it's time for you to go.
I don't wanna take up too much of your time.<eos> I just wanted to come by, say hello, sorta give you an introduction as to who we are.<eos> We're coming from K State, we're doing a magazine drive, sort of gain some money for the new cafeteria we're trying to build.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I go to K State, and I haven't heard about this new cafeteria.<eos> Yeah, there's a new cafeteria they're building.<eos> They're trying do it altruistically as opposed to using like student funds.<eos> Oh!<eos> Trying to sorta see if we can get it from the community.<eos> It seems like you'd have to sell a lot to, you know, actually make enough to build a cafeteria.
You know where Zeke's Barbecue is?<eos> So maybe about three blocks around Zeke's Barbecue by the coin laundry, there's an apartment building there called The Magnolia.<eos> - Yeah, I'm not familiar with it.<eos> - It's a really nice area.<eos> - I love barbecue.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Does your husband love barbecue?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You're not gonna believe this, but there's an outdoor frontiersman magazine that basically is all about paleo diets and outdoor eating, which is a really nice pick, um, if you have any interest in that.
Don't say anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> # We gotta keep on dreaming<eos> # We gotta keep on dreaming<eos> # Dream on, dream, baby, dream<eos> # We gotta keep our hearts open<eos> # We gotta keep our hearts open<eos> # We gotta keep our hearts open<eos> # Dream on, dream, baby, dream<eos> You like that, huh?
And that's Frank.<eos> Jake's gone.<eos> I told him he can't come back again.<eos> Anyways...<eos> Hey, so this is all... Hey!<eos> - Krystal's fucking talking.<eos> - Yo, everybody.<eos> So this is all poor people.<eos> I've got family from here.<eos> It's just poor people like y'all, so they'll pity you because you're just like them.
You know, like something printed on a mug at Spencer's Gifts.<eos> Kind of funny in the store, but later on, it's something your friends think is really lame.<eos> Tribeca, we got him.<eos> Go in for the kill.<eos> Tell me, professor, would you ever blackmail someone with tattoos?<eos> Well, if he were in a position of power and I could stand to make a cool $4,000, you bet.<eos> Well, it looks like the Harlem Globetrotters are gonna have to find someone else in their audience to throw confetti on instead of water.<eos> Your blackmailing days are over.<eos> You won't get very far without this.<eos> You'll never take me alive!
This is going to be interesting.<eos> Okay, Saroo...<eos> Why did you choose this course?<eos> What else do you want to get out of it?<eos> Hi, Hey!<eos> - Welcome. - Come in.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> Do you guys like Indian food?
Jyn, if you're listening, my beloved... so much of my life has been wasted.<eos> I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong... because the pain of not having you with me... your mother, our family.<eos> The pain of that loss is so overwhelming... I risk failing even now.<eos> It's just so hard not to think of you.<eos> Think of where you are... my Stardust.<eos> Saw... the reactor module, that's the key.<eos> That's the place I've laid my trap.<eos> It's well hidden and unstable.<eos> One blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station.<eos> You'll need the plans... the structural plans for the Death Star, to find the reactor.
None of us could.<eos> It won't be comfortable.<eos> It'd be a bit cramped, but we'd all fit.<eos> We could go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Gear up.<eos> Grab anything that's not nailed down.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Jyn.<eos> I'll be there for you.
Rogue One, pulling away.<eos> Pulling away.<eos> Despite what the others say, war is inevitable.<eos> Yes, I agree.<eos> I must return to Alderaan to inform my people that there will be no peace.<eos> We will need every advantage.<eos> Your friend... the Jedi.<eos> He served me well during the Clone Wars... and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's purge.<eos> Yes, I will send for him.<eos> You will need someone you can trust.
Make 10 men feel like 100.<eos> And get those troopers away from us.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Keep the engine running.<eos> You're our only way outta here.<eos> Cargo shuttle SW-0608... be prepared to receive inspection team.<eos> Ready?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, you're probably looking for a manifest?
Fall out! Move, move, move!<eos> Help!<eos> Snowden? Where the fuck is Snowden?<eos> -Help!<eos> You know, you've been walkin' around on two broken legs, best I can tell, for weeks.<eos> Now, this is what happens when you put a 80 pound rucksack on a 150 pound body.<eos> You get these little stress fractures.<eos> -Easy. -Sorry.<eos> They build up in your tibias. You don't get off of them and eventually they just bust.<eos> Now you gonna be here for a few weeks, and then, I'd count on another eight weeks or so on crutches.
Atlas Shrugged? Yes, sir.<eos> I believe that.<eos> Let's try again.<eos> Why do you want to join the CIA?<eos> Uh, well frankly, sir... sounds really cool to have top security clearance.<eos> It's not enough.<eos> Ordinarily.<eos> But these are not ordinary times.<eos> Bombs won't stop terrorism, brains will, though we don't have nearly enough of those.<eos> I'm gonna give you a shot, Snowden. Thank your, sir.
Well then, Snowden. You've some to the whorehouse.<eos> The front lines in the global war on terror are not Iraq or Afghanistan.<eos> They're here.<eos> In London.<eos> Berlin.<eos> Istanbul.<eos> Any server.<eos> Any connection.<eos> The modern battlefield is everywhere.<eos> Which means you don't have to sit in a ditch eating MREs or dodging mortar fire.
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.<eos> Sherman says you hacked the Human Resources site.<eos> -Yeah, it's my job to find flaws.<eos> The security of the HR site is not your problem.<eos> You went outside the wheelhouse.<eos> Okay, but just to clarify, I did not hack.<eos> I showed that it could be hacked.<eos> You told me to find a patch.<eos> Do you have that in writing? -Yes, I do.<eos> Remember, I sent you the proof of concept.
Has anyone called here before? -Not once. Not in three weeks.<eos> Well, shall I answer it?<eos> Tell them it's a wrong number.<eos> Yes?<eos> No I don't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Asked if I wanted turndown service and she said the "do not disturb" sign was off the door.<eos> So?<eos> Do we wait or go on our own?<eos> Look, I said from the beginning that how you publish is your business and I trust you.
How'd you make out today, Corbin?<eos> -Aw, very mediocre.<eos> Nothing like Ed here.<eos> Apparently, the Army's training people to shoot straight<eos> -So this is Ed Snowden.<eos> Sir, a pleasure to meet you.<eos> -The brains behind Epic Shelter.<eos> It's brilliant work.<eos> -Thank you, sir.<eos> Yeah, I had a few questions I wanted to ask you.
-Yes, sir.<eos> How'd you like it?<eos> -It was a very empowering job, sir.<eos> With this new job in Hawaii, there'd be even more access.<eos> I asked Corbin to start the conversation, but the offer is mine.<eos> Take your time.<eos> It's gonna take a few months to get this program on its feet.<eos> You'll excuse me, gentlemen?<eos> I see dinner.<eos> Sir, for you?
Now I just pray that it's actually authentic.<eos> Are you actually questioning that?<eos> -No one has ever seen a FISA court order. There's no precedent here.<eos> Our source risked his life for that document.<eos> It's real.<eos> Tell us, did the White House make any specific claims about national security, that would prevent you from publishing?<eos> No.<eos> I asked them repeatedly.<eos> And they had no substantive answer.<eos> Then there you go. What more do you want?
You can always turn back.<eos> What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the qu<eos> Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?<eos> No, sir.<eos> -It does not?<eos> Not wittingly.<eos> There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps collect, but not--not wittingly.<eos> -Oh,really?<eos> Thank you. IÕll have additional questions to give you in writing on that point...<eos> Okay, so uh, what I wanted to show you guys is uh, this slide I ran across while building this indexing program.
He doesn't know about your heat map conversations or some of the ideas you've expressed to your colleagues.<eos> And he's not going to.<eos> -Yeah, uh...<eos> You know, Heartbeat is proving a tricky project.<eos> Collating from multiple agencies.<eos> And knowing where to pull from.<eos> It has helped to talk it over with colleagues.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> Which is why nothing to you after the derog in Geneva.<eos> And I'm very grateful you've looked out for me.
-Shh.<eos> MONDAY, June 10, 2013<eos> Ewen, I'm on the second floor.<eos> I don't see Tibbo.<eos> No, no-no, wait, I think I see him.<eos> Shit.<eos> There's press swarming all over the hotel.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> I'll figure it out and I'll stop them with a press conference or something.<eos> Look, we really appreciate this you're one of the best lawyers in Hong Kong.

I understand...<eos> Shit, they've spotted me.<eos> You guys get going.
These are good people. They won't talk.<eos> I've been handling their cases for years. They're like you.<eos> -That's so nice.<eos> They're stateless. -Yeah.<eos> So, we're waiting on the UN application for refugee status.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Just in case you're arrested, this is where you can call me.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> -Thank you so much.
- And they're either too hot or too cold.<eos> - I know, the quality has gone far and off.<eos> Oh, it's terrible and there's always people talking.<eos> - Many people. - Oh it's... I'm sorry.<eos> Just... hold on a second.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It's probably work.<eos> So you know, we love it.<eos> - It's so nice.<eos> - Well you have to come. You should come by.
Oh, please don't tell me that you found a toy.<eos> It's already bad enough that I'm going through Alison's panty drawer. I don't need to...<eos> It's locked.<eos> It's not here.<eos> I can't find a key anywhere.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Uh, I just realized none of us have had anything to eat since yesterday.<eos> Can I bring you guys something?
One day it just went up, you know...<eos> And, uh, yeah, it cost the guy his life and his life's work.<eos> So, kind of, I don't know, kind of makes you think, right?<eos> Not really, Chet.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> Kid.<eos> What?<eos> You know the guy who lived here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> What's it to you?
- What?<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it. Dad.<eos> Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.<eos> Sweetheart, how many times have I told you?<eos> Don't say "and stuff."<eos> Just say, "Dad, there are whores here."<eos> Well, there's like a ton.<eos> Wait.<eos> No. I can help you.
Now, we can do this the easy way or we can...<eos> We're currently doing it the easy way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus.<eos> The penthouse.<eos> She's in the penthouse, top floor.<eos> - Are you happy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Guys, listen.<eos> You...
We're currently doing it the easy way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus.<eos> The penthouse.<eos> She's in the penthouse, top floor.<eos> - Are you happy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Guys, listen.<eos> You...<eos> You don't wanna go up there, all right?
I made a film.<eos> I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.<eos> And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> - It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> We...<eos> We've actually met your mother.<eos> What did she tell you, that I'm crazy?
- I don't know.<eos> I think she's involved in something shady maybe.<eos> Well, her daughter certainly seems to think so.<eos> What, Amelia?<eos> You found Amelia?<eos> Yes.<eos> She fell on our car.<eos> We were just talking and she fell on our car.<eos> Anyway, she's here.<eos> You should come over.
- Thank you.<eos> - You mind fetching your dad?<eos> - Uh, he's running an errand.<eos> - Back anytime soon?<eos> - Oh, hour, tops.<eos> Fine.<eos> Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our patient?<eos> - That's her?<eos> - Oh, no, that's Jessica.<eos> What she's got you can't fix.
Please tell me they're at least gonna question her.<eos> They haven't and they're not going to.<eos> Because?<eos> Because she's the head of the Justice Department.<eos> Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome.<eos> You're out, free on your own recognisance.<eos> You get to walk.<eos> There should be like a statue of me in your fucking house.<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> You're gonna lose this one, all right?
Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome.<eos> You're out, free on your own recognisance.<eos> You get to walk.<eos> There should be like a statue of me in your fucking house.<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> You're gonna lose this one, all right?<eos> Your word against hers.<eos> No evidence.<eos> You lose.<eos> You better seriously think about changing your story.
It's spliced into the middle of it, right in the other film.<eos> Go get it.<eos> On my way.<eos> Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?<eos> I got a gun pointed directly at your daughter's spine.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> How does that song go?<eos> Welcome, Los Angeles, to the finest fleet of automobiles Detroit has to offer, giving the world luxury redefined.<eos> In addition to the most distinctive styling, we are bringing you interiors that are comfort assured, combining velour, leather, wood panelling and an improved...
Unbelievable.<eos> The America I love owes its life to the Big Three.<eos> But it's all right for you to fail your daughter?<eos> - Detroit had her killed.<eos> - I think I read about that.<eos> The whole city got together, took a vote.<eos> Big turnout.<eos> I wanted her safe.<eos> That's why I hired you two.<eos> You're going to jail, Mrs Kuttner.

-He's got no pulse.<eos> -Faster!<eos> He isn't breathing.<eos> You can't go in here.
Excuse me. I am so sorry.<eos> Go to your mommy! My kitties!<eos> Mom will feed you.<eos> Mom loves you.<eos> Kitty-kitty-kitty!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Please open, it's the police.<eos> You...<eos> Good evening.<eos> Tamara Stepanovna, tell me if anyone came to you about that case.
The old bastard.<eos> Everyone wants to get their five minutes of fame.<eos> Nothing like that has happened here before.<eos> Colonel! The body has been identified.<eos> This is Komarov Vasiliy Andreyevich.<eos> Our main suspect.<eos> Well, a former suspect now.<eos> I found the missing pages from the case in an album.<eos> I read this Shilov's testimony.<eos> I'll make you a cup of tea.
Looks like I found it.<eos> Captain Shevtsov here!<eos> What are you doing on a guarded territory?<eos> Present your IDs!<eos> That's him.<eos> Clear the way!<eos> -He's got no pulse.<eos> -Faster!<eos> He isn't breathing.<eos> You can't go in here.
1354.<eos> Any return on fingerprints request?<eos> No.<eos> Two ghosts with the same tattoos looking like those made in the army.<eos> We have to make a request to the military.<eos> Got it.<eos> Please hold still.<eos> You must always have this with you.<eos> You might have an arrhythmia attack up to the heart failure.<eos> For this not to happen, you'll have to immediately inject this medicine intravenously.
What do I have to do?<eos> Just enter the cell.<eos> He might react.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -Not really.<eos> The patient was transferred to our place a week ago.<eos> I didn't have the time to study him.<eos> You can refuse, but then it'll be much harder for me.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Do you know this person?
Do you recognize this person?<eos> Are you pretending?<eos> I know.<eos> He's got a chiv!<eos> I'll kill you!<eos> I'll kill you!<eos> Excuse me for this incident.<eos> I wouldn't have imagined...<eos> But now, with your help, we'll be able to prove he's capable and to appeal against the decision.<eos> You should enhance security measures, or the next time, this will be pulled out from your eye!
I was the first.<eos> I told you:<eos> you mustn't tell anyone anything.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Quiet, quiet...<eos> Don't tell me you not enjoying it.<eos> Should I do something differently?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's do it differently.<eos> Do you confirm that this belongs to you?
-Good morning.<eos> -Good morning.<eos> Tell me, what's the name of these pills?<eos> Please, direct all questions to your doctor.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Damn!<eos> What happened?<eos> I see you've already made yourself at home in the new office, Mr. Guskov.<eos> We wanted to ask you several questions.
Yegor, you're lucky.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Here's a search warrant, start.<eos> That's an interesting vase you've got.<eos> China from the times of revolution.<eos> Revolution?<eos> A genuine work by Petrov-Vodkin.<eos> In the 1920s, the most talented artists tried to compensate for some major violations of kilning technology with their revolutionary enthusiasm.<eos> The glassware turned out original, but fragile.<eos> You'll have to come with us.
I have the right to the house and everything else.<eos> Feeling better now?<eos> You're such a sleaze ball.<eos> Yes.<eos> But nobody will find it out.<eos> Some fresh air will do you good.<eos> You're such a sleaze ball.<eos> Ms. Zimina, you're accused of killing Irina Novikova.<eos> You've played your role well.<eos> You'll have to come with us.
Who were Alyona's friends...<eos> I can't remember right on the spot.<eos> Well, maybe she had a boyfriend?<eos> You'd better talk to Natasha Gaponova about it, she's the prefect.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> In the dorm.<eos> Today's Saturday, everybody from other cities went home.<eos> She'll be in class on Monday, at 9 AM.<eos> I see.<eos> And I have a strong request for you.
-Clear. May I go?<eos> You may.<eos> Strip club "Star". Crazy prices!<eos> Colonel!<eos> The landlord of the apartment rented by Ligachova came to visit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maksim, find out everything about a certain Liza.<eos> Liza Aksyonova, a stripper and Alyona's friend.<eos> -And please order a pizza.<eos> -But you're... -Yes.
Yes.<eos> Thanks, got it.<eos> -Where is he?<eos> -He was at this table.<eos> -Could he leave?<eos> -No.<eos> He was here a moment ago.<eos> Here he is.<eos> How interesting.<eos> You'll have to answer several questions.
During the murder of Ligachova, my client was on a highway 120 kilometers from the city.<eos> He was in a hurry and exceeded the speed limit.<eos> Which was captured by cameras documenting traffic violations.<eos> My client now has to pay a fee.<eos> And he'll surely do so.<eos> As soon as you let him go.<eos> That is, now.<eos> Her condition is stable, but positive dynamics is very insignificant.<eos> That is why her treatment might last longer than expected.<eos> Sorry, but I must ask you a question.
As soon as you let him go.<eos> That is, now.<eos> Her condition is stable, but positive dynamics is very insignificant.<eos> That is why her treatment might last longer than expected.<eos> Sorry, but I must ask you a question.<eos> Are you ready to continue paying for her stay at our center?<eos> It is not about the money.<eos> Why isn't she getting better?<eos> You see, the last meeting with you provoked an exacerbation of post-traumatic syndrome.<eos> It would be better for you to refrain from visiting her for now.
-I don't know this girl.<eos> -How can you not know her?<eos> It's Liza.<eos> Alyona's best friend.<eos> I don't know any Lizas!<eos> She was killed the same night as Alyona.<eos> The killer dropped this token at the crime scene.<eos> Okay.<eos> I...<eos> I'll tell you everything.
About half an hour ago, I got a strong spasm below.<eos> It would pass all the previous times, but now it keeps hurting.<eos> And I started bleeding.<eos> You have to urgently go to any gynecology department of duty.<eos> You can't come to me.<eos> Why?<eos> Think about it.<eos> Have they visited you?<eos> Yes, today.<eos> Good luck to you.
There's something wrong with the codec.<eos> Pure mysticism.<eos> Was the electronic lock activated in the prisoner's cell?<eos> I can't say anything.<eos> A system error of the whole security profile occurred.<eos> Your first and last name?<eos> Your first and last name?<eos> Human life is short.<eos> But the name is eternal.<eos> Do you know these people?
Take it away and document it in the log.<eos> Good.<eos> The warm-up is over.<eos> -Now you're going to have a sparring.<eos> -With whom?<eos> With a strong and experienced partner.<eos> -Are you giving up?<eos> -Never in my life.<eos> Well, it's even better for me.<eos> You shouldn't have become distracted during a fight.
And one more thing.<eos> He felt sick after the vaccination.<eos> What kind of vaccination?<eos> Seasonal vaccination against the flu.<eos> He hugged me and held close to his chest.<eos> Did you cry?<eos> No.<eos> What did you feel?<eos> Well, I felt... protected.<eos> Did you feel like squeezing up against him? -Like touching him?
Strange.<eos> What do you have?<eos> Three days ago, a system error occurred in our security profile.<eos> Its consequences have been liquidated, but...<eos> Some data could not be recovered.<eos> We don't know if there was a stranger in the detention facility.<eos> Have you managed to identify the phone number which called Barkov?<eos> No.<eos> According to the information received, we have a criminal group working against us, presumably consisting of former members of special operation unit 1354.<eos> You are familiar with some of these persons.
Riddles all around.<eos> One more thing.<eos> We had the blood sample of guard Barkov stolen from our lab.<eos> Do you know who did it?<eos> Yes.<eos> So it's you.<eos> I waited for you to find everything out.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> I have nothing to discuss with you.<eos> You'd better go with me.
He's come to his senses.<eos> Damn it!<eos> -Good morning.<eos> -Where am I?<eos> It's the second time you're trying to die in my presence.<eos> I won't let you do that.
I still see nightmares with her, screaming and hitting herself against the car window.<eos> Did only your hands burn?<eos> No, I had burns on 20 per cent of the body, including the face.<eos> I had to undergo a plastic surgery.<eos> -Do you have children?<eos> -Unfortunately not.<eos> Tanya was sterile.<eos> He's making it all up, just making up!<eos> You showed me your daughter Polina yourself. She was in the wheelchair.<eos> Sorry, where did I show you my daughter?
I know that I am breaking the ethics code and disclosing medical secrecy, but believe me, it is for your own good.<eos> The thing is, your colleague came to me.<eos> He's got a serious mental disorder.<eos> Paranoid syndrome.<eos> Primary systematized delusions of different content.<eos> All classic symptoms are present:<eos> a conviction that he is persecuted, that somebody wants to poison him.<eos> Self-isolation, aggression attacks.<eos> If we don't start treatment now, this condition will only deteriorate with time.<eos> I proposed you to go into therapy.
Which files?<eos> From the surveillance cameras in the detention facility.<eos> How did they restore themselves?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A stuffed shirt, you are saying?<eos> You are arrested.<eos> Take a napkin over there.<eos> Yes, I never doubted that this day would come.<eos> Your phone, keys, and watch.<eos> You know, I even feel sorry for you.
-Thank you.<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> Maksim!<eos> Yes?<eos> Let Kuleshov go.<eos> I got it.<eos> Your breakfast.<eos> Too bad you don't eat.<eos> You have to get used to such food.
Either you're working with us or I'll liquidate you.<eos> It's up to you to choose.<eos> He pushed me...<eos> I almost cried with shame but managed to contain myself.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Please go on.<eos> Yes?<eos> Good afternoon, it is Vera from the rehabilitation center.<eos> Which Vera?<eos> I passed you those pills, remember? Well?
I did it.<eos> That's as far as it goes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I know what stopped me.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It's never stopping me again.<eos> Chao cac co, ladies!<eos> Chao cac co!<eos> Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.<eos> You should get out of this place once in a while.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.<eos> Where? Floating in somebody else's pool?<eos> Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.<eos> Why give that up?<eos> I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it... selling people, convincing people...<eos> I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.<eos> Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.<eos> All right. Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
Wait. What?<eos> Ken, you are the greatest.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem-o.<eos> Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.<eos> Oh, I believe it.<eos> All right, well, we should get out of your hair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, wait, wait.<eos> This... is for you.
No, not really.<eos> So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?<eos> No. Not that I...<eos> No.<eos> How'd they get in?<eos> Uh, the back door over here.<eos> It was open when I came home for lunch.<eos> I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.<eos> Uh-huh. At what time, uh, you figure this happened?<eos> I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
It's very sweet.<eos> You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.<eos> I don't know how, but that's what they say.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> Huh. What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?<eos> Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.<eos> Wow. Computers.<eos> God, I should've gotten into computers.<eos> - I'd have that same Hummer.<eos> - Yeah, right. Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.

Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.<eos> You know, the priority is my baseball cards.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.<eos> So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
Get out here.<eos> Bye.<eos> Santa Fe, New Mexico.<eos> I need the number of a law firm... Davis Main.<eos> Yeah, you can connect me.<eos> Davis Main.<eos> There are a few options on the company cars.<eos> We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.<eos> Company car... wow.<eos> And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.

If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.<eos> Anytime you're ready,<eos> I can put together some samples for you to review.
Mr Holmes. I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home.<eos> I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson.<eos> That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.<eos> They're notoriously difficult to schedule.<eos> - What's in there? - Never mind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you catch a murderer, Mr Holmes?<eos> Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs. I think we'll call it a draw.<eos> And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr Watson.<eos> Yes, did you enjoy it?

You ask her!<eos> Why didn't you ask her?<eos> How could I?<eos> What with me not talking and everything!<eos> For God's sake, give her some lines, she's perfectly capable of starving us!<eos> Good afternoon, I'm Sherlock Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.<eos> You may speak freely in front of him as he barely understands a word.<eos> Holmes!<eos> However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.<eos> You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.
Good afternoon, I'm Sherlock Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.<eos> You may speak freely in front of him as he barely understands a word.<eos> Holmes!<eos> However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.<eos> You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.<eos> You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.<eos> You have come to this agency as a last resort in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible. Good lord, Holmes!<eos> All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.<eos> Her perfume?<eos> Yes, her perfume which brings insight to me and disaster to you.
Yesterday morning.<eos> The bride's face, how is it described?<eos> White as death, mouth like a crimson wound.<eos> Poetry or truth?<eos> Well, many would say they're the same thing.<eos> Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?<eos> I saw her face myself, afterwards.<eos> - After what?<eos> Or me.<eos> Really, Lestrade. A woman blows her own brains out in public and you need help identifying the guilty party.
Votes for women.<eos> And are you for or against?<eos> Get out.<eos> Ooh, ooh.<eos> Oh! Have they gone off again, have they?<eos> I don't know. What a life those gentlemen lead.<eos> Yes.<eos> Those gentlemen.<eos> Oh, never you mind.<eos> Oh! Almost forgot, that came for you.
Not unlike yourself, sir.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Just observing, sir.<eos> Well, that's quite enough. Nobody asked you to be observant.<eos> Sorry, sir, I just meant you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.<eos> You are dangerously close to impertinence.<eos> I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you. Very good, sir.<eos> And when will you be seeing her? - Now, listen...<eos> - Oh, I nearly forgot.<eos> - Sir, a telegram came for you.
You are dangerously close to impertinence.<eos> I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you. Very good, sir.<eos> And when will you be seeing her? - Now, listen...<eos> - Oh, I nearly forgot.<eos> - Sir, a telegram came for you.<eos> - You forgot?<eos> No, I nearly forgot.<eos> What have you been doing all morning?<eos> Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.<eos> Did you enjoy it?
- You look well, sir.<eos> - Really?<eos> I rather thought I looked enormous.<eos> Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption is incredibly injurious to your health.<eos> - Your heart...<eos> - No need to worry on that score, Watson.<eos> There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.<eos> It's a family trait.<eos> Oh, I wasn't being critical.<eos> If you continue like this, sir, I give you five years at the most.
- Why are you talking like this?<eos> Why are you so determined to be alone?<eos> Are you quite well, Watson?<eos> Is it such a curious question?<eos> From a Viennese alienist, no. From a retired army surgeon, most certainly.<eos> Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever, I am your closest friend.<eos> I concede it.<eos> I am currently attempting to have a perfectly normal conversation with you.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - Why do you need to be alone?
You must be.<eos> Little use us standing here in the dark.<eos> After all, this is the 19th century.<eos> Do not forget me.<eos> Do not forget me.<eos> She's there, she's down there.<eos> Don't tell me you abandoned your post.<eos> What?<eos> Holmes, she's there, I saw her.<eos> Empty, thanks to you.
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.<eos> In the confident expectation I would not have to.<eos> Anything you can tell us, Doctor?<eos> Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.<eos> It's a man, then.<eos> Possibly.<eos> A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman.<eos> In theory, yes, but we know who it was, I saw her.<eos> - Watson.<eos> - I saw the ghost with my own eyes. You saw nothing. You saw what you were supposed to see.
But I would quite like to find every ounce of this stuff in your possession and pour it out of the window. I should be inclined to stop you.<eos> Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly, which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.<eos> You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.<eos> I'm an army doctor, which means I can break every bone in your body while naming them.<eos> My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.<eos> Never on a case.<eos> You promised me never on a case.<eos> No, I just said that in one of your stories.<eos> Listen. I'm happy to play the fool for you.<eos> I will run along behind you like some halfwit, making you look clever, if that's what you need.
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth, while actually firing the other into the ground.<eos> An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood, and thus her apparent suicide is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.<eos> A substitute corpse, bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs Ricoletti, takes her place and is later transported to the morgue.<eos> A grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard.<eos> Meanwhile, the real Mrs Ricoletti slips away.<eos> Now comes the really clever part.<eos> Mrs Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her, to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.<eos> Perfect stage for a perfect drama.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?
Time you woke up, Sherlock.<eos> I'm a storyteller, I know when I'm in one.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Of course, you do, John.<eos> So, what's he like?<eos> The other me, in the other place.<eos> Smarter than he looks.<eos> Pretty damn smart then.<eos> Pretty damn smart.<eos> Oh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?
Yes, sir!<eos> Carry on, Company Sergeant.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Company!<eos> Left turn!<eos> Quick march!<eos> We welcome the forces of the United Nations here with open arms but with some confusion.<eos> We don't know why you are here in Africa... as we are quite capable of looking after ourselves.<eos> However, we will be thoughtful hosts.<eos> Unless you come here to start trouble, in which case you will force us to tutor you on how things are done here in the Congo.
I believe I can... accomplish the mission, sir.<eos> Good, Conor.<eos> Good.<eos> The United Nations are going to send more peacekeeping troops, so I need your assistance, General de Gaulle.<eos> And what will you give in return?<eos> It's in all our interests that the mining companies continue their operations.<eos> My old rival would have nationalized everything you own.<eos> If I lose power, it might still happen.<eos> Your American friends wouldn't like that.<eos> Okay, I will send you 1,000 of our best former legionnaires.
Let's go.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I'll take as much as that truck outside can carry.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where's the best bar in town?<eos> At the end of the street.<eos> I don't think you will find any of the bars here to your liking.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I don't mean to be rude, but you do know that you're not welcome here, don't you?
Discuss the details with General McEntee.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> General, does he have a clue what he's doing?<eos> All our troops in the field are on Operation Morthor, Commandant.<eos> We don't have any reinforcements.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Nobody thought this was a possibility, did they?<eos> When do our men come back in?<eos> A heavy-weapons battalion's expected here within 12 hours.<eos> They'll be sent out to you immediately.
Cease fire!<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> We've got to clear that whole area.<eos> Cover me.<eos> Commandant Quinlan.<eos> You're a good drinker, but not such a good soldier.<eos> And I believe I can be of help to you.
Sir, the radio's working, they're just not answering.<eos> Try it again.<eos> I require an immediate decision on our last request.<eos> This is Charlie Alpha Juliet awaiting further instructions.<eos> This is Company A, Jadotville calling.<eos> I require immediate contact with anybody there.<eos> They can hear us, boss.<eos> If they were gonna help, they would have by now.<eos> Sir!<eos> You need to see this!
Wait.<eos> I know exactly what you need.<eos> Totally plug-and-play.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> We'll go with.<eos> Operate in support.<eos> Wait.<eos> The sun's coming up.<eos> You can't go outside.
So if you want to go down swinging, these guys hit harder than anyone.<eos> All right, Donnie, you got this.<eos> Okay. Dissolve the quadra-helix bonds and reverse the cohesion.<eos> Wait.<eos> That would mean... Is it really possible?<eos> We have confirmation, Master Shredder.<eos> The canister of purple ooze is at police headquarters.<eos> Take a team. Recover it at all costs.<eos> I'll retrieve the first piece needed to open the portal.<eos> How many men do you want?
That footage has been altered. It's been edited.<eos> We checked its authenticity.<eos> It's clean.<eos> I want a phone call.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but all the phones have been shut down on account of monsters breaking into our stationhouse.<eos> Well, I hate to break it to you, but legally I'm entitled to a phone call.<eos> - Tell me where they are.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But if I did, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> Chief, the turtles are not the ones you should be chasing.
- Well, we do have one.<eos> - The other one.<eos> Turtle power!<eos> Escaped convicts Bebop and Rocksteady are now in police custody, while Dr. Baxter Stockman remains at large.<eos> Authorities assure us that the city is once again safe, however questions remain about last week's events.<eos> What was that threat from the sky and how exactly was it averted?<eos> But the bigger question is, does it even matter?<eos> Do we need to give our heroes a name and a face?<eos> Or is it enough to know that they're out there watching over us from the shadows?<eos> For your incredible valor within this community, and for your uncompromising cooperation with this agency, I present to you the keys to the city, a symbol of our appreciation, respect, and for our continued partnership.

We had a good laugh about it afterwards.<eos> You know, whenever you talk about him, you nearly always mention his fine sense of humor.<eos> Do I?<eos> Aye.<eos> And his smile, and his hair.<eos> It really is the most...<eos> Was.<eos> It really was the most extraordinary mop of red you'd ever seen.<eos> - It's...<eos> - You don't have to say it.
No.<eos> Was the age difference an issue?<eos> What is it, about 20 years?<eos> It didn't help.<eos> Andrea, I mean.<eos> It didn't matter at all to Evelyn, or me.<eos> Was there anything else about the marriage Andrea didn't like before, during, or after it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Evelyn's will.<eos> It entitled you to something when Evelyn died even though you'd been married just two years.
And you don't remember anything about this second time?<eos> There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about you?<eos> Is that how you like it?

But conceivably she wasn't?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You didn't check her pulse?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't call 911?<eos> No.<eos> Why not, if it was possible she was still alive?<eos> I don't know. I wasn't thinking.<eos> You see why I'm having some trouble here?<eos> You had the presence of mind to run from a crime scene, to remove evidence implicating you in the crime, to operate a motor vehicle without crashing into anything, but you didn't have the presence of mind

I don't know.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Ms. Kapoor?<eos> The Defense rests, Your Honor.<eos> You know, at the beginning, I thought we had maybe a... 10% shot.<eos> Now? Zero.<eos> You just convicted him.<eos> No...<eos> I'm not discussing it.<eos> Jurors, I'll remind you not to discuss this case with anyone, and keep your TVs, computers, and iPads off.
For, um...<eos> I don't know, not lecturing me.<eos> I'm too busy to lecture.<eos> Besides, you know what you did.<eos> So chin up, finish this trial... and then clear out your fucking desk.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... when you file a request for a document from the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, this is what you get.<eos> It's called a redacted document, edited to render unreadable any content the FBI deems a threat to national security, or, more often, to the security of the workings of the FBI itself.<eos> Redaction equals self-preservation.<eos> Like this, there is a redaction in the middle of what the defendant has told you about the night of Andrea's murder, a black rectangle of nothing between the time he had sex with her, and when he, as he says, found her bleeding out.
Right.<eos> God!<eos> God!<eos> Oh, no, hey, I need this like a fucking hole in the head!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fucking get...<eos> Fuck!<eos> You under any unusual stress?<eos> You could say that.<eos> Who gave you this?
You could say that.<eos> Who gave you this?<eos> Some Chinese guy on Canal Street.<eos> Canal Street.<eos> Did he also offer to re-tar your driveway?<eos> Unless you like insomnia, panic attacks, confusion, and psychosis, you don't want to make a habit out of this.<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> This isn't what I normally do.<eos> I mean, obviously, someone who looks like this doesn't make his living doing public speaking.<eos> I'm sorry you even have to look at this.
So, Mrs. Weiss, what's your pleasure?<eos> Shall we impanel a new jury for retrial? Say, next week?<eos> No, Your Honor.<eos> My office declines to prosecute further.<eos> You're free.<eos> Free to go home.<eos> As per usual, I see some old faces.<eos> Glad you learned your lesson.<eos> Now for the freshmen, I'll keep it simple.<eos> You get told to do something, you do it. Gate!
It's tucked.<eos> I shaved for the trick.<eos> Don't post those pics.<eos> As they approach the end of the dark forest...<eos> It's an illusion.<eos> It's tucked. I tuck it back.<eos> Conner, just hold on.<eos> Don't post those. It's a tuck and take.<eos> I don't know what to do right now.<eos> I wanna show you all my dick but I can't show you my dick.
Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah. I wish Lawrence could've been here.<eos> Owen, that sucked.<eos> I'm trying to sell a record, not stroll down memory lane.<eos> That shit made me look like a has-been.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> The crowd loved it.<eos> Whatever, man.<eos> Conner.<eos> Well, look, you have to understand something.
Eddie?<eos> Feeling these?<eos> Okay. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Dude, I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> Conn, these are terrible, man.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Thank you, Owen, truly.<eos> Okay.<eos> And the rest of you liked them?
It's been awesome, you know.<eos> Dude, which one of y'all pissed on me?<eos> Feels really good to reconnect with my hometown.<eos> I've just been really living a very simple life, kind of back to basics.<eos> I've been watching a lot of dressage, which is a very elevated, uh, competitive form of horse dancing, and I've been doing a lot of painting and a lot of sketching.<eos> I'm doing a series on show ponies.<eos> I actually have a lot of trouble with the hooves.<eos> It's hard to get like a hoof texture.<eos> This one is, like, pretty accurate, actually.<eos> I'll show you guys the horse that I based it on.

Sold.<eos> Eleven-fifty.<eos> You know, it's not Conner4Real numbers, you know, but, in a way, it means more.
Hi, how are you?<eos> I just... you see what I'm talking about here.<eos> Mr. Hutchinson, could you please look that over for me?<eos> I got my own copy, this is for you.<eos> We can get going, I'll look over what I have.<eos> Let me help you outside.<eos> I'll keep everything.<eos> This is all your receipts, it's all for the transaction you did.<eos> You're gonna hold onto this.
Remain on the floor or we will kill you.<eos> Remain on the floor or we will kill you.<eos> Remain on the floor or we will kill you.<eos> Remain on the floor or we will kill you.<eos> Remain on the floor or we will kill you.<eos> Remain on the floor or we will kill you.<eos> If anyone leaves or calls the police within 15 minutes, this device will explode.<eos> If anyone leaves or calls the police within 15 minutes, this device will explode.<eos> If anyone leaves or calls the police within 15 minutes, this device will explode.<eos> I'm sure you'll be as pleased with those reports as we are, and trust you will enjoy your business in Cincinnati.
That they'd be that precise but not take the time to wipe it off?<eos> These are thugs.<eos> Did you see the tape?<eos> These guys move better than a SWAT team.<eos> No, if I were looking for thugs, my first suspects would be you assholes.<eos> This is not gonna hold up, these guys will be out in 15 minutes.<eos> Jackson's lawyer claims she has a liquor store tape of James making a purchase at the time of the robbery.<eos> And who the fuck are you?<eos> Number three on that list of people who outrank you.<eos> Well, congratulations, gentlemen, you've just been played, it's called disinformation, that print was put there on purpose and you've given our suspects a nine hour head start.
This has certainly gotten more interesting.<eos> You have two voice messages.<eos> Voice messages.<eos> Hey, baby, don't forget to stop and grab some wine.<eos> See you soon.<eos> I'm thinking how do you have so many dirty clothes.<eos> I miss you.<eos> - Hi, Martha Wallace? - Yes?<eos> Yes, I'm Special Agent Chase with the FBI.<eos> I was hoping to ask you a few questions about T.J.
And that's okay because I already know the box is registered to a Jan Martense.<eos> - How did...<eos> - How what?<eos> Unfortunately, that's about all I know.<eos> - How's your marriage?<eos> - What?<eos> I mean, are you happy, do you love her?<eos> Did you make a good choice?<eos> Did you pick well?<eos> You did, so you know how lucky you are to have a wife.
- You're fucking right I do.<eos> But I know a hustle when I see one.<eos> These guys are trying to make themselves look really fucking good, a $3 million donation to a charity?<eos> The press gets hold of that, it'll look like the Boondock fucking Saints.<eos> You're right.<eos> - You still should've reported it to me.<eos> - What, the FBI doesn't have any press leaks?<eos> I know you guys do, it's not like you make any more money than we are.<eos> Guess again, I live up in Akron next to Lebron.<eos> - I'm assigning an agent to you.
She's also a writer for The Plain Daily.<eos> I only know about the big tits.<eos> Look, Monty's assigned you to Detective Mims and his crew.<eos> What?<eos> Gotta coordinate with CPD.<eos> Cops hates Feds, you're the newest.<eos> Least amount of hate.<eos> Don't take any shit from those assholes.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> I felt bad for never giving you anything at West Chester.
How are you this evening?<eos> Who am I talking to?<eos> Robin Hood.<eos> I think it would be more useful for both of us if you didn't worry about trying to trace this.<eos> So I won't have to hang up and we can have a conversation.<eos> You're taking an awful lot of risks.<eos> Purposefully leaving evidence at the scenes, sending me stuff, now calling me at home.<eos> Yet, you still don't know who I am.<eos> Oh, I assume you have theories.<eos> Have you considered the possibility that I'm helping you catch - a greater criminal than myself?
Why would you be blackmailing a guy that you're the main campaign contributor for?<eos> Thanks for coming by.<eos> - Have George come in please.<eos> - Security?<eos> That's a first.<eos> Not everybody needs a gun to get things done.<eos> What else can I do for you today, Special Agent?<eos> I'm asking you simple questions, just answer them.<eos> What's the difference between a question and an allegation?<eos> An allegation is the one you don't answer.

They're alive because of you.<eos> Let's get these assholes.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - I got your plate match.<eos> - How long has it been there?<eos> - Just got here.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> So what made you join the Bureau?<eos> Fell into it.<eos> You got that born on the 4th, be all you can be look.
- May we come in? - Okay.<eos> Thank you, we won't be long.<eos> Was that James Jackson leaving your apartment?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Was he here long?<eos> What's going on now?<eos> Just gonna ask you a few questions and then we'll be on our way.<eos> Wells.<eos> Well, that's an awful lot of money.<eos> Did James give that to you? Yes.
Why not.<eos> I guarantee you whatever they serve is better than that swill you buy in your dive.<eos> I prefer my swill.<eos> I'd ask you why you don't drink it, but I don't give a fuck.<eos> What now, Agent Montgomery?<eos> Surely even your little mind understands this country's so corrupt. What are you doing?<eos> You can't touch me here.<eos> Or else I could have you killed.<eos> That, and it wouldn't cost me the price of one of your cheap suits.<eos> You really don't like my suits?
Why art thou patient, man?<eos> Thou shouldst be mad.<eos> York cannot speak without a crown.<eos> Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.<eos> Now looks he like a king.<eos> Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,<eos> And this is he was his adopted heir.<eos> But how is it that great Plantagenet<eos> Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath?<eos> As I bethink me, you should not be King
'Was never subject longed to be a king<eos> 'As I do long and wish to be a subject.'<eos> Are you there, butcher?<eos> Ay, crookback, here I stand to answer thee.<eos> 'Twas you that killed my brother, was it not? Ay,<eos> This is the hand that stabbed thy father York,<eos> And here is the hand that slew thy brother Edmund,<eos> And this is the heart that triumphs in their death.<eos> Speak not spite,<eos> For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.

Our sister shall be Edward's.<eos> Ah!<eos> Until today, Louis WAS Henry's friend.<eos> And still is friend to him and Margaret.<eos> And shall you have all kindness at my hand<eos> That your estate requires and mine can yield.<eos> Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.<eos> My Lord of Warwick, this letter is for you, sent from your brother.<eos> This, from our King unto Your Highness.<eos> And Margaret This for you, from whom I know not.
These words have turned my hate to love... .. and I forgive and quite forget old faults,<eos> And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.<eos> So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,<eos> That if King Louis will vouchsafe to furnish us<eos> With some few bands of chosen soldiers,<eos> I'll undertake to land them on our coast<eos> And force the tyrant from his seat by war.<eos> Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged<eos> But by thy help to this distressed Queen?<eos> You shall have aid.
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter,<eos> That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage<eos> May I not prove inferior to yourself.<eos> My brother flies to Warwick?<eos> Yet, am I arm'd against the worst can happen,<eos> And haste is needful in this desp'rate case.<eos> They are already, or quickly will be, landed.<eos> I need to levy men and make for war.<eos> But ere I go, brother Richard...<eos> Tell me if YOU love Warwick more than me.
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,<eos> And with the other fling it at thy face,<eos> Than bear so low a sail.<eos> And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,<eos> With whom an upright zeal to right prevails<eos> More than the nature of a brother's love!<eos> Come, Clarence, come.<eos> Thou wilt, if Warwick call.<eos> Brother?<eos> Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
You keep practicing.<eos> Try again.<eos> This is Anderson Station.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Anderson Station, this is UN1.<eos> Are you ready to surrender?<eos> Survivors of the Donnager, my name is Fred Johnson,<eos> Director of Operations at Tycho Station.<eos> I don't know who you are, or what your intent may be, but unless you're trying to start a war, you need to contact me.<eos> I can help you.
Ask the clerk for a Sherpa.<eos> - Sherpa?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you think Julie's dead?<eos> You should've stopped her.<eos> Nobody could stop Julie from doing anything she wanted to do.<eos> You should've protected her.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> She still got on that ship, huh?<eos> You don't understand Julie.
We have tried repeatedly to surrender to the UN Marines.<eos> But...<eos> We just wanted to be heard for the sake of our children.<eos> Anderson Station is secure.<eos> All terrorists have been subdued.<eos> Well done, Colonel. Well done.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You have my solemn promise that you will not be harmed.<eos> And you will be granted safe harbor on Tycho.

Punch it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> How many times do I have to tell you I don't want any?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> That's good.<eos> What you need, Mister Star Helix?
Let me worry about her, and you'll get Filat Kothari.<eos> Go get your justice.<eos> Make it pretty.<eos> We can't resolve the drive signatures or make any visual IDs.<eos> Somebody has a new fleet of warships.<eos> I'm not a pilot, someone else needs to fly.<eos> I don't think I'm in any condition to...<eos> - Get us out of here!<eos> - You got it.<eos> You will be granted safe harbor on Tycho.
You two are the only witnesses to a series of catastrophic events.<eos> You could be the key to stopping all-out war.<eos> We're not the only witnesses.<eos> You were watching.<eos> I've been out of the war business a long time, son.<eos> I broker peace treaties these days...<eos> Not exactly what you're known for...<eos> You can put those guns away.<eos> Tell the others to come out.<eos> I'll give you safe harbor.
I'm just the messenger, I have half a platoon of pissed-off Martian marines who are just itching for some payback.<eos> Huh.<eos> That's a corvette-class Martian frigate that typically crews thirty.<eos> I only see two of you.<eos> That tells me that you're trying hard to hide your numbers.<eos> Tactically, if there were more, as a show of force you would've brought them out.<eos> I'm guessing there are two to four people left on your ship.<eos> And I'm confident that there's no Martian Navy on board.<eos> If they were, they'd be out here speaking with me now.<eos> You walked off that ship, because you're in charge.

Did you pattern the charges?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just like you said...<eos> Time to make some money, bachemang.<eos> Once all the shooting got started, it was over pretty quick.<eos> The Martians barely knew what hit 'em.<eos> The Donnager and the Cant were attacked by the same class of stealth warships.<eos> You will have to testify.<eos> Testify?<eos> To the UN Security Council.<eos> You mean the one that you and the OPA aren't allowed into?

A small fleet of stealth ships wouldn't be impossible.<eos> I'm not going to debate with you.<eos> We're going back to our ship now.<eos> I'm afraid you can't go back to the ship.<eos> Sounds like he doesn't like goodbyes.<eos> I'm taking control of the Tachi right now.<eos> The hell you are!<eos> - Freeze!<eos> - Right there!<eos> Those guns can't help you anymore.
- Hey! - Leave him alone.<eos> Dzeet! Dzeet! Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet! Why are you doing this?<eos> Impound our haul and there's nothing left for your taxman.<eos> Oh, are we being too hard on you?<eos> Should we cut you a break?<eos> We are just tryin' to feed our families, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> What god gives you the right to life's riches, huh?
Just tell me if she's alive.<eos> If she was here right now, she'd spit in your face.<eos> You're everything she despised.<eos> A Belter who preys on his own kind.<eos> Welwala...<eos> Die as you lived.<eos> That every drop of water on Ceres has been blood, and piss and tears and spit, a hundred times and will be a thousand times more.<eos> The innocent can never comprehend this.<eos> Perhaps, they will comprehend the hail of stones that will one day come crashing down through their precious blue skies.<eos> You want us to call you Sir and Madam, and grovel, like we are some second-class citizens.
Big brass said I didn't have what it takes to fly their badass gun-ships...<eos> But I'll tell you one thing, flying the Rocinante back there, that was just about the best feeling I have ever had.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> The ship will look like a run-of-the-mill gas freighter.<eos> Don't fly too close, but don't try to avoid it.<eos> The Martian patrols won't give you a second look.<eos> - The drive signature?<eos> - We're altering that too.<eos> A lot of Martians gave their lives getting us onto this ship.<eos> In the heat of the battle... They fought to get you off the Donnager?
A man's gotta stand up.<eos> Uncle Mateo!<eos> A man has got to stand up!<eos> Come back!<eos> We'll be okay.<eos> We can only live so long... With a boot to our necks!<eos> Uncle Mateo!<eos> You don't need to do this!<eos> We'll be okay!<eos> Xinglong, you are on unauthorized intercept course.
Are you?<eos> I guess we lost Amos.<eos> Oh, he'll be here in a sec.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess I'll put on some coffee.<eos> You people drive a hard bargain.<eos> You got our recorded statements.<eos> We'll bring your Lionel Polanski home, if he's out there.<eos> In return, I want you to help me find someone.<eos> Someday, I'll come to you with a name.
Which leaves someone with a lot of power, a lot of resources, who'll do anything to keep it quiet.<eos> Including starting a war.<eos> And that man...<eos> He holds the key.<eos> Radiation levels are off the charts...<eos> We're ready for the next phase.<eos> We need to get a sample off Phoebe, now!<eos> You tell anyone about this?<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
Now I don't want to get picked up by any Mickie patrol, and I know you guys don't want that either.<eos> What do you know about us?<eos> It's none of my business, okay?<eos> None of my business why you guys are flying around in a stolen Martian attack ship...<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Like I said, it's none of my business.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You think the Martians are gonna buy whatever story you're selling?<eos> Will you shut him up, please?<eos> No, look, you need to...
Are they antique?<eos> Some.<eos> Cervantes.<eos> Jimmy liked to think of himself as a knight.<eos> He thought it was a funny story.<eos> I never broke it to him that it was a tragedy.<eos> Can we stop with the bullshit now?<eos> Oh, I had a little left about how charming your home is.<eos> Should we sit down?<eos> I don't think you're gonna be staying that long.
I have two governments, and whatever the hell the OPA calls itself, on a course toward a war that your son started.<eos> I want to stop it before anyone else loses a kid.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Can't?<eos> Or you choose not to?<eos> What good will any of this do?<eos> What could I possibly say to you that would make any difference now?<eos> Make him make sense to me.<eos> He's raised by people like you, and he joins the Earth Navy?<eos> Was he trying to piss you off?
See what shape the reactor's in.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Hey, Amos, take the flight deck.<eos> We need to check the ship's systems and logs.<eos> Take him with you.<eos> He'll be useful.<eos> Come along, tweety bird.<eos> Flight deck's gotta be upstairs.<eos> After you.<eos> You guys need more eyes over there.

When we find Polanski.<eos> Not before.<eos> Anybody object to us turning that ship into scrap?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> - Well, I...<eos> Anybody except you.<eos> Do it.<eos> Look, you control that ship.<eos> You have a bargaining chip.<eos> Why would you destroy something you control?
Not from what I can see here.<eos> But they were able to collect highly detailed drive signatures.<eos> Well, they did fly closer to those ships than anyone else in the system.<eos> Unfortunately, for them.<eos> You're going to want to see this for yourself.<eos> So what are you going to do now?<eos> This place used to be the jewel of the Belt.<eos> I wish I could've seen it in its heyday.<eos> It's not a bad district, though.<eos> I'm tellin' you, if you guys like okra-infused tank-grown ribs, there's this place on Level Six that's pretty...
The one that killed the Cant.<eos> It has to be.<eos> Someone forced their way out of this.<eos> Holden, behind you!<eos> I think it's absorbing energy from the reactor.<eos> Anyway, what do you know about this kid?<eos> Why she's on Eros.<eos> I believe in her.<eos> You're going to Eros, aren't you?<eos> Let me help you find him.
Yeah, I didn't get any orders anything like this.<eos> You stand down.<eos> I've got rank here.<eos> Not today, you don't.<eos> Sir, sir, we're trying to... - We got a man down!<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> He needs medical attention.<eos> I can see that, but who the hell are you?<eos> Hey, some of your guys are taking fire down that connector shaft.<eos> - You want to check it out.
We need to go, now.<eos> Please.<eos> You'll die if you...<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Holden, it's me.<eos> You're going the right way to the docks, okay?<eos> I'm heading that way myself.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> I thought I was helping you guys.
- Oh, no.<eos> You can't do that, man.<eos> You'd get in a lot of trouble for something like that. That's, like... Yeah.<eos> Maybe we can just do something that doesn't involve naked women. Just...<eos> You know, 'cause that's not fun for me.<eos> How 'bout if I show you my dick?<eos> Why would I want that? Oh, okay, okay, it's a prank if you don't want to see it but he shows you anyway.<eos> This guy gets it.<eos> It's gonna be hilarious.<eos> I think I get it. I'm gonna get myself hard, and I will show you what I mean.
_<eos> Madame?<eos> Madame?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Then I shall make it easier for you.
Comte St. Germain told me all about your part in the burning of his pox-afflicted vessel,<eos> "The Patagonia."<eos> You're friends with the Comte St. Germain?<eos> Au contraire.<eos> You may, shall I call us, rivals.<eos> A pleasant term for enemies, is it not?<eos> And since he's your enemy as well, you must, in point of fact, be my friend.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I could use a friend.<eos> Accept this mixture as my gift to you and your husband.

You ask of the clans?<eos> Well, sire, the truth of it is, the clans canna agree on the color of the sky, let alone put aside their old grievances and band together to fight the British.<eos> No, sire... they're not ready to hear the call of the pipes nor likely to be so for many years to come.<eos> I dare say... If that is the truth... it is one I have yet to hear.<eos> Damnable defeatist talk is what it sounds like and very peculiar coming from a supposed Jacobite.<eos> - Ooh, monsieur...<eos> - Non, merci.<eos> I assure you, sire...<eos> I hate the English as much as any man. I carry the scars of 200 lashes on my back that remind me of the fact every day.<eos> You asked for the truth, and the truth is what I gave you.
Then ken this...<eos> Scotland is a beautiful country... its glens, its lochs, its mountains.<eos> We're a people of the land, a simple people with no great love for outsiders.<eos> We will fight... have fought... each other more than not.<eos> But you ask us to shed our blood for what... to put a more sympathetic arse on the English throne?<eos> Is that cause enough for a cotter to exchange his scythe for a sword, to leave his home, his crops, and charge into a cannon's blast?<eos> It would appear you have now heard the truth from two loyal Scots.<eos> And what about God's truth?<eos> For His is the only truth that matters, is it not?<eos> I tell you both... it is God's will that I, Charles Stuart, unite the clans.
The Board meeting is now open.<eos> Over to you, Mrs Lariviére.<eos> Our trading account was down in the second quarter.<eos> I feel strong, I feel strong!<eos> I am strong, I'm a winner!<eos> You can't go in, Mr Mercier.<eos> I'm very strong.<eos> It must be important.<eos> The investment accounts-<eos> You're out of line, Mercier.
Two hundred and fifty employees on the street.<eos> Inertia would be costly.<eos> The meeting is closed.<eos> Mr Mercier!<eos> Mister Mercier.<eos> Why are you not further up the ranks of this company?<eos> We"...<eos> - Mr Maltard...<eos> - Maltard is a dolt.<eos> You know that. We both do.
- Mr Maltard...<eos> - Maltard is a dolt.<eos> You know that. We both do.<eos> I was looking for his replacement.<eos> I've just found him. You start next month.<eos> Meanwhile, take some time off.<eos> Tell me...are you never apart?<eos> You and...it?<eos> No.<eos> Why, you don't like it?
Dear friends, dear friends.<eos> Dear friends, I am pleased to present your new finance director.<eos> Please welcome him!<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, no.<eos> OK, all right.<eos> All right, thank you.<eos> Right, listen up.<eos> I don't do speeches.<eos> But I do promise you that from now on everyone will be treated equally.
But I do promise you that from now on everyone will be treated equally.<eos> No more tongue-lashings.<eos> This is now a free country, we're friends and fellows, co-workers eager to innovate and move forward.<eos> We're here to help one another.<eos> A month ago I promised change.<eos> From now on, no more basement!<eos> It's all in here!<eos> I also want to thank Chairman Desmoines for his sound judgement and to give him the last word.<eos> Thank you, Mr Mercier.<eos> To all of you who work at Sogetec, I have only one thing to say.
My. my!<eos> I see.<eos> You have a bad case of eczema.<eos> Have you recently eaten something that disagreed with you?<eos> Have you lately been under a lot of stress?<eos> I lost my hat.<eos> That isn't serious enough to cause-<eos> It's very serious!<eos> It's a catastrophe.<eos> You wouldn't understand.
I've got my memory back.<eos> This is a restricted area.<eos> It's the smell.<eos> You like it too?<eos> - May I ask you a question?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Would my jacket burn?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Would my jacket catch fire?<eos> Why would you want that?
What about his outburst on TV?<eos> He was drunk and drugged on Gitanes.<eos> What an unsavoury character with his ragga Marseillaise...<eos> You mean "reggae.._<eos> Reggae, raggay'! ...<eos> He's a disgrace to France!<eos> - I think he's quite funny.<eos> - The national anthem is sacred.<eos> That's right.<eos> If you want to see a scandal, go to Paris.
I need your advice.<eos> Mr Lavalliére, things are bad.<eos> - The unions want more.<eos> - Well then, give them more.<eos> Why? Think of the shareholders.<eos> And why not?<eos> How would you like a rise?<eos> Me?<eos> All right.<eos> What do you think?
Call me Bernard.<eos> You know Charlotte, my wife.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - After you.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Come, dear.<eos> After you, Santelli.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> There.<eos> I wanted to come say hello and tell you...
Good day.<eos> Signore?<eos> I'm supposed to meet the President.<eos> - Frangois Mitterrand. - This way.<eos> - Good evening, Mr Mercier.<eos> - Good evening, Mr President.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> - There's a reward.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> Since you don't want the reward, let me tell you a secret.
No.<eos> "FM", right?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> "FM".<eos> Not "BL", this time.<eos> No, it isn't...<eos> Do you often come to Venice, Mr Mercier?<eos> Not since my honeymoon. I'm here with my family.<eos> Would you try it on for me?<eos> It looks good on you.
You're mine now. Mine!<eos> Well, I like it.<eos> This hat is in grave danger!<eos> You haven't worn a hat for a while.<eos> Take off that silly hat!<eos> She doesn't like stealing.<eos> I haven't given it back, that's all.<eos> He loves making love.<eos> Odd?<eos> It looks good on you.
Miss Hideko is very ill and is easily awakened.<eos> The Mistress' room is over there?<eos> Mother.<eos> Mother.<eos> Miss. Are you all right?<eos> Sun Ja.<eos> Is it you Sun Ja?<eos> Sun Ja got fired.<eos> I am the new maid.<eos> You were having a nightmare?
But don't worry, during our painting lessons, I will dress properly.<eos> Are you Tamako?<eos> Yes Count, please take good care of me.<eos> It'll be hard for me to deal with you if you disservice me.<eos> Understand?<eos> For a Korean you don't look so bad.<eos> So...<eos> Will you fulfill your duty?<eos> Count Fujiwara calls for your maid Tamako to help him do something.<eos> He asks you if it is alright?
Your mother. has stolen a thousand times and only got caught once.<eos> And because of that, died.<eos> You ask if she cried?<eos> No, she laughed.<eos> Said she was very lucky to have been able to give birth to you before dying.<eos> I wasn't burdened at all.<eos> Please sit here for a bit.<eos> I will go and pick mushrooms.<eos> I'll make you hotpot tonight.<eos> You don't like hotpot?
We are very honored to have you pick our boat.<eos> We should arrive around... 7:30 pm.<eos> At last have reach home.<eos> It's been 3 years, I miss it so much.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You may not steal.<eos> You may not steal.<eos> No sex before marriage.<eos> You may not commit adultery.<eos> Were you able to sleep?
It's the only way.<eos> They'll only do a couple tests<eos> We'll eat lambchops tonight at the Peace Hotel<eos> We're almost done, you have worked hard.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hello Miss.<eos> Do you still remember me?<eos> Miss.<eos> What are you people doing?<eos> We aren't harming you Miss.
We'll eat lambchops tonight at the Peace Hotel<eos> We're almost done, you have worked hard.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hello Miss.<eos> Do you still remember me?<eos> Miss.<eos> What are you people doing?<eos> We aren't harming you Miss.<eos> But taking care of you.<eos> You've got the wrong person.
But taking care of you.<eos> You've got the wrong person.<eos> That is Count Fujiwara's wife.<eos> Count, say something!<eos> You think you're the maid?<eos> After all, she was raised by someone like the maid.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You bastard.<eos> Damn you all.<eos> You can't say those things here.
Hideko?<eos> Tonight... will she appear in your dreams?<eos> Even if she did show up in my dreams,<eos> I feel that for us it is not meant to be.<eos> Because she is as cold as ice.<eos> It is the result of a long strenuous training<eos> I heard that you want to marry her.<eos> As I see it, this relationship is right I do not see that desire in her eyes.<eos> Then it's no different than a soulless person.<eos> You have to find a suitable method. If you don't want to make love with someone dead on the inside.
As I see it, this relationship is right I do not see that desire in her eyes.<eos> Then it's no different than a soulless person.<eos> You have to find a suitable method. If you don't want to make love with someone dead on the inside.<eos> This is my method of making things become beautiful.<eos> Has Miss Hideko learned the fine arts yet?<eos> She has only immersed in the literary arts, reading reciting poetry.<eos> Then...<eos> When I studied in the UK they made girls learn painting and such...<eos> Whether they were aristocrats or not.<eos> You have a call.
I'm a cold-hearted Mistress, Count.<eos> He's going to come back soon.<eos> Yanshu calling... is because I wanted to talk to you alone about something.<eos> I want to talk about your future.<eos> I will be waiting at the lamppost at midnight.<eos> Yanshu is a fool.<eos> There's a maid sleeping behind you.<eos> I don't want you to be tied in a scandal.<eos> I saw Keiko carrying pillows and leaving already.<eos> You don't think about the face you have as an aristocrat?
After that, I spent 3 years preparing, learning about poetry and linguistics.<eos> And even picked up ways to replicate paintings.<eos> All just to meet you.<eos> Persuading you to marry me.<eos> To appropriate your father's assets.<eos> After that, abandon you.<eos> But after I have met you, I know not just anyone can seduce you.<eos> Can't?<eos> That's why I have a proposal for you.<eos> Although the wedding binds us, this is all of choice, its up to you.
You don't need to be embarrassed Miss.<eos> Even a professional jeweler could hardly tell the difference<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'm returning the earrings I borrowed from you.<eos> Women love to play with fate.<eos> She always takes the earrings and tries them on as she looks in the mirror.<eos> I feel that Sook-Hee will do her best.<eos> She won't be suspicious about us.<eos> Until the day comes, don't let Sook-Hee find out.<eos> Let her do her best to help you fall in love with me.
You're the one who's going to be thrown in the asylum.<eos> You will be sent there under my name.<eos> After that, I will assume your identity and go with that bastard.<eos> So I won't have anything against you.<eos> Because you wanted to do the same to me...<eos> That fucking son of a bitch!<eos> I'm sorry miss!<eos> Hello, it is I Sook-Hee.<eos> I'm writing this letter this letter explaining the change of plans.<eos> Miss Hideko has decided to work with me But I need to send you something.
I have lots to teach you.<eos> You will become a perfect woman.<eos> Hideko<eos> I too read a book a few days ago, in there it said when women are forcefully taken, they have more pleasure.<eos> So now just lie down.<eos> Can you help me get that?<eos> Send this to Uncle<eos> Every time I watched Uncle and the Count speak Japanese so fluently, he concentrated on instigating fear on the aristocrats.<eos> In my heart, I think the who should be pitied is Uncle.<eos> I am very happy to tell you, that you don't have to do anything.
I think he knows that much.<eos> Why do you think they call him Black?<eos> I asked his pal, Kendu Wallace, why they called him Black but he didn't know.<eos> Did he know anything else?<eos> Well he knew Black didn't like Joey.<eos> He knew that.<eos> Hmm... He said Black hated him.<eos> Can I ask y'all something?<eos> Please do.<eos> What did Kendu Wallace ever do to you?
He's so young, too.<eos> Too much violence with these kids.<eos> Hey, he punches hard as hell though.<eos> What, you're bigger than me now?<eos> You're bigger than me now?<eos> Lucky!<eos> We regret to inform you that your son,<eos> José Alvarez de la Cruz, was killed in action.<eos> My nephew is no slouch either.<eos> Let me tell you how good a cop he is.
What?<eos> Janine...<eos> Janine...<eos> Janine, what?<eos> Shh... It's OK.<eos> It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.<eos> Janine...<eos> If you want to leave, you can leave.<eos> But it ain't no good being alone.<eos> Hey... I have something to tell you all.
- I love you, too.<eos> - OK, good night.<eos> Good night, pal.<eos> Olga.<eos> Olga, Olga... Olga.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> How have you been?<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> I came by your house a few times, but you were always out.<eos> I wanted to show you the miracle.
What is that?<eos> You can't leave your fish around like that.<eos> I don't know why the hell it keeps dripping.<eos> All night long, drip, drip, drip.<eos> I've had the fucking thing repaired ten times.<eos> You need a new stopper.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Well, your stopper, it's rotted around the edges, so it's not making a seal,<eos> The water is going to drip through into the bowl.<eos> I could bring you a new one tomorrow, or you might want to consider replacing the whole apparatus.
I'll be up there in a hour and a half.<eos> Okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mr. Emery, it's Lee again.<eos> I contacted Jose, who says he can cover for me till Friday night at least.<eos> Uh, after that, Gene MacAdavey will take over until I get back.<eos> I wouldn't do anything with Mr. And Mrs. Fredrick's ceiling until you get a real plumber in there.<eos> But what are you going to do?<eos> I will let you know a soon as I have more information.
Fuck her.<eos> You want to stop with that shit?<eos> Come on with that stuff.<eos> Thank you, Tony.<eos> I have to get up to Manchester.<eos> Nobody told Patrick right?<eos> No, you had asked for us to wait for you to get here.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> So, um... What is the procedure now?<eos> Well, now you have to make arrangements with the funeral parlor, and they pretty much take care of everything.
How is he?<eos> How's Joe?<eos> He's fine.<eos> You know, he's all right.<eos> He's doing all right.<eos> And you didn't run out of beer?<eos> You got through the day okay?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We were very temperate.<eos> I don't know why you guys bother getting on the frigging boat.
And the house and the boat are owned outright.<eos> I can't commute from Boston every day until he turns 18.<eos> I think the idea was that you would relocate.<eos> Relocate to where?<eos> Here?<eos> Well, if you look... As you can see, your brother worked everything out extremely carefully.<eos> But he can't...<eos> He can't have meant that.<eos> Uh, he's allowed up to $5,000... to pay for moving expenses.<eos> And there's a small amount set aside for you to draw from as personal income while you settle in.
Minnesota.<eos> Minnesota<eos> Minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> That's right.<eos> It was my impression that you'd spent a lot of time here over the years.<eos> I was just a backup.<eos> I came up here to look after Patty, yeah, if Joe was in the hospital after my father couldn't do it. We...<eos> It was supposed to be Donny.<eos> I'm just a backup.<eos> Well, I can just repeat that I'm astonished that Joe didn't run this by you, thorough as he was.
You all right?<eos> This must all be really overwhelming for you, so just let me know if you need anything, okay?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ma'am, I have something I need to show you.<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Good luck on your interview.<eos> So they found this phone on the body, and there are these images.<eos> Manny?<eos> Manny, there you are.<eos> - Do you know...
Manny, there you are.<eos> - Do you know...<eos> - This is...<eos> We're going live in just a few seconds.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Keep swiping.<eos> And turn around.<eos> Here's the camera.<eos> Do not go anywhere.<eos> - You don't know this young man?
Obvious, right?<eos> No offense.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Coming.<eos> Come, let's get some air.<eos> He can't see anymore.<eos> Our lesson isn't until tomorrow, right?<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Yes, so, I wanted to tell you...
No offense.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Coming.<eos> Come, let's get some air.<eos> He can't see anymore.<eos> Our lesson isn't until tomorrow, right?<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Yes, so, I wanted to tell you...<eos> I wanted to tell you that...
You were dressed like that at school?<eos> No, I'm working part-time in the Theresienstift.<eos> Interesting. - Yes.<eos> Bärbel, hello.<eos> Greetings. - Greetings.<eos> - Winfried.<eos> - Babette, nice to meet you.<eos> Winfried, greetings.<eos> - I'm happy that you're going to be parents.<eos> You must stick together.
All she does is talk on the phone. - Well...<eos> We must have done something wrong.<eos> Come back inside.<eos> I'm still on the phone.<eos> And what else did he say?<eos> Almost done, dad.<eos> Yes, that's a good start.<eos> Anyway, I will get back in touch... uhm... with you tomorrow and...<eos> I'm glad we talked.<eos> Good evening to you too.
Ah, so, I'm sure you can ask for any shopping question.<eos> - I'm sorry for that.<eos> I know that you're busy.<eos> - No, no, it's really okay.<eos> What do you need?<eos> - I need to go shopping.<eos> Because we have this wedding this weekend in Moscow. I would like to buy some presents.<eos> I do not have much shopping here myself.<eos> But there are several big malls Plus it's an area with exclusive shops.<eos> It depends on what you need.

The mall is okay.<eos> So, why do not you give me your number? I'll find the best places for you.
- It's a modern solution. - Yes.<eos> And is the other daughter better?<eos> The cakes are better.<eos> And she cuts my toenails.<eos> But she's not your daughter, right?<eos> Have a good evening.<eos> Right.<eos> - Did you arrange something?<eos> - Oh yeah, everything okay.<eos> - A good evening to you.
It's gonna be a really bizarre mix of people..<eos> Gabriel, he just invited everyone.<eos> Oh god, that is disgusting.<eos> He's definitely not waiting for Ion Tiriac.<eos> You never know.<eos> My limousine is waiting.<eos> It was very nice to meet you.<eos> Sorry, just one moment!<eos> My husband has a headhunting company here,<eos> If there's anything we can do to help you or Mr. Tiriac, we'd be very happy to
- Did you apply the technique?<eos> - No, I didn't need it this time.<eos> It went well, I...<eos> I would like to do some work on my body language.<eos> Sometimes I lose control of it...<eos> Do you have an example?<eos> It tends to be when I'm listening.<eos> I suspect you're really listening in those moments.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> That's noble, of course, but maybe you need to focus more on your own message.
- And our deal?<eos> - I know, again and again this "deal".<eos> But we're talking one year tops Then you can start at a whole new level.<eos> I've heard that a few times before.<eos> I can manage Bucharest just as well from Shanghai.<eos> That's not realistic.<eos> This is your partner case.<eos> Did he just fart?<eos> Think it over.<eos> Then you can choose where you want to go.
Dana.<eos> Erdmann.<eos> You're also here?<eos> - Is Henneberg still here?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> We just had dinner.<eos> He always must...<eos> I'm here incognito today.<eos> We'll speak tomorrow.<eos> You must meet my husband
These are apples from the embassy's garden. Come in, please.<eos> So I had this vision of painting of the Easter eggs.<eos> Oh, the eggs.<eos> - Yes. OK, Please come in.<eos> These are friends, family...<eos> Do you remember Mr. Erdmann from the party?<eos> Yes, the eggs. You know,<eos> These are here from professionals.<eos> We didn't really paint them ourselves. It is very complicated.<eos> But we did it with the children. We show it to you, if you want - Yes, please.

You don't have to join in.<eos> Ring the bell if you change your mind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What was that?<eos> That was your boss.<eos> What are we going to do with you now?<eos> I'm, I'm.. I'm definitely not getting undressed.<eos> This is not my deal, you know..<eos> Excuse me, but then you have to go. Really?<eos> Oh hey. Have fun, you two.
You're welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Am I the first?<eos> Many happy returns!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Because you always ask for mine.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> At the office you are always so... so stiff, and now you... come up with this idea.<eos> You like the apartment?
A serious occasion...<eos> - Can I?<eos> - Yes, please, thank you.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't see her again.<eos> The line is long...<eos> They are all after her money only.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You can close the coffin now.<eos> Can I help you with anything?
Cuerno.<eos> - Yes, Cuerno.<eos> The whole reason I planned to come on this trip, Cuerno, was to find the secret beach.<eos> And now she's stuck back at Islas Rocas with an Irish flu.<eos> Nursing a hangover.<eos> Yes, hangover.<eos> Major hangover.<eos> Nancy:<eos> My professional opinion is to take 2 Advil + Zzz = ☺<eos> You do not like it when someone change your plan, do you?
California.<eos> Uh.<eos> Close, Texas.<eos> You surf in Texas?<eos> Yes, we have surf in Texas.<eos> It's just not like this though.<eos> Hey, this is a secret place, how you find it?<eos> Someone told me about it a while ago.<eos> What's it called?<eos> If I tell you, I would have to kill you.
Calling Short Crop<eos> - Short Crop?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Guess where I am.<eos> - Do you wanna?<eos> Oh my god.<eos> No way.<eos> Mom's beach, right?<eos> It's just as beautiful as she said it was.<eos> Ah, I wish you were here.
You are not going to feel a thing, ma'am.<eos> Just put some Novocaine injections to numb the area.<eos> So, you're just going to feel a little pressure, but...<eos> You're not going to feel the stitches, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> Ahhhhh!<eos> Tie up the suture.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's a nice union.<eos> One more and then we'll send you on your way.
I got to go, okay?<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Hey, sweet pea.<eos> She was a fighter.<eos> I'm going to fight.<eos> Just like she taught us.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> No!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Fuck you.
You think that your five-foot-four kindergarten teacher is gonna...<eos> Who is, uh, I don't know, 62, is gonna pull out her ak-47?<eos> Well, not every single person has to be armed and use a gun, but the more people that have them makes the world a safer place.<eos> So that's a heck of a long barrel.<eos> Let me ask you somethin', okay?<eos> Just in the world and life, what do you need a barrel that long for?
- In a well-regulated militia.<eos> You in a militia?<eos> Hey, Vladimir putin may come here, take off his shirt,<eos> - and they have to do something.<eos> Hey, Melissa, what's going on?<eos> I thought we were doing homework together.<eos> I've got some serious issues with this cupcake experiment...<eos> This gun is more powerful.<eos> What if he's 50 yards down the pike?<eos> Hit you in the back?
Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, may I speak to John aloysius mccain of 550 maple Avenue, please?<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I'm on disability and I can't give you any money.
I just wanna get to know you somewhat.<eos> - F or instance... what do you do for a living, Mr. mccain?<eos> I...<eos> I gut fish.<eos> These cupcakes are killing me.<eos> I am totally not able to get the cupcake experiment on.<eos> I work in a cannery and I got a special knife to gut fish.<eos> Well, that is interesting.<eos> It's like bird cupcake factory time.<eos> Listen, can I call you back in a minute?
I...<eos> People at the job, they go off the deep end.<eos> And then what happens?<eos> Whether they're ten years old or 50 years old, they reach for that...<eos> - Take these.<eos> - Oh, thanks for the help.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> You scared me.<eos> Why, am I scary?<eos> I told you, you cannot stay here.
Well?<eos> I barely knew mad dog, but he knew my parole was coming up and he took this fall for me.<eos> He just did it, like that.<eos> And so, somebody like that?<eos> You owe a lifetime.<eos> Oh, mama.<eos> No, seriously, the smoke.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It worked.<eos> Felt like these huge arms, felt like your mom giving' you the biggest hug ever.
- What time are we meetin' Joey?<eos> - Not for, like, two hours.<eos> And we're close.<eos> Yo, Madeline.<eos> That French whore I was tellin' ya about, just got off the chain.<eos> Hey, I'm Madeline.<eos> You mind if I grab a red bull bloody before we go up?<eos> Oh, god, that's sounds horrible.<eos> No, seriously, that just sounds disgusting.<eos> Why don't you just get a regular bloody and you can fall asleep on me.
Pretty long.<eos> That's nice.<eos> You're actually really fuckin' hot, you know?<eos> Well, you're a pretty cute kid yourself.<eos> It's gonna be 1,500.<eos> Oh, yeah, they took care of that.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> I'm very sure they did.<eos> Dude, go down, go ask the manager.<eos> I promise you, they didn't.
Shit!<eos> Bro, he loves me.<eos> Like the old fudge puncher said, a man kills the thing he loves.<eos> You keep him away from me.<eos> Those paranoid types make me scared.<eos> These hood rats, man.<eos> I think they've been watchin' too much black entertainment television or somethin'.<eos> 'Cause they all have these little things they do.<eos> Like they saw in a gangster rap video or some shit.<eos> Like fuck you, who gives a shit?
Yeah.<eos> Run these through r and I.<eos> Yeah, man, see about Evie.<eos> Get off her fat ass for a minute.<eos> We gotta figure this shit out, though.<eos> Damn sure.<eos> - Step out of the car, please.<eos> - What?<eos> Please, step outta the car.<eos> Why don't you leave them alone?
- Motherfucker.<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Go!<eos> - Go.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Get the fuck outta here, that's right!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> So I asked for $10,000, we settled at nine.<eos> I spent $300 to get us broads, and I got you...<eos> I got you a little extra...
I'll be, uh, makin' some money in the next couple of months.<eos> Did you wanna go there with me?<eos> Mm, maybe.<eos> We'll stay in a bed and breakfast, get up, have coffee and a cigarette.<eos> You know, you're a real cutie-patootie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just a cutie-patootie.<eos> You got that classic movie star look like Marlene Dietrich.<eos> I could be your bogart, you can be my Dietrich.<eos> You like those classic movie stars from the '30s, like cagney, bogart, Edward g?
Thanks.<eos> Just a cutie-patootie.<eos> You got that classic movie star look like Marlene Dietrich.<eos> I could be your bogart, you can be my Dietrich.<eos> You like those classic movie stars from the '30s, like cagney, bogart, Edward g?<eos> - I like those guys.<eos> - Uh-huh, me, too.<eos> Okay, so if you want me to go downtown, it's an extra 300 bucks.<eos> But I'll make it worth your while, 'cause I know how to do it right.<eos> - Can I just ask you one thing?
Okay, so if you want me to go downtown, it's an extra 300 bucks.<eos> But I'll make it worth your while, 'cause I know how to do it right.<eos> - Can I just ask you one thing?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Would you be interested in going to nice with me, maybe get away from all this for a little while?<eos> Yeah, where is nice again?<eos> In fucking France.<eos> Yeah, I don't know, uh,<eos> I still gotta get my head shots taken, and then there's this guy, Robert.<eos> Oh, the gay guy I was telling you about, he's my roommate, and when he gets back, he's gonna help me edit my album.
- Just go easy.<eos> - I know.<eos> This take forever.<eos> I know.<eos> The fuck?<eos> Get the fuck outta here, go on!<eos> Get the fuck outta here!<eos> Go on, get the fuck out before I paint the wall with ya!<eos> - Get out!<eos> You like this guy?
Yeah, that don't add up.<eos> Why do you say?<eos> Well, it's not impossible.<eos> It's just if you wanna die, you're gonna sit there and hack away at your chest?<eos> No, you're gonna take a gun.<eos> If you're afraid of that, you eat a bunch of pills or do a fat shot of heroin.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Plus his girlfriend was a bitch and she envied him 'cause he was, like, the only acoustic guy who penetrated the Seattle scene.<eos> And this was the time with nirvana and Alice in chains and whatnot.<eos> So what kind of music you like?
No, I didn't say you were crazy.<eos> Listen, please.<eos> I'm not a violent person.<eos> No, I understand that, I know.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't feel safe right now.<eos> And I don't feel safe and I have to leave now.<eos> Let's do this again real soon.<eos> Well, hey, I enjoyed the shit out of certain things.<eos> I wanna just honestly express my gratitude to you, Troy, for hookin' this little adventure up.
- Okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> He's got a one-year-old out in the heights.<eos> I need you to snatch him.<eos> Kidnapping.<eos> I don't dig the sound of this.<eos> Plus, there hasn't been an unsolved kidnapping-for-ransom in the United States in a long time.<eos> I mean, granted, this was different, 'cause ain't nobody gonna report this one.<eos> Okay, so how would this work?<eos> T'll work because I guarantee you a half a million, plus half of whatever Brennan pays, if he pays at all.
People don't look too kindly on it.<eos> All right, take it easy.<eos> I ain't into abusing' children, you dig?<eos> Kid's still a baby, he ain't ever gonna know.<eos> If he was four or somethin', I'd never be doin' that.<eos> He wouldn't do that.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna be home.<eos> Just the girlfriend, the nanny, and the baby.<eos> It'll go quick, Troy.<eos> Look, what if I give you 500,000 plus a $250,000 bump?
Nah.<eos> You should know, you come from money, huh, Troy?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> It's me, doll, I'm back.<eos> No, Mike Brennan.<eos> No, no, I'm goin' back to my house.<eos> No, meet up there, it's much more boring.<eos> Yeah, it's my baby mama, I'm gonna surprise her.<eos> Yeah, she's been bringin' her boyfriend over to the house.<eos> How 'bout I just send you a cellphone video of me beating' his fuckin' ass?

Okay, good.<eos> Canton is good, that's a start.<eos> Now I need ya to call him, tell him his kid's collateral on money he owes an old friend from prison, and as soon as he pays it, he gets the kid back, okay?<eos> Carmen!<eos> Lady!<eos> I don't have time for this shit.<eos> All right, did you get your phone charged?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay, good, 'cause we're gonna call you in a little bit, so keep it charged.<eos> If you need to, you can plug in that charger over there.

We're gonna give you the combination to that lock, and then you can let yourself out.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> Yes.<eos> Here's a pen so you can write down the combination.<eos> And if we don't call right away, don't panic, don't do anything, don't call anybody, 'cause we got people outside, ya see?<eos> And they're gonna get very upset if they see anything weird or they hear anything weird.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh, you like that, huh?
Jesus Christ, are you kiddin' me, with a mother like that?<eos> You're not gonna judge me?<eos> Dis!<eos> I mean, i...<eos> I looked to you to be a friend.<eos> I mean, to be a friend, you know, what accepts ya, 'cause...<eos> See, that's all I ever wanted, was unconditional love...<eos> Oh, god, I fucked this shit up!<eos> Look, look, look, man, I understand.<eos> Can I just ask you one thing, a logistical thing?
Hey, it's me.<eos> - Somethin' happened.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm comin' back alone.<eos> So dog is gone?<eos> Yep.<eos> We were family.<eos> Yep.<eos> Can't say as I'm surprised.<eos> Well, there's something you need to know.
Gotta be samurais, gotta be samurais, gotta be samurais.<eos> Gotta be samurais, gotta be samurais, gotta be samurais, gotta be samurais.<eos> How we doin' back there, Dorothy?<eos> Can I get ya somethin'?<eos> Chocolate milk, a cock to suck on?<eos> You know what, Jack?<eos> That's enough.<eos> But he does have a good point.<eos> Not much of a tough guy now, are ya?<eos> You like fuckin' shootin' cops?
And I can tell you're a good person, too.<eos> You care about your wife.<eos> Yeah, you're a good man.<eos> Well, all right, here's what.<eos> We're real close.<eos> I need to get dropped off.<eos> But I just wanna say one thing, one thing to put your mind at ease when we go, all right?<eos> You're gonna make it outta this.<eos> Your wife's gonna be safe, and you're gonna be fine.<eos> And I promise you, the only person who's gonna go down outta this is gonna be me.
Oh, my purse.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Mr. Taylor?<eos> Who the fuck is this?<eos> Detective Sergeant Dennis Box.<eos> What'd she do now?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Whatever it is, you can keep her there. I'm not coming down.<eos> Actually, that's exactly what I need you to do.

I'm not coming down.<eos> Actually, that's exactly what I need you to do.<eos> I said no. I'm tired of it.<eos> Mr. Taylor, I need to see you.<eos> I'm gonna give you an address.
Did he say?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What did he do?<eos> Someone was killed, and they think that... It's crazy, but they think he did it.<eos> Any homicides last night?<eos> Some Muslim freak carved up a girl in the 2-1.<eos> You're in the wrong precinct.<eos> This is the 1-2.<eos> You gotta go to the 2-1.
Some Muslim freak carved up a girl in the 2-1.<eos> You're in the wrong precinct.<eos> This is the 1-2.<eos> You gotta go to the 2-1.<eos> Thank you. All right.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Arms out.<eos> Shoes off.<eos> I don't think you want me to do that.
Is that who did it?<eos> - He's a suspect.<eos> - In custody?<eos> We're talking to him.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Naz?<eos> No.<eos> Did she know him?<eos> She may have just met him.<eos> I'd like to show you some pictures.
In case you've seen him around.<eos> He's an Arab?<eos> No.<eos> - He's not an Arab?<eos> - No.<eos> What are they?<eos> Any of them look familiar?<eos> No.<eos> The house will be sealed for a while.<eos> You got some place you can stay?
What are they?<eos> Any of them look familiar?<eos> No.<eos> The house will be sealed for a while.<eos> You got some place you can stay?<eos> I don't live there.<eos> It's Andrea's house, her mother's.<eos> I live in Queens.<eos> Three years to commence immediately at the Cape Vincent Correctional Center.<eos> You'll like it up there, Mr. G. Right on the border with Canada, no frets about humidity.
Come and join us.<eos> - Welcome here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I have just learned of your ennoblement, Your Highness.<eos> My sincere congratulations.<eos> You are most kind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God is in our wine.<eos> It can do you no harm.
Won't your father demand I become a Muslim?<eos> No.<eos> I've always wanted to go to Paris, more than anywhere in the world.<eos> I promise I will take you to Paris for our honeymoon.<eos> Now... will you marry me?<eos> I will.<eos> I will, Ali.<eos> Khan.<eos> Khan.<eos> A telegram for you.
I need something warm.<eos> Something warm. Something warm.<eos> My father suggests we make our way to Sweden.<eos> Neutral country.<eos> Does he suggest how we might get there in the middle of a war?<eos> They pay no attention.<eos> When you write back, tell them we are living the way most people live in our country.<eos> And it makes sense.<eos> It belonged to Ali's mother.<eos> Thank you so much, Safar Khan.
It belonged to Ali's mother.<eos> Thank you so much, Safar Khan.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you fetch the water from the well every morning, my child?<eos> And do you do all the cooking?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I approve of your wife, Ali Khan.<eos> But... she is a very bad cook.<eos> Safar Khan, can I tempt you to some more?
We have to leave.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm staying here with Ilyas.<eos> You have to go with my father to Persia.<eos> - No, I want to stay with you.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> This fight isn't over yet.<eos> I'll call the baby Ali.<eos> This is Yahya Guli.<eos> He will show you to your quarters.
You are very lucky with him.<eos> Wear this.<eos> Wear, wear.<eos> It will protect you against any rival.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Any news?<eos> What are all these?<eos> I told you I don't want to wear a veil.<eos> I am sorry, Princess.<eos> I can't allow you to leave the harem without one.
- If I ask, you'll say yes?<eos> - Depends.<eos> I want you to come home to Tbilisi with us.<eos> - No.<eos> - But you have to.<eos> I want you to tell your husband to leave this place.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> This man Lenin said the revolution will not survive without Baku oil.<eos> They'll be coming for it.<eos> Do you like it?
Excuse me?<eos> - What did you expect?<eos> To question people without anyone from the local present?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're a social worker?<eos> - No, I'm a detective constable.<eos> But we could talk about your childhood.<eos> We're police.<eos> Carl Mørck.<eos> Can we ask you some questions?
- Okay.<eos> Ah, fuck.<eos> Three. 105.<eos> Yeah, here it is.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> With the proofs the District Attorney's office think they have, there's a good chance your son is facing life imprisonment.<eos> The good news is that's why we go to court.<eos> But any way you slice it, it's gonna be a long battle with no guarantee of a successful outcome.<eos> And any lawyer who comes to you with the words "I guarantee!" is a liar.

I'll work every angle I can for Naz, and I won't rest until everything that can be done is done.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - However, a good defense costs money.<eos> How much?<eos> Let me tell you this before I tell you that.
- Baby, I can't do this no more.<eos> They're bringing in polygraphs.<eos> - We still okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You don't got to pay my rent no more if you don't want to.<eos> Take me back.<eos> As per usual, I see some old faces here.<eos> Glad you learned your lesson.<eos> For the freshmen, I'll keep it simple.<eos> You get told to do something, you do it.
Pick up some Saran Wrap and Crisco. Apply a large dollop to each foot morning and night and wrap them up.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> I can't walk around in public like that.<eos> Saran Wrap is clear. No one will even notice.<eos> Do it, come back and see me in a week, and we will marvel together at the improvement.<eos> Why not some WD-40 and a Glad cinch sack?<eos> We're not only going after the so-called doctor who mauled Ms. Hahn's face, but also the airline that fired her because, as they put it, the results made it too disturbing for the passengers to interact with her.<eos> But the surgery was voluntary, wasn't it?<eos> You're a stewardess who served your employer faithfully for 25 years.<eos> After awarding your silver wings for a quarter-century of service, they start dropping hints like confetti that you need to start keeping up your appearance, the "or else" as implicit as a storm cloud.
More power to you, brother.<eos> - And how you doing, John? - Me?<eos> You know, I'm holding my own.<eos> He drug you down the street by your hair and brought you back to the house, and you're pregnant.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did you do that?<eos> - I don't remember that.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> The question is not whether you remember it.<eos> Did someone tell you that you did it?
My Purge playlist.<eos> I put a lot of thought into it, especially this final tune as it will be the last song you'll ever hear.<eos> Tough choice.<eos> And then I thought, George Clinton!<eos> The king of interplanetary funkmanship.<eos> George's psychedelic rock will leave you feeling funky, obviously.
- Secure the audience.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> I'd like to talk to you guys.<eos> Put a leash on her, Chief.<eos> She's no good to anyone dead.<eos> You got it, Leo.<eos> - Okay. We're on the move.<eos> - Copy, boss.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you so much. Thank you.
To be like Americans.<eos> We're very excited.<eos> Foreigners coming to our capital to kill.<eos> Murder tourism.<eos> It's the new booming business in our country this year.<eos> Murder tourism.<eos> What's happened to our country, Joe?<eos> Mrs. Sabian, I wish I knew.<eos> But you take care of yourself, Mrs. S.<eos> Next time you need something, just give us a call.

That's a nasty woman, right there.<eos> Joe.<eos> Mira.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Where's he going?<eos> I never saw him move so damn fast.<eos> All right, girls, give it up. I won't have to call the police.<eos> Get outta my face, old man!<eos> Let's not do this the hard way, okay?<eos> I'm giving you an out.
...Dante is suspected of eliminating wealthy NFFA supporters on Purge Nights.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> And many are wondering why he has come to Washington this year.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Hold it. Wait a minute.<eos> Why are you raising my rates now?<eos> Do you know what today is?<eos> Yeah, but look, I...<eos> Yeah... I can't afford that.<eos> What do you mean, you're sorry?

Eric, thank you for being here tonight.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Leo, have a drink with me.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> Sounds serious.<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> Or I'll stick my foot up your ass.<eos> Sit.<eos> It's water, Leo.<eos> Are you scared?
No bullshit.<eos> I want a real answer.<eos> I lost my son some years ago.<eos> He was killed.<eos> I almost did something on Purge Night that would've destroyed a lot of lives.<eos> I want this night gone.<eos> I know you do, too.<eos> Especially after what you lost.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Despite all of that, you have a big problem with how I do things.

- Stay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, this is my place.<eos> You can stay all night if you want to.<eos> Now, I got to ask you 'cause I'm just a nosey old dog.<eos> What in the Mississippi fuck was you doing outside on Purge Night, Senator?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There was an assassination attempt on me.<eos> I can't thank you enough, Mr...
- Hey, Senator.<eos> - He actually think you can win this thing.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Shit!<eos> Tell her what she need to do to win, Marcos.<eos> No, it's not my place to say.<eos> Well, you saved my life, Marcos.<eos> I'd like to hear it, please.<eos> Florida is the key.<eos> You have to get the elders.
You gentlemen understand what's at stake here, yes?<eos> - Yes?<eos> All right.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We are gonna Purge today Purge today, Purge today<eos> We are gonna Purge today Burn this bitch down<eos> Fuck!<eos> Okay, you take the back, I'm gonna take the front.<eos> I'll take the front with you.<eos> No, you're not gonna be on the frontline.
- Yes.<eos> We are gonna Purge today Purge today, Purge today<eos> We are gonna Purge today Burn this bitch down<eos> Fuck!<eos> Okay, you take the back, I'm gonna take the front.<eos> I'll take the front with you.<eos> No, you're not gonna be on the frontline.<eos> Are you crazy, Leo?<eos> Give me a gun.<eos> I will give you a gun, but you're not on the frontline.
Everybody's got a past.<eos> That was a Crip whistle.<eos> They just threw it back.<eos> If this is the right set, we should be good.<eos> I know, I know what I heard.<eos> All right.<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.<eos> Just help my fuckin' boy.<eos> He's gonna die.<eos> We help you, you do something for us.
Senator, why don't we go outside...<eos> Stop.<eos> Those are the Minister's biggest financial supporters.<eos> The NFFA.<eos> Our Lady of Sorrows.<eos> Is that where the Minister is going to be tonight for the Purge Mass?<eos> - We believe so.<eos> - You believe...<eos> What is all this?<eos> Why do you have all this?
Hold on, guys.<eos> Look.<eos> Those are government trucks.<eos> I saw them on YouTube from last year's Purge.<eos> And they're going straight back towards the Safe Zone.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> I need to win this thing fair and fucking square.<eos> They are not playing fair and fucking square and neither should we.<eos> This church will be locked up like Fort Knox.<eos> You'll never get through.
You're gonna get slaughtered.<eos> Four churches were built on that site.<eos> The original by your boy George Washington over 200 years ago.<eos> The man liked to have escape tunnels attached to all his structures.<eos> They're all over D.C.<eos> The tunnel under the original church has been closed up since the '50s.<eos> But we reopened it.<eos> We're gonna walk right through there and into that church without anybody even knowing it.<eos> The original Founding Fathers are about to fuck over the New Founding Fathers.<eos> Now how you like that for irony?
You call him.<eos> You tell him he does this and the Minister becomes a martyr.<eos> I cannot have my presidency built on murder.<eos> You see that.<eos> He will not leave this to the voters.<eos> He does not believe in the American system.<eos> Angel, believe in me.<eos> I can make this happen.<eos> We do.<eos> That's why we're trying to pave a way for you to the White House so you can make changes.
You're a son of God.<eos> - God wants you to Purge.<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> Coward.<eos> Purge!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it! Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Kill me!<eos> Now, I'm gonna tell you right now, I like black people, but I ain't gonna let you all shoot these white folks.
I think you intend to return to that beach, and seize every last ounce of gold off of it, and I think you're going to need my help to do it.<eos> I have committed men and resources to aid you in retrieving the Urca gold, in exchange for which you assured me, expelling Captain Vane from that fort.
Her word will be the last word for this place.<eos> My men will need to lean on something solid.<eos> They look to me for that, but they'll also look to their new quartermaster.<eos> There's something you ought to know, before my misfortune at the hands of Vane's leftenants, our friend, the scout, confessed something to me.<eos> He told me that he could sell the gold's location to another crew in exchange for a larger share of the prize.<eos> Mast approaching, starboard side!<eos> Rig the capstan!<eos> Sir?<eos> There are men here to see...<eos> May I help you?
You're coming with us.<eos> I understand your anger, but I've lived long enough to know that any promise made beside the word "forever"<eos> is no more than a lie agreed upon.<eos> There is no forever.<eos> Everything moves towards its end.<eos> And the closer we get to ours, the louder that clock ticks, the less a sane man would let a promise deprive him of happiness.<eos> I explained all this to Mary, who told me she understood and that she would not protest our separation.<eos> Are you calling my sister a liar?<eos> Well... you're here.<eos> I can think of at least three lies she must have told you to bring that about.

Maybe Flint's right.<eos> Maybe they are getting nervous.<eos> Or maybe someone else secured them for him.<eos> Someone larger than Hume or Hornigold.<eos> Someone to whom the rules as we understand them don't apply.<eos> Flint was right about one thing.<eos> This is only the beginning.<eos> Something else is coming.<eos> Judge: "For years you lorded over the operations of hundreds, if not thousands, of hardened pirates.<eos> How exactly were you able to manage this?"
"I am the one who set her free."<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> My name is Woodes Rogers, and I am the next governor of New Providence Island.<eos> Well, assuming I can subdue her.<eos> That is where you come in.<eos> I am to set sail for the West Indies in two days' time.<eos> I am prepared.<eos> But the one element I lack is knowledge, someone who understands Nassau and can help me know what I'm going to find there.<eos> If you agree to be that person for me, your sentence will be commuted and the charges against you released.<eos> And what would you ask of me?
Now?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> See the time?<eos> I have to sleep. I get up at 6.<eos> The Radical Loser<eos> If the reform passes, us kids won't find work.<eos> Already 25% uneployment!<eos> When we finish school, we won't find jobs!<eos> Let's show them we won't give up!<eos> - You can't enter!
To get your opinion.<eos> I don't have to give my opinion on politics.<eos> But blocking the entrance is pathetic.<eos> Students deciding if teachers can work?<eos> We have to ask freshmen if we can teach now.<eos> They won't let Antonia come in.<eos> Great! I've had enough.<eos> - Respect different convictions!<eos> - You have none!<eos> You just want to graduate!
You just want to graduate!<eos> You're in school and speak of retirement!<eos> - Enough!<eos> - Your talk of '68 is nonsense!<eos> - You're selfish!<eos> - Us, selfish!<eos> This isn't for us, but for our parents, for workers.<eos> - For people that work hard all their lives!<eos> - For our futures.<eos> And you're not concerned?
What was your class on?<eos> Empiricism and rationalism.<eos> Were they concentrated?<eos> - Totally concentrated.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You terrorize them.<eos> No, I make them responsible.<eos> On time and attentive.<eos> I said: "One word about retirement and you're out. "<eos> How many Adornos do you want?
To give it the pedagogical makeover it needs.<eos> We'd like to add facilitators and product tie-ins.<eos> Make it more attractive, less austere.<eos> Show her the graphic designer's suggestions for the Essay Collection.<eos> You're changing my collection?<eos> - It's the most costly and least profitable collection.<eos> - And the most prestigious.<eos> No doubt, but we can't sit back and watch sales plummet.<eos> Just a proposal.<eos> - If you don't like it...
I have to go.<eos> It's my mother.<eos> She's crazy.<eos> I have to see her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Antonia, I'll call you tonight for the next class.<eos> Tell your classmates, even the strikers.<eos> - They won't come.<eos> - Still...<eos> I'll send you the corrections.
- He's lying!<eos> - We're firemen, not doctors.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> I keep telling her.<eos> Consider putting her in hospital.<eos> Call an ambulance, but not us.<eos> I won't go to hospital!<eos> - I won't go!<eos> - Sign this release.<eos> - She said she called you.
- I give up.<eos> - Pandora!<eos> - No way!<eos> - Pandora's gone.<eos> Found a taker?<eos> Pay him a lot?<eos> - You could have told us.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> - We didn't even say goodbye.<eos> - As if you cared.
What did you see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There was nothing at all.<eos> The Lord let you come back for a reason.<eos> Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.<eos> Could you give us a moment?<eos> You were dead.<eos> And now you're not.<eos> That's completely fucking mad, seems to me.<eos> I can only imagine how it seems to you.
Lord Stark.<eos> I looked for you on the Trident.<eos> We weren't there.<eos> Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.<eos> The Mad King is dead.<eos> Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.<eos> Why weren't you there to protect your prince?<eos> Our prince wanted us here.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
Your mother.<eos> My mother who is unclean?<eos> My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?<eos> How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?<eos> How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence, hmm?<eos> It was through their own mothers.<eos> There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei.<eos> You know that.<eos> But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.<eos> Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn't come from this world.
Yes.<eos> It's a great gift.<eos> One I never had.<eos> Envy.<eos> One more thing for me to atone for.<eos> Your Grace, do you-- may I?<eos> Do you mind?<eos> It's my knees.<eos> Of course.<eos> When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.
It means he's half tree.<eos> Question is, what's the other half?<eos> Order, order.<eos> Stenographer, can you read those last parts back?<eos> And then Mr. Smith said, "That tree is my father," at which point, the stenographer blacked out from excitement and the record stops.<eos> I apologize to the council.<eos> I ate some almonds. I'm good now.<eos> Mr. Smith, I think we're ready to hear what you mean when you say this tree is your father.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll tell you.
Oh, my God, Freddie, we can't chop down a tree with a homosexual man in it.<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> I made a gay slur, then he threw it back in my face by acting like the kind of fruit that grows on trees.<eos> Everybody thinks so fast.<eos> Stan Smith, remove yourself from the tree immediately.<eos> Not until you promise you won't cut it down.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'll go and get on the roof of my store right --<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Can I offer you a temporary tattoo?
Madam Florence regrets she is unable to hear any more candidates today.<eos> - It's unbelievable.<eos> - I trained at Juilliard...<eos> I am so very sorry.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You're not her type.<eos> Now, I must warn you, I work very hard.<eos> I study an hour every day.<eos> Sometimes two.<eos> And my father didn't leave me as much money as everybody thinks, so I couldn't pay you more than a hundred and fifty.
- They're not for practical use.<eos> - I understand.<eos> She abhors all pointed objects, so don't smoke in her presence or hand her a knife or anything like that.<eos> - Are you fond of sandwiches?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Madam Florence is inordinately fond of sandwiches.<eos> And potato salad as well.<eos> When we throw parties, we make mountains of the stuff.<eos> It would serve you to consume both with enthusiasm.
Tomorrow morning at nine. Don't be late.<eos> - I won't, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> Taxi!<eos> Taxi!<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Mr McMoon is here.<eos> - Oh, do come in, Mr McMoon.<eos> This is the talented young man I was telling you about.
Oh!<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Maestro, it is true that a lot of singers my age are on the decline, but I seem to just get better and better.<eos> I know.<eos> It's hard to believe, isn't it?<eos> Well, I am so blessed.<eos> There is no one quite like you.<eos> Onwards!<eos> I thought you were off score.<eos> - Did you enjoy the class?
Is her instrument quite what it was?<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> But as Beethoven said, a few wrong notes may be forgiven, but singing without feeling cannot.<eos> Mr Bayfield, is there any way I could do the lessons but not the concerts?<eos> - No, I'm afraid not.<eos> - But I have my reputation to think of.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what reputation is that?<eos> If you want to go back to playing for tips in a steakhouse, be my guest.<eos> Oh, Cosmé, Florence is very fond of you, she's paying you well and she knows, well, she knows everyone.
Let's get you home.<eos> Dr Hertz is in Washington, but he sent his colleague Dr Hermann.<eos> If I may, please.<eos> I didn't have time to look at your medical notes.<eos> The scarring is from syphilis.<eos> When did you contract the disease?<eos> On my wedding night.<eos> My first husband, Dr Frank Thornton Jenkins.<eos> Something of an alley cat.<eos> - How old were you?
I hope I'm not disturbing you, Mr McMoon.<eos> Oh! Madam Florence.<eos> I was out and about and I suddenly realised I was in your neighbourhood.<eos> - What a happy coincidence.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> - Is Mr Bayfield with you?<eos> - No.<eos> - May I come in?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I've brought you our recording.
- I'm a silly woman.<eos> - No.<eos> Would you like a glass of water?<eos> When Mr Bayfield is away playing golf, the days can seem awfully long.<eos> I understand that he needs his... sport.<eos> But I miss him.<eos> I...<eos> I miss him terribly.<eos> - He'll be back soon. - Hmm.<eos> Madam Florence,... he's devoted to you.
Believe.<eos> - But I'm afraid.<eos> - Don't be. Don't be.<eos> They're going to love you.<eos> You'll be great, Madam Florence.<eos> We can do it. Hmm. - Jenny.<eos> May I have my briefcase?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And a pen, anyone?<eos> Madam Florence, you must go on now.
Now, Florence, that's really not a good idea.<eos> What on earth is the matter with you today?<eos> Well, after the first half, I was pooped. - Oh! - Well...<eos> And, you know, people were fighting for tickets outside.<eos> - Why, I was offered $20 for mine.<eos> - What?<eos> - That's a great deal of money.<eos> - I know the reason why.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What was the high point of the evening for you, Mr Bayfield?

- Oh!<eos> We saw your show at Carnegie Hall last night.<eos> - It was wonderful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - We've never laughed so hard.<eos> - My ribs are still aching.<eos> You have an enormous comic talent, Mrs Foster Jenkins.<eos> It was so funny.<eos> Oh, thank you very much. Um...

Take the deal.<eos> All rise.<eos> All right.<eos> I understand that in an exchange for a plea of guilty, the people are offering to downgrade the charge of murder one to manslaughter one with a sentence of 15 years.<eos> Is that your understanding of the agreement, Ms. Crowe?<eos> It is, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Khan, is that your understanding?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> You're gonna be asked a series of questions by the district attorney.
KNOCK AT DOOR<eos> I just think that both you and Barbara stand to benefit.<eos> Besides, I'm terrified no-one will come.<eos> Hello, Phyllis.<eos> - Ooh, do you want to join Trixie's new Keep Fit class?<eos> - I do not.<eos> I am content with performing my Canadian Air Force routine every other morning, as well you know.<eos> And I cannot make head nor tail of these new fastenings.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Though you'll have to turn a blind eye to all of us in our scanties.
- "Let's look at what we've got." BOTH:<eos> - "Not what we've not got."<eos> Give us a kiss, Rhoda.<eos> And that's your lot!<eos> Should've said that to you nine months ago!<eos> The neck of your womb is what we call nicely effaced, Mrs Mullucks, so it is thinning out, ready for the main event.<eos> However, you're only one finger dilated.<eos> But the pains are terrible.<eos> You heard me yelling just now.<eos> Seems to me, Mrs Mullucks, that the best thing for you would be to settle down with a magazine and a nice hot drink.

Excuse me, miss?<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you mind if I take your picture?<eos> Oh, that's rather a bold request on a first acquaintance.<eos> I...do have a business card.<eos> All this says is that your name's Denny Wray and you're a freelance photographer.<eos> I'm trying to compile a record of life in the old East End, before it vanishes.<eos> Well, life in the NEW East End has a lot to recommend it.<eos> Little things, like vaccinations and indoor bathrooms.<eos> But you wouldn't know that, seeing as you live in...
Is she your boss?<eos> No.<eos> Fortunately.<eos> Miss, if I can't get behind closed doors, I'm going to get nothing on film but kids kicking footballs and meths drinkers.<eos> And that's what the rest of the world will see.<eos> He's right, Trixie.<eos> Do you have a bike?<eos> I have a scooter.<eos> Very well.<eos> As long as you don't inconvenience our patients, I see no reason why you can't tag along.

# A flower of devotion<eos> ♪ For all the world to see... ♪<eos> There we go.<eos> All right?<eos> Good girl, Rhoda.<eos> - Ooh... - SHE EXHALES DEEPLY<eos> Rhoda...<eos> Baby's got himself into a bit of a pickle, so we're going to have to help him out.<eos> How do you mean, a "pickle"?<eos> His head seems to be...a bit off centre, it's nothing we can't sort out between ourselves, but you are going to have to change position.
My husband never came in last night.<eos> I fell asleep.<eos> When I woke up, gone 11.<eos> Too late.<eos> He does know Baby's been born.<eos> Mrs Turner telephoned him at the warehouse.<eos> Ah, that was nice of her.<eos> Expect he's already down the Hand And Shears, wetting the baby's head.<eos> Yes.<eos> And you needed to rest, Rhoda.
The ambulance is booked for two o'clock.<eos> Patrick, her mother has to see her first.<eos> I know she does.<eos> There.<eos> You have a nice little sleep.<eos> I'll be back soon.<eos> Oh. Mr Mullucks!<eos> Is there any chance of me seeing my missus and my kid?<eos> It's just, I got a bit tied up last night, so...<eos> Why don't you take a seat?
It's just that she... ..seems not to have grown quite as she should.<eos> Hello!<eos> Are you saying she's a dwarf?<eos> No.<eos> Hello!<eos> - Mr Mullucks...<eos> - How could you even let that live?<eos> I need to see her. I need to see her!<eos> And you will, Rhoda.<eos> I'm going to fetch her myself and bring her to you and put her in your arms.
Everything else, we can talk about later.<eos> There ain't nothing to talk about!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Cos I've seen it, and there ain't no way that thing is coming back to our house.<eos> It's all right, Rhoda.<eos> BABY WHIMPERS<eos> We're with you every step of the way.<eos> Come on in, Rhoda.<eos> Sit down and I'll hand Baby to you.

Her name is Susan!<eos> And if that's true, why can't she stay?<eos> Why can't she stay?<eos> - They may be able to do tests on her in hospital.<eos> - What sort of tests?<eos> Tests to make her arms grow?<eos> Tests to magic her legs out of nowhere?<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Doctor prescribed this for you.

I'll arrange for an extra special lunch for Easter Monday, before the Bonnet Parade.<eos> Shall I invite Mr Hereward?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Morning, Sister! - Oh!<eos> - Smashing article in the paper. - Mmm?<eos> What's that, then?<eos> - Right, Nurse Franklin!<eos> - Present and correct.<eos> There is nothing whatever correct about this, Nurse Franklin.<eos> Oh. - I would rather you didn't look, Sister Julienne, but I'm happy to spell out the headlines for you.
Thank you.<eos> I just wonder if it's not something in the atmosphere.<eos> The father of the baby with the missing thumbs is a chemical mixer at the Matchworks.<eos> There are atom bombs going off in the Sahara and a polluted river running right past our front door.<eos> I'm not sure any good can come of asking why, Sister.<eos> We have to accept things are as they are and reach out with all the love we can find.<eos> I suppose that's what we're doing now, with Susan's clothes.<eos> The trouble is, these aren't Susan's clothes.<eos> They're what we could find in the charity box, things people threw away, and that just isn't good enough.<eos> I do know it must be hard for you to manage without Rhoda, Mr Mullucks.
Me clothes are soaked.<eos> Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me, so's I can go out through the hall?<eos> Of course.<eos> Has this happened to you before?<eos> Well, it does, doesn't it, to women?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Not unless there's something wrong.<eos> I reckon there is something wrong.<eos> It's like there's something slipping away, down below.<eos> Oh, Olive, you must see the doctor!
Have you ever tried to remedy this yourself?<eos> Well, I tried...<eos> I tried shoving things up there.<eos> Er, me mum, she used to say she'd tie a knot in a bit of old flannel.<eos> I've had a go at that.<eos> I have heard of people using a bit of rolled-up cardboard.<eos> Even apples, some of them.<eos> Or a spud.<eos> So have I.<eos> - But you have to draw the line somewhere, don't you?

In first place, Belinda!<eos> CHEERING AND APPLAUSE<eos> 'The day would come too soon when Susan could no longer be wrapped up 'or protected from the gaze of strangers.<eos> 'Her parents' questions would be matched by those of other people.<eos> 'And in time, their bewildered "whys"<eos> 'would meet with a one-word answer.<eos> 'No-one foresaw this, 'or that a scandal would be sparked that would rock the world for years.<eos> 'And there was love, because love grows when nothing else is certain, 'changing its shape, to fill the space required.'<eos> The docks are brutal and I need men that's fit for them.<eos> Men give you their lives, at least respect them.
Nurse Mount -- you're on district with me.<eos> You're yellow.<eos> Not my best colour.<eos> I'm blue.<eos> Efficiency, ladies.<eos> We need to do more and we need to do it faster.<eos> Why not simply give us radio transmitters so we can telegraph our whereabouts?<eos> There are people in Poplar falling through the cracks.<eos> I've persuaded the borough council to provide a number of home helps.<eos> So, when you're on your visits, make a note of anyone you feel cannot cope, we'll put their names forward, and see if we can't make life a little easier.
You made that look easy -- just like your mum when I delivered you.<eos> I wish she were here now.<eos> She'd be very proud of you, Connie.<eos> And her little grandson.<eos> I heard the crying - - I couldn't wait any longer.<eos> Oh, Connie...<eos> We got a little boy, Frankie.<eos> We are not yet done, Mr Manley.<eos> And until we are, this is my delivery room.<eos> And you will knock.
I should like that.<eos> It's got spring suspension and an anti-tip device and look at that brake, I mean, you'd think it was ivory.<eos> We'll be the pride of the street with this.<eos> I'm so happy for you, Mrs Beckett.<eos> For both of you.<eos> I'm so happy for you, Mrs Beckett.<eos> For both of you.<eos> And me cursing him like I was.<eos> I can be harsh, can't I, Nurse?<eos> You've had an awful lot on your plate.
Rita was showing me this cot, and before you say anything, it's not dear.<eos> And now you've got your shifts back, we know where we are.<eos> Nurse Crane, I've Mr Danvers and Miss Lane down for home helps.<eos> Bravo, Nurse Mount.<eos> ♪ .. desesperado... ♪<eos> Long may these Spanish lessons continue.<eos> Have you ever known Nurse Crane speak so little yet say so much?<eos> ♪ Estas perdiendo el tiempo<eos> ♪ Pensando, pensando. ♪<eos> Mr Gibson, I don't mean to interrupt you.

Someone fetch one of the Sisters!<eos> I don't understand how he's losing weight, I'm doing all I can.<eos> It's perfectly normal for a little while after birth -- he'll soon start putting it back on.<eos> Connie, is it still difficult for you, feeding?<eos> I just got to keep going with it, is all.<eos> Like Sister Evangelina says, it gets easier.<eos> It does.<eos> But not always for everyone.<eos> You would say, wouldn't you?<eos> If you needed help?
But not always for everyone.<eos> You would say, wouldn't you?<eos> If you needed help?<eos> The milk's where the goodness is.<eos> It's, it's where my baby gets his best start in life from.<eos> I just got to get on with it, is all, like Mum did.<eos> I want to do this right, Sister.<eos> I, I want to be the best mother I can be.<eos> Well, you don't have to manage alone.<eos> I'm here if you need a little more support.
I need to get through.<eos> Mr Beckett.<eos> You must go home.<eos> Your wife's collapsed.<eos> She's all right, she's resting now.<eos> But she collapsed at Mr Gibson's.<eos> Strike me down -- you told her.<eos> You told her I weren't working.<eos> You had no right.<eos> She came to the docks to bring you your lunch.
I don't take petitions, Nurse.<eos> You see this place?<eos> Industry, not charity.<eos> But surely three generations of one family's labour must count for something?<eos> Johnny's labour?<eos> We'd find him asleep through his shifts, curled up like a stray in the haulage crates.<eos> Well, perhaps he was just under the weather.<eos> Yeah, and perhaps he was workshy.<eos> The docks are brutal and I need men that's fit for them.<eos> Now, if you need a worthy cause, Miss, I suggest you find a Seaman's Mission.

Of course.<eos> Then I'll do better than show it to you, I'll play it for you.<eos> I'm so glad you've found something you enjoy so much.<eos> We all need more than just our work.<eos> I sometimes think there must've been a terrible hole in my life before Keep Fit.<eos> Charming -- those were probably the evenings you spent with me.<eos> They weren't.<eos> Can I interest anyone in a barley sugar?<eos> Oh, yes, please!<eos> You know I rather envy you.
You know I rather envy you.<eos> You live life as you please.<eos> You have a motor car, your work and now a genuine passion.<eos> And no-one ever bothers you with endless questions about when you'll marry and why you don't have a gentleman friend.<eos> Oh, we must always live as we please.<eos> So long as no-one gets hurt in the process.<eos> Recklessness is quite another matter.<eos> But these are wonderful days, girls.<eos> Go out there and take hold of them.<eos> You're not GIVEN opportunities.
So's mine.<eos> Oh, Sister, come quick, please. It's my Connie. She's in a bad way.<eos> I told you not to call no-one.<eos> I told you I was managing.<eos> But you're not.<eos> You can't feed him. Connie, please, let me help.<eos> What kind of mother can't feed her own baby?<eos> Oh, you're bleeding.<eos> Connie, all right now, we're going to stop this.<eos> This isn't fair on you.
I didn't know what you was going to say then.<eos> Pneumonia.<eos> It's the dust down at the docks, he just needs a vapour bath.<eos> The chest specialist is treating Johnny, but he is concerned there may be some underlying cause.<eos> Your husband mentioned to staff he'd been exceedingly tired for a good while.<eos> Well, that'll go, won't it?<eos> With the treatment?<eos> The London are going to run some further tests.<eos> I should like to go to him, doctor.<eos> If I might suggest you go this evening.
I'm so s...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm not family, I'm just the neighbour,<eos> I, I sit with her when I can.<eos> Mother!<eos> You came.<eos> She don't half get confused.<eos> Old age comes to some sooner than others.<eos> Mrs Smith.<eos> We have you on our list as a possible beneficiary of the home help service.
Does Mrs Smith live alone?<eos> No. She has a husband.<eos> I shall add that to her notes.<eos> He does what he can but it's ever such a strain.<eos> I mean, one minute she knows him, the next she thinks he's a boy who stole her sweets at school.<eos> Nurse calling.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> Good afternoon, Nurse Mount, to what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> You weren't assigned to this visit.
Oh, well, yellow pin, blue pin...<eos> Mrs Smith appears to be suffering from senile dementia.<eos> Perhaps you could pop by the telephone box and ask Dr Turner to drop in on his rounds.<eos> I'd like his opinion so we can see how best to help.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm back!<eos> Oh! You must be Mrs Smith's husband.<eos> Yes...<eos> I am.<eos> We're here at assess your wife, with a view to providing home help for her and for you.
We're here at assess your wife, with a view to providing home help for her and for you.<eos> This is my colleague, Nurse Crane, and she...<eos> Nurse Crane and I are in fact acquainted.<eos> We attend Spanish classes together.<eos> That is of no consequence.<eos> Mrs Smith's wellbeing clearly is.<eos> Please. Let me explain.<eos> No, no explanation is required, Mr Smith.<eos> Everything is perfectly clear.<eos> Could I buy you a cup of tea?
I need to be somewhere where the only being I can speak to is a higher one.<eos> I've got so wrapped up in my work, I've forgotten my calling -- to be a vessel for God, to do His work.<eos> I've... I've got to start listening again.<eos> Connie tried to tell me she couldn't breastfeed.<eos> I thought I knew best.<eos> My way or no way.<eos> We both know how I am.<eos> I'm all mouth, and He knows that too.<eos> This is not a decision you can make alone.<eos> At the very least, you will need permission from Mother Jesu Emmanuel.
Dr Turner's with him.<eos> Johnny is waiting for this baby.<eos> And I promise you, he will see it.<eos> Doc?<eos> Nothing's wrong, is it?<eos> Not with Stella?<eos> The very opposite.<eos> Your wife is in the maternity home and everything's going so well I'm quite redundant.<eos> I heard you're a Spurs fan.<eos> So I thought I might try to keep you posted on how the Cup goes.
I'm 63 years old and I've never spent a day on me own in me life.<eos> Wouldn't want to neither, would I?<eos> It's Marina Margaret, Nana Meg.<eos> Middle name's after you.<eos> Hello!<eos> Long night?<eos> Not really, Mrs Lovell's ninth.<eos> Morning! Ooh!<eos> Morning, Sister.<eos> Do you need a hand?
BELL RINGS<eos> What do we say to Sister Winifred? !<eos> ALL: Thank you, Sister Win-i-fred.<eos> Thank for all your hard work.<eos> Class dismissed.<eos> You're so good with them.<eos> You must've made a marvellous teacher.<eos> Oh, I think that would be overstating it.<eos> But I did enjoy the work.<eos> As do you - I can tell.
Hello, Fred!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Everything all right, Sister?<eos> I was hoping for Fred.<eos> Someone has to tell him to bring some more of his wife's home-made jam.<eos> It all seems to have disappeared!<eos> I just saw him.<eos> I'm sure he won't be long.<eos> Well, I hope not!<eos> It's quite small, I know, but I hope you'll be happy here.
Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> I saw the bags.<eos> I'm afraid there's quite a lot to tidy away.<eos> Well, luckily that's my forte.<eos> I'm sorry, I can see that this has come as a shock and I expect you'll want some time to discuss this with your... your fiance.<eos> - In the meantime...<eos> - He isn't my fiance.<eos> That won't affect the care you get from us.<eos> I am going to give you some iron tablets, but, otherwise, I'm pleased to say, things look very healthy.

Oh! Oh...! Nana!<eos> - BENNY: What is it?<eos> - Go away!<eos> Nana, I don't want him to see me like this...<eos> Don't worry love.<eos> I'll sort it.<eos> I-I'll give him something to do.<eos> All right, Stan?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I brought you something.
We'll be all right, love.<eos> I'll take that key, thank you.<eos> What?<eos> You went through my things!<eos> This is a respectable establishment.<eos> Miss Whitmore.<eos> - I've just paid next month's rent.<eos> - Which will serve in lieu of notice.<eos> Mrs Tucker, I don't have enough money...<eos> I'm sure your gentleman friend will help you out.

In my experience, it's the withholding of information that could lead to... misunderstanding.<eos> I expect you're right.<eos> How do you know it isn't "going out" going out?<eos> Well, I don't...<eos> I don't think it...<eos> I think, if it wasn't, you might not be so concerned.<eos> Look at these beauties!<eos> Summer on a little green stalk!<eos> Mmm. Delicious, Fred.<eos> I'll pick you some, Mr Hereward.
Tom won an Indian meal in a raffle and he asked me to go with him, but I haven't told Trixie yet, so please don't.<eos> - I'm awfully worried about it and I don't have anything to wear. - Gosh.<eos> I've told her just to be straightforward.<eos> Nothing good ever came of keeping secrets.<eos> Did it, Nurse Mount?<eos> (Stop staring.)<eos> Does the 15 go past the London?<eos> Yes, love.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Are you all right?
Oh, God...<eos> I killed poor old Stan Roberts.<eos> The register of typhoid carriers exists to help control and contain future outbreaks.<eos> I know it must feel intrusive, but it is an effective way of preventing people becoming ill.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's very important the register is kept up-to-date, so you would need to let us know of any change of address right away.<eos> - I've lived in the same flat all my life, Mrs Turner.<eos> - I know.<eos> Though if you did want to move, it could be arranged quite quickly.<eos> There's a points system for re-housing and your carrier status would give you priority.
She was alone and desperate for a friend.<eos> I knew that, Sister, and I didn't help.<eos> You did help.<eos> No!<eos> I judged!<eos> And now it's too late.<eos> But, Sister...<eos> Miss Whitmore has never had more need of a friend than now.<eos> You washed your hands five minutes ago, Mrs Mahoney.<eos> And you don't need to use a brush.
I can't.<eos> When I look at her, I see Jeanette, all sick.<eos> And when I go outside, I think of Stan!<eos> Hello,love.<eos> Hello, Miss Whitmore.<eos> Hello, Sister.<eos> I brought you some of your things.<eos> I expect the room was rather a mess.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss Whitmore,<eos> I should've helped you more.
Why should the Taraxacum struggle in the cracks?<eos> It deserves an efficacious spot in which to flourish!<eos> Just look.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> I can't imagine living up here.<eos> Like a bird in a nest.<eos> Look.<eos> Hot water, whenever you need it.<eos> Space for a fridge.<eos> You don't even need to take the rubbish out - you just drop it down a chute.
Well done, son.<eos> It's all right if I bring the boys in?<eos> Of course.<eos> As long as they steer clear of Wendy House Corner.<eos> We don't want another incident with the mangle.<eos> Right, go on.<eos> You heard.<eos> Take a seat, Mrs Cottingham.<eos> We're just talking through the differences between home and hospital delivery.<eos> We try to give you as much information as we can.
Yes, of course.<eos> She's here now.<eos> Sister, it's the Matron of St Cuthbert's Hospital.<eos> She asked to speak to you.<eos> I'm entirely happy to deputise with regard to administration, Sister.<eos> But, er, hospital routines are rather gruelling.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to send one of the youngsters?<eos> It's only for a week.<eos> But I'm sure St Cuthbert's will provide a bath chair, if I can't take the pace.<eos> I'll thank you for the beetroot, Sister Winifred.
- Brow presentation.<eos> - I'll telephone Doctor.<eos> He'll be on his house calls.<eos> It's like being crushed by an elephant.<eos> - I bet you've heard that one before. - Elephants.<eos> Rhinos.<eos> Hippopotami.<eos> And to extend the comparison, this baby's being a monkey.<eos> Not quite tucking its chin down as it should, I suspect.<eos> You might both do better if we send you off to hospital.

It was completely limbless.<eos> Like little Susan Mullucks?<eos> Without even an indication of gender.<eos> What did Mr Kenley say?<eos> He said, "Oh, God.<eos> Another one."<eos> "Another one"?<eos> He's had nothing to do with Susan.<eos> She was born here, in the maternity home.<eos> That's why I thought I ought to come to you.
Ta-dah!<eos> Hot off the press.<eos> Is that the health report?<eos> I feel a drum roll is in order.<eos> Well, shall we see how we've fared?<eos> I thought it might at least be the new James Bond novel.<eos> Far more exciting. Patrick Turner, GP, licensed to practice medicine. And secret agent Shelagh Turnova, save Poplar from ill health and disease!<eos> That's it, ladies.<eos> If we want to reduce, we must keep moving.<eos> And make sure you all have enough room.
Er, gentlemen, we're short of space.<eos> If you'd repair to the corridor.<eos> Please come through, Mrs Dawley.<eos> Can you manage, my dear?<eos> Today, if you would, Mr Dawley.<eos> I was hearing about how the baby shouldn't sleep on its back in case it gets sick, and it got me to thinking, what would make it sick?<eos> Oh, there are lots of little things.<eos> All babies get gripes and upsets.<eos> Such as what, Nurse?<eos> Have you had a little look at the pamphlet I gave you?
We need to keep the back supported.<eos> Now rest and aspirin, and perhaps some Mentholatum ointment when the pain has subsided a little.<eos> What kind of door?<eos> Any door.<eos> Handle on or off?<eos> Mrs Buckle will be lying on it, not opening it, Fred.<eos> Not my bathroom door.<eos> We may be married but I do still have my dignity.<eos> So, rest over night then, Doctor?<eos> Mrs Buckle, you will need to rest for a week, perhaps two.
- It hurts so much.<eos> The midwife said three weeks, but there's water all over my settee from... down there.<eos> Is there someone with you, Mrs Dawley?<eos> No.<eos> No, there's no-one.<eos> I'm alone.<eos> Ohhh!<eos> Now breathe through it...<eos> I'm going to stay on the telephone till it's passed.<eos> Then I'm going to come straight to you.
- Fred! - Oh!<eos> - I've spilt my water!<eos> - Coming, my love.<eos> Although strictly a volunteer helper, I'd hope to see my good work reflected in this week's pocket money.<eos> I'm sure you would!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> We know for some of you it took a great deal of effort.<eos> This is Dr Turner's first chest clinic for chronic pulmonary and bronchial conditions.<eos> Hello, Mr Philips.<eos> To help you manage with a little more comfort at home.
Might I trouble you for a cup of tea, Mr Dawley?<eos> Babies aren't an exact science.<eos> A mother must trust her instinct.<eos> Then I should like her on the bottle.<eos> That way my husband can help with feeding.<eos> She settles so much better with him.<eos> Would you take her please?<eos> Mr Phillips, I want you to reconsider radiotherapy.<eos> For your cancer.<eos> Your consultant at the London offered you it and you've refused.
And he had lung cancer.<eos> Good God.<eos> I've only seen them in text books.<eos> Tar and tumours.<eos> From those bloody cigarettes.<eos> He was 45.<eos> Smoked since he was 15, by all accounts.<eos> So you may want to tell the patients in your clinic, no bronchodilator or drainage technique will clear this up.<eos> I went back, but she'd gone.<eos> Then you should have telephoned the police, Mrs Dawley.
- Tea?<eos> - No.<eos> ...who may present with little or no symptoms.<eos> Then it's a wild goose chase.<eos> An impressive challenge we have neither the resource nor stomach for.<eos> - Good God, just the cost of it.<eos> - The cost is a lot less than treating lung cancer in its late stages.<eos> It's very simple, Mr Stephens.<eos> I don't want to see lung cancer as the biggest cause of death in Poplar in five years' time.<eos> - We gave you your chest clinic.
BABY WAILS<eos> Oh, dear, someone's out of sorts.<eos> He's always out of sorts.<eos> He never stops crying.<eos> I'm scared there's something wrong with him.<eos> Dear me, young man!<eos> It's only a postnatal check-up, no need to be so vexed.<eos> Why don't we see who's free, bump you up the queue a bit.<eos> I can't find any reason to refer him to Doctor - there's a possibility it's a touch of colic, and we can keep an eye on that together.<eos> Now, Mrs Coleman. Are you getting any sleep?

Are you getting any sleep?<eos> I'm walking the floors with him most nights.<eos> My husband has to get up at the crack of dawn for work - it's his sleep that matters.<eos> Well, you won't be able to take care of Michael properly if you're exhausted.<eos> While the nights are still so mild, a gentle bedtime walk in the fresh air might do you both good.
Akela's arranged for us to borrow two tents and as much of the Cubs' equipment as we need.<eos> Mum's even bought a little half-size sleeping bag for Angela.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> I couldn't be happier.<eos> Very prettily done, Sister.<eos> But you cannot tempt me.<eos> Everyone has noticed that you aren't eating properly at mealtimes, Sister.<eos> My strength comes from another source.<eos> And I hope you do not need to ask from whence.

But...<eos> How recently did you study for Novices' Vows? Were you not apprised of the practice of mortification of the flesh?
Makes me feel sick when I see all that.<eos> I've had four and everything's in hand.<eos> Put it out of your mind.<eos> We have two or three ladies on our books who are very close to term.<eos> Their records have already been moved to to the green filing cabinet over in the maternity home.<eos> They're also double-copied to the Nonnatus House log and my own personal Rolodex, which is widely held to be infallible.<eos> Rolodex?<eos> I like the sound of that, Nurse Cray.<eos> Crane.<eos> As in the wading bird, or industrial lifting equipment, whichever you prefer.
As in the wading bird, or industrial lifting equipment, whichever you prefer.<eos> Ulcer clinic is on Friday afternoons.<eos> We've been experimenting with a new antibiotic powder...<eos> Which I will be delighted to discuss with Dr Godfrey.<eos> It's cutting-edge stuff like this that brings me out of retirement time and time again!<eos> I imagine you feel the same.<eos> I shall consider retirement as and when I reach the appropriate age, Dr Godfrey, which will not be for some years.<eos> Shelagh, I can get the tents or the children in the car.<eos> But not both!<eos> May I refer you to my earlier offer to loan you my roof rack, which you declined?
I happened to be passing, and thought I'd see if this young man had started behaving himself.<eos> He's all right.<eos> Did you try taking him for a walk to settle him at bedtime?<eos> I told you, he's all right.<eos> Judith? Your face...<eos> Oh, I-I've always been clumsy.<eos> It's even worse now I don't get any sleep. - What happened?<eos> - I clumped myself one with the wardrobe door.<eos> Things can take time to settle down when a newborn comes along.<eos> We're here to help, whatever upsets you're having.

- Colin Coleman?<eos> I'm sorry, I've met more aggressive marshmallow bunnies.<eos> Or that Judith herself was out soliciting.<eos> - No!<eos> - Either way, if the situation at her home is volatile, as you suggested, Sister Julienne, we'd put her at risk if we went round and quizzed him.<eos> So our first port of call should be the other girl.<eos> Lizzie was adamant that she wouldn't speak to the police.<eos> If you could come with me, we might be able to pull her round.<eos> May I, Sister Julienne?<eos> I would be grateful if you did.
- Patrick!<eos> I'm sorry. But I'm just not sure about Godfrey.<eos> General practice is a young man's game.<eos> You're not supposed to be thinking about work.<eos> And if you don't mind my saying so, you're not exactly Cliff Richard yourself.<eos> I could sing a chorus of Summer Holiday if you'd like me to!<eos> CLATTER, CRYING<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Mum? Dad?<eos> Can we come in with you?
You're not in any trouble.<eos> My friend, Sergeant Noakes, just wants to ask you a few questions.<eos> Nurse Gilbert told me what happened.<eos> I'd like to help.<eos> In which case, the best thing you can do is find out where my husband went.<eos> Because if you did that, I wouldn't be having to sell myself to help feed the kids I had because I gave myself - for nothing - to a man I thought might stick around!<eos> - I'm sorry, Mrs...<eos> - Call me Lizzie.<eos> That's what I say to all the blokes.<eos> And I'm not saying anything else to you!

I spy with my little eye, something beginning with...<eos> R-N-H-I-S-O-T-W...<eos> G-P-W-B-I-T-F-T-R-O-T-W.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Rather nice hotel I spotted on the way here.<eos> Get packed.<eos> We're booking in there for the rest of the week.<eos> I don't want you three playing silly beggars, running all over the place tonight.<eos> Once you're in bed, you stay in bed, do you hear me?
You've got to get rid of the afterbirth.<eos> None of mine took this long...<eos> It's not right.<eos> Stay in here, and don't move.<eos> Mum!<eos> Don't leave me!<eos> PHONE RINGS<eos> Is that Nonnatus House?<eos> I need to speak to Nurse Franklin.<eos> I'm sure you'd rather talk to a doctor.
Do you suppose they're sleeping well?<eos> Either that, or they've been mauled to death by squirrels!<eos> - Shelagh. - Mm?<eos> I want to call the surgery.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it will put my mind at rest.<eos> And then we'll REALLY be able to enjoy our holiday.<eos> Instead of pretending.<eos> Diane's gone into theatre now.<eos> The ward sister suggested you go home and telephone later.
Do you know the worst thing?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> And... I can't imagine it.<eos> The worst thing is that I'd actually stopped to pray.<eos> I'd stopped, because I wanted to raise my prayers with yours to sing inside my soul, when my Sisters were singing.<eos> I wanted to give thanks for Trixie's skill, for what she'd done, for the fact Diane had survived.<eos> And it was one of the most beautiful moments I'd ever known.<eos> I felt so close to God, and then it happened.<eos> Sister, would it help you to pray now?
Or He's behind glass.<eos> Scared to move in case everything breaks.<eos> - Can I speak to her?<eos> - She doesn't want to.<eos> And I cannot and will not force her to.<eos> - She's been brutalised enough.<eos> - Sister.<eos> Someone has to talk to us.<eos> Or I don't know where it's going to end.<eos> Sister, you're meant to be resting.
Or I don't know where it's going to end.<eos> Sister, you're meant to be resting.<eos> I want to have a bath.<eos> You can't.<eos> You have to be examined.<eos> Why?<eos> I know what he did.<eos> I was there.<eos> If you want a bath, you have one.<eos> But please let us help you.
And the crying gets inside your head and in the end you can't tell if it's him screaming or you screaming.<eos> And...<eos> Love.<eos> It's all right.<eos> And so I parked the pram, and I walked away.<eos> I walked away.<eos> I abandoned my baby.<eos> All I wanted was to not hear that crying any more.<eos> And then I felt... him grab me from behind...<eos> The man who hurt you?
All I wanted was to not hear that crying any more.<eos> And then I felt... him grab me from behind...<eos> The man who hurt you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'M sorry.<eos> I should've known...<eos> I should've helped you.<eos> I can tell you.<eos> I wanted to tell you.
It's prison work.<eos> Soot or ink rubbed into cuts made with a knife.<eos> I don't know that one.<eos> This one says he's a convicted brigand.<eos> This one says what he thinks of his sentence.<eos> I've had more old lags than you can shake a stick at come through these doors, and I've never seen tats like that.<eos> I have.<eos> You get them on the Soviet lads, the ones that come in with the Merchant Marine.<eos> - Soviet?<eos> - So all you need to do is look up what ship's come in under their flag.
Oh, get down!<eos> You could hurt yourself!<eos> I can't stop myself, nurse.<eos> Yesterday, it was cleaning.<eos> And when there was nothing left to clean, I started painting.<eos> Please let me finish -<eos> - I've only got one more stroke with the brush.<eos> In which case, I shall do it.<eos> But it's not your job.<eos> My job is looking after you, and that involves stopping you falling, A, off this chair and, B, out of the window.
I don't doubt that you've looked at this from every conceivable medical and social angle.<eos> However, whilst there is nothing in Anglican teaching to forbid birth control, the church does take a view on matters of morality.<eos> As Mrs Turner, at least, will be aware.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> Have a lemon puff.<eos> Is there anything plainer?<eos> I have some arrowroot biscuits.<eos> I'll pop and fetch them.<eos> Tea is on the table, Sister.<eos> I shan't join you today.
- Not so's you'd notice.<eos> It's like he don't even know there's a baby on the way.<eos> Thank you, Sister.<eos> I'm sorry to have kept you.<eos> Some blood results came back from the London.<eos> - One or two will need attention.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Could you pop over to the side room, Sister?<eos> This week's unmarried mothers are ready to catch the bus - to the station.<eos> You just need to sign those final forms.
I had a hard time having Jonah, it took me ages to pick up afterwards.<eos> These things do all get rather harder with age.<eos> Where was Jonah born?<eos> In a barge, like the others.<eos> I always liked the quiet, the being on me own...<eos> On your own?<eos> But maybe not this time.<eos> Well, we can look after you when you deliver.<eos> And keep an eye on your blood pressure, which is rather low.<eos> The London blood tests showed that you're also anaemic, so our rather lovely doctor can prescribe you iron pills.
Where's Lou?<eos> Doing crepe paper handicrafts with the other children.<eos> And being quite the bossy-boots, from the look of things.<eos> She's like a second mum to my three lads.<eos> I call her my right hand.<eos> - Knock, knock!<eos> - Come in, Doctor.<eos> I was just telling Mrs Blacker what a sterling service we provide.<eos> No stone left unturned in pursuit of a happy outcome!<eos> Which means that we need to give you a bit of extra care, Mrs Blacker.

It was such a wonderfully frivolous thing.<eos> It meant that I was with friends.<eos> That I wasn't alone.<eos> I don't bother much with maraschino cherries any more, I don't even put them in my Horlicks, or my barley water -- they taste revolting.<eos> I don't need them.<eos> I know that fun doesn't come in bottles now.<eos> I know the value of sobriety... .. and I know what friendship really is, what it means.<eos> I always did, I just couldn't see it.<eos> I owe the 49 bus rather a lot, all things considered.<eos> And I owe you -- all of you -- even more.
You lot behave yourselves, now.<eos> - And you.<eos> - Nurse Mount'll keep me in order, I reckon.<eos> I may not be on horseback, but consider me the cavalry.<eos> Gina, this baby's well on its way and we've brought more gas to get us through the home stretch.<eos> Shall I take over, you look done in.<eos> You yell your head off, if you fancy it, Gina.<eos> That's the last you'll be having without some help.<eos> - Am I the only one in here?<eos> - Yes, you're lucky.
You get lice in schools and they never went there till yesterday!<eos> Sister Winifred insisted on it.<eos> She always says,<eos> "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."<eos> And you dressed Lou up like a little girl.<eos> Ribbons and ankle socks?<eos> They're not going to last five minutes on the barge!<eos> Daisy, Lou just wanted to fit in, to be like everybody else.<eos> She's not like everybody else.<eos> She's a bargee, whether you like it or not.
And what about this one?<eos> She looks old enough to come in handy.<eos> Take her with the other kids.<eos> Me and Nurse Mount can manage, can't we?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And I'll take my lead from you.<eos> Calm down, take a deep breath and tell me what you mean.<eos> She, she says she can see flashing lights!<eos> Go back to Gina and wait with her.<eos> I'm telephoning for an ambulance and then I'll come straight to you.
There's plenty we can do to help her.<eos> But the ambulance won't have the complete address, I need you to go downstairs, wait outside and flag it down.<eos> No!<eos> I'm not going to leave her!<eos> - Leslie, we can't waste any time.<eos> - I'm not going to leave my wife.<eos> I don't want him to go!<eos> I don't want him to go.<eos> Don't leave me, Leslie.<eos> Right, Gina, you need a warm coat and something on your feet.
In the end, it's like giving a plant too much water.<eos> An autoclave can only sterilise things if they're properly cleaned beforehand.<eos> It is a machine, not a magician.<eos> Nevertheless, we still have power, which is a blessing from above, if there ever was one!<eos> "And, behold, I am with thee<eos> "and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest<eos> "and will bring thee again into this land..."<eos> ".. for I will not leave."<eos> The Book of Genesis instead of Keats, indeed.<eos> That gale must have blown some sense into you.
- I take it you mean this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I had a stroke.<eos> Two months after I left for the retreat.<eos> Why didn't you let us know?<eos> - We could've prayed for you, at the very least.<eos> - I know.<eos> But at the time, this was between me and Him.<eos> I was much worse than this, I couldn't move my arm at all.<eos> And you wouldn't have wanted to see me slurping my tea.
I've got steady work on the tools in Lipkin's Plumbing now.<eos> Ah, good for you!<eos> The East End raised you.<eos> Now you can get stuck in and sort those khazies out!<eos> Thank you(! )<eos> He doesn't need compost all over his lapels.<eos> We're on our way to a consultation.<eos> Mum, there's a notice in the window.<eos> "Mr Hereward is available in the church vestry "between 12 noon and 2pm each weekday."<eos> Oh, so much for "knock and it shall be opened unto you"!
You make sure you speak to Mrs Williams.<eos> When she's tucked in her pram or all wrapped up, it's not so bad.<eos> She looks like any other baby, and people don't stare.<eos> Or when she's in the house, I just have her in a nappy and a vest, and she sits there, all propped up, smiling like nothing's the matter.<eos> And then I remember in the middle of the night.<eos> I remember that she's got no arms... and no legs.<eos> I just lie there, shaking.<eos> Are you getting much sleep, Rhoda?<eos> Because we can help with that.<eos> I can give you a mild sedative and you can take it only when you need it.
Oh, bless the girl, coming all that way across the world!<eos> Love knows no boundaries.<eos> - Who told YOU?<eos> - Mr Ballard at the stationer's.<eos> And he said you was in yesterday, ordering wedding invitations.<eos> Yes.<eos> And today, I've come to you to order two dozen nappy pins, two dozen terry squares, six pairs of plastic pants, a heavy-duty sanitary belt and a packet of maternity towels.<eos> And none of it's for me.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, you'll have to get her signed up with the Sisters, Tessie.
You're too disorganised and too slim!<eos> But I remember teaching myself some words of Yiddish when I first came to Poplar.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> "I can see Baby's head!" and, "We're almost there!"<eos> Welcome words to any mother after a hard labour, but I reckon they deserve to hear them in their own language.<eos> Get your bag, I'm coming with you.<eos> But you're the midwife, mind!<eos> I'm just there to do the donkey work.<eos> Fred, this front tyre is as soft as butter!<eos> I told you last week, yesterday, and I'm telling you now!
Ah, which means we get our copy of The Lancet!<eos> Mr Miller sent you a copy of the Exchange Mart as well today. I asked him if it was a mistake but he said no.<eos> It isn't.<eos> We're going to be looking at the "doll's pram" section.<eos> Ooh, thank you.<eos> What a lovely house!<eos> Dad, she understands everything we say!<eos> Patrick, you're needed at Nonnatus House.<eos> I would put money on another stroke - a massive bleed to her brain that took her while she slept.<eos> But she hadn't seen you or any doctor since she came back to Poplar.
But they just say that there is a possible association with harmful effects on the foetus.<eos> And it also says there are only two reports from abroad and none from Great Britain.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> But this letter came, Patrick! Distaval's being withdrawn!<eos> Shelagh, I have prescribed Distaval to dozens of patients perhaps scores!<eos> Deformed babies have been born in our district.<eos> We need to speak to someone and then we need to act.<eos> I don't think anything's going to happen just yet, Noelle.<eos> I feel like a bit of a chump, calling you out when there was no need.<eos> If a quick home visit helps you to relax and look forward to your wedding, that's all to the good.
She's Mother Heidi.<eos> That's what Cordelia called her.<eos> Heidi Meyer.<eos> The leader of the cult and the main suspect.<eos> We haven't found her body.<eos> - How could you not foresee this?<eos> - Those people didn't go against the law.<eos> They'd grow tomatoes, pay their taxes...<eos> You should know: without a crime, there's no case.<eos> - I need to ask you some questions.
What does that have to do with...?<eos> Yes.<eos> There was a time when we used all kinds of drugs.<eos> Any suicide attempt?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I guess all this information is confidential.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you're the relative of one of the victims.<eos> - I have no interest in making it public.<eos> - May I help you with anything else?
Get up, come on.<eos> Get up.<eos> You can't go on like this.<eos> - She's sad.<eos> - She instills mystery.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And melancholy too.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hello.<eos> You'll be very welcome.
Let's get out of here.<eos> That place was sealed off for a reason.<eos> What were you doing at the farm?<eos> I'm not here as a tourist.<eos> I'm here because my sister is missing.<eos> And you won't call me or tell me anything.<eos> What kind of investigation is this?<eos> Mr. Larrea, I don't care who you are in Bilbao.<eos> Here, you're just a suspect's relative.<eos> - I'll decide what I tell you.
I give your cousin a contribution and it's like a get out of jail free card for me, right?<eos> That's something to celebrate.<eos> No, I don't do that.<eos> [chuckles] [inhales] See, me...<eos> I celebrate when things are finished.<eos> Not when it's just starting.<eos> [woman] Listen to him.<eos> This is nothing to celebrate.<eos> You saw what happened to Fisk.<eos> You two shouldn't even be seen together... let alone having me all up in the Kool-Aid.
Now, Harlem is a community that welcomes everyone.<eos> All people.<eos> But at the same time, since the days of Langston Hughes,<eos> Malcolm X, Zora Neale Hurston, Duke Ellington,<eos> Harlem has been the jewel of black America.<eos> It's a perpetual symbol of... of hope and prosperity and excellence.<eos> For black lives to matter, black history and black ownership must also matter.<eos> Now, my multifaceted plan for the Crispus Attucks Complex is just yet another way to bring hope to a new generation, to incubate the kind of innovation and creativity and progress that Harlem's famous for.<eos> Thank you again for your time, Madam Councilwoman.<eos> Oh, Megan, you're always welcome in Harlem.
- [gunshot] - [Luke grunts]<eos> [bullet clattering]<eos> You want some?<eos> I don't even like these niggas, man.<eos> I'm sorry about your window.<eos> [cash register opening]<eos> Here.<eos> - For what?<eos> - For you.<eos> Ma'am, I'm the one who owes you money.
Dummy.<eos> [both sobbing]<eos> You did good.<eos> That's what.<eos> My bad, Mr. Hunter.<eos> Where's the restroom key? Just...<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> You heard me.<eos> You got to get him out of here.
He'll be out in a minute.<eos> -[pats Pop] -Let me stall 'em.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> [chuckles] Whoa.<eos> Detective Mercedes Knight.<eos> It's Misty now, Pop.<eos> You know that.<eos> [Pop] All right, all right.<eos> [chuckles]<eos> Call yourself whatever you want to, Detective.
[both chuckle]<eos> -"Who?" -Cottonmouth.<eos> The man you stole from.<eos> Dante's former boss.<eos> The man who shot up Pop's Barber Shop and killed a good man trying to get at you.<eos> Hey, look, we don't want you, Chico.<eos> We want the people who killed Shameek and who shot up the barber shop.<eos> Testify.<eos> Do something good for somebody for once.<eos> [breathing shakily] I can't help you with that.
Domingo's right.<eos> When the lights are on... you really can see things for what they are.<eos> [speaking Spanish]<eos> -I got some verdad for you.<eos> -Hmm.<eos> We got hit.<eos> And it was you.<eos> You didn't have to send no mercs to break up my organization.<eos> I think somebody's pulling your chain... and using my name to do it.<eos> 'Cause if my people were to hit you, you'd be dead.
Used to love Willie Burger back in the day.<eos> But I can't give up the fries. [chuckling]<eos> True.<eos> Where's Detective Knight?<eos> Busy.<eos> I suppose you heard about... what happened at the Crispus Attucks today.<eos> That's why I called.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> Your turn for what?<eos> Tell you everything.
[scoffing] Oh, I've got your intel.<eos> Swinging.<eos> [chuckles softly]<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Anything related to how I lost 80% of my cash reserves?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe.<eos> In my trunk, you will find a deceased individual.<eos> One Wilfredo "Chico" Diaz.<eos> I'm sure your homie down at Spurlock's Mortuary can hook you up.
- [whistle blowing] - [yells]<eos> What the hell?<eos> [whistle blowing]<eos> [Luke grunting]<eos> - [firefighter] Can you move?<eos> - I'll be damned.<eos> I can, but I'm gonna need some help.<eos> Connie's leg is broken.<eos> [Connie] I can't believe you did this.<eos> [whispering] Which is why I think you should keep what happened down here between us.
[indistinct radio chatter]<eos> - How you doing? - [inhales deeply]<eos> I'll survive.<eos> [chuckles] That's the understatement of the year.<eos> Look, we need to, uh, talk about what happened.<eos> Not now.<eos> Excuse me, excuse me, sir!<eos> I've been hearing some pretty miraculous things about you surviving that explosion.<eos> You saved the owner's life.<eos> Why don't you just tell us your name?
The night of the restaurant explosion and Crispus Attucks raid, you and your partner logged into the crime scene 40 minutes apart.<eos> So?<eos> In the time that was unaccounted for, your only source of information for the barber shop shooting,<eos> Chico Diaz, went missing.<eos> He was last seen with Scarfe.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Scarfe left the precinct to pick up Chico, but Chico was gone.<eos> So, he picks up a witness unsupervised, which is against protocol, doesn't even log it in, and he still has time to get to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.<eos> What, is he clairvoyant?<eos> He's not telling you everything.
I said, "Baby, everything I touch turns to shit."<eos> She never did listen.<eos> Quit letting her down.<eos> If she comes back... tell her Luke Cage came by.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> You him, huh?<eos> Your name is all over Harlem today.<eos> Not in a good way.<eos> I'm about to change that.<eos> You should do the same.
This belongs in our shop.<eos> No one else's.<eos> Now, there's already too many new faces here, far as I'm concerned.<eos> And there're only gonna be more.<eos> We need to be the ones to bring him home.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> How, uh... how you holdin' up?<eos> I'd be doin' a lot better if people would stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.<eos> What do you know, Detective?<eos> Scarfe must have told you something.
Are you sure you don't know where to find him?<eos> If I knew, I would tell you.<eos> So is that how we're playing this, Captain?<eos> Like Scarfe is a suspect and not a victim?<eos> He could be both or either.<eos> We won't know until you guys bring him in.<eos> Us?<eos> I need my best on this, Detective.<eos> That was you and Scarfe.<eos> Now I need you and Perez to find our boy.
Do I even need to say it?<eos> Come on, Zip.<eos> You should find a new profession.<eos> Cottonmouth is done.<eos> You ain't heard?<eos> Cottonmouth's getting out, so you ain't done shit.<eos> Boom!<eos> Detective.<eos> Remember who you are.<eos> Next time, it would behoove you to have actual evidence.
[Luke] Whatever we gotta do.<eos> [gunshot]<eos> [theme music playing]<eos> - [Luke] You okay? - [Claire] Yeah.<eos> - [both groan]<eos> [Manny] Who was that son of a bitch?<eos> - [groans] Are you okay?<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> But somebody took a shot at us.<eos> You guys got to get out of here.
- I'm bringing him in myself.<eos> I didn't finish my sentence, Misty.<eos> You're about to do something stupid.<eos> Don't.<eos> Listen, don't tell the inspector.<eos> Don't tell anybody.<eos> [Shades] I thought you went back down south, Sugar.<eos> Ain't nothing down there for me.<eos> I'm back.<eos> What do you guys want?
The question is, how badly do you want it?<eos> You work for the department?<eos> You a shrink?<eos> [Krasner] I was on the job for 15 years.<eos> I left to become a psychologist.<eos> [scoffs]<eos> I'm with the peer assistance program. I'm a volunteer.<eos> Well, how about I volunteer my way out of this chair, tell you to kiss my ass, and talk to my union rep?<eos> Well, you could do that, sure.<eos> But your inspector would guarantee that you'll be at your desk, and the only time you'll see the street is in the parking lot, or if you go to get coffee, or...
You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?<eos> Really?<eos> Mmm... Maybe at MG's, after a shift.<eos> Still can't believe that place went out of business.<eos> I miss Copeland's.<eos> [chuckling] Who doesn't?<eos> Whatever.<eos> [inhales sharply] Let's do this.<eos> Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight, badge 3-0-9-3-5.<eos> You know, you're not being recorded.
[chuckles and groans]<eos> [Alex] Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Madam Councilwoman?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Have you seen the emails?<eos> The interview requests?<eos> Even Thembi Wallace wants another sit-down.<eos> Never.<eos> Can I show you something?
Until last night... [breathing heavily] I was bulletproof.<eos> Jesus Christ, kid.<eos> What did this to you?<eos> They shot me with some crazy bullets.<eos> They exploded inside of him.<eos> [Burstein] He should be dead.<eos> My skin is now tough... like armor.<eos> I think maybe what makes him stronger is also pushing the shrapnel deeper into his organs.<eos> Trust me, it is impossible to cut into his skin.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is that you think I can do for you.
What if we can help you with that?<eos> Reva took this.<eos> [Burstein gasps]<eos> She shouldn't have done that. [sighs]<eos> Can you unlock it?<eos> [sighs]<eos> [Burstein] Oh, my God.<eos> It's all here.<eos> Everything.<eos> Everything you need?
Until he stopped serving you.<eos> Cut the crap, lady.<eos> What do you want to tell us?<eos> I'm out.<eos> My family is no longer to be associated with what you all do.<eos> I need to move in a more legitimate direction.<eos> [Jacques] Need?<eos> That's a weak hand you're playing.<eos> My cousin has valuable assets and connections.<eos> I'll give them to you... for a price.
Do I trust the cops?<eos> - No. Hell no.<eos> - Not blindly.<eos> We need protection from Luke Cage.<eos> We need protection from the other powered people like Luke Cage.<eos> He is the real threat!<eos> We need to arm our men and women in blue so that they can protect us.<eos> Truly protect us and never confuse us with those who are the real threat.<eos> You stay strong!<eos> I know you will stay strong and I know you will welcome to this mike right now,
Reverend John Pope!<eos> Emails.<eos> Make sure you get emails and a head count.<eos> - Consider it done, ma'am. - Oh!<eos> I didn't know you got off work.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> - Because you are here.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> That means that you care.
You'll die.<eos> I need to get you stabilized.<eos> Then I'll think of some way to help Claire and everybody else up there.<eos> [breath trembling] You can't negotiate with him.<eos> I won't.<eos> [voice breaking] I don't wanna...<eos> I don't wanna bleed to death on the floor, like Scarfe.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> [sniffs]<eos> I think you deserve a drink, Councilman.
It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth.<eos> [grunts]<eos> I was so scared.<eos> I snuck out of there, back to the lockers. And, um, I was trying to calm myself down.<eos> When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story.<eos> So I told one.<eos> -Why are you coming clean now?<eos> -'Cause I can't live with this.<eos> Especially after Luke saving my life.<eos> If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.
You have the nerve to use that term?<eos> Right here?<eos> Where Pop died?<eos> Cough up Diamondback's location, or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.<eos> Luke, be cool, brother.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> No one needs to stomp anyone.<eos> Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason.<eos> Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.<eos> There's no way I'm helping you.
That's why Ridley just kicked her.<eos> Mariah and Shades will talk.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I told her not to leave.<eos> I know.<eos> [man] Carl Lucas, I'm Marshal Franco.<eos> This is Marshal Johnson.<eos> You're under arrest for your unlawful escape from Seagate Prison.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You won't need those.
We also have the wife of Ian Finch. Please welcome Eleanor Finch.<eos> - Welcome, it's so good to have you. - Thank you.<eos> Please, have a seat. Thanks so much for coming on for the show today.<eos> - It must be very trying right now. - Yeah. It is.<eos> - That's your wife?<eos> - I know.<eos> - Punching above my weight.<eos> - I decided to come on your show in the hope that this'll be broadcast in Ecuador and maybe my husband will see it.<eos> I've kept silent in the hope that any negotiations would be successful, but the wait is unbearable.<eos> I understand, and the whole country is feeling for you right now.
I thought I was throwing away the letter that I wrote you. That, um...<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - It's not your money. - Excuse me?<eos> It's not your money.<eos> People gave that money so we wouldn't be in danger, but we're not in danger, so it's their money, but they don't need to know that. So, it's definitely not yours.<eos> So, now I got nothing again. You ruin everything.<eos> Well, weren't you gonna spend it anyway, to pay our ransom?<eos> Of course.<eos> But, like, you clearly don't need it now.
Any bridge. They'll check.<eos> They'll find no money there because the bad men came and took the money and gave it to the bad men that were kidnapping us.<eos> It works.<eos> Okay, done.<eos> - Yeah. - Get out.<eos> Oh. Jesus Christ. What was that?<eos> Bugs.<eos> - Truck. - There's a truck.<eos> Thanks for stopping.<eos> - Where you go?
That's the thing about constructs.<eos> They are single-minded.<eos> The only thing keeping you alive right now is the fact that you're the only one capable of fixing the problem you created.<eos> I know that.<eos> Do your job.<eos> Or I will kill your daughter in front of you.<eos> And then I'll kill you.<eos> Hello, Sunstone residents.<eos> Time to dig deep and find that happy place.<eos> You are stronger than you think, and worthier than you believe.

For some reason we were the only ones evacuated.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm okay, I'm okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I guess we owe our lives to Ms. Kravid.<eos> She's the one who arranged for us to come here.<eos> No, you're here because Tommy wanted you to be here.<eos> I'm very grateful to be reunited with my son, Ms. Kravid.<eos> But I have a lot of questions and I'll need some answers if you want Tommy's help.

We've sent them all over the world.<eos> We can't force people to join us but we can give them the opportunity to.<eos> Ms. Kravid?<eos> Phone for you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Sunstone's been compromised.<eos> Matt Parkman went rogue.<eos> He has Taylor.<eos> Do you know where he's taking her?<eos> My guess is he'll come to you.
I feel like I could be stronger on the last--<eos> I need you to be more threatening.<eos> The world needs to be terrified of you and every single Evo or we fail.<eos> Try again.<eos> [Sighs] Phil, you're losing him.<eos> [Crowd reacts] Sorry, Erica.<eos> I'm a little tired.<eos> Take a break.<eos> ♪ ♪ Lies and deception, all of it.<eos> Evos and non-Evos, you were meant to share this world.
_<eos> When I was, like, seven, these people took me to this place because of my power.<eos> I remember a room filled with toys and stuff.<eos> No windows.<eos> It's kind of hazy.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't want to see this one!<eos> Nathan?<eos> I'd like you to meet Malina... your sister.<eos> Do you two ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?
No, wait.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Hello, Tommy.<eos> Go--go back. Go--<eos> Did you really think you could escape without me knowing?<eos> It's over, Tommy.<eos> My name is Nathan.<eos> And you can't stop someone who can stop time.
The moment you go back and stop it, all of this-- all of us-- will cease to exist.<eos> So which world are you going to choose?<eos> The one with your sister or the one with your girlfriend and your mother and the thousands of innocent people that you... brought here?<eos> Let me make it easier for you.<eos> Time's running out, and one of these worlds has to die.<eos> You can't save both. You can't be in-- - Two places at once.<eos> Even Hiro Nakamura couldn't do that.<eos> I can.<eos> Hiro Nakamura prepared me my entire life for this.<eos> And now I've had an eternity in "Evernow" to practice, thanks to you.
I take it you are heading for Prague.<eos> How far is it?<eos> Thirty kilometers.<eos> I have a special delivery permit for my truck.<eos> I could take you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You rest here tonight. I will take you in the morning.<eos> Enjoy your soup.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> How much do the Germans pay you? For turning in your fellow countrymen, huh?
And given that this wound has more tree bark than dog bite,<eos> I would have to guess that you were parachuted back into Czechoslovakia with information that was somewhat out of date.<eos> You're a clever man.<eos> We were also told you were a good man.<eos> How long have you been away?<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Rewards are given to people who inform on anti-Nazi activity.<eos> Heydrich has all but crushed the resistance.<eos> He has executed thousands.<eos> I can put you in contact with the miller.

Go easy on the foot. You will be dancing the tango within a week.<eos> This is Břetislav.<eos> The miller.<eos> Edaurd told me you were looking for Oldrich Novák.<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you like to take a drive with me?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Please sit.<eos> You were looking for Oldrich Novák.<eos> Who gave you this contact?
Please sit.<eos> You were looking for Oldrich Novák.<eos> Who gave you this contact?<eos> London.<eos> And you tell us this because?<eos> You are not giving us much choice and this doesn't look like Gestapo headquarters.<eos> You, where are you from?<eos> Your accent, Bohemia?<eos> No, Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia.<eos> So you must know the railway station at Vladislav?
And please call me Auntie Moravec.<eos> Ata.<eos> Ata.<eos> Ata is my son.<eos> He is studying to be a violinist.<eos> Ata, this is Josef and this is Jan.<eos> Pleased to meet you both.<eos> So, try not to go outside, but if you do, never walk together.<eos> If you're stopped, you will need an excuse for why you're not at work.<eos> We'll try to get you medical certificates as soon as possible.
There is a way off the roof?<eos> There is a fire escape to the left.<eos> To the right it continues to the building next door.<eos> It's good enough.<eos> I'm sure you both would like a glass of Becherovka.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - It... It's okay.<eos> - Mrs. Moravec?<eos> There was so much people at the market.<eos> But I didn't find the bread that you like.
I guess, not being registered with the police as residents has something to do with this question?<eos> I hate the Germans.<eos> And tell me, do you have a friend as lovely as you that...<eos> That you can trust?<eos> Why?<eos> It would be less conspicuous if Jan and I were not seen out alone.<eos> Young love flourishes under German occupation.<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> But you're not that young.<eos> Knowing that you are trustworthy is one thing, Marie.

Valčík.<eos> I see you are no strangers to one another, but we don't have much time.<eos> We all trained special operations together.<eos> Valčík here was even on the same drop.<eos> Yes, dropped 10 minutes later and 30 miles off course.<eos> Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A, we have finally re-established communications with London.<eos> I have orders to send and receive any communications between you and London.<eos> You have your own decoder book, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Second Lieutenant Opálka and Warrant Officer Curda have completed Operation Out Distance, so both are now available to assist you.
Armed escort?<eos> There's only one person in Prague that travels with an armed escort.<eos> Are you going to assassinate Heydrich?<eos> What?<eos> Heydrich is the target?<eos> For your own safety, it's best that you don't ask too many questions.<eos> It's a bit too late for that now.<eos> Well, you agreed to help the resistance.<eos> Who the target is should not concern you.<eos> We are about to help you assassinate Reinhard Heydrich. - Of course it concerns us.

- Murder Heydrich? - No, no.<eos> Assassinate Heydrich.<eos> Murder implies he has a life worth living.<eos> So you think we are just two little girls who are here to follow the important parachutists around?<eos> Whoa. Lenka.<eos> We've been resisting here from the beginning in our own way.<eos> I personally don't have any reservation to killing a Nazi pig.<eos> But don't treat us like what you are about to do doesn't affect us.<eos> It does and it will.<eos> And you should keep your weapon clean because it's filthy.
Heydrich chokes the people of this city with a blanket of fear.<eos> People are shot for what?<eos> Their race? Their religion?<eos> Their cigarettes?<eos> You hear the stories about Poland.<eos> Marie, it's okay.<eos> Just tell me we are doing the right thing.<eos> I think it is my turn to apologize to you about the other morning.<eos> You were right to be angry.<eos> We should have told you what was at risk.
Thank you.<eos> I regret nothing.<eos> You are the bravest men I have ever met.<eos> I'm Father Petrek.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Please, come with me.<eos> This is our hidden crypt.<eos> You will be safe there.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> You made it.
I'm suggesting three men on guard duty in the nave balcony at all times.<eos> We rotate every six hours.<eos> These three take first watch.<eos> I'm sorry it wasn't the outcome we all hoped for.<eos> None more than us.<eos> Reinhard Heydrich has died in hospital.<eos> A direct result of the injuries sustained in the attack.<eos> Yesterday, the Germans went to a village, Lidice, and shot every man over the age of 16.<eos> The women and children have been taken to camps, and the buildings were razed to the ground.<eos> There has been talk that the village aided you somehow.
Today Karl Frank issued an amnesty broadcast.<eos> A full pardon for any person and their family in exchange for any information about the assassins, even if they did not come forward before.<eos> But there is a deadline of five days.<eos> After that, they plan to execute 30,000 Czechs.<eos> - This must stop.<eos> - What do you propose?<eos> Me and Josef will go to a park, place placards around our necks saying that we killed Heydrich and commit suicide.<eos> - Stupid talk. This is stupid talk.<eos> As a soldier, it is your duty to stay alive and continue fighting.<eos> Do you understand that, Warrant Officer Kubiš?
- I'm asking where you were going. - Why?<eos> Because they'll ask, and I'd like to know the answer before they ask.<eos> Well, I'm not answering that.<eos> Look, am I on trial? No.<eos> Did I kill that girl?<eos> No.<eos> I tried to protect her from that Arab.<eos> - He's not Arab.<eos> - Whatever. Okay?<eos> If they ask me why I was walking down a public street, minding my own business, I'm just gonna say, "What the fuck are you asking me that for?
I remember.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Captain Webb. Good morning<eos> Has everything been explalined to you?
I remember.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Captain Webb. Good morning<eos> Has everything been explalined to you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> When we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.<eos> I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
SYSTEM BREACH<eos> They found a back-door.<eos> We need the reverse shell.<eos> I'm going to locate the source. I'm working on it.<eos> Okay, people, we have a major breach in our classified main-frame.<eos> Drop everything you're doing and get on it, right now.<eos> WEBB, RICHARD<eos> SPOUSE NAME: MARY WEBB SON: DAVID WEBB<eos> TREADSTONE PROGRAM WEBB, DAVID<eos> Ma'am, I'm sending you the shell.
DASSAULT 1,0<eos> Kollwitzplatz 49, 28764 Berlin<eos> And now the founder and chairman of Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor.<eos> Hi.<eos> You all know why you're here.<eos> We're going to be unveiling a new platform.<eos> We think it is a bold new step, to allow us to serve our community better.<eos> We're a community right now that's trascending national boundaries, and<eos> I think we're at 1.5 billion users.<eos> In a nutshell. As you know we have an ecosystem of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point.
And I heard you got hacked.<eos> We're dealing with it.<eos> This changes everything.<eos> There's too much risk.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Aaron.<eos> You are an extraordinary gifted and perceptive young man.<eos> When you agreed to help us it was because you understood the very grave threats...<eos> Do you have any idea the shit-storm I'll have on my hands if this arrangement becomes public?<eos> I've already took a hit with Snowden, and you want more?
When you agreed to help us it was because you understood the very grave threats...<eos> Do you have any idea the shit-storm I'll have on my hands if this arrangement becomes public?<eos> I've already took a hit with Snowden, and you want more?<eos> Our enemies have become much more sophisticated.<eos> Gathering meta-data is no longer adequate.<eos> We need a backdoor into your new platform, and a way past the encryptions.<eos> And when that's not enough, you'll want something new.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> Privacy is... is freedom.<eos> Oh I mean, that's something you should think about defending.

47859 WHARF ROAD.<eos> Files deleted, sir.<eos> Call in.<eos> Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.<eos> I'm not in charge here.<eos> I wasn't here when you went missing.<eos> I can see you're going through the old Treadstone files.<eos> Were you tracing you history?<eos> I know you're looking for something.<eos> Let me help you find it.
- Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle? - Absolutely.<eos> Look, I don't...<eos> I... I think you're right.<eos> - I just don't think we want the...<eos> - I'm tired of this.<eos> Mr. Kalloor.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Barros.<eos> I'm from the Department of Justice.<eos> And I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint - issued by the US government. - Really, you have to do this in public?
Let's go.<eos> In 200 meters, make a right. Copy that.<eos> Comms check, second channel.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> I have you.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Heading towards Smith.<eos> No sign of Bourne.<eos> Subject is turning east. Into an alley.<eos> Alpha Team, that alley leads to a foot bridge, which will bring him to you.
- He hired you to put me under survellaince, why?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Why did he hire you?<eos> Don't say anything, Smith.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> There's no sign of them.<eos> What do you want us to do?<eos> Work you way down the Canal.<eos> I'll circle around and meet you there.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Everybody down! Right now!<eos> Get down!<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Federal agent, move!<eos> Take a team to the northeast elevator.<eos> I'll meet you up there.<eos> Bourne's on his way up to you.
There are many other agencies that would want what I know.<eos> I brought you something.<eos> It's a cast from you father's star, on the Memorial Wall at Langley.<eos> Richard Webb 10-20-48<eos> I'm sorry for what happened to you.<eos> How you were treated.<eos> But the people who did that are gone. And... things are changing at the Agency.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> I know you've always been a patriot.<eos> And what happens to this country, matters to you.
Could we just hold off on that for a second?<eos> I wanted to wait till Charlie was at school...<eos> - before speaking with you... - Ma'am, you're shivering.<eos> Yeah, I forgot my jacket.<eos> It's kind of chilly out.<eos> Maybe you want to put on a sweater or something.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> I just...<eos> 'Cause you don't want to get sick, ma'am.<eos> He told you.
It's kind of chilly out.<eos> Maybe you want to put on a sweater or something.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> I just...<eos> 'Cause you don't want to get sick, ma'am.<eos> He told you.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> That you have a cancer in your breast... and that you're dying, ma'am.<eos> Did he tell you how long I have?
Stealing's the one thing us Samuels are good at.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> I'm about to head out to the market.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> We shop at Gordon's.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's fine.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You know, Mr. Church, if we're going to do this... let me at least give you some money.
Made a card up for you and everything.<eos> And ma'am, you feel free. Whenever you want, you can read these books.<eos> And if you like, I'll bring more.<eos> A house could always use books, right?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Church.<eos> She'll get used to it.<eos> She's just a child.<eos> She doesn't understand.<eos> Oh, sure, ma'am.<eos> Look, I'll have dinner ready for you and the child... about 6:00 tonight, then after that, I'll take care of the dishes.
Hey, I'm Charlie.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> ...it can also be a time... where you slowly get lost.<eos> And sometimes... you just have to go home.<eos> Wherever that may be.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's Charlie.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Seems the legacy of the Brooks family... was having babies out of wedlock.<eos> Sorry I stopped writing you, Mr. Church.
For the first time, he wasn't afraid.<eos> He felt happy-<eos> And he promised that if he ever saw... that ladybug again... that he was going to thank her.<eos> Did he?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He still hasn't stopped looking.<eos> Maybe she's in the sky.<eos> Well, you just might be right.<eos> You just might be right.<eos> You should be in bed.
How about you, Nelly?<eos> Yeah, I got one.<eos> You're a fat fuck.<eos> 'Kay, that wasn't really funny.<eos> It was just angry.<eos> You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys.<eos> 'Kay, that's good.<eos> Now, just try and say it a little bit funnier now.<eos> Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us.<eos> Then see if you guys think it's funny.
And...<eos> And you think that's achievable?<eos> I do.<eos> I do, Matt.<eos> Uh, I mean...<eos> I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and... and look like a jackass.<eos> Oh, geez...<eos> All right, kids.<eos> Today, we have a very special treat.<eos> One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you.
Compared to you, I hadn't noticed.<eos> (water splashing)<eos> I'm sorry. (nervously chuckling)<eos> I'm the one who should apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> The epic headache you're gonna have in the morning.<eos> It's much worse than I thought.<eos> The Ellcrys is dying.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> You need to mobilize the Elven army.
I'm sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Uh...<eos> You're an Elf?<eos> Half-Elf.<eos> And yes, they're small, so spare me the ear jokes.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your letters to your aunt.<eos> You went through my things?<eos> Look, it's really important you return to Arborlon.
- Maybe we should.<eos> - For the laugh.<eos> - What are you on about?<eos> I suppose.<eos> Any interest in goin' to a weddin', no?<eos> I'll see ya around, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dates.<eos> No matter how great life is, it's always better when you have someone special to share it with.<eos> Here at Cupid's Arrow, we provide a unique personal introduction service that is designed to help you meet someone special.
Maybe next week?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll say it to him.<eos> Thanks, babes.<eos> The things you need to know about Charlene.<eos> What kind of man you want?<eos> One that's free to go to a weddin' on the 28th of March.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But what kind of men do you like?
You're welcome.<eos> I'm fuckin' married, Mary!<eos> I know.<eos> When I get back from me honeymoon, me and you are goin' out on the town.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> I'll see ya, Char.<eos> See ya, babe.<eos> Where would you be going, if you were going out?<eos> Music?<eos> Are you into your music?
It was Daphné's flat.<eos> Her father wants it back.<eos> I miss her so much.<eos> All right.<eos> Tonight you're staying over at your old man Lanester's.<eos> Thank you, it's kind of you.<eos> It's only normal.<eos> Not long ago you saved my backside.<eos> This is the least I can do.<eos> Can I ask you a question?
- You must be joking!<eos> - I'm afraid not.<eos> They don't want you going blind speeding down the highway.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> - What am I supposed to do?<eos> Ride a bicycle?<eos> Get Kaminski to ferry you.<eos> I reckon the cap will suit him.<eos> Gabrielle, it's Lanester.<eos> I have a proposition for you.
Please send her... my regards.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I wanted to change a dud bulb this morning but I found none.<eos> So I changed the lamp.<eos> I found an unused one upstairs.<eos> But then the table didn't match, so...<eos> And what's that?<eos> Those are flowers.<eos> They grow in fields.<eos> Gabrielle, I said you could stay, not redecorate the place.
It's not what you think, Inspector.<eos> What do I think, Mrs Arnault?<eos> What are...<eos> All right, you've got me.<eos> I was in the back when Delphine ran off.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> I was ashamed.<eos> Antidepressants don't work for me, so I smoke a little to cope.<eos> To forget what was said to me.<eos> What was said to you?
I can still see my mother's face.<eos> She seemed so lost and powerless.<eos> So I did what my father would have:<eos> I slapped him.<eos> He looked at me, began to cry and went to his room.<eos> After my father died, my mother couldn't cope.<eos> I thought it was up to me to step into his shoes and assume the paternal authority that he had so abused,<eos> as though we can only replicate what we've seen before.<eos> So whenever Xavier did that... I'd hit him.<eos> You thought you had to be someone who you couldn't be.

Have you got a reply to your message?<eos> No.<eos> You seem sure they're fine.<eos> Don't you think they might have been caught by a bad person?<eos> No way. They're much too sly.<eos> Especially Sarah.<eos> Nasty, but very sly. Nasty?<eos> I thought she was nice.<eos> Sarah, nice?<eos> Who told you that?
Here's the numberplate.<eos> 806-CDG-92.<eos> Got it. I'm on it.<eos> OK, thanks.<eos> Her phone is off.<eos> Yes?<eos> - Insp. Lanester?<eos> - Yes. - This is Vincent Meniel.<eos> - Who?<eos> Vincent Meniel, you asked me to contact you regarding Byron Croft.
Yes?<eos> - Insp. Lanester?<eos> - Yes. - This is Vincent Meniel.<eos> - Who?<eos> Vincent Meniel, you asked me to contact you regarding Byron Croft.<eos> About a police investigation.<eos> You're the international reporter?<eos> I do wildlife photography now.<eos> Not as warped. What do you want to know?<eos> Can I call you back, Mr Meniel?
Yeah, I've seen it from my house.<eos> Not like this.<eos> I thought it might give you some perspective.<eos> The most important day in human history is coming, Will.<eos> I just want you and your family to be on the right side of it.<eos> And when I tell you to piss off?<eos> - Why don't you give us a minute, sweetie? - Yeah.<eos> You have committed crimes that must be punished in accordance with Occupational Law.<eos> If you can't help me, then you and your wife and your children, well, I'm sorry but you'll all be sent to The Factory.<eos> How do you do it, Snyder?
Proxy Snyder.<eos> Bram, take Grace upstairs.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Don't leave without breakfast.<eos> Move, Grace.<eos> Come on.<eos> This is a big moment for your family.<eos> You're going to have access to things that were previously unavailable.<eos> For instance, your children will be assigned private tutors.<eos> You'll also be afforded certain other luxuries, round-the-clock security from Homeland among them.
Excuse me.<eos> We have a problem?<eos> We have some unscheduled activity.<eos> Evidently, one of your creatures is restless.<eos> In the park?<eos> No, sublevel 83, cold storage.<eos> We should be cautious.<eos> Send a response team, full armor.<eos> I'll take care of it myself.<eos> I think you guys enjoy playing dress up as much as the guests.

Every time your team rolls out an update, there's a possibility of a critical failure.<eos> We don't update the hosts in cold storage and the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years.<eos> Meaning we're overdue.<eos> I'll go along, too.<eos> If it's one of mine, I might be able to help.<eos> They're only yours until they stop working, Bernie.<eos> Then they're mine.<eos> Cooling system's been down for weeks.<eos> Gonna smell fantastic.<eos> I recommend you hang back.
They come here every day.<eos> Would you like a closer look?<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> They're very gentle.<eos> Here, put your hand out real flat.<eos> They're beautiful, aren't they?<eos> You're one of them, aren't you?<eos> You're not real.<eos> I have to go now. Sun's almost down.<eos> You should, too.
And here I thought you were only good for writing depraved little fantasies.<eos> You're right.<eos> This place is one thing to the guests, another thing to the shareholders, and something completely different to management.<eos> So enlighten me.<eos> What do you think management's real interests are?<eos> You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture, but not smart enough to see what it is.<eos> You know how much use that makes your support to me?<eos> Fuck all.<eos> Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.<eos> You'll have more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.
The Archdeacon's heard.<eos> He's sent you to check up on me.<eos> He can be an insufferable arse sometimes.<eos> - The merest hint of scandal, he's all over it like a rash.<eos> I'm finding Abigail.<eos> Mr Chambers!<eos> Come and dance!<eos> He's too old to dance.<eos> - Where's Abigail?<eos> - How old are you, Mr Chambers?
Mr Redmond, we found Abigail.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> More visitors?<eos> You'd best make yourself presentable.
I'm not ready.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> More visitors?<eos> You'd best make yourself presentable.<eos> Did you ever meet the Rector of Stiffkey?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - I can't say I did.<eos> As you know he had a rather hands-on way of dealing with fallen women.
Please, just trust that I have good reason.<eos> You know who the father is?<eos> No.<eos> And that's the truth.<eos> Geordie!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> She was 15 years old.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> One of her pals came to you.
- You know what he's done?<eos> - I'll make certain he atones for his sins.<eos> Atones for his sins?<eos> He got a child pregnant!<eos> A child is stretching it somewhat, wouldn't you say?<eos> It's a terrible thing, there's no doubt about that, but if you give a girl an apple, what will she do but eat?<eos> You're complicit.<eos> You are complicit in her death!<eos> Know your place, Sidney.<eos> It's you who should know yours.
Promise me you're not lonely.<eos> Don't you worry about me.<eos> - Valentine Lyall?<eos> - 46. - Suicide?<eos> I'd be screaming blue murder.<eos> It's about the death of your colleague.<eos> - I hear it was an accident.<eos> - So everyone stresses.<eos> Leave this alone, old boy.<eos> You're out of your depth.
I asked you where the drugs were.<eos> I don't know<eos> Then you better find them.<eos> Ain't you gonna get me a lift back?<eos> I don't run a taxi service, Dane.<eos> Could I speak to Dr. McKenzie, please?<eos> She's not here<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> Dr. McKenzie doesn't work here anymore.<eos> If you want a Doc, you'll gonna have to go to Hobart... or you can take a seat and I'll see you.
I'm going to call the police<eos> This colouring looks like advanced hemochromatosis.<eos> I've never seen it in anybody so young.<eos> You need to have his ferritin levels checked.<eos> Well, she won't go to a hospital.<eos> No one's taking him away from me.<eos> No.<eos> - You need to take a blood sample.<eos> Excuse me, but you can't...<eos> - You need specialist advice on this.
People think I had something to do with Chloe's disappearance, don't they?<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> I'm trying to work that out.<eos> Shit!<eos> Mum, what's she doing here?<eos> I couldn't stop her.<eos> Put a jacket on.<eos> Who'd you kill?<eos> What are you even doing here?<eos> You gotta wear these.
Yeah.<eos> You knew her better than anyone.<eos> She was my best friend.<eos> Who was her worst?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She was fighting with that Anna woman at the party.<eos> Fighting?<eos> - What, physically fighting?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I already told you all that.
Think back. Any arguments?<eos> Words she may have had with someone?<eos> She had a big mouth, like me, but no one hated her.<eos> You know what she was like.<eos> How about you two?<eos> Any altercations?<eos> - Anyone threaten you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Every bloody greenie who stepped foot in the forest.<eos> - Why aren't you talking to them?
- Just following up.<eos> If I want you to follow up on something, hey<eos> I'll ask you.<eos> Right up until that point, you speak to no one unless I say so<eos> OK?<eos> Yeah, ok.<eos> - Anna Macy<eos> - Yes<eos> I'm Dominic Harold, have you got a moment?<eos> What do you want?
Green night vision goggles.<eos> Army issue probably<eos> Put them on<eos> What do you see?<eos> Green Dutch<eos> Green office<eos> Why, what's all this about?<eos> What are army goggles doing at Mother Sullivan's Ridge<eos> Chloe Holloway?<eos> Who told you that?
I believe, uh, he could have had time to conceal the evidence, and...<eos> So you thought it was better to drop a senior officer, from a great police family, right into the shit from the get go.<eos> Well, I thought the seriousness of the situation warranted that I...<eos> You not heard of honor, son?<eos> Steve.<eos> Young McFadden was possibly right to raise this concern.<eos> If these matters were true, then there'd be serious questions that need to be answered.<eos> Well, I'm convinced they are true, sir.<eos> I found the drugs in his locker...<eos> You don't think that might be an offence?
It can't explain your soul.<eos> Does a rush of hormones and testosterone fully describe what it is to fall in love?<eos> And can science explain the excruciating loss we feel when that person we love most dies?<eos> Science doesn't have all the answers.<eos> I was working at an Antarctic base in 1998.<eos> Whilst I was there, I witnessed things, recorded things, that are beyond the understanding of Newtonian physics.<eos> Geomagnetic anomalies so bizarre that the government felt it necessary to stifle all further research.<eos> Anna, you came.<eos> You said something about the humming.<eos> What do you know?
Where does the main water supply come in from?<eos> The catchment, up behind the ridge.<eos> Right, ok.<eos> I'll need to access it.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> My old man owns half, and I can't bloody get up there.<eos> You'll need to talk to Craig Grayson, or Max Holloway.<eos> Right.<eos> Ok, fellas.<eos> It's with a very, very heavy heart I need to inform you that ... as of next Friday, the mill will be shut down
You'll need to talk to Craig Grayson, or Max Holloway.<eos> Right.<eos> Ok, fellas.<eos> It's with a very, very heavy heart I need to inform you that ... as of next Friday, the mill will be shut down<eos> New owners will be taking over in the next few weeks.<eos> I just want to say that I tried as hard as I could to prolong the decision, but as you all know, we couldn't fullfill the contract.<eos> Yeah, and who's fault's that?<eos> And as a result Jack Stedman, just had no choice, but to shut us down.<eos> - Bullshit, what is gonna happen to us?<eos> You're gonna be paid out until the end of next month. - Yeah, and then what?
It's the baker.<eos> He's almost done.<eos> So, what did you come up with?<eos> This was no suicide.<eos> Good afternoon, Dr. Edelweiss.<eos> Ah.<eos> Tribeca, Geils.<eos> No, the icing didn't kill him.<eos> But let's turn him over.<eos> I want to show you something very interesting.
A river of shit ran through the center of Andersonville, and I tell you the stench of Goodwin's wound overpowered it.<eos> The rot did not take his leg.<eos> Uh, the rebels did.<eos> And with it, his dignity.<eos> Imagine saving a man's life only to watch his slow death.<eos> What breed of monster is capable of such inhumanity?<eos> I can think of one.<eos> Oh, as can I.<eos> Untie me, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> I can help you.
Son of a bitch.<eos> And I will see you hang.<eos> If your misguided see of justice requires that I hang for my crimes,<eos> surely you can understand that you must hang there beside me...<eos> For yours.<eos> And, the bodies you have piled up do not disappear when you bury them away,<eos> out of sight.<eos> And you bring death everywhere.<eos> You scared?<eos> You need your rest, Mr. Bohannon, hmm?
Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Private, what...<eos> What is that...<eos> What is that you're playing?<eos> It got no name far as I know.<eos> Just a melody I keep hearing in my head.<eos> It is not "just a melody" rattling around in your head, you.<eos> It is, unless I misheard, Two Soldiers, and you...<eos> You almost have it, but for blowing a note or two, you should be drawing.
I've had enough.<eos> Please.<eos> Stay the night.<eos> Of course.<eos> You're welcome to.<eos> I'll sleep in the barn.<eos> William.<eos> Mr. Bohannon...<eos> I'm sorry about supper.<eos> Should've seen it'd be hard on you, but it's been so long...
All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Go on.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'll be right in.<eos> Thank you for saving them.<eos> For dispatching that monster.<eos> The Swede cast a long shadow over all our lives, Mr. Vinson.<eos> We'll be moving on in the morning, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> I suggest you do the same.
$20 a man.<eos> Keep your money.<eos> It's the hard paper I want.<eos> Stock in the Union Pacific Railroad.<eos> You're a labor contractor.<eos> Aye.<eos> And I'd say I'm undervalued.<eos> No one holds you in higher esteem than I do, Mickey.<eos> Oh, Jesus, I'm touched.<eos> The thing is, though, I know that you're short 900 Mormon graders.
I will make you a partner in the railroad's construction company.<eos> Credit Mobilier.<eos> Credit Mobilier is a worthless shell.<eos> I want the real thing.<eos> I want legitimacy.<eos> I...<eos> Or you can race Cullen Bohannon with no graders.<eos> Bohannon.<eos> Hardly the adversary I expected.<eos> Well, it seems like you don't need my services after all, then.
It's not all steaks and French wine.<eos> Ownership comes with responsibilities.<eos> And what kinds of responsibilities?<eos> Responsibilities suited to a man of your background.<eos> A man unafraid of back alleys.<eos> This is supposed to keep me from them kinds of responsibilities.<eos> It's not just the Dead Rabbits.<eos> Every business is dirty.<eos> Give me the stock.<eos> I'll have your thousand workers out to you by the end of the week.
How much do you think I'm worth to the Railroad?<eos> Were I to go missing?<eos> Let's say, masked men kidnap me for my private car, in front of Mr. Delaney.<eos> They demand $250,000 for my return.<eos> And threaten to kill me, if Delaney reveals this to anybody except the board.<eos> The board hopes to avoid the plummeting share price that would result in the breaking news of their president's kidnapping.<eos> So, they agree to send the funds within the day.<eos> Voila.<eos> Our cash problems are solved.<eos> It sounds like you should be talking to Mr. Delaney.
He's it, not me.<eos> Ms. Strobridge.<eos> Take your brood inside for a moment.<eos> Anything you gotta say to me, you can say to us.<eos> Well, I think it'd be better if we spoke in private.<eos> Better for you, or better for us, Mr. Huntington?<eos> Say your piece.<eos> Very well, Mr. Strobridge, the Central Pacific no longer requires your services as railroad superintendent.<eos> You have until tomorrow to pack your things.<eos> The railroad will provide transit for you and your family wherever you want to go.
I mentioned we were going to New York.<eos> I am not giving an interview.<eos> Get out of my private car.<eos> So you have no comment on the money you're paying out to Jack Nobles and the other ranchers?<eos> That's right, I have no comment.<eos> "Union Pacific president pays out $50,000 for role in fraudulent land scheme."<eos> There was no fraud.<eos> The board decided to move the hub without my knowledge.<eos> Then why pay the money?<eos> It's time you went back to your seat.
That is a piece of history, forged from the golden spike.<eos> - Golden what?<eos> - Spike!<eos> The great transcontinental railroad?<eos> Didn't you learn anything in school?<eos> I didn't go to school.<eos> The marriage of the mighty Union Pacific and the significantly less mighty Central Pacific Railroad Companies connecting at last the east and west of this great nation.<eos> Let that be a history lesson...<eos> Free of charge.<eos> I can give you the going rate.
Bella here is the very ambassadress of diversification.<eos> - Aren't you, mon petit chou?<eos> - Guilty, mon coeur!<eos> Pretend you have some manners, for the lady's sake.<eos> Don't insult me.<eos> Were we not in the company of said lady, I would call you what you are.<eos> What's that?<eos> A jackass, my dear.<eos> All right, you win.<eos> And we thank you very kindly, sir.
We'll start a collection.<eos> I got $1,000.<eos> Spends just as good as any government money.<eos> Plus I got a horse.<eos> I could sell him.<eos> Keep your horse, honey.<eos> There ain't enough assets in this whole damn town to raise the ransom.<eos> Who could've done this?<eos> From his accent, the leader was Irish.<eos> What did he say to you?
- The books?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We follow Durant's debts, then we can find out who did this.<eos> Right then, I'll release the books.<eos> Anything to help.<eos> I just need consent from the board members first.<eos> We don't have time to waste on the damn board!<eos> You've had a difficult day, Miss Ellison.<eos> - Don't patronize me.<eos> - You're lucky to be alive.
You'd be wise to mind your hole or I'm liable to give y'another.<eos> I'd wager your mother dropped you on your head more than once when you were a baby.<eos> Whiskey fingers, as you well know, can be slippery.<eos> You're nothin' but a bloated old Mary-Ann.<eos> I should kill you right here and now!<eos> You're an idiot!<eos> A useless, pathetic, idiot.<eos> If you don't shut your hole, you'll be shittin' your death shit right here in this murky drink...<eos> Some privacy, please?<eos> I think I've a notion of who you're wantin' for this.
Pains me to say it,<eos> but that's what I'm figurin'.<eos> Your own blood.<eos> He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.<eos> Johnny's never been a very patient man.<eos> You best get that ransom together quick.
Major Bendix and his men will finish with Mr. Shea.<eos> Maggie...<eos> A word.<eos> You're too late, Miss Ellison.<eos> Johnny Shea killed Mr. Delaney and kidnapped Durant.<eos> McGinnes turned him in.<eos> Why?<eos> No loyalty amongst rats.<eos> Maggie,<eos> Durant told you he wired for money to pay off the ranchers?
- A man was killed.<eos> - Your friend, murdered.<eos> - Yes, and I wasn't.<eos> I'm not lucky to be alive.<eos> I think Shea was told not to kill me on that train by Thomas Durant.<eos> What you are suggesting is beyond absurd.<eos> This isn't a dime novel.<eos> You don't know what happened on that train, Louise.<eos> You were there but you don't know.<eos> I'm telling you, Maggie.
Why didn't he kill you?<eos> I don't know, John.<eos> Maybe he got tired of all the death.<eos> I know I am.<eos> I'm free to go, I assume.<eos> I know what happened out there.<eos> I know the whole story.<eos> I can't prove it.<eos> But I know it.<eos> I've told you the whole story.
I don't doubt the extent of the resources at your disposal, sir.<eos> It's me you doubt.<eos> My business.<eos> I've turned a blind eye until now.<eos> If you're gonna haul freight to Asia for the Central Pacific, I need a deeper understanding of the man representing me.<eos> My intention is to read about my business in the same papers I read about yours, Mr. Huntington.<eos> You're a whore minder, sir, and a peddler of opiates.<eos> As well as a fine chef.<eos> The single largest business in Asia began by smuggling opium into China.<eos> The day you grow as big as Jardine Matheson is the day I cut out my tongue and allow you serve it as your daily special.
- Paid who?<eos> Ain't for sale.<eos> Everything for sale.<eos> $20.<eos> Hop in.<eos> Reno waits.<eos> - Wait too long already.<eos> - Get in.<eos> It's time to consider workforce for the future.<eos> You got a taste for firing and you want another one?
You got a taste for firing and you want another one?<eos> Chief Mandarin.<eos> Man I know back East, name of Mickey McGinnes, can have us a thousand Irishmen out here by the time we hit the desert.<eos> Mr. Chang provides invaluable services for this road.<eos> Skimming wages, organizing strikes, killing my foreman.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> That... Hard to put a price on those kinds of services.<eos> Chinese business.<eos> Chang's never betrayed me.<eos> You don't need Chang.
Please.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You can look at me.<eos> We're not supposed to.<eos> In here, we might be able to bend the rules.<eos> Just a bit.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Hi.<eos> I imagine you must find this strange.
All right.<eos> I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?<eos> I'll check my schedule.<eos> Well.<eos> See if you can squeeze me in.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Nothing exciting, just meetings.<eos> Well, after you get back, then.<eos> It's a date.<eos> Now, I think it's time for you to go home.
- Do you have a name?<eos> - Angela.<eos> Angela.<eos> She's just perfect.<eos> - You can join us.<eos> - What do you mean, "us"?<eos> There's a network.<eos> Waterford is important.<eos> He's very high up.<eos> You need to be careful.
- Nothing.<eos> It's just...<eos> - What?<eos> - It sounds a little patronizing. - It is so fucking patronizing.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bring it on.<eos> I wanna hear why I shouldn't take care of my wife.<eos> - "My wife"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - She doesn't belong to you.
You really got a fucking problem, you know that?<eos> Should I just go in the kitchen and cut my dick off?<eos> No, you should do that.<eos> And while you do it, take a video of it, 'cause the girls down at the collective will love watching that shit.<eos> - They'll love it.<eos> - It's not for the collective.<eos> It's for you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Hey, Davis is closed.<eos> You're gonna have to take the train at Alewife.
Sure.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I just wanted to check if you were okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Except for the weird guy who just snuck into my room.<eos> Other than that...<eos> You're dripping.<eos> I brought you some ice.
No ice cream for you this month, young lady.<eos> This can go in the hall.<eos> Offred, blessed day.<eos> Please, come on up.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I know that we're still in such early stages.<eos> But I've been wanting to clean this room out for quite some time, and the light here is so beautiful in the morning.<eos> And by His word, all things are possible to him that believeth.<eos> Mrs. Waterford...<eos> I want to tell you something.
They need you to go back to Jezebel's.<eos> They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.<eos> This is fucking ridiculous.<eos> Risking your life because Alma said so?<eos> - Fuckin' Alma?<eos> - It's just a package.<eos> It could be anything! A bomb.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> What do you know?
Utter and unutterable.<eos> It tastes like gunmetal.<eos> Like the point of a carpenter's nail.<eos> Would you like a one-two-three, dear?<eos> One...<eos> We don't look at each other that way anymore.<eos> It's their own fault.<eos> They should have never given us uniforms if they didn't want us to be an army.<eos> Praised be.<eos> I trusted you.

If I've sinned, then you led me to it.<eos> You can blame me all you want, but He knows the truth.<eos> Everybody answers to God.<eos> And you answer to me.<eos> - Go to your room.<eos> - She's pregnant.<eos> Praised be.<eos> Praised be.<eos> It isn't yours.<eos> You're weak, and God would never let you pass on that weakness.
Please, please.<eos> No! No!<eos> No!<eos> Offred, you need to listen to me.<eos> Please, please, take me back.<eos> Please! I have to see her, please!<eos> That's not going to be good for anybody.<eos> She is a beautiful girl, Offred.<eos> And she's happy and she's well taken care of.<eos> And you don't have to worry about anything.
How about you?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Of course.<eos> I need you to...<eos> Protect my daughter.<eos> Please.<eos> Protect her from what?<eos> From her.<eos> From Mrs. Waterford.<eos> I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.
Previously, on "Suits"...<eos> Tara Messer, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.<eos> I don't care how much money you make or how many you women you sleep with.<eos> You have issues in your life that are going to keep you from having real relationships.
- Donna...<eos> - I want something more.<eos> - What do you mean more?<eos> - I made a deal that we would handle the miners' case in exchange for the chance to be admitted to the bar.<eos> Are you goddamn kidding me?<eos> You're fired.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - He lied... not once, not twice...<eos> I don't care because we need him.<eos> Monday morning, you better start putting your money where your mouth is and find us another $50,000 case.
- Don't do it.<eos> - He lied... not once, not twice...<eos> I don't care because we need him.<eos> Monday morning, you better start putting your money where your mouth is and find us another $50,000 case.<eos> Tara left a 15-second voicemail.<eos> She's either gonna tell me that she never wants to see me again or she wants to make up.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your first year's salary in advance.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Harvey, I'm running out of ways to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.

Welcome back.<eos> Harvey, I'm running out of ways to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.<eos> I'm offering you a deal.<eos> One for you, one for me.<eos> I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year.<eos> I want to fund it for two, and any case I want to bring the clinic onto, I can.<eos> Done.<eos> - And there's one more thing.<eos> - You are not getting my office.<eos> Oh, yes, I am, and I will tell you why.

I couldn't hear you.<eos> I like the car.<eos> Good.<eos> You're here early.<eos> I need you to take point on a consumer fraud hearing for Sandra.<eos> Nathan, I need to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know things got heated between us the other night, but as far as I'm concerned, it's water under the bridge, so if you're wondering if I'm still upset at you...<eos> I'm not.<eos> And this is to make sure you're still not upset with me after you hear what I'm about to say.

Wow.<eos> That sounds uncomfortable.<eos> Now, speaking of pro bonos, when are you gonna get your old man records out of here so I can settle in and get to work?<eos> I'll get out of here once we take of Neil Stillman.<eos> Neil Stillman?<eos> Detour industries?<eos> No, Neil Stillman, Jedi counsel.<eos> Okay, I was asking because<eos> Neil Stillman is a corporate client, so what happened to one for me, then one for you?<eos> Do I need to remind you that at a corporate law firm, we do the cases that pay the bills first?

We go out and have some fun and kick some ass?<eos> Or do you want to stay here measuring for your bike rack?<eos> It's not gonna measure itself.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Kick ass.<eos> But we do this, I want on that Jedi counsel.<eos> Robes, light saber, whole deal.<eos> Good, you're here.<eos> Gretchen, what are you doing here?<eos> - I'm here to give you these.
But we do this, I want on that Jedi counsel.<eos> Robes, light saber, whole deal.<eos> Good, you're here.<eos> Gretchen, what are you doing here?<eos> - I'm here to give you these.<eos> - What are those?<eos> Brochures from the top nine mud resorts in the northern hemisphere, though I don't know why a person would do that in the first place.<eos> It's like sitting in a bathtub of your own poop.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Louis, you need to take yourself some time off.
No one will be shitting.<eos> No one will be pissing.<eos> No...<eos> Go ahead, ask him.<eos> Ask me what?<eos> I heard about your reputation, but...<eos> But what?<eos> Don't you worry about my reputation, son.<eos> I am not the same Louis I used to be.<eos> I still may be tough, but I have a soft spot, so what do you need?
We're gonna have a baby boy.<eos> Something everybody here knows is never gonna happen to you.<eos> Gonna be a father for the rest of his life.<eos> - What'd you just say to me?<eos> - I said it's a C-section, 'cause the baby's actually sideways, which means we have to go in there...<eos> You self-centered piece of shit.<eos> Do you think I care about the graphic details?<eos> - I just thought...<eos> - Thought what?<eos> That you don't give a shit about your job?

Got it.<eos> You thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Depends. What are you thinking?<eos> I'm thinking we've got a vodka company to sell.<eos> You already said you wanted to have some fun.<eos> That's right, and you put those two together, what have we got?<eos> Party.<eos> See?<eos> We're already on the same page.<eos> Why don't you get a kick-ass location, and I'll get the models.
Rachel, taking the associates away isn't exactly gonna stabilize him.<eos> That's the one thing he has.<eos> Yeah, I know that, but I'm telling you, if we're not careful, someone's gonna do something to him, and he'll be lucky if it's just suing him.<eos> Did you tell him that?<eos> I tried to, and he bit my head off the minute I walked into his office, so...<eos> Okay, I'll talk to him.<eos> But I'm gonna need you to tell me exactly what he did first.<eos> Whatever it is, I don't have time, Donna.<eos> From what I heard, you had time to go off on the associates this morning.<eos> Who told you that?
Are you telling me you didn't go off on Brian Altman and then make a horrible comment about Stephanie Patel's sex life?<eos> - It's called discipline, Donna.<eos> - It's called actionable, Louis.<eos> You're lucky that there isn't a lawsuit on your desk right now.<eos> Well, thank you for your counsel.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Louis, I am trying to be understanding, but I think Rachel should handle the associates for right now.<eos> - Is that a joke?<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> Well, then let me explain a little something to you called pecking order.
Rachel's down here.<eos> And you don't give dominion over your associates to someone down here.<eos> I know that, but I also know that Tara broke up with you last night, and you're not in your right mind.<eos> I don't want to hear that name again.<eos> Louis, all I'm saying is if you don't deal with it, you're gonna keep abusing the associates, and then we're gonna have...<eos> Hey, Donna, you know what, I didn't want to do this, but I did leave one name off the chart.<eos> Me. Rachel.<eos> You.<eos> So don't you tell me what to do.<eos> Louis, I'm gonna let that go, because I know you're hurting, but that right there is exactly why I'm right, because if you're willing to talk to me like that, god help those associates.
'Cause I'd like to schedule an appointment as soon as possible.<eos> I'm sorry. You've got the wrong number.<eos> This is Dr. I have work to do.<eos> Well, in that case, I'd like to schedule an appointment as soon as possible.<eos> Harvey, why exactly are you calling me?<eos> First, answer me this:<eos> How many times have you considered picking up the phone and telling me that you've reconsidered since you said yes?<eos> Four.<eos> If you don't count right now.<eos> Then let's just say I'm calling to tell you that I've been in a room full of models for the last hour, and all I can think of is you.
I think Harvey got a helicopter.<eos> We should take a ride around the city.<eos> I can't.<eos> You go.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I ju...<eos> I might be taking over the associates, and if I do, I just want to be prepared.<eos> Rachel, that's amazing, but are you telling me that Louis is really ready to give that up?<eos> That's the long story.<eos> But I'll tell you about it later tonight.
You want to tell me what's going on, or you want to keep firing your pistol in the wrong direction?<eos> I'm sorry, Gretchen.<eos> I am just sick and tired of being everyone's go-to and not getting what I ask for.<eos> I don't mean to sound insensitive, but you're a corporate secretary.<eos> What exactly did you expect?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I asked Harvey for a seat at the table.<eos> - What table?<eos> - The partnership table.<eos> - No wonder he shot you down.
Mm. And what are you getting at?<eos> I'm having another drink.<eos> I said for you to be careful.<eos> I can handle my liquor.<eos> Okay.<eos> How many fingers am I holding up, huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> You can't tell, can you?<eos> Who can't handle my liquor now?<eos> I'd tell you to put food in your stomach, but unfortunately, I only ordered enough to give the appearance of having food.

Is it?<eos> Because if you were worth your salary, you'd ask how many bids we're sitting on.<eos> I don't have to ask, because I've got this.<eos> Guest list was 500, and half of them came for the girls.<eos> Half of the other half don't have the capital, and 60% of the rest of them woke up realizing they don't want to work in the liquor business.<eos> Take, I don't know, what, 47 off the top for good measure?<eos> Leaves us with three bids.<eos> - Donna told you, didn't she?<eos> - Probably.<eos> Did she bother telling you what we're doing now?
Neil Stillman's walking away with a boatload of cash.<eos> Speaking of boatloads of cash...<eos> It's a check for half a million dollars.<eos> I told you I was serious about becoming a partner, and I am.<eos> - Donna...<eos> - Harvey, be honest.<eos> You haven't given one thought to what we talked about yesterday.<eos> - I've been a little busy.<eos> - And you've also been avoiding the subject.<eos> This way, you have to take me seriously.
- I've been a little busy.<eos> - And you've also been avoiding the subject.<eos> This way, you have to take me seriously.<eos> I do take you seriously.<eos> Then walk the hell down to Louis' office and tell him I'm a partner.<eos> Donna, I can't just ram every decision down his throat.<eos> Every decision?<eos> You haven't even told him that you're stepping into Jessica's shoes yet.<eos> I'm waiting for the right time.<eos> And if I were a partner, I would tell you that the right time was yesterday.

You don't think I've had fantasies about you?<eos> That one day you'd show up at my office as I was heading home for the night, and I turn around, and you'd be there.<eos> You wouldn't say a word, but...<eos> You'd take me in your arms and kiss me, and...<eos> It would actually be the start of something special.<eos> Well, I have, which is why despite my better judgment, I'm here with you right now.<eos> - So what's the problem?<eos> - The problem is those fantasies weren't of me being a therapist to a man who's still too afraid to admit that he needs help, much less take control of a firm that bears his name.<eos> Thank you for dinner, Harvey.<eos> If you need a session, call my office.
- Do for me?<eos> You could tell me from now on if you have a problem with me, you'll take it up with me instead of going behind my back.<eos> - What?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You think I don't know the whole<eos> "Rachel should be in charge of my associates"<eos> bullshit came from you and not Donna?<eos> You're right.<eos> It was from me.<eos> And I came to you first, and you bit my head off.

- Well, now you do.<eos> - It doesn't change a thing.<eos> Those two dipshits already signed the agreement.<eos> Neil, this looks a hell of a lot like you're asking me to be a party to fraud.<eos> I'm asking you to do your job.<eos> Look out for my interests, and take me at my word.<eos> If I have reason to believe that you're lying to me, which I do...<eos> The only thing you have reason to believe is that I will fire you if you don't do this for me and then find someone who will, so this thing is gonna get done whether you do it or not.<eos> The only thing that happens if you don't is that the world will know what people suspect already:<eos> That you can't fill Jessica's shoes.
The only thing that happens if you don't is that the world will know what people suspect already:<eos> That you can't fill Jessica's shoes.<eos> How long do you think it's gonna take after that before every one of your clients starts to leave you?<eos> So you tell me right now, are you in or not?<eos> - Shit.<eos> Oliver.<eos> - What's up, Mike?<eos> How's your new job?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I swear I was gonna tell you.
I'm just getting the ball rolling.<eos> I can't work on my own cases if I don't have my own office.<eos> Listen, Mike.<eos> You let the goddamn sale go through.<eos> - You don't understand. - I understand that you said that you wanted one last case together before you stepped up, but you clearly are not ready to step up, so I got to get my pro Bono cases in before this place doesn't even exist anymore.<eos> Are you finished, or do you have a minute to hear why I let the sale go through?<eos> Mike, I have no proof he knew.<eos> He's Jessica's client.<eos> How's it gonna look if he tells the world that we can't handle his business anymore?<eos> Well, I'll tell you how it looks right now.
He's Jessica's client.<eos> How's it gonna look if he tells the world that we can't handle his business anymore?<eos> Well, I'll tell you how it looks right now.<eos> It looks like you're afraid and you're not in charge.<eos> Okay, you say something like that to me, you better get ready for a hit, because I am doing the best I can.<eos> No, Harvey, you're not doing shit.<eos> You're hiding, 'cause you're afraid.<eos> You're afraid to take responsibility for this firm, and you won't admit it to yourself.<eos> I don't have to listen to this.<eos> Well, you're going to, 'cause way back when, you cared enough about me to tell me the same thing to my face, and I'm just returning the favor.

Win-win.<eos> Maybe you are as good as Jessica.<eos> Maybe I am.<eos> Maybe I'm not.<eos> But the thing we have in common is we're never gonna be bullied by any of our clients.<eos> All right, Louis, I've tried to be reasonable, but I'm not gonna sit around and watch this anymore.<eos> As of this moment, you're no longer in charge of the associates. Says you and what army?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> - I said you can't do that.<eos> - Oh, yes, I can, because even though Harvey clearly didn't tell you, as of last night, I'm a senior partner.
- You're what?<eos> - That's right.<eos> I gave Harvey a check for half a million dollars.<eos> I'm a partner now, Louis, which means your whole "you're up here and I'm down here" bullshit, not anymore. Partner?<eos> You're not even a lawyer.<eos> Neither are the chief operating officers of four of the top nine firms in the world.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> I didn't agree to any of this.<eos> I don't care whether you agreed to it or not.<eos> You're gonna live with it.
And if you think you're gonna leave this bathroom without giving me the respect I deserve...<eos> I'm not giving up my associates.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - Harvey, what the hell kind of shit did you pull?<eos> Shut up and listen, Louis.<eos> Donna asked for a seat at the table, and I gave her one, because when she worked for me, she had my back, and would kill anyone coming for me, and when she worked for you, she did the same exact thing,<eos> not to mention if she left tomorrow, this firm would be a pile of rubble within 15 minutes.<eos> So then give her a raise.<eos> You don't make her goddamn senior partner.<eos> If Jessica were here, she'd tell you to do the same exact thing.
- Rachel, just let me finish while I'm still able to get it out.<eos> I know I can be rough on them... But it's only because I want to see them become the best lawyers they can be.<eos> But I'm not in the best headspace right now, and if I keep taking my anger out on them, they will not become great lawyers.<eos> They might not stay in the law at all, so...<eos> It's better that someone else takes over for a while, and I cannot think of a better person than you.<eos> I'm sorry that I went behind your back, Louis.<eos> You were right to.<eos> If you had asked me face-to-face, I don't even know what I would have done, and that... just thinking about that makes me sick.<eos> Rachel, you're family, and if I lose you too...<eos> Louis, you're not going to lose me, but I think I know what you may need.
- That's not what Rachel says.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> I think we both know what that means.<eos> Donna, for the record, my balls are within normal parameters.<eos> So you just come down here to give me shit, or was there maybe another reason?<eos> What other reason would I have?<eos> I can't think of a single one.<eos> - Then my work here is done.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I certainly didn't come down here to tell you I remember the first time you were in this office, and I never thought I'd see the day when I told you congratulations, Mike.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Shit.<eos> This one's for you, Charlie.
I'm sorry.<eos> You were late.<eos> You almost didn't make it.<eos> I know. I... I mean, if it hadn't been for Cassidy...<eos> I had my hands pretty full myself.<eos> I got back, I stopped him, that's it.<eos> Can't you feel it, Jesse?<eos> That... That "something's not right" feeling?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Tulip.
And once we get out of here, there's gonna be a girl that comes in here and reads it.<eos> It will let her know she's not alone.<eos> Moira!<eos> Time's up!<eos> Just a second, Aunt Elizabeth.<eos> Just having my monthly woe.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Bye.<eos> You had to be brave to do this.<eos> So, whatever it means, thank you.
Gave an interview to the Toronto Star.<eos> It's already up on their website.<eos> - What does it say?<eos> - You can imagine.<eos> Lies and hyperbole, everything in the worst possible light.<eos> I would expect more from an Aunt.<eos> Just me being naive, I guess.<eos> Have Fortenberry send in a written response.<eos> The important thing is not to discredit what she said, but we need to discredit her.<eos> You don't need to worry about this.
God damn it!<eos> God fucking damn it!<eos> We're home.<eos> Look, I'm sorry this is happening to you.<eos> - I wish...<eos> - You wish what?<eos> What do you wish?<eos> So, are you dying?<eos> Dehydrated.<eos> You need to take better care of yourself.
9:00 in my office?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, who's an early bird today?<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> "And when Rachel saw that she bear Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob,<eos> 'Give me children or else I die.'"<eos> Fred.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let me help you.
And what price did she pay for her insolence?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, I'm sorry.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The most painful thing is not the betrayal of trust, June.<eos> Do you know what's most painful?<eos> The most painful thing in this entire ugly incident is the ingratitude.<eos> Don't you realize the opportunity you have been given?
We brought the suit so that I could get into the Bar.<eos> - 100 million.<eos> - With an admission of guilt.<eos> Sure, where do I sign?<eos> I'm willing to cut your clients a check that'll change their lives and you're too stupid to see it.<eos> Are you ready to take responsibility or not?<eos> You think I won't go after you for stealing from Seidel's company?<eos> I don't give a shit about his marriage.<eos> The reason he hasn't come forward has nothing to do with his marriage.<eos> You didn't have to keep this quiet because you're married.
You promised Rachel that you'd pull the plug if things got too risky.<eos> Well... it just got too God damn risky.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You got out of bed before it was light out.<eos> And you never came back.<eos> I want to talk to you for a minute.<eos> About what?<eos> I know you went to Harvey and you made him promise to pull the plug on my getting into the Bar if things got too risky.<eos> He wasn't supposed to tell you that.
Mike, I don't mean to be an asshole, but I'm not doing anything until you tell Nathan exactly what's going on.<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You said you were doing this case as a way to get into the Bar.<eos> And I just withdrew my application.<eos> There's no deal anymore.<eos> So whatever it was I was gonna tell Nathan, I don't have to tell him anymore.<eos> Just like that. You're giving up your chance?<eos> Look, I heard what you said to me last night about setting an example.<eos> So instead of telling Nathan that I was up to something shady, I'm telling you that I'm not.
Let me guess, she promised him the Moon, then hung him out to dry.<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> You don't need to access Velocity's records.<eos> She doesn't work there.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I know who she is.<eos> And the price just tripled.<eos> Tripled?<eos> You hypocritical piece of shit.<eos> You don't even have to access anything.
But before we move forward, I need to make sure you're good with one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> I want 90% ownership.<eos> 90%?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> And I'm not in the venture capital business.<eos> I invest in the stock market.<eos> Which means I'd be using my own money on this.<eos> Money that you'd earn back in spades.

You have no credibility to do this.

You have no credibility to do this.<eos> Believe me, these are the best terms you're gonna get.<eos> Well... you see, that's where you're wrong, Stu.<eos> Because like I told you once before,
Because like I told you once before,<eos> I'm Donna, this is awesome, and I can do better.<eos> Well, I hope you prove me wrong.<eos> But in the meantime, I won't be used as a stalking horse.<eos> Which means if you walk away now, you can't come back to me later.<eos> You don't have to worry about that, Stu.<eos> Because once I walk out that door, I promise you I'm not coming back.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> Listen, Mike, before you say anything...<eos> I know you didn't give a shit about those miners, but the least you could've done is stuck around long enough to give me some leverage.
Rachel, I was upset.<eos> It had just happened.<eos> No, Mike, that's just it. It hadn't.<eos> You've been living with this for so long, that's why you gave Harvey the go-ahead to begin with.<eos> I did that because I had to watch Oliver fail and there's nothing I could do about it.<eos> And if it wasn't Oliver, it was going to be someone else.<eos> Or something else.<eos> There's always gonna be some reminder that you weren't a lawyer.<eos> And it would eat away at you, because it's what you're meant to be.<eos> You shouldn't have done what you did.
And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I still haven't even told her I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner.<eos> - Louis...<eos> - Rachel, when Sheila found out, she said I wasn't her soul mate anymore.<eos> But that was Sheila, Louis.<eos> And the key phrase is "she found out."<eos> You didn't tell her.<eos> So you were okay when Mike told you?
- Louis...<eos> - Rachel, when Sheila found out, she said I wasn't her soul mate anymore.<eos> But that was Sheila, Louis.<eos> And the key phrase is "she found out."<eos> You didn't tell her.<eos> So you were okay when Mike told you?<eos> No, I wouldn't say that I was okay with it.<eos> But I love him.<eos> That's why I forgave him.<eos> I can't guarantee that Tara will forgive you, but I can tell you that if she finds out some other way, then she won't.
Why don't you tell us about your product?<eos> Can I get a black coffee?<eos> Make it two of whatever he's having.<eos> You here to tell me what a dick I am for going behind your back again?<eos> No, I'm here to find out what time your meeting with Palmer is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> Well, I wasn't gonna do it without your permission.<eos> Which means there is no meeting with Palmer.<eos> Well, I'm giving you my permission.
Of course they will.<eos> These guys are vultures.<eos> Well, then shouldn't I go with you so we can stop it?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Then trust when they make me the offer, I'm gonna act outraged, tell them we'll never do business with them, and they'll give us an extra 5% right there.<eos> - So what'd you think?<eos> - I thought it was impressive.<eos> Then I think you're easily impressed.<eos> - You didn't like it?
Where have you been since that meeting?<eos> I've been doing some thinking.<eos> And I've been wondering if my partner sold me out all day.<eos> Well... I hate to break it to you, Benjamin, but that's actually the opposite of what happened.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean... they don't want to make us an offer.<eos> In fact, they don't want anything to do with the Donna.<eos> - It's my fault, isn't it?<eos> - Benjamin...<eos> You don't have to protect my feelings.
I gotta say, the world's gonna be a better place with you as a lawyer.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause we just strong-armed some jackass into doing what what we want? No, because you did what it took to get those miners what they deserve.<eos> Speaking of which, you wanna come with me after this?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - To tell those miners that the world's best lawyer just got them what they deserve.<eos> - Second best.<eos> - Potato/potahto.<eos> Seriously, Mike, you go tell them.<eos> Besides, after that, you've got some preparing to do for that hearing.

Welcome back to the Bar, Mike.<eos> Thanks, Harvey.<eos> Actually, you weren't really in the Bar, ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd ask how your day was, but last time I did that, it didn't go very well.<eos> Tara, can I be honest with you?<eos> Of course.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> It's part of getting to know each other...<eos> I told you that.
Yeah.<eos> I'd ask how your day was, but last time I did that, it didn't go very well.<eos> Tara, can I be honest with you?<eos> Of course.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> It's part of getting to know each other...<eos> I told you that.<eos> Just not sure that this is what you had in mind.<eos> Louis, what is going on?<eos> The other day, when I didn't want to tell you what I was upset about, I was trying to figure out a way to get Mike Ross into the Bar.
I mean I knew Mike was a fraud before he was arrested.<eos> And I didn't just know.<eos> When I found out about him, instead of going to the police, or going to the Bar, I leveraged it to get my name on the wall.<eos> Tara, say something.<eos> Say what?<eos> You just told me you found out you were working with a criminal and you turned it into a promotion.<eos> I know that, but you said we should get to know each other.<eos> What do you want me to say, Louis?<eos> I didn't know what your favorite movie was.<eos> Or what side of the bed you like.
Tara, say something.<eos> Say what?<eos> You just told me you found out you were working with a criminal and you turned it into a promotion.<eos> I know that, but you said we should get to know each other.<eos> What do you want me to say, Louis?<eos> I didn't know what your favorite movie was.<eos> Or what side of the bed you like.<eos> But I thought at least I knew what kind of man you were.<eos> Tara, please.<eos> This is the thing I'm most ashamed about in my life and I'm telling you to show you that I'm never gonna hide anything from you.

I was up front about it with you and with him.<eos> You were up front about it with everybody and then you wanted me to be up front with you about things.<eos> And now you're looking at me like I'm a monster!<eos> You know what?<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it...<eos> Well, where are you going?<eos> I'm sleeping at my place tonight.<eos> Look, Tara, please.<eos> If I knew that you were gonna react this way, I never would have told you any of this.
That's it.<eos> That's it...<eos> Well, where are you going?<eos> I'm sleeping at my place tonight.<eos> Look, Tara, please.<eos> If I knew that you were gonna react this way, I never would have told you any of this.<eos> But you did tell me, Louis.<eos> Good night.<eos> Tara, wait.<eos> I'll give you a call when I've had a chance to figure things out.
- I know I can't.<eos> But I gotta get a couple days off for the hearing, which means I gotta tell him something.<eos> Louis, what are you doing here?<eos> I hope you don't mind I stopped by.<eos> I had to see you.<eos> I couldn't sleep at all last night.<eos> - Neither could I.<eos> - Tara, please.<eos> I know we had a fight, but you told me you wanted to get to know me.<eos> And I swear, what I told you was the worst thing I've ever done.
But I'm not sure I want to be with a man who thinks there's ever a reason to treat me that way.<eos> - Tara...<eos> - I'm sorry, Louis.<eos> They're waiting for me in the conference room.<eos> I told you I'll call, and I will call.<eos> - Nathan.<eos> - Mike.<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just wanted to give you this.
Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> That's not a joke.<eos> Wait, you're telling me that $50,000 can really make that big a difference to the clinic?<eos> I'm telling you that I know in corporate law, money doesn't matter unless it's in the millions, but... here, $50,000 makes all the difference in the world.<eos> Well, in that case, Nathan, I've been working here seven days a week since I started, and I've got some personal stuff that I need to...<eos> Stop right there.<eos> Look.<eos> You just bought me 30 days rent.<eos> The least I can do is give you a few days back.

First of all, that's Greenpeace.<eos> And second of all, I took the day off so I could prepare for the Character and Fitness Committee.<eos> That means you're taking whatever that hitch is gonna be seriously.<eos> - You know I am.<eos> - That's what I like to hear.<eos> Because I don't want somebody working here who doesn't listen to my advice.<eos> Harvey, I still don't think you understand.<eos> When this thing is over, I am not coming back here.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - I told you, I want to do good.

There's a whole process to get on that committee.<eos> There's no way you just happened to be in the pipeline.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> But when a member takes leave, he has the right to appoint his replacement.<eos> And Walter Samson appointed me.<eos> You think I'm not gonna find out whatever bullshit you did to get this guy to drop out?<eos> Be my guest, because if Mike is going before that hearing, that means you did something too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to tell you you might as well cancel this hearing, save us all a lot of time.
Which is why we're gonna make sure that doesn't happen by getting her kicked off that panel.<eos> And how exactly are we gonna do that?<eos> We're gonna start by you telling me everything there is to know about Walter Samson.<eos> Well, then we might as well give up right now, because Walter Samson is as clean as they come.<eos> - No one is that clean.<eos> - Well, this guy is.<eos> And I didn't sign on...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You said you were in on this.<eos> And I'm telling you right now, you still are.

Last winter, Mr. Ross pled guilty to defrauding the citizens of New York.<eos> Therefore, I propose we reject his application right now because Mr. Ross is a felon and the New York Bar does not accept felons.<eos> Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the new board member, you do.<eos> Not only does the Bar accept felons, but years ago, this very committee admitted Neal Wiesner, a man who spent years in prison for attempted murder.<eos> Now, Ms. Gibbs may think my crime is worse than attempted murder, but I don't think it's worth throwing away 140 years of precedent by not even allowing me to make my case.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - What does it look like<eos> I'm doing? I'm watching my money go down the toilet.<eos> Well, it looks to me like I paid you to do a job, and you're sitting here doing this.

Some truth in the night.<eos> Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.<eos> And I knew I'd have to watch that happen over and over and over.<eos> So when that opportunity presented itself for the second time, I took it.<eos> Because I knew it would never come along again.<eos> - You don't know that, Mike.<eos> - I do know that.<eos> So you can say no if you want to, but don't say I haven't changed.<eos> Because the Mike you met that night in prison never would have told you the truth just now.
And the reason I asked Stu and Benjamin to be here was so that you'd know I didn't shit the bed.<eos> Are you telling me you couldn't get them to back off the lawsuit?<eos> He's telling you we won't be able to patent The Donna at all.<eos> - What?<eos> - Donna.<eos> They weren't authorized to let us partner with them.<eos> That's what I sent you over there to take care of.<eos> I know, and then they said they would fight us to the ends of the earth.<eos> So I pulled out every trick in the book.<eos> And I got them to make you an offer.
He didn't roll over, Donna.<eos> I went over it with Benjamin, and we can't get the overlap under 30%.<eos> I also ran it by my own attorney and he was shocked at what Louis was able to get us.<eos> So you're telling me you want to take it?<eos> We do.<eos> But The Donna wouldn't even exist without you, and we're partners, so if you don't want to, then we won't.<eos> I'm gonna need to think about it.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Liberty Rail.<eos> I tried to give it to you once before.
I'm gonna need to think about it.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Liberty Rail.<eos> I tried to give it to you once before.<eos> You wouldn't take it.<eos> You said it should come without strings.<eos> Well, here it is.<eos> No strings. It's still got strings, and you know it.<eos> You want me to let Mike in the Bar.<eos> I do, but I'm giving you this whether you do that or not.

Your message said it was urgent.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is there a problem with the settlement?<eos> I'm here to tell you the truth.<eos> - Truth about what?<eos> - I made a deal.<eos> A quid pro quo that we would handle the miners' case in exchange for the chance to be admitted to the Bar.<eos> Are you goddamn kidding me?<eos> I asked you point blank if something was going on, and you lied to my face?<eos> Nathan, I'm sorry. But I didn't want to tell you until there was something to tell.

Wait.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Did you hear what he said?<eos> He lied. Not once, not twice...<eos> I don't care, because we need him.<eos> - We don't need him...<eos> - Sophia needed him, and she got me, and look what happened.<eos> Yeah, Nathan, that was some shady shit he pulled, but you gotta be blind if you can't see that he actually cares.<eos> And I don't remember us beating down a place like Velocity Data before he got here.<eos> So if it's all the same to you, I'd like him to stay.
So if it's all the same to you, I'd like him to stay.<eos> Well, it's not all the same to me, Oliver.<eos> It's up to me.<eos> Not to the person that kept it from me as much as Mike did.<eos> He didn't keep it from you, Nathan.<eos> He said that if I didn't tell you, he would.<eos> So here I am.<eos> And I know I don't have a leg to stand on, but...<eos> I'd like to stay.<eos> Monday morning, you better start putting your money where your mouth is and find us another $50,000 case.
- Sure, Harvey.<eos> I don't know how much you know about what's going on with Mike's hearing.<eos> Enough to know that look on your face means it's not going well.<eos> It's not. And I may have a way to change it, but I wanted to run it by my partner first, because it may mean that I need a little time off.<eos> What do you mean, "a little time off"?<eos> I mean Gibbs offered me a deal.<eos> Mike goes on record admitting I knew he was a fraud, she'll vote to let him in the Bar.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You do that, it won't be a little time off.<eos> You'll get disbarred.
And we can argue that he said that just to appease Gibbs.<eos> Bullshit. You do this, two out of three names on that wall will be gone, and I won't be able to keep this firm going.<eos> And if you can't, we'll have done it for Mike.<eos> Zane will hire you.<eos> I don't want to go to Zane's.<eos> I want to do what we said we were gonna do and rebuild this place together.<eos> Louis, I owe him. Well, what about what you owe me?<eos> You said we were partners.<eos> We are partners.<eos> Which is why I came to you with this.
No, you didn't come to ask my permission.<eos> You came to tell me that you were gonna do this.<eos> And what if I did?<eos> Then you're not just an asshole.<eos> You're an idiot, because there's no way<eos> Mike Ross ever agrees to trading you for him.<eos> - Well, I'll make him agree.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> Mike.<eos> Harvey, whatever deal she's offering you, I'm not gonna take it.
Because I didn't fly all the way down here to strong-arm that woman.<eos> And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.<eos> You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off on his own.<eos> That's not a strategy; It's a prayer.<eos> Louis, I already admitted that I knew about Mike, and I reminded her of her own compassion.<eos> That's the best we're going to do.<eos> You know they could disbar you for that.
Thanks for calling.<eos> You're in.<eos> My God.<eos> It happened.<eos> I'm gonna go get us some champagne.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you for flying in.<eos> I wouldn't miss this for the world.<eos> Hey.<eos> You said you had to go to the bathroom a half hour ago, but you never came back for your champagne.
- And? - She just called when Harvey was giving us the news about Mike.<eos> Left a 15-second voicemail.<eos> I'm afraid to listen to it.<eos> Louis...<eos> She's either gonna tell me that she never wants to see me again or she wants to make up.<eos> Do you want me to listen for you?<eos> No. But I'd like it if you stay with me while I do.<eos> Of course.<eos> What's that?<eos> I wanted to give you a present.

I'm offering you a deal.<eos> One for you, one for me.<eos> You can save the spotted owls, stop global warming, and help as many damsels in distress as you like.<eos> And the good news is, you'll be doing it from here.<eos> What makes you think I'd take you up on that?<eos> Because here's the thing, Mike.<eos> You wanna be here, and you know it.<eos> That's not true...<eos> I saw the look on your face when you strong-armed Palmer and you took on Seidel and every other talented attorney you've beaten over the years.<eos> And I told you this once before.

- What? I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year. I wanna fund it for two.<eos> And while we're at it, I want some left over for a little something nice for me and the wife-to-be.<eos> - That's all it's gonna take?<eos> - Not even close. I wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> Any case I want to bring the clinic on to, I can.<eos> Done.<eos> Anyone I want to bring over from the clinic, I can.<eos> Louis doesn't get a say, you don't get a say, no Harvard rule.<eos> Done.<eos> And there's one more thing, and you're not gonna like it.
Anyone I want to bring over from the clinic, I can.<eos> Louis doesn't get a say, you don't get a say, no Harvard rule.<eos> Done.<eos> And there's one more thing, and you're not gonna like it.<eos> You are not getting my office.<eos> Yes, I am. And I will tell you why.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> And she's not coming back.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.
I'm offering you a deal... One for you, one for me.
I'm offering you a deal... One for you, one for me.<eos> You are not getting my office.<eos> Yes, I am 'cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.
You told me that you're now head of the firm.<eos> I am... i just haven't told Louis yet.<eos> I think this may have been a mistake.<eos> You don't think I've had fantasies that one day you'd take me in your arms and kiss me?<eos> Those fantasies weren't of a man who's still too afraid to take control of a firm that bears his name.<eos> I'm not giving up my associates!<eos> That's enough.<eos> Donna asked for a seat at the table, and I gave her one.<eos> You don't make her goddamn senior partner.<eos> If Jessica were here, she'd tell you to do the same exact thing.

- I saw the sun rise. - Really?<eos> It takes something pretty special to get me up before 7:00 A.M.<eos> As I recall, I was pretty special last night.<eos> There... you surprised me again.<eos> You know, the truth is I'm a little surprised by all this myself.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I mean, you disappear for nearly a year, and then, one day, you suddenly show up in a '57 Chevy... '72 Ferrari, but, yeah.<eos> And you sweep me off my feet.<eos> And I liked it.<eos> That's good 'cause I wasn't sure you would.
You don't really know me yet.<eos> Till yesterday, we'd spent about 50 hours together, and we'd spent most of them talking about you.<eos> I know, and that's what I love about our relationship.<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - Paula...<eos> Before you say what I think you're gonna say, let me say you may know me better than anyone.<eos> And now I'd like to get to know you too.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> I guess what I'm trying to say is I acted irrationally, but please, Tara, if you could just give me another chance...<eos> I promise you that I will never let you down again.
- You must be thrilled.<eos> - I am. And I know what you're thinking... How can a secretary be made a partner?<eos> But... I wasn't thinking that, Donna.<eos> I know how hard you work and how much you mean to this firm and everyone in it.<eos> Thanks, Katrina.<eos> You're welcome. I'll let you get back to work.<eos> All I'm saying is I think you're rushing it.<eos> And I'm saying that, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave their statue up in the square.<eos> You tear it the hell down.<eos> You don't think that this sends a message that you have something to prove?
You mean the guy who played superman?<eos> That was George Reeves. Arthur Reeves founded this firm.<eos> And when Gordon, schimdt, and Van dyke ran him out of town, they didn't just tear his name off the wall.<eos> They called his biggest client and told them to pack up their shit and find another firm.<eos> - What's your point? - My point is they wanted the world to know there was a new sheriff in town, and the message that sends isn't that you have something to prove...<eos> It's that you're in charge.<eos> And you're staying that way.<eos> Hope you don't mind I took the Liberty of hanging that.<eos> It's your last official act as my secretary.<eos> I told you once before I wouldn't leave you
Because Jessica's gone, so now I can.<eos> - Then make me name partner.<eos> - What? This isn't about Jessica's gone so now you can...<eos> This is about Jessica's gone, so now you wanna tell the world that you're not her.<eos> And that's not about hiring me.<eos> That's about getting my client.<eos> Alex, this is a win/win.<eos> I don't poach.<eos> You come over. We have fun.<eos> But I'm not gonna just give you the run of the place.
The only problem with that is I went to 15 firms before I came to you, and none of them would take my case because of that photo.<eos> You were my last hope, Mr. Ross, and now you're telling me we're gonna lose.<eos> No, Harry.<eos> I am promising you that I will not cost you this case.<eos> Good, Donna, you're here.<eos> I'm gonna need someone to draw up a contract for Alex, and...<eos> Harvey, I don't think we should drop Jim Reynolds.<eos> - I understand what you're doing, but I think that maybe you're rushing into it.<eos> I'm not rushing, Donna.<eos> I'm being decisive. Then you need to tell Jessica before you do it.
Tell Jessica?<eos> I'm doing this to show people that this is my firm now.<eos> Asking mommy's permission isn't part of the plan.<eos> Well, is it also part of the plan that you signal to the rest of our longterm clients that you'll just throw them over for the next big thing?<eos> Where the hell is this coming from? What do you mean "where is this coming from?"<eos> You made me a partner.<eos> I'm saying my piece. That's what the meeting was for.<eos> Well, maybe you didn't notice, but you and Louis were having a private meeting.<eos> Well, you know what, Donna?<eos> You had the balls to ask for a seat at the table.

You go get pfizer.<eos> But don't you bring in some Johnnycomelately and water down the name of this firm.<eos> You don't give a shit about watering down this firm.<eos> You're scared of watering down your place in it.<eos> I'm not afraid of a thirdrate lawyer.<eos> Bullshit, you're afraid and you're jealous.<eos> And this entire firm knows it. Now there's no need to be jealous because he's not coming here.<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> - Well, then why don't you try reading the bylaws?<eos> Because in order to make someone name partner, you need my vote or Jessica's vote, and if you think she is going to ditch her oldest client to bring in someone she doesn't even know, you're out of your goddamn mind.
I... i wanted to get<eos> - your permission first.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not? - Because I made a deal with Mike, not you.<eos> Now, you wanna tell me what's really going on here?<eos> Because Mike's not giving away his first case unless he's in a coma.<eos> The lawyer on the other side outed Mike as a fraud.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - He brought out Mike's Harvard diploma, and he prejudiced the judge.<eos> So Mike thinks if he hands the case over to you, he takes that weapon out of their hands.
I don't have time to change my image.<eos> Look, if I lose this case, the only article that's gonna get written is that I never should have been able to practice law in the first place.<eos> Yeah, well, if you can't figure out a way to win without Rachel's help, then maybe I shouldn't have brought you back in the first place because I've had about enough of having every employee I have question every decision I make.<eos> I thought we were gonna meet at the restaurant.<eos> I got down here early.<eos> Manhattan doesn't have views like this.<eos> Thanks for making the time to see me, Jessica.<eos> I will always make time to see you, Harvey.<eos> Especially after you've flown all the way out here to put the screws to me.<eos> Louis called you, didn't he?
Then you've already heard his side of the story... and I don't need to hear yours.<eos> - Jessica...<eos> - Harvey, I understand wanting to make a statement, but, you rush into this, the only statement you're making is that you're not ready.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> My first act as managing partner, and you're cutting my legs out from under me.<eos> I'm not cutting anything out.<eos> You can't give out name partner like it's Halloween candy.<eos> That sounds like I'm a child...<eos> Harvey, you do this, what's gonna happen the next time you wanna bring someone over?<eos> I'll tell you what happens... You're going to get rolled because you haven't thought this through.
I'll tell you what happens... You're going to get rolled because you haven't thought this through.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think this has nothing to do with my decision.<eos> You're pissed I'm dumping your client for a better one.<eos> No, Harvey, that's something you'd be pissed about because you've never been able to look at the big picture.<eos> Well, how's this for big picture?<eos> I think you want it both ways.<eos> And what the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means you want to live here and keep your name on my wall because you're not ready to let go of my firm.<eos> Well, if that's how you really feel, then take my name off your goddamn wall, and then you can do whatever the hell you want.
I know.<eos> I'm not saying Donna doesn't deserve a promotion...<eos> I know what she does as much as anyone.<eos> I'm just saying making partner means something, and I'm concerned that being one here won't mean what it used to.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Katrina, being a partner here will mean as much as it always has.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> I hope you came here to tell me you got everything straightened out.<eos> I came here to tell you that the deal's off the table.
You can let me know in the morning.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I wasn't really gonna make name partner in a year.<eos> Maybe not ever.<eos> I know.<eos> How?<eos> Because if they were really gonna do it in a year, you would've leveraged them to move it up the second I left your office.<eos> So why didn't you call me on that before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's because I felt like I owe you, or maybe because I wanted to prove to the world that I'm not Jessica.
Don't you dare say that to me.<eos> I'm not doing this for myself.<eos> I'm doing it so that pieces of shit like you never try to use my history against my clients again.<eos> Louis, before you say anything...<eos> Harvey, before you say anything, I just wanna say I'm sorry.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was jealous of Alex coming over here, but not because I'm afraid of another lawyer.<eos> I don't understand. See, Harvey, I know you like to make fun of me, and I know I might not mean as much to you as you mean to me, but you're my friend, and, because I don't have many, that friendship<eos> is important to me.<eos> You don't have to worry about that, Louis.
Really? Yeah, you were right.<eos> We can't water down the firm like that.<eos> You've never knocked before.<eos> And you've never had a door before.<eos> I know, and it's a good thing I do because... you can't be a partner, Donna.<eos> What?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I have to. I made a mistake.<eos> Bullshit, I...<eos> I paid you $500,000.
What?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I have to. I made a mistake.<eos> Bullshit, I...<eos> I paid you $500,000.<eos> You haven't signed the partnership agreement yet, so I can refund your money, and...<eos> I don't want a refund.<eos> I want what we agreed to.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> You are not a lawyer, and being partner at a law firm... It means something, inside the firm and out, which is why I wrote up a new release for you.
You were just tearing the statue down.<eos> Just like you saw me do all those years ago, and I didn't like it because the statue was me.<eos> Well, if it's the same to you, I'd like the statue to stay.<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> - There's one more thing.<eos> - There always is.<eos> I'm still bringing Alex over, only not as a name partner, but pfizer's still insisting we drop Jim Reynolds.<eos> And you want to know if I'm okay with it?<eos> No, I'm letting him go.<eos> I'm just calling you to tell you before I tell him, like I should've done in the first place.
Oh, and find out what, if any, connection either may have to James Gillies.<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm going to have another chat with Mr. Foley.<eos> I'll go to the asylum and see if there's a file on him.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> Yes.<eos> Whether he's insane or just manipulative, he is in custody and of no threat to either of us.<eos> James Gillies remains as dead as ever.<eos> Though I would be interested to hear what Mr. Foley has to say.<eos> Let's meet back at the hotel later and I'll tell you all about it.
Welcome to the Murdoch Trap, Detective.<eos> We are going to have so much fun!<eos> I went to the asylum.<eos> There's no record of Mr. Foley.<eos> William, are you alright?<eos> He knows things, Julia.<eos> He knows how I met Gillies, what he did to Robert Perry...<eos> He even used the phrase "We're going to have so much fun."<eos> Wasn't that on his filmed confession?<eos> William, everything he told you could have been gleaned from newspapers and court transcripts.
Veronica, who took you from your bed last night?<eos> Was it a man, or a woman?<eos> - A man.<eos> - A man.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> No.<eos> What did the man look like?<eos> I never saw him.<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> Veronica, did this man hurt you in any way?
It just makes a crackling sound.<eos> See, I told you.<eos> Hello, City Morgue.<eos> - It's working now.<eos> - Julia.<eos> - William?<eos> - Meet me back at the hotel.<eos> Right now?<eos> Are you finished at the Bowden House?<eos> Meet me back at the hotel and I'll tell you all about it.
What have I learned, after 34 games?<eos> I've learned that he likes it when I flirt.<eos> And I like it when he lets me win.<eos> We're a match made in heaven.<eos> It reminds me of a poem I read once.<eos> "You fit into me like a hook into an eye a fish hook an open eye"<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> Those were all destroyed.<eos> Some of us retain an appreciation for the old things.<eos> I thought you might like to read it.
Some of us retain an appreciation for the old things.<eos> I thought you might like to read it.<eos> It's not allowed.<eos> It is with me.<eos> I used to buy magazines like this at the airport.<eos> I read them when I got my hair highlighted.<eos> Now the models all look insane.<eos> Like zoo animals.<eos> Unaware they're about to go extinct.<eos> "Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.

- So cute.<eos> - He's married.<eos> - He does not act married.<eos> - No, they never do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Blessed day.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to be?<eos> No.<eos> Must be nice.<eos> Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll do it this afternoon after the shopping.<eos> May as well strike while the iron is hot.<eos> Will you bring that in for me?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> You know, she's even started smiling now?<eos> Oh, it's so cute.<eos> And she sticks out her tongue sometimes like this.<eos> You really shouldn't talk about that stuff, Ofwarren.
That's not good for me.<eos> That's not good?<eos> Oh, that's a bummer.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll try it.<eos> I'll try it once.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's really nice of you. Yeah, I'm a giver.<eos> All clear.<eos> You should go and lie down now.
Come on, this way.<eos> Your mistress might like them.<eos> Hi.<eos> I know what they did to you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - Ofglen.<eos> - I'm not Ofglen.<eos> I know.<eos> Just, it's hard to keep track.<eos> Offred, you should come see the lilies.
What we had was real.<eos> It's just complicated.<eos> Let me know when you un-complicate it.<eos> - At last. - Isaac Frost.<eos> I could hardly wait to meet you.<eos> Cool logo.<eos> Is that your company?<eos> Congregations need somewhere to congregate.<eos> Don't make a move until I figure out just what the hell we're walking into.<eos> Whatever it is you're going through, we go through it together.
I'll be fine.<eos> And Hollow Sky?<eos> Our investors are getting anxious.<eos> Everyone who has walked through those gates did so because they believed.<eos> I need you to believe too.<eos> By the end of today, we'll have an answer to life's greatest mystery.<eos> Tomorrow, we share it with the world.<eos> Prometheus shared fire with the world... and a bird ate his liver for all of eternity.<eos> When they write the book detailing our achievement here today, maybe don't mention that.<eos> She gave you that, didn't she?
We've gotta get across.<eos> You have to get me across.<eos> Across to where?<eos> Look, there's nothing on the other side.<eos> There is!<eos> There has to be!<eos> We just can't see it yet.<eos> You!<eos> You can reveal it to us.<eos> You were meant to show us the way.
When I blow up the bridge... you die.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I had you in my hands... and I lost you.<eos> I thought it was a memory, but it wasn't.<eos> It just didn't happen yet.<eos> Holden, we're running out of time.<eos> I watched you fall.<eos> We can't let those things cross over.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> This is what you meant to do.
See you soon.<eos> I owe you big.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to thank me, Matthews.<eos> - I just do what...<eos> - The universe tells me.<eos> I know.<eos> So...<eos> I've got some questions.<eos> I'm not sure how much Willa's told you or what you think you saw back there.
Except I missed the exit.<eos> Help.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> Holden.<eos> Help me.<eos> Charlie Singer?<eos> You got a sec?<eos> Still rocking that jacket?<eos> All you need now is a big yellow hat and a monkey.
Fifteen's a tough age.<eos> You were no different.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, you ran away before I could say a proper goodbye.<eos> Yeah, you shot at me.<eos> And?<eos> How is the boy wonder?<eos> Is he still breathing?<eos> That's sort of why I'm here.<eos> I... want to help you.
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> How was your trip?<eos> I was in Mexico to coordinate a trade delegation.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> You don't need to worry about this.
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> How was your trip?<eos> I was in Mexico to coordinate a trade delegation.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> You don't need to worry about this.<eos> We've got good men working on it.<eos> Don't you ever touch me like that, when she's there.<eos> I didn't mind it.<eos> I don't think you did either.
Cross my heart.<eos> And hope to die?<eos> Hope to die.<eos> All right, girls.<eos> Two lines!<eos> Best behavior!<eos> Praised be.<eos> It's like a dream.<eos> I think I went to a Bat Mitzvah here once.<eos> They won't let you speak.
And now, for our guests, we have a very special surprise.<eos> It is my honor to present to you the children of Gilead.<eos> All brought forth in this district by our Handmaids.<eos> Looks like Waterford's gonna get his trade deal.<eos> What did they talk about last night?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You didn't hear anything?<eos> Schedules, dates?<eos> Why do you care so much?
You should be coming with me.<eos> So, what are your plans for today?<eos> I'm going to make this place a home.<eos> Tired?<eos> The opposite, actually.<eos> I don't think that I'll be able to get to sleep.<eos> I'm just glad that it went so well.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You, too.<eos> You should discuss with the other Commanders.
Offred. If they find us here.<eos> If they find us...<eos> Offred. If they find us together, I'm gonna get sent to the colonies.<eos> You're an Eye.<eos> You're untouchable.<eos> It's... That's not true.<eos> Fuck you, Nick.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> They don't rape you, do they?<eos> He doesn't come in here once a month and read you a little scripture and stick his cock up your ass?
It's... That's not true.<eos> Fuck you, Nick.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> They don't rape you, do they?<eos> He doesn't come in here once a month and read you a little scripture and stick his cock up your ass?<eos> I said I was happy!<eos> Offred.<eos> Don't call me that!<eos> It is not my name.<eos> Can I get you a glass of water?
You're going to bleed to death.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> - Shit. - It's not his jacket.<eos> I topped off the tank and we got some ammo but there are patrols on the highway.<eos> We should move on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Help me with him.<eos> Grab what you can.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> You know at some point, you're gonna have to stop collecting strays.
I'm Luke.<eos> Antibiotics.<eos> That wound was full of crap.<eos> Gotta stay on this drip until we reach Canada or you're gonna go septic.<eos> No.<eos> I need...<eos> I need to get out...<eos> There are Guardians all over.<eos> We need to get some miles on them.<eos> You need meds and rest.
I got it.<eos> No, no, I got...<eos> You sure?<eos> You might be able to get a ride out of Cutler.<eos> It's 10 miles south.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Boat leaves soon as it's dark.<eos> Our dock is a half mile down river, if you change your mind.<eos> Let me show you something.
Our dock is a half mile down river, if you change your mind.<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> The town fought back.<eos> They tried to hide the fertile women in here.<eos> The Guardians took them and strung everyone else up.<eos> There's one of these in every town.<eos> This is what they do to people who fight back.<eos> It's the only thing I can do.<eos> The US government has people in Canada.<eos> They can help you find them, maybe even get them out.
Hey! It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> This a free enterprise.<eos> That'll do.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Let's move, let's move.<eos> Stow it all away.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Grab that line. Come on, I'm gonna help you down.
He doesn't want them to grow up in this screwedup world.<eos> Who can blame Him?<eos> There's nothing you can do about it.<eos> Now, there you're wrong.<eos> There's this group that wants to set things right, clean up this country.<eos> We have chapters in 30 states.<eos> I head up one of them.<eos> We're called the Sons of Jacob.<eos> Come with me to a meeting.<eos> I think you'll like what you hear.
Now, first, we're gonna have to do something about those legs.<eos> Once a month, Rita waits outside while I shave my legs in the tub.<eos> We're not to be trusted with razors, not for longer than necessary, for obvious reasons.<eos> This must be a special occasion.<eos> Hold still.<eos> Doesn't that feel nice?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's good at this.<eos> He's done it before.<eos> You'll need this, too.
- Evening.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Commander Waterford.<eos> Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Have a good night, sir.<eos> Clear.<eos> Let 'em go.<eos> Let 'em through.<eos> You're very quiet.<eos> Aren't you enjoying yourself?
There.<eos> Doesn't she look beautiful?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This way.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Don't gawk.<eos> You'll give yourself away.<eos> Try to act natural.<eos> Don't lose your nerve.<eos> It's like walking in the past, don't you think?
You'll give yourself away.<eos> Try to act natural.<eos> Don't lose your nerve.<eos> It's like walking in the past, don't you think?<eos> I thought these kinds of places were forbidden.<eos> Officially.<eos> Unofficially?<eos> We turn a blind eye.<eos> Everyone's human, after all.<eos> Now, let's get you a drink.
Give us another round here. Who are all these people?<eos> Officers, senior officials.<eos> And foreign visitors, of course, to stimulate diplomacy and business.<eos> I meant the women.<eos> All women who couldn't assimilate.<eos> Some were working girls before.<eos> That one there, she's a sociology professor.<eos> Or she was.<eos> We've got lawyers, a CEO, a few journalists.<eos> I'm told you can have quite a good conversation with some of them if what you feel like is talking.
Some of the guests have Sleeping Beauty fantasies.<eos> But the girls use it, too.<eos> They'll spike the guys' drinks, go through their phone after they pass out.<eos> The Eyes thank you for your service.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, it's from the mistress' garden.<eos> It's fresh.<eos> Stick around, I'll make you that pesto that got me a James Beard nomination.
I can't trust him.<eos> We've been hearing things from other districts.<eos> Purges. Could just be rumors, I don't know.<eos> No one's made a move yet here, but I can't help feeling there's a target on my back.<eos> Well, I suppose that's what happens when you're the boss.<eos> You do understand me, don't you?<eos> So...<eos> What do you think of our little club?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> I thought you'd enjoy it.

That's it.<eos> Look, forget about escaping.<eos> This is Gilead.<eos> No one gets out. Luke got out!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank God.<eos> But he isn't us, and he isn't in here.<eos> We're alone, June.<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> You need to go.
Talk...<eos> Talk to me, Nick.<eos> I don't know anything about you, you know.<eos> Nick, you won't tell me anything.<eos> So, I don't know anything.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> Jesus, Nick.<eos> Fuck, is this it?<eos> Is this it?<eos> Is this enough for you, this bullshit life?
Nick, you won't tell me anything.<eos> So, I don't know anything.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> Jesus, Nick.<eos> Fuck, is this it?<eos> Is this it?<eos> Is this enough for you, this bullshit life?<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> You want to polish his car and once in a while just try to get a Handmaid pregnant?<eos> Is that enough for you?
Wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What?<eos> My name is Nick Blaine.<eos> I'm from Michigan.<eos> Well, under His eye, Guardian Blaine.<eos> Offred.<eos> Welcome home, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I brought you something.
Black van, feet first.<eos> This is Gilead.<eos> No one gets out.<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> I thought we could just be together.<eos> You know I had to go with him last night, right?<eos> You know I didn't have a choice.<eos> I don't have any choice.<eos> We can't do this anymore.<eos> Is this enough for you, this bullshit life?
Great.<eos> Tonight would be a good time to go.<eos> Tonight?<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to tell you something.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Well, you shouldn't be out of your room.
Not now.<eos> You're right.<eos> It can wait.<eos> Hold on.<eos> So?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> I just can't stop thinking about when we went out.<eos> Our adventure.<eos> Enjoyed that, did you?
I guess I'll have to think of a way to thank you.<eos> I'll think of something.<eos> Sir.<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> Coming up to the checkpoint.<eos> You're no fun. Nick's no fun, is he?<eos> ‐<eos> No, Nick just needs to chill.<eos> You heard her, Nick.<eos> You just need to chill.
No, you're Ofdaniel now.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> Did you like that?
No.<eos> No.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> Did you like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me know next time.<eos> You don't have to be quiet here.
Anybody say anything about Waterford's Handmaid?<eos> Why? Is she trouble?<eos> Nope.<eos> Not a word.<eos> Nick.<eos> A driver poking around, asking questions?<eos> Good way to get yourself up on the wall.<eos> Stay here with me.<eos> For old times' sake.<eos> I can make you something else.
So you're a spy now?<eos> I guess.<eos> Not a very good one. I can't seem to get out of the fucking room.<eos> Good, because this is fucking ridiculous.<eos> Risking your life because Alma said so?<eos> Fuckin' Alma?<eos> It's just a package.<eos> It could be anything!<eos> A bomb. Anthrax.<eos> What do you know?
Do not let them grind you down.<eos> You keep your fucking shit together.<eos> You fight!<eos> I was doing all right until I saw you again.<eos> She left?<eos> Good, she's a degenerate.<eos> Pull yourself together.<eos> We're going.<eos> It's late.<eos> You should get some sleep.
I promise.<eos> Bye.<eos> May the Lord keep you in His mercy.<eos> You stupid girl.<eos> This way, Commander Putnam.<eos> Hopefully, he'll only receive an admonishment.<eos> Let's pray that you won't bear any of the consequences.<eos> You think what happened is my fault?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Let me show you how.
The Commissioner asked me to come and see you.<eos> We were hoping we could maybe borrow you.<eos> - Borrow me?<eos> - He was wondering if you can help with a new case.<eos> Well, it's more of an old case, but...<eos> - I'll explain on the way.<eos> - Hm, OK.<eos> Well, always happy to oblige.<eos> - Suppose I'd better smarten myself up.<eos> - You might need to iron a shirt.
One only.<eos> Cheers, sir.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You know what we need?<eos> More willpower?<eos> A grown-up.<eos> Wouldn't hurt.<eos> Remember when you were little? You were so fascinated by the stars - you wouldn't let me close your bedroom curtains.<eos> - I remember.<eos> And on cloudy nights I used to tell you there were no stars because the batteries had run out.
- Belonging to who?<eos> Grace Matlock.<eos> When did you first see them?<eos> Your fingerprints are all over them.<eos> She showed them to me the day before she died.<eos> I couldn't believe she did something like that.<eos> But, then again, she was like a dog with a bone when she wanted something.<eos> All my life she tried to force me into things, tell me what to do, make decisions for me.<eos> I'd had enough.<eos> I'm telling you, Gracey, he'll never change.
You understand me?<eos> Don't worry, Dwayne.<eos> I understand you.<eos> - Good. - Mm.<eos> You don't want Catherine to become mayor, because you won't be able to buy your cheap rum any more.<eos> Hey!<eos> There's no need to put it like that, OK?<eos> So how should I put it?<eos> What's your problem?<eos> - What do you care who I vote for?
Yours don't really.<eos> Well...<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Straight up.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Straight up.<eos> Cool.<eos> Do you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?
Yeah. I do.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I had one today.<eos> Me, too, see?<eos> - They're a real treat because they combine two things that are different, but together they're beautiful.<eos> So I'm saying...<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm saying do you want to jam?<eos> That verse isn't about being in love.<eos> It's about being so in it that you... you don't even care that it's raining.
All right. Cool. Rob.<eos> John, it's happening.<eos> What is?<eos> My life.<eos> Starting now.<eos> Let's catch up later.<eos> We'll catch up. Yeah, man.<eos> I got something I got to do now.<eos> Yeah. We got you, scumbag.<eos> You don't fucking take shit that doesn't fucking belong to you, bitch!
Okay.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I heard you bragging to everyone how you can comb your own hair.<eos> I can.<eos> Really?<eos> Never seen it.<eos> I just heard you bragging to everyone.<eos> Well, I can.<eos> I don't believe you.
I just heard you bragging to everyone.<eos> Well, I can.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I'd show you, but it's too early to remove my helmet.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I'll just tell everyone that you're a liar, then.<eos> How did you get in here, Ted?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Why did you come in?<eos> Because everyone thinks you're a liar, and I wanted to tell you that because I like you.
How did you get in here, Ted?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Why did you come in?<eos> Because everyone thinks you're a liar, and I wanted to tell you that because I like you.<eos> I didn't believe them, but now I do because you won't comb your own hair.<eos> You smell familiar.<eos> You're probably lying about that.<eos> Watch this.<eos> You see, Ted?<eos> You enjoying Luxembourg?
A photo of me under another name.<eos> Yeah. She has it somewhere.<eos> She's going to interview me.<eos> Then if she looks at that thing...<eos> Why would you take that picture?<eos> This thing with the guy, it was making me, I don't know, happy.<eos> I didn't think.<eos> I was in the... afternoon spray, I guess.<eos> What? In the what?<eos> That's just when you're... you're feeling good... you don't really know what else is going on around you so much.
So I'd like you to spend time tonight with some professional sex workers.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yep.<eos> Two tickets for 5 p.m.<eos> Is there beer on the boat?<eos> Yes, there is a bar, yes.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You'll like this boat, man.
El-Mashad's wife was supposed to take it today.<eos> She's watching Tangled in her room.<eos> His brother's here, same as me.<eos> Why is Ed here?<eos> Because things got fucked up.<eos> And the Bag Man's on a boat today, same as me.<eos> Why'd you take me today?<eos> The boat?<eos> Because things were getting fucked.<eos> You needed to catch your breath so you could find the bag.
Well, he's still here, and you're still here, and he's still looking for the bag, and you're still looking for the bag.<eos> Go kill him.<eos> John?<eos> I think I'm seeing things, Dad.<eos> I think I started seeing things.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like a hundred people hopping through town here.<eos> They have beer.<eos> There's a little bar inside.<eos> Want me to get you a beer?
Previously on Billions...<eos> Rhoades' misconduct is being investigated.<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> You'll receive full cooperation.<eos> With it, without it, I'll find out what's true.<eos> Know that.<eos> You broke into my computer, opened my files, and read my session notes.<eos> You stole the evidence you needed.
So, you didn't grow up with football?<eos> Oh, I did, but it was on a 24-inch Trinitron knock-off.<eos> TV's great, but you really miss out on being part of something very special.<eos> Yeah, you do... which is why I've been thinking about watching a few more games in person.<eos> Bobby, I don't know where you get your Intel, but it's accurate.<eos> So that franchise is on the block.<eos> It's going to be announced in the next couple of days.<eos> Well, when I become an approved bidder, I hope I can count on your support.<eos> Well, you can.<eos> But the hoops you have to crawl through... they don't give a shit how many zeros are in your bank account.
Chuck, you're a really good dad.<eos> You're a really good mom.<eos> Not every couple can do that, recognize each other in the midst of anger and uncertainty.<eos> That's intimacy.<eos> Let's see if we can keep that going.<eos> - What else is on your minds?<eos> - Money.<eos> The Yale Club is kind of steep.<eos> And we had talked about sharing a satellite apartment.<eos> I'm fine at my sister's, but I think it makes sense for you to get your own place.
Really, it's hard not to notice the shrink sorority eye-lock thing.<eos> Chuck, this is not a conspiracy.<eos> I don't want to speak for Wendy.<eos> I'll just say it felt like you had an emotional response that you didn't share.<eos> Signing a lease... is a commitment.<eos> Do you mean financial?<eos> Do you mean...<eos> I had hoped that this separation wouldn't be permanent enough that it would entail references and credit checks and outlaying security payments, but it'll be fine.<eos> You know, I guess I'll just, uh, sell something.<eos> Chuck, you've got to accept the new reality.
Axe, I've been your wingman for the past three years.<eos> I've been close to the final table every time.<eos> Yeah, which is another way of saying you missed the final table three years running.<eos> You know one of the things that I really like about the NFL?<eos> The cheerleaders?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, when I was 12, yeah.<eos> But I'm all grown now, so I was gonna say the contracts.<eos> No other league gives fewer guarantees.<eos> You can sign for seven years, $120 million.<eos> Yet you shit the bed, they cut you in the spring, you're back knocking on doors again.
You can sign for seven years, $120 million.<eos> Yet you shit the bed, they cut you in the spring, you're back knocking on doors again.<eos> So you're cutting me loose.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say it that way, but yes.<eos> For that little...<eos> Hey.<eos> For Taylor?<eos> Everything I measure myself by has been called into question.<eos> Todd.<eos> This is for you by way of an apology for putting you in an awkward position.
No.<eos> We've done this dance before.<eos> You're gonna want insight into Axe or...<eos> There are lots of villains at the tournament tomorrow.<eos> Axe is only one.<eos> Look, I want to perform at my best.<eos> And like you said, it's scary when you feel the pressure.<eos> I can admit that.<eos> I'm reluctant.<eos> I am offering you a challenge and a chance to redefine yourself in the industry... as independent, separate from Axe in every way.
Okay.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You're playing in the Alpha Cup.<eos> It'll do you good... and me.<eos> Consider it a part of those 168 hours you promised.<eos> I can't promise results.<eos> Competition doesn't bring out my best.<eos> Make a session with Dr. Gus.<eos> Maybe he'll help you with the competition piece.
Bryan has always expected it... and worked for it and Chuck like nothing else in the world mattered.<eos> And lately he's... It feels like if this goes the other way and he gets passed over, his entire purpose is called into question.<eos> Meanwhile, Lonnie has been sent away, called back, and never let it derail him.<eos> He's dogged.<eos> And none of this is being colored by your personal connection to Bryan?<eos> In the past.<eos> This is an advisory conversation, not "Loveline."<eos> Then you should think about yourself and the ways in which you could contribute, given more influence, more control, more access to decision making.<eos> You're right.<eos> Rhoades won't make you head of Crim, but his successor may.
Thanks for your time.<eos> You sure, Chuck?<eos> Oh, I have to.<eos> The Churchill World War II... it's a hell of a set.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong.<eos> I'm very happy to have it.<eos> I'm sure I'll do very well with it, but I remember how long you worked on this.<eos> Well, maybe I can circle back and grab them before they're gone.<eos> If somebody comes in, I have to sell them.<eos> But, you know, a specialty item like this, at this price, they'll probably be sold at the Antiquarian Fair in April, so, if you do come back, I'll give it to you at the carrying cost, okay?
All-in.<eos> Call.<eos> We have two all-ins.<eos> One of these players is going to go home rich.<eos> The other player is going to go home rich, but pissed off.<eos> Gentlemen, flip your cards up, please.<eos> Ooh, top two pair.<eos> Unfortunately, I've got these babies.<eos> You went set-mining against me.<eos> I knew if you'd hit, I'd felt you because you underestimate my strength.
Well, have fun.<eos> How could I not?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> And now we're down to heads-up, Mano a Mano, winner take all.<eos> And then there were two.<eos> Just you and me, hot stuff.<eos> Let's have a five-minute break.<eos> Yeah, Todd!<eos> Tell me you're not enjoying this.
He seems to think that you don't get something out of winning.<eos> He wanted me to pull you from this entire event.<eos> You didn't listen.<eos> Eh, he may not be very good at his job.<eos> You love winning.<eos> I do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I keep going back to why you quit the live game in college.<eos> I didn't like...<eos> I think it's that you didn't like that it put the two things that really fucking matter to you... winning and being thought of as good... in direct conflict.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm not getting a good read on it.<eos> You have any...<eos> That's not your issue.<eos> Really?<eos> It seems to me that it is since that's what stands between me and winning.<eos> No.<eos> Your anger is what stands between you and winning, your inability to De-personalize this competition, and as a result...<eos> My inability?<eos> I didn't pay you to come here and criticize me.
Well, I guess some part of me wanted that, too, and I am going to work on that.<eos> Consider it a job well done.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to the table and put the sword into Axe's little pet.<eos> Hey, don't worry so much, all right?<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> We'll celebrate later tonight.<eos> Will we?<eos> Will we have something to celebrate?<eos> What?<eos> I was about to tell you that, in your confusion about your opponent, you've become easy to read.
That's when I knew I had to get my butt back here.<eos> Got another girl to be on standby for the return flight.<eos> It's not great quality.<eos> Not usable.<eos> I thought the microphone might be too far away, so I took a little... initiative.<eos> ...you know, some of the tension...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Will you help me?<eos> ...I'm sure has been building up, yeah.<eos> I want to show you this getup I have back here.
Neat freak in the streets, chaos in the sheets.<eos> Who would've guessed?<eos> What the portable travel lab... crossdressing hell?<eos> Real slow.<eos> Or I call the cops.<eos> Also I am the cops.<eos> I mean, kind of.<eos> I mean, technically I'm...<eos> Son of a Charlie horse!<eos> Joke's on you, bitch.
They go to Black Rock.<eos> Dark ops, middle of the Baltic Sea, average life expectancy once you get there is like two months.<eos> I'm not giving up on him.<eos> Then you're gonna need me.<eos> They won't transfer him right away.<eos> Any safe house they store him in...<eos> - I have clearance to get us inside.<eos> - And I have a team.<eos> Look, Eliza,<eos> - if you care about Dolls...
Any safe house they store him in...<eos> - I have clearance to get us inside.<eos> - And I have a team.<eos> Look, Eliza,<eos> - if you care about Dolls...<eos> - I do.<eos> Well, that makes two of us.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But you should prepare yourself.
- Long dead.<eos> - Its junk was everywhere.<eos> We don't get to cleanup, that smell's likely to linger round here for weeks.<eos> - We good to go?<eos> - Fine, yes, get out of here.<eos> My.<eos> There's lots more where that came from, Tex.<eos> I'm from Georgia, ma'am.<eos> Your head looks naked.<eos> Why are you sneaking around if you have a security pass?
Having to stare at your gorgeous smile and pretty French braid around the conference table...<eos> Actually, I'm thinking of cutting it.<eos> Think I'll manage.<eos> I don't know what we're gonna find at that trailer park. All I know is with Bobo gone, these revenants are gonna be desperate.<eos> And desperate things make desperate decisions.<eos> - We're not going to the trailer park.<eos> - What is this?<eos> This, Nicole, is for the greater good.<eos> What?<eos> OK, if you want me to trust you, you've gotta tell me the plan.
- Wait, Dolls, where's Dolls?<eos> - Doc's on it!<eos> Hey.<eos> You kept one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No needle, though.<eos> OK.<eos> Don't need it.<eos> No time to be stingy.<eos> You need enough to run.
You kept one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No needle, though.<eos> OK.<eos> Don't need it.<eos> No time to be stingy.<eos> You need enough to run.<eos> Can you please tell her?<eos> I will.<eos> - Dolls, you need to go!
Who are you people?<eos> Really?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Don't talk to him any more.<eos> Cheer up, Wynonna.<eos> I'll sweeten the pot for you.<eos> You play ball, I'll help you break the Earp Curse.<eos> I already know how to break it.<eos> Bobo Del Rey has been dispatched and his revenants are all scattered.<eos> You'll never find and kill them all, not in your lifetime.
I swear on our mother's grave.<eos> Seriously, how stupid do you think we are?<eos> He just... shot her.<eos> God, I hope Nicole got out.<eos> - Car's gone.<eos> - Good.<eos> Good?<eos> How the hell are we gonna get home?<eos> Doc...<eos> Did Dolls... say any... did he tell you to...
God, I hope Nicole got out.<eos> - Car's gone.<eos> - Good.<eos> Good?<eos> How the hell are we gonna get home?<eos> Doc...<eos> Did Dolls... say any... did he tell you to...<eos> - tell me anything?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> I'm sorry you had to reup.
- Car's gone.<eos> - Good.<eos> Good?<eos> How the hell are we gonna get home?<eos> Doc...<eos> Did Dolls... say any... did he tell you to...<eos> - tell me anything?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> I'm sorry you had to reup.<eos> I know how much you hate being one of the good guys.
Oi!<eos> - Stand him on the spot.<eos> That's it.<eos> - Left hand.<eos> Left hand.<eos> Give us your left hand!<eos> Look, pens, yeah?<eos> You... sign your name.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's help you out, you half-wit.
Get out of here, you pervs!<eos> Stop doing your hair.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Gordon Bennett!<eos> - Yeah, Gordon Bennett.<eos> Yeah, Gordon Bennett.<eos> Your first PM already?<eos> You're putting yourself out there.<eos> Am I?<eos> If you need some tips, maybe we could grab a drink later.
No, no, I'll be fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right.<eos> We need the floor plans for the bank.<eos> Look like you've just seen a ghost.<eos> What are you depressing yourself with that crap for?<eos> She was pretty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Know what you got to do?
Mortuary.<eos> - We're looking for Eddie Phillips!<eos> - Check upstairs.<eos> Eddie Phillips!<eos> Nothing down here.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - No.<eos> He said 'Not in those trousers! '<eos> Hello, Suzy.<eos> I'm not sure you should be out working.
Love now, is it?<eos> We're looking for Julie-Ann's boyfriend.<eos> Have you seen him around here recently?<eos> No.<eos> What was Julie-Ann's relationship with Eddie like?<eos> I didn't know him.<eos> Was he violent?<eos> - Have you prepared a long list of questions?<eos> Piss off, love.<eos> Sorry I bothered you.
John?<eos> Is this about some girl he was seeing?<eos> He's fine, Ma.<eos> Here, do us some bacon, will you?<eos> You got anything stronger?<eos> Do I look like a dealer?<eos> Please, man.<eos> Tell me where I can find Eddie, then.<eos> You're not gonna find him.<eos> If you really need something, I can give you an address not far from here.
We've got an address and a car registered to him.<eos> Come in!<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Sir, the Forensic Document Examiner... erm... retrieved a partial number from the pad we found at the hospital.<eos> 0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3.<eos> I'll need your signature so that the GPO can send us a list of possibilities.<eos> I put it in an envelope... with your name on it, sir.<eos> Leave it with me.<eos> - Who's the cripple now, then? - Argh!<eos> You should watch your fucking mouth.
Oh, erm...<eos> Just tell them it's sub judice to discuss it.<eos> George...<eos> Oh, er... thank you for coming, Detective Inspector.<eos> Have there been any developments?<eos> We are chasing several leads, sir.<eos> Oh, well, that's something.<eos> So sad, George.<eos> So very sad.<eos> Erm... let me get you a taxi, Reg.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?<eos> What's that for?<eos> You a superstitious man, Silas?<eos> He's losing his grip on this job.<eos> There's a matching necklace, part of a set.<eos> My God.<eos> - Jane, there's something...<eos> - Yes?<eos> I saw you both earlier.<eos> You should speak to him. If you're serious.
Len!<eos> - He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> - Len...<eos> - He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Len!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You can't go in there.
- He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> - Len...<eos> - He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Len!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You can't go in there.<eos> You can't go in there!
- I'm just saying.<eos> - Both of you, shut up.<eos> Right, gents. I've got teams of Uniforms briefed and ready to go and hunt Clifford and David Bentley.<eos> I suggest you make yourselves useful and join 'em.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jane... come ride with us.<eos> Best thing's to keep busy.<eos> Got you that from the hospital shop.
I suggest you make yourselves useful and join 'em.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jane... come ride with us.<eos> Best thing's to keep busy.<eos> Got you that from the hospital shop.<eos> Can't stand that stuff.<eos> Such gratitude!<eos> You look like you could use it more.
You mean John?<eos> Are you talking about John?<eos> Tell me, David.<eos> What happened?<eos> If it was John... why?<eos> Cos I told her about the job.<eos> I told her about the fucking job and he found out.<eos> It was me who found her body in the car park.<eos> It was me who made the phone call.<eos> David, let me help you.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.<eos> It was me who found her body in the car park.<eos> It was me who made the phone call.<eos> David, let me help you.<eos> Please.<eos> Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.<eos> If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out.<eos> - David, we need to go.<eos> - No.<eos> We can help you.
How about cement floors, no windows and a view of a toilet?<eos> Because that will be home if Von Barlow tells her boyfriend what she heard.<eos> What's her real name again?<eos> Oh, my God. I don't... I don't know.<eos> Linda... something.<eos> I guess. Linda.<eos> Linda, who has "Solsbury Hill" on every single one of her Spotify playlists.<eos> Her heart is going boom-boom-boom.<eos> She could end you.<eos> I don't know how many ways to tell you...
Reg is the husband, Bill is the boy toy.<eos> Huh! Don't wanna share, huh?<eos> Scrooge McDuck.<eos> Hey, turban!<eos> - How do you waterboard someone?<eos> - Join the military.<eos> And they say Muslims ain't funny.<eos> You're a fuckin' riot.<eos> You know, I have worked with many Muslims, many African Americans, I've had nothing but good experiences.<eos> Yeah, nice try and all, but I can't help you here.
Afghanistan?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Morman Miracle Pageant.<eos> He was in some kind of musical.<eos> Once you start scratching the surface on somebody, it's crazy the kind of shit you find.<eos> That's why I try to keep my nails short.<eos> Don't wanna scratch too deep and hit crazy.<eos> Maybe instead of "P" for Piscatella, he filed it under "S" for son of a bitch.<eos> Feeling kind of sweaty.<eos> You feeling sweaty?
Technically, that's a mermaid, not a princess.<eos> Until the end of the stupid movie. Then she's a princess who gave up her voice to chase a man.<eos> He knows how I feel about the fucking mermaid!<eos> And when our girl rises up from the sea, it'll be on her God-given talents, not some magical sea witch's spell.<eos> And she'll know better than to marry outside her race.<eos> Hey! All right, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Uh, Sahar?<eos> You think it would ruin your creation if I took off the princess?<eos> You're not feeling knock-off Tiana?
- I know I would.<eos> - Oh, me, too.<eos> Me three.<eos> Hey! You're supposed to be on my team, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now, go show 'em how it's done, birthday girl.<eos> I suck!<eos> Oh, baby, you don't suck.<eos> Can I show you how to keep your wrist straight?
We're about to begin the séance.<eos> I'm sorry, the what?<eos> We are summoning Poussey's spirit.<eos> You know, making sure there's no unfinished business.<eos> Well, of course there's unfinished business.<eos> She didn't get to live her life.<eos> We... we just wanna offer her some peace.<eos> Well, y'all have fun with y'all pretend time.<eos> Here, Suzanne.<eos> I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.
There are hostages.<eos> It's a women's minimum security prison.<eos> Probably one big Take Back the Night rally.<eos> Maybe less armpit hair.<eos> Do they have razors in there?<eos> Come back in the morning.<eos> On your way out, could you tell Ashley that we need to discuss the...<eos> She... she should just come back in here... Situation.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Are you hungry?
Or both in my cousin April's case.<eos> I thought it'd be like one of those open-minded relationships, you know?<eos> I think you mean open relationship.<eos> They can be quite wonderful...<eos> Don't correct her!<eos> Who asked you anyway?<eos> I only brought it up because I happen to be in one myself.<eos> Of course you are, money bags.<eos> This is different.<eos> When's the last time you had to suck a dick?
Ah! Perfect timing.<eos> I've got lunch ready for you.<eos> Mommy, look.<eos> Aren't they cool?<eos> You let her do that?<eos> You said whatever she wanted.<eos> I meant a bracelet, maybe a purse. Not body mutilation.<eos> Oh, that's a little harsh, don't you think?<eos> Sahar, can you please take Farah into the den?<eos> You need to relax.
"You've got another love, and I know it..."<eos> You're taking too damn long.<eos> Oh, yo! "She'll cry and wonder.<eos> What went wrong?"<eos> See?<eos> Maya Angelou.<eos> I am crying and wondering what went wrong.<eos> We're all doin' that.<eos> You really think P would bother to have us look that shit up in a book?<eos> She says... she misses you.
It was terrible.<eos> I'm so thirsty.<eos> What should I do now? Um...<eos> Oh, yeah, boobs.<eos> Yeah, I have boobs.<eos> Yay, me! Yay!<eos> Yeah!<eos> It's a little... It's a little cheesy... but there's something really satisfying about it.<eos> See, for me it's, like, a little hacky.<eos> Um, but didn't you think it was satisfying, like... like a little bit?
I'm pleading with you to just stop this.<eos> We... we can all work together.<eos> Are you gonna perform or not?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> There... ♪ There's workers in the mine ♪ ♪ And they can't get out ♪<eos> ♪ There's workers in the mine ♪ ♪ With a job to do ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause the moms won't care ♪ ♪ And it's just not fair ♪ ♪ Gotta get those workers out of there ♪<eos> ♪ With a job to do ♪<eos> Uh, I... I need a phone.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said that you could put your uniform on?
Winner!<eos> We really have our work cut out.<eos> This has been our strongest season yet.<eos> Uh, look, your friend is here.<eos> Ugh! Like a puppy that won't stop following me around.<eos> Von Barlow, you got a sec?<eos> All right, commercial break.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> I'm a little busy.<eos> What do you want?
I murdered someone, and I let my friend go down for it.<eos> So you all can do whatever you want, but I just wanna sit here and serve my time.<eos> Well, I only wanna serve my time, too.<eos> I only wanna serve my time, too.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Yep, me, too.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> What do you want now, Nazi?
- No, don't do that.<eos> - What?<eos> I made it up.<eos> Still, you could be sending messages and not even know it.<eos> I did this once to a guy, you know, to, like, show him that I thought he had a small dick, and he thought I was a Crip.<eos> Like you'd be anything but a Sureño.<eos> What an idiot.<eos> I think I'm gonna ask for a contouring palette as my demand.<eos> Get an Amazon Wish List.<eos> That way they know the brand to get you, and they don't buy you that cheap shit that makes you break out.
Oh, shut up, piss-bitch.<eos> Look, you wanna go after Caputo, fine.<eos> But I think the real problem is these crazy bitches have a gun.<eos> Actually, I'm not so sure they do.<eos> Flores?<eos> What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Reading guard files.<eos> Knowledge is power.<eos> Have you, by any chance, come across the name "Wes Driscoll"?
Mira, let's go!<eos> Shit.<eos> You two, stay and help me.<eos> Put on some aprons.<eos> Not that food safety's our main concern these days.<eos> Nah, chica.<eos> But I'm hungry.<eos> Oh, you worked up an appetite playing Scarface, huh?<eos> That don't mean you get to skip the line.<eos> We all in this together now, thanks to you and that gun.

Now when you inhale, make sure to contract your lower abs and squeeze your Kegels.<eos> New one from Reg.<eos> "Concerned about you.<eos> Yearning for you back." Blah, blah, blah...<eos> There's a thing about him wanting to watch Bill<eos> "fill her out like an application" later tonight.<eos> Classic Reg.<eos> Textbook compersion.<eos> Textbook what now?<eos> Oh, it's that feeling you get watching someone you love... make love to...
"This will help with your high blood pressure."<eos> Possible side effects will include nausea, dizziness, a loss of will to live, hives, feelings of anger, aggression, tremors, dry mouth, insomnia and a limp.<eos> "Enjoy your life without high blood pressure!"<eos> Can I have my drugs now?<eos> Can I get my drugs now, too?<eos> I wanna not feel this way anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, all right.<eos> You can't cheat grief.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> I guess I can give you some sleeping pills, huh?

My crack-ass sister's still alive.<eos> On the other hand, forcing them to eat the swill we've had to eat is its own special punishment. Don't you think?<eos> I ain't taking' 'em out when they get the shits.<eos> I'll bring another bucket from the cafeteria.<eos> Hey, biceps, coming along?<eos> - Nah.<eos> I got a phone call to make. - Ooh.<eos> Yo, Barney-butt!<eos> Yeah, you!<eos> We gonna feed you a meal, baby.
Perhaps we should all stay here.<eos> Of course, but what if we run out of food in the middle of a hurricane?<eos> - Wouldn't that be frightening?<eos> - Terrifyingly frightening?<eos> I won't be long, children!<eos> Don't do anything dangerous!<eos> You know, anything I wouldn't do!<eos> - Of course not!<eos> - Nothing you wouldn't do!<eos> I know you don't care for the sound, but maybe I could use your rattle to invent a burglar alarm so Aunt Josephine won't have to rely on piles of cans.

He finds education in a woman highly unbecoming.<eos> My mother merely bemoans the lack of mine.<eos> I think my father and your mother have far more in common than either of them would like to think.<eos> At least we know the score.<eos> Apropos, there's something I'd like to say.<eos> An heir and a spare and you can do your own thing.<eos> If you get my drift?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right, well, um... shall we see the rest of the house?<eos> I think you're supposed to put it on, or something.
He's got the mental age of an infant.<eos> Then he doesn't have the wherewithal to lie.<eos> Did a girl come in here?<eos> Were you frightened?<eos> Did you hit her?<eos> You can't give credence to anything he says.<eos> When I chanced into this room,<eos> Arthur hid himself behind the curtains.<eos> When Ruby did the same, we're expected to believe that Arthur took a poker and brutally clubbed her to death.<eos> Steady on, mate, I'm not going to hurt you.
We should probably go. There's a... gas leak.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, I think you're in great shape.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're in scrubs.<eos> So everyone keeps pointing out.<eos> Are you working here again?<eos> Mm-hmm. Charlie reinstated my privileges.<eos> So are you sticking around or what...<eos> Maggie, I don't want to make small talk. I told you how I felt, and I haven't heard from you since.
Maggie, my mom's urn got held up at customs.<eos> I ordered it on Etsy, custom-made out of oak,<eos> - just like the tree from her back yard.<eos> - Alex, slow down.<eos> I need you to help me get it back before the memorial.<eos> I didn't know where else to put her.<eos> I mean, she just brought these cute little rain boots for Luke, and they were...<eos> So, actually, this is the last thing that she...<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Just do you have a tracking number?
- Put him down.<eos> - Oh, right. Put him down, put him down, put him down, put him down.<eos> I've checked the ward, the nurse's station, and the lounge.<eos> Nothing yet, but there's still lots of places to look.<eos> Like where, the City Morgue?<eos> Have a little faith in me.<eos> I'll find it. Sweetie, I hate to ask, but I really feel like something to eat now, too.<eos> Sorry to be a pain.<eos> No, it's like practice... for when we get pregnant, you know.<eos> Getting you bacon and ice cream at 2:00 a.m.
Yeah, they do.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> We haven't spent very much time together.<eos> Liv, you're my best friend. Same.<eos> And... if it's okay with you,<eos> I'd still really like to be your husband.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I want to be your wifey.<eos> - We should talk.<eos> - I can help you find Martha's ashes, but then I think it's best if we keep our distance.
You are so selfish.<eos> Do you see her?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Faster.<eos> Faster!<eos> Didn't you have friends?<eos> End of the line, fellas.<eos> He's coming to you.
You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?<eos> Come on, talk to me.<eos> I am a bartender now.<eos> I've just been feeling betwixt and between of late.<eos> - Betwixt and between?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But, a story came across my desk today.<eos> A missing girl.<eos> I'm gonna find her.<eos> Can I offer you some unsolicited advice?
Go back to the DEO.<eos> I just...<eos> Tell Alex what happened and make sure a strike team follows me.<eos> - I'm going in there.<eos> - Right, um...<eos> We don't know what's on the other side.<eos> Izzy's on the other side and that's all that matters.<eos> Wait, no...<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> Uh, I thought you might need my help.
Hey, you're bleeding.<eos> That is a red sun.<eos> Like on Krypton and Daxam.<eos> And we get our powers from the radiation of a yellow sun, so that means... - No powers.<eos> - No powers.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Well, now who's gonna help us?<eos> We have to get it to work.<eos> Nobody knows we're here!<eos> That's why I told you to get my sister.
We have to get it to work.<eos> Nobody knows we're here!<eos> That's why I told you to get my sister.<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter who's to blame.<eos> We just need to get back to Earth.<eos> Aliens brought those people to this planet, and we're gonna find out why and save them.<eos> Um, could you maybe just think about saving us for a second?<eos> No one told you to come here.<eos> In fact, I specifically told you to not come.
Jo Gunraf does not eat bipeds.<eos> -So you speak English?<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> Jo dissected a human once.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> Learned your tongue.<eos> Hideous pink thing.<eos> Eh, Jo...<eos> Jo, is it?<eos> We promise, we are not here to hurt you.
What about the Prince?<eos> He wasn't worth admiring.<eos> But I wanna be.<eos> So that's the next thing.<eos> I've made a decision... - Sounds decisive. - It's very decisive.<eos> I wanna be a superhero.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Like you.<eos> With a name and an outfit, maybe a cape.<eos> - You want the suit.
I wanna get my hands dirty, you know, like...<eos> I wanna do something.<eos> - You're serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you take this road, easy is over.<eos> Well, I don't want easy.<eos> Cape can get heavy sometime.<eos> I want a heavy cape.<eos> Come on.<eos> I wanna help you keep the world spinning.
And I'm a mechanic, not a Captain.<eos> So I guess we're both trying out new things today.<eos> So what's dating like in 2017?<eos> You still go to the movies?<eos> Sure, but, you know, you gotta work up to it.<eos> Two hours is a big-time commitment.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yeah, nowadays, we got dating down to a science.<eos> There's an app on your phone.<eos> If you like somebody, you swipe right.
We're being watched.<eos> You sure you heard someone?<eos> I mean, I hear the sound of rushing water, but I don't think anyone else is out here.<eos> Hessians.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Nate?<eos> The Hessians must've planned to camp here for the night.<eos> I'm so cold.<eos> I've never been so cold.<eos> - Why aren't you cold?
You're suffering from hypothermia.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're the one who doesn't think seals are cute.<eos> Whatever, I'm tired of arguing with you.<eos> I'm just gonna take a nap.<eos> No, Nathaniel, stay awake.<eos> I'm awake. I'm up.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> You need skin on skin contact.
Lieutenant General Cornwallis.<eos> I would've preferred to meet you on the field of battle.<eos> I must give credit where credit is due.<eos> I have a new colonel who's most impressive.<eos> One might say he's ahead of his time.<eos> If you two are done yapping, I'd like my last meal.<eos> Take these men to my tent, and have them well fed.<eos> You'll both be hung in the morning.<eos> Sounds exciting.<eos> What'd I tell you, Georgie boy?
This is a rebellion.<eos> And you will be hanged for treason against King George III.<eos> Wait, you mustn't punish him.<eos> This man is only guilty of following orders.<eos> I'm guilty of a lot more than that.<eos> He will be returned to his regiment tomorrow with news of your death.<eos> Is my underwear out there?<eos> You weren't wearing any.<eos> That's embarrassing.<eos> Just so you know, that water was very cold, so if you happened to have sneaked a peek, it's not a fair representation of...
That's embarrassing.<eos> Just so you know, that water was very cold, so if you happened to have sneaked a peek, it's not a fair representation of...<eos> Nate, I wasn't looking down there.<eos> Because that would be unprofessional.<eos> We'll wait for our clothes to dry and then continue tracking Rory and Washington.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're gonna wait out there?<eos> It's warm by the fire.<eos> It's warmer in the tent.<eos> If you're implying what I think you're implying, you don't think that's a little fast?
I suppose, after all we've been through, a kiss would seem quaint.<eos> It would seem old-fashioned.<eos> Mr. Jackson!<eos> Man, this guy's really starting to piss me off.<eos> You can't run forever, Mr. Jackson.<eos> Something tells me I'm getting warmer.<eos> Nope, colder.<eos> Man, the Legion really must've fried your brain.<eos> I bet you couldn't even find your own ass with both hands and a flashlight.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jax.

What, not even your father's life?<eos> Think about it, Jax.<eos> The spear allows us to rewrite reality.<eos> Now, if you were to help me, your father no longer has to ship off to battle.<eos> He would no longer have to die in that ambush.<eos> Your mother would no longer be a widow, and you...<eos> The only way you're getting that spear is by prying it from my cold, dead hands.<eos> Well, that works too.<eos> When they change shifts, I'm gonna bust us out of here.<eos> Are you really so anxious to die?
I think I'll let you do the honors.<eos> You.<eos> I underestimated you, Jax.<eos> And I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to interrupt this tender moment.<eos> - Get away from her.<eos> - Not another step.<eos> Now, one last time, where's the piece of the spear?<eos> Don't make me ask you again.<eos> I'm not telling you nothing.
Don't move!<eos> You haven't got it in you.<eos> You didn't have to kill her.<eos> Sara wasn't supposed to die, not like that, not by you.<eos> There's no rhyme nor reason to any of this, Jax.<eos> History is war and slavery and holding your dead son in your arms.<eos> There's no point in protecting history, so we might as well just burn it all down.<eos> I haven't got all day for this.<eos> If you're gonna shoot me, then, please, get on with it.<eos> I will make it easier for you.
You're weak.<eos> Just like your old Captain.<eos> Don't.<eos> Sara?<eos> What?<eos> Gideon and Stein saved me.<eos> It looks like Rip put together a pretty good team.<eos> Will you put the gun down, Jax?<eos> No.<eos> I think you should listen to your friend.
I'm not protecting him.<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> Speaking of Christmas miracles, the British are coming.<eos> To fighting like an American.<eos> I always do.<eos> It's not bad.<eos> Listen, Georgie,<eos> I got some thoughts on the criminal justice system...<eos> This is last of them.<eos> You should be back to a fair fight now.
We are a team of outcasts and misfits, so please don't call us heroes.<eos> We're something else.<eos> We're legends.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> We're The Justice Society of America.<eos> Dr. Mid-Nite, Star Girl.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The Spear allegedly has the power to rewrite reality.<eos> I know that you're one of the protectors of the Spear of Destiny, and I know that you know where the other pieces are hidden.
- I'm rounding up the fragments.<eos> - Why?<eos> They're safer apart than they are together.<eos> They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.<eos> Really?<eos> You said the Time Masters couldn't be trusted.<eos> Did I?<eos> Bollocks, so I did.<eos> I suppose we're gonna have to do this the hard way, then.<eos> Now, where is the fragment of the Spear that I had you protect?
- Why?<eos> They're safer apart than they are together.<eos> They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.<eos> Really?<eos> You said the Time Masters couldn't be trusted.<eos> Did I?<eos> Bollocks, so I did.<eos> I suppose we're gonna have to do this the hard way, then.<eos> Now, where is the fragment of the Spear that I had you protect?<eos> I don't know why you want it, but you'll never find it.
- but the future just...<eos> - It's uncertain.<eos> Yeah, and it freaks me out a little.<eos> Then just stay on the ship.<eos> You think I should stay on the ship?<eos> I don't care.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> I am a time travel professional.<eos> If you need me to visit the future, I can visit the future.<eos> And I'm just saying it's entirely up to you.
I mean, when's the next time we're gonna get to feast in Camelot?<eos> - Mm. - Hey, guys, check it out.<eos> - That's Sir Galahad.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Because he's sitting in the Siege Perilous.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on.<eos> Some kind of historian you are.<eos> Siege Perilous is a special seat reserved for only the purest of knights.<eos> I don't how many times I have to tell you... there's a difference between legend and history.
As long as I live, you will never have it.<eos> That might turn out to be shorter than you think.<eos> Stand fast, or your king dies.<eos> All I have to do is think it, and he slits his own throat.<eos> Ultimatum time.<eos> Deliver the fragment to me by dawn, or I'll come back with an army just as obedient as Arthur here.<eos> Choice is yours...<eos> Camelot... or the Spear.<eos> Galahad, may you rest in peace, where sorrow and pain are banished.<eos> May the everlasting light of Camelot shine upon you.
There's no time for sentiment.<eos> Do you really wanna chance Damien Darhk having the power to rewrite reality?<eos> I guess not.<eos> It's set in stone.<eos> Not for long.<eos> Damn, that was badass.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Put it down.<eos> We should attack now.<eos> Let me tell you how an ultimatum works.
Damn, that was badass.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Put it down.<eos> We should attack now.<eos> Let me tell you how an ultimatum works.<eos> The so-called Legends have until dawn to deliver the Spear.<eos> You don't actually believe that they'll hand it over, do you?<eos> Perhaps not, but meeting on a battle field is infinitely more wise than laying siege to the castle.<eos> Right.<eos> I-I just thought that you would want my expertise.
- Sure, you can.<eos> Left foot, right foot, repeat, let's go.<eos> No, Nate, look around you.<eos> All of these men are willing to die on the battlefield... not for some Spear, but for an idea.<eos> And I get it now.<eos> Camelot isn't about history.<eos> It's not even about some dusty old books that got a lonely kid through childhood.<eos> It's about one noble idea... that we can all stand up for what's right, no matter what.<eos> And I can't walk away from that.<eos> I believe you, Ray.
Yeah.<eos> I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.<eos> Thank you, Amaya.<eos> Tales of your deeds will honor these halls for longer than you can imagine.<eos> The honor is mine, Your Grace.<eos> Hey. So you're staying?<eos> Like you, I found a new home.<eos> - Like me?<eos> - With the Legends.<eos> The team suits you.
It's not just about my grandfather.<eos> It's about the entire fabric of reality that's at stake here, which you think would be incentive enough for a certain talking computer to buffer a little quicker.<eos> The name is Gideon, and I'm processing data as fast as I can.<eos> Just... Just chill out, bro, all right?<eos> Let Gideon do her thing.<eos> Look, soon as we lock in a location on the fragment, we'll head there right away.<eos> We're gonna save your grandfather, and, you know, the fabric of reality.<eos> Hey, yo, got an idea.<eos> If it's try to get Evil Rip to tell us where and when Commander Steel is, I already tried.<eos> And he didn't tell you nothing?
Very well... Captain.<eos> Wh-What?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Gideon?<eos> If this is about before, I'm sorry.<eos> Gideon, what's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, but I have no recourse but to follow the Captain's orders.<eos> Women.<eos> I didn't give you any...
Not entirely. The sudden reconfiguration of my navigation system forced me to select the oldest destination in my logs.<eos> Gideon, I don't care how we got here, just time-jump us out of here, now.<eos> Unfortunately, I am unable to.<eos> The ship's primary temporal delineator was lost during initial impact.<eos> But if we were able to recover the delineator and somehow effect repairs...?<eos> All systems would return to normal.<eos> I'll go and get it.<eos> My old neighborhood, after all.<eos> All right, go. Just take Nate and Amaya with you.<eos> You don't need to be out there alone.
With the professor as my assistant, yeah.<eos> You cannot be serious.<eos> Very serious.<eos> Get me a beer.<eos> So who's going in?<eos> I will.<eos> I brought Rip onto the ship.<eos> It's my responsibility.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not letting you go in alone.
Right, I couldn't help but get the feeling that Gertrude didn't like you very much.<eos> Raymond, what aren't you telling us?<eos> Well, it just so happens that lady dinosaurs<eos> - are rather maternal. - And?<eos> And I may have eaten one of her eggs.<eos> - But I was starving.<eos> I needed protein.<eos> I mean, one egg made me, like, 70 omlettes.<eos> I regret nothing.<eos> All right, but you have to tell us this before we walk onto Gertrude's territory.
You're not exactly a spring chicken, Professor.<eos> Your point?<eos> My point is you're not gonna be around for too much longer, and Jax has to learn how to do this stuff himself.<eos> Stop treating him like a kid and more like a partner... partner.<eos> You just threw me against the wall without laying a finger on me.<eos> Yeah, I had no idea I could do that.<eos> If you can throw me across the room, then you can open that door.<eos> This is your mind.<eos> You control everything.<eos> Why do you care so much about getting me out of here?
- That's also true.<eos> The temporal delineator is operating at normal levels, Dr. Palmer.<eos> She couldn't just say that earlier?<eos> I swear, I think she's still mad from before. You know I can hear you, right?<eos> Thank you, Gideon.<eos> That move you did with the T. rex?<eos> I'll be thinking about that for days.<eos> Is that so? Yeah.<eos> My quarters, tonight.<eos> I'll give you something else to think about.
- You're a white Martian?<eos> - I am not like them.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I spared you so you can rot in a cell for all eternity.<eos> This is Leslie Willis coming to you alive, and wired.<eos> Leslie Willis is dead.<eos> This is Livewire.<eos> I wanna be a superhero.<eos> You're serious?<eos> I wanna help you keep the world spinning.
- Yes.<eos> Are we clear on the whole protect-citizens-above-all else thing?<eos> Yes.<eos> Clear.<eos> Super clear.<eos> Supergirl clear.<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> No, seriously, we're clear.<eos> - Let's do it again. - Uh...<eos> Well, I think you might need to change.
Her kind has taken enough from me.<eos> From us!<eos> If she dies, she dies.<eos> She deserves it a thousand times over.<eos> Let her drown in her own sins.<eos> Come on, that's the best.<eos> What the...<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> I, uh... Want to tell you something.
I can handle these guys.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - Don't worry about me.<eos> Just help them.<eos> Stay back!<eos> I'll see you in a minute.<eos> Supergirl, behind you!<eos> Go with them.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> - Let me help you!
So cool.<eos> I know I don't technically need a motorcycle, Jimmy,<eos> I am a very fast man, but I would very much like one.<eos> You know. Where would I...<eos> Where would I find a motorcycle?<eos> Is there a superhero discount?<eos> Is there some cash...<eos> It's a cool suit.<eos> Yours?<eos> I was going to tell you.

Um, Kara...<eos> This is between us.<eos> - Not them.<eos> - Yeah, you're right.<eos> Can we have a minute, please?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, yes, yes.<eos> I am calm.<eos> I am going to listen to you.<eos> I owe you that much.
- Yes.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> You saw him, he left civilians unprotected at that fight which I had to go back for.<eos> - Mon-El's still learning.<eos> - At what cost, Kara?<eos> There was a cop that took a lightning bolt because "Mon-El's still learning."<eos> He cares about himself, he cares about you, and that's what he fights for.<eos> But he can change.<eos> You can't.<eos> You are never going to be strong enough for this.

She did it anyway.<eos> She said she tried to help your kind.<eos> I suspect that's true.<eos> Then what's the harm in the Bond?<eos> I mean, if you can see into her past, maybe you can find some good there.<eos> I don't want to forgive her.<eos> Why?<eos> Hate becomes your reason for living when you've lost everything that you love.<eos> If I find that there was some good in their kind, I don't hate her.<eos> Forgiveness isn't something that you give to somebody who's hurt you.

Hey, wait.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, what's wrong?<eos> I can't trust you.
Hey... Hey, wait.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, what's wrong?<eos> I can't trust you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You were reckless.<eos> You left your post and because of you, someone got hurt.<eos> I was trying to protect you.<eos> Yeah, but I don't need that, I need a partner who will listen to me.<eos> I told you, I said protect the people, above all else and...
I told you, I said protect the people, above all else and...<eos> Why can't you just listen to me?<eos> - Because!<eos> - Why?<eos> Why are you working with me?<eos> Because I should.<eos> Right?<eos> I have these powers, and I should use them.<eos> That's not an answer.<eos> Do you like me?
Right?<eos> I have these powers, and I should use them.<eos> That's not an answer.<eos> Do you like me?<eos> Do I like...<eos> Uh, at the moment, that's a tough call.<eos> You kissed me when you were sick.<eos> Yeah, um, says you.<eos> Are you working with me because you like me?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, okay?
It's the right thing to do.<eos> I've, uh, never attempted this with a White Martian.<eos> I don't know what'll happen.<eos> If things get hairy, I'm gonna pull you out.<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm going to relive some things.<eos> Deaths.<eos> The war.<eos> What do you need?
That's where you two come in.<eos> Perfect specimens.<eos> Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.<eos> We will never fight for you.<eos> You will.<eos> You, you might definitely die.<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - Oh, what do you care?
I will.<eos> But not today.<eos> Do you understand me, Agent Schott?<eos> What you did was insubordination.<eos> If you ever keep a secret from me like that again, you are...<eos> - Dead?<eos> - Fired!<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> That's fair.<eos> You're lucky no one died.
Way before all of this.<eos> I know you want to help people, but this is not the way to do it.<eos> I won't stop you.<eos> But as long as you are putting yourselves in danger, I can't support it.<eos> I guess that's it, then.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Feeling better?<eos> Better.<eos> Come in.<eos> Thank you.
Do you...<eos> Do you want to sit?<eos> - I... I feel like...<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> I think we're gonna sit.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I remember.<eos> I was sick and alone.<eos> And you were leaning over me.<eos> And you must have been sad.
I know you're there.<eos> I saw you yesterday, too.<eos> The old lady at the bus stop.<eos> And you were that little boy in the park this morning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Do you regret letting me out of that cell?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - But you still don't trust me!<eos> I do trust you.
I refused to open my eyes to what was right in front of me.<eos> People who were willing to take a chance.<eos> It's taken me hundreds of years to learn to trust again after...<eos> After what my people did.<eos> You are not your people.<eos> Okay?<eos> You are kind and you are generous and willing to put yourself before others.<eos> You are different.<eos> I know that now.<eos> Then you know that I can't just stay here and let these monsters hurt you and your friends.
- About four minutes?<eos> - Good answer.<eos> As long as I can focus, it should be easy.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Monsters are real.<eos> J'onn, J'onn!<eos> Go, go!<eos> I haven't killed a Green in centuries.<eos> This is going to be a joy.<eos> You never should have come here.
This skin is beautiful.<eos> Core breach in two minutes.<eos> Just don't look behind you.<eos> That should do it.<eos> Core stabilized.<eos> Oh, that was a close one.<eos> Close?<eos> We had, like, you know, 12 seconds to spare.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. Thank you.
There's a thing called a Dunkaroo.<eos> Have you ever heard of this?<eos> - No.<eos> - It's...<eos> Kara!<eos> Mike...<eos> - Eve!<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> It's so funny, Mike, that you're here.<eos> I was going to call you later to talk about something, but...
Whoa! Whoa, buddy, come on.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Lillian Luthor's defense attorneys tried to downplay Lena Luthor's testimony, characterizing her statements as<eos> "the angry rant of an estranged daughter."<eos> Everyone in National City has got an opinion about me.<eos> Ungrateful daughter, heroine, bitch.<eos> Ugh. And they've all called for a quote.<eos> Not you though, Snapper Carr hasn't sent you here to shake me down.<eos> No, no. I'm here as a friend.<eos> I thought you could use some fried sugary goodness in your life.
I can just call the guard back and go.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I promised myself I would be better.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> I asked you here because I wanted to let you know that I forgive you.<eos> That I still love you.<eos> The only time you ever tell me you love me is when you need something from me.
The only time you ever tell me you love me is when you need something from me.<eos> I know I wasn't the greatest mother, but I did the best that I could.<eos> By making me feel unwanted.<eos> - Like an outsider.<eos> - You don't want to believe it, but I always tried to protect you.<eos> If dad could hear you now.<eos> After all the things you've done and justified.<eos> You hold Lionel up as some saint, but he's not.<eos> Don't disparage him.<eos> He was a good man. If he was a good man, he would've told you the truth.
But he hated me too much to do that.<eos> Told me the truth about what?<eos> When your father and I first got together, it was the happiest time of my life.<eos> But after Lex was born, Lionel started having... an affair.<eos> I was clueless, until I went to surprise him on a business trip, only to find that he was with your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She was already pregnant with you by then.<eos> They paid her off.<eos> Your father came back to try and rebuild our marriage.<eos> Then when you were four, we heard your mother had died.
But keep gumptioning for tomorrow's cover.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> But that'll be too late.<eos> By then everyone will think she's guilty already.<eos> Everyone will think she's guilty today.<eos> Tomorrow's another story.<eos> But once it's out there, it's out there. I mean, people still think Macaulay Culkin's dead.<eos> James, come on, you know we can't print this.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Snapper.<eos> And I think you should, too.
Kara.<eos> Kara, come on, wait.<eos> No, no, are you kidding me?<eos> The only thing Lena has done is help.<eos> She called the police on her own mother over the Medusa virus.<eos> That's exactly my point. If she can betray her own mother, what is to stop her from pulling a long con on you?<eos> Okay, I know she's your friend, Kara, but Lena's bad news.<eos> Why, because she's a Luthor?<eos> No, because she's guilty.<eos> And if you don't see that, I'm gonna prove it to you.
The prodigal daughter.<eos> How'd you get in?<eos> If Lena was bad, I knew it was only a matter of time before you showed up to free her.<eos> I do work for the Luthors, after all.<eos> Hello, Ms. Luthor.<eos> Sorry for the delay.<eos> Metallo's strong, but something's off.<eos> His Kryptonite isn't right.<eos> I think it's hurting him.<eos> Well, you're lucky you didn't take a direct hit.
His Kryptonite isn't right.<eos> I think it's hurting him.<eos> Well, you're lucky you didn't take a direct hit.<eos> Very lucky.<eos> I had my shield.<eos> I love that shield.<eos> And I know what I'm doing, Kara.<eos> Even if Metallo's weakening, though, he still is a fanatic follower of Lillian Luthor.<eos> We have to find out where he's taken Lena, and help her.<eos> What is it going to take for you to realize that Lena is a criminal?
If you watch that video, I know you'll find something.<eos> I did.<eos> It's...<eos> It's clean.<eos> Then find something to prove her innocent.<eos> Everything we've seen so far says the exact opposite.<eos> Well, she's my friend.<eos> And I believe in her.<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> Which is why I don't understand why it's so hard for you to believe me.
Oh, did you talk to James?<eos> No, I'm actually talking about myself.<eos> You know, you believing in me, it meant a lot.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have been cold. - And distant.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. And I'd like to apologize for that.<eos> Hey, I'm just glad to know that it's not me adjusting to Earth's chilly climate.<eos> I was mad at you, because I thought you were dating Eve.<eos> "Were", as in past tense. Right?<eos> As in, she told you that the date didn't actually go well.

Yeah.<eos> You know, I'm not super hip on earthly social cues, but why would you be mad if I was dating Eve?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> You literally just said you were mad.<eos> No. Two seconds ago, you said, "I am mad about"...<eos> Yeah, I'm surprised.<eos> - Oh, not mad, surprised.<eos> - I'm surprised that... You'd just date someone else, when you were serious about me, because I mean if...<eos> How could you be serious if you did that?<eos> If you don't like me, why do you...
To what? You have no life anymore, Lena.<eos> You have no one on your side.<eos> You're guilty, just like me.<eos> You're on the run, just like me.<eos> Join Cadmus.<eos> And together we can do all the great things you ever dreamed of.<eos> And with no Luthor men to divide us,<eos> I can finally be the mother you always wanted.<eos> Because I do love you.<eos> Let me prove it to you now.
I didn't say Lex's DNA.<eos> I said Luthor.<eos> Any Luthor can open it.<eos> And you, my daughter, are part of that family tree.<eos> You didn't have your green goon liberate me from prison because you loved me.<eos> Because you wanted to help me.<eos> You did it because I'm the only one who can open this vault for you.<eos> While it's true I need your DNA, one doesn't negate the other.<eos> I still love you.<eos> I still want to help you.

He doesn't want to, Lena.<eos> Put your hand on the pad and we can all start getting along again.<eos> I promise. No.<eos> I'm trying to play nice.<eos> See?<eos> That wasn't so bad, was it?<eos> You know, the backseat driving, not helping.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But have you found anything yet?<eos> I promise I will tell you.
When the Kryptonite explodes, it's gonna send out a radioactive cloud of Kryptonite gas.<eos> If you are anywhere near it, it'll kill you.<eos> Then I'll make sure I'm not there when it goes off.<eos> Well, this should make you feel safe.<eos> Lex's warsuit, an Atomic Axe, a Black Mercy.<eos> Everything we need to rid this planet of Kryptonians and every other alien invader, once and for all.<eos> You're worse than Lex.<eos> I promise you, I will be on the right side of history.<eos> Maybe then you'll believe that I was looking out for your best interests, after all.<eos> Whether you like it or not, I'll always be your mother.
My name is Mxyzptlk and I love you, Kara Zor-El.<eos> Tell me... Will you marry me?<eos> Hey. I don't know how you got to this planet,<eos> - but she's with me.<eos> - The other suitor!<eos> I didn't see you there, tall, dark and bland-some.<eos> You're barely there, let alone my romantic rival.<eos> No!<eos> What...<eos> Invisible is a good look on you.
On Daxam we had a zero tolerance policy for those creatures.<eos> - You had them on Daxam?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And those guys knew how to party, but they're dangerous.<eos> Very dangerous.<eos> Agent Schott, scan the archives for anything resembling Fifth Dimensional incursions here on Earth.<eos> Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey. J'onn.<eos> We're ready to send your message to Mars whenever you are.
You know me well.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's from my mom.<eos> It's kind of silly.<eos> She's always made such a fuss about Valentine's Day.<eos> Here I am, 28 years old, and she still sends me cards.<eos> I always wondered who bought those.<eos> Let me see this.<eos> "Daughter, thank you for being who you are.
I can handle Mxyzptlk, but it's Mon-El who's infuriating.<eos> He has some grudge against imps.<eos> - Do you think Mon-El's jealous?<eos> - No.<eos> Of Mxyzptlk?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, that would be crazy.<eos> Though Mxy is persistent.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Hey! Why don't you take these to Maggie?
Anything else?<eos> Well, she loves scotch.<eos> You know, that's, um...<eos> - Good.<eos> - And... she loves tiramisu.<eos> I mean, could eat it for every meal, literally.<eos> It's like her happy food.<eos> And she loves bonsai trees, which I know is totally random, but I mean, find it adorable.<eos> That's all great.<eos> So why don't you create a tailor-made Maggie Valentine's Day?
Yeah. Thanks, Kara.<eos> - Parasite!<eos> - How is he still alive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Hey. I thought you were dead.<eos> You're the one who's dead.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was going to ask you the same question.
Look!<eos> Up in the sky!<eos> - It's a bird!<eos> - It's a plane!<eos> It's...<eos> Superman?<eos> Not quite.<eos> Mxy?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Thought you could use a little extra help, Supey-Baby.
Superman?<eos> Not quite.<eos> Mxy?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Thought you could use a little extra help, Supey-Baby.<eos> Hello.<eos> I was helping her so...<eos> You?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> You're lucky I flew in when I did, Supergirl.
Not quite.<eos> Mxy?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Thought you could use a little extra help, Supey-Baby.<eos> Hello.<eos> I was helping her so...<eos> You?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> You're lucky I flew in when I did, Supergirl.<eos> I mean, do you think this fraud could have helped you save the day?
You?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> You're lucky I flew in when I did, Supergirl.<eos> I mean, do you think this fraud could have helped you save the day?<eos> What superpower?<eos> I guess he could have leaped over Parasite like a gazelle.<eos> Hey, that's...<eos> Would you like to see my superpower?<eos> 'Cause I will just rip you apart with my bare hands right here<eos> - if you're interested in that.
Who can come to her aid when villains suddenly pop up.<eos> Wait...<eos> Parasite...<eos> This was all you?<eos> Don't you...<eos> Don't you see what he's doing here?<eos> He's creating havoc so that he can play the hero and then impress you.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> She's been slumming it with you for so long, she doesn't realize what's out there.<eos> Why don't you just say your name backwards, buddy, and just zap back to wherever you came from, okay?
Hey, no!<eos> You don't get to just walk out, Maggie.<eos> This is a relationship.<eos> You're the one who told me not to push my feelings down, so...<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> You want?<eos> You want to know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, yeah, fine.<eos> When I told you that my parents were supportive of my coming out, I lied.
Wife.<eos> Yes, I'm coming.<eos> My God. Thank God you're still here!<eos> - Mon-El...<eos> - It's not too late.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, okay?<eos> I'm jealous.<eos> I wish I could snap my fingers and give you anything you wish for, and it kills me that he can do that stuff for you and I can't.
I'm jealous.<eos> I wish I could snap my fingers and give you anything you wish for, and it kills me that he can do that stuff for you and I can't.<eos> And I acted badly, okay?<eos> Very badly.<eos> But please...<eos> Please do not marry him.<eos> I will be better for you...<eos> It's not just the jealousy thing, monel.<eos> It's the patronizing ego thing.<eos> I told you I could handle Mxy, and you didn't listen.
I'm sorry.<eos> Alex?<eos> Hey, Kara.<eos> Alex around?<eos> I was looking for her, too.<eos> She's not here.<eos> I was hoping I could see her.<eos> I need to apologize.<eos> I acted like an idiot last night.<eos> Look, I know Valentine's Day might not be happy for you, but it means something to Alex
You said noon and here I am!<eos> - Kara!<eos> - I can hear you.<eos> Where's the dress?<eos> The flowers?<eos> The pigs in blankets?<eos> See, that's the thing, Mxy.<eos> I'm not going to marry you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - I brought you to the Fortress in case you got violent again.
- I brought you to the Fortress in case you got violent again.<eos> 'Cause I didn't want anyone to get hurt when I broke the news.<eos> It's not going to work between us.<eos> Ever.<eos> But you said...<eos> You don't love me?<eos> Love isn't making demands of someone, or forcing them to marry you.<eos> Love is putting someone else's needs above your own.<eos> So you brought me all the way up here just to reject me?<eos> I think you're going to have to explain your catastrophic lack of judgment to your family.

Atomic Cauldron detonation countdown initiated.<eos> Well, here's the thing.<eos> I'm calling your bluff.<eos> I don't believe that you'd destroy all of this.<eos> Atomic Cauldron detonation in one minute.<eos> Okay, please.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Just don't die.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not going to tell you the cancellation code.
You aren't like some experience to me, okay?<eos> You're a potentially real, fulfilling, challenging relationship and that's just way too much chaos.<eos> That's too fast...<eos> Just gonna...<eos> What do you say we just...<eos> We take it slow?<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Slow.<eos> Take me to where you live.
You out-tricked the most cunning intergalactic trickster, and you did it your way, without violence,<eos> which I never should have doubted because you're...<eos> You know, you're you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I also wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> For acting like an ass.<eos> I've been giving it a lot of thought and I have realized<eos> that you are my Kryptonite.<eos> Me?<eos> No, I mean, my feelings for you.
Kara?<eos> Kara!<eos> Was it that bad?<eos> Was it that good?<eos> and it's been quite a morning for Supergirl.<eos> National City's own feminist hero in a cape has already prevented five armed robberies, delivered a litter of puppies, and given one very lucky tugboat owner some extra help hauling a tanker.<eos> She's done a lot more than me.<eos> Morning.<eos> Hi.<eos> - I got you these.
Sorry.<eos> - Ten seconds.<eos> - Yeah, I thought that was...<eos> You lasted...<eos> We just walked in.<eos> It was 10 seconds.<eos> very, very short.<eos> I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.<eos> I mean, back on Daxam, they used to throw parties when people got together.<eos> You're lucky I didn't arrange a parade.
Better than he ever did.<eos> But what happened after that?<eos> You were gone for such a long time.<eos> I guess I did too good a job enhancing Henshaw, 'cause Cadmus wanted me to stick around, help 'em with other projects.<eos> In the beginning, I tried to escape again and again.<eos> But, well, let's just say they didn't appreciate that very much.<eos> Oh, Dad.<eos> I...<eos> It's okay, by...<eos> By working with them, I was helping to keep you and your sister safe.
So, what you're telling me is that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and Alex and Kara's long lost father has returned from Cadmus custody with news that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion explosive using Kara's other-worldly heat vision radiation,<eos> and that they're going to drop that on National City and just kill us all?<eos> Ha! Is... Is this...<eos> You could run a trace on Kara's heat vision radiation signature.<eos> Right, yeah well, if the bomb is armed, then yes, I might be able to pinpoint its location before it goes off.<eos> Good, get to work, Winn.<eos> Jeremiah!<eos> Eliza.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My God, did I miss you?
- He saved us.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I was there and I...<eos> I watched you solar flare, and it didn't look like they were trying to, you know, capture your heat-vision.<eos> It looked like they just wanted you to blow your powers out.<eos> Mon-El.<eos> You are not a scientist.<eos> And you don't know how that Cadmus device worked, but Jeremiah does.<eos> Why is it so hard for you to trust him?
Dr. Danvers!<eos> And Dr. Danvers!<eos> That's a knife.<eos> - Don't shake your knife.<eos> - Hello, sweet boy.<eos> - It's harder, one-handed.<eos> - Here, let me.<eos> Fourteen years with Cadmus, this is all I ever thought about.<eos> Look at our girls.<eos> Thank you, Lizzie.
Thank you, Lizzie.<eos> I'm so sorry...<eos> That I wasn't here.<eos> It's going to be different now.<eos> We can make up for lost time.<eos> No.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> That time, it's gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that I love you and I have missed you every day.
What a lucky thing that you have returned when you did.<eos> You mean when he was rescued, right, Mon-El?<eos> I mean, that it is very fortunate that Dr. Danvers has returned just as a fusion bomb has become a threat.<eos> A fusion bomb that only he's mentioned and no one else has seen.<eos> I mean, what a gift.<eos> What did you just say to my father?<eos> And now he's just gonna go right back to the DEO.<eos> With full access, I'm guessing, right, J'onn?<eos> No background checks for your old soldier buddy.<eos> You need to back up.
Is that not crazy?<eos> If your father walked through that door right now, after all these years that you thought he was dead, what would you do?<eos> I would run.<eos> - Run?<eos> - Because he was not a good man.<eos> So...<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> But this is not about you and your suspicion, and your disrespect are out of line.<eos> And you need to leave my home.
Sir, as a scientist, you have to believe in questioning.<eos> That's all I was trying to do in there.<eos> - I'm sorry if I hurt you...<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> And?<eos> That's it.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> And I doubt Kara would like the truth.<eos> Hey.<eos> - For you. - Ooh!
Yeah. And speaking of...<eos> What's so top secret that you can't talk to me at the DEO?<eos> It's Jeremiah's return.<eos> What if...<eos> What if Cadmus allowed us to "rescue" Jeremiah so he could sabotage us?<eos> Just when this, this doomsday bomb is about to be detonated.<eos> - I mean, think about it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You know what...<eos> I knew I shouldn't have given you my Netflix password.
When is the last time we were this lucky?<eos> Lucky enough that Cadmus was moving their most valuable prisoner, a guy that the DEO has been unable to find for over 15 years?<eos> And he just...<eos> He just lands in our lap?<eos> So, you think Jeremiah is...<eos> It's just... He is somebody that we need to keep our guard up around.<eos> At least until we know exactly what he's has been doing for the past 15 years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll help you.
I can't take the credit.<eos> For years I was afraid of real change, of revealing my true identity through pro-alien action.<eos> Your daughters helped me with it.<eos> They demanded we all be better.<eos> I owe them a great deal.<eos> Don't sell yourself short, J'onn.<eos> It's easy for the young to demand change.<eos> And you were open to it.<eos> You did your part.<eos> A lot of lives are going to be better because of you.
Winn?<eos> Your... Yeah...<eos> Yeah... He's...<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> I mean, looks like it's just a bunch of old case files.<eos> Oh, Dad.<eos> You both are unbelievable.<eos> But you, you're something else.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't have anything to say to you.

I've changed.<eos> J'onn!<eos> Put him down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> We have to get back.<eos> Now!<eos> Let's move!<eos> What have you done?<eos> J'onn, please, stay down, I don't want to hurt you any more than I have.<eos> I asked you a question.
Let's move!<eos> What have you done?<eos> J'onn, please, stay down, I don't want to hurt you any more than I have.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> What have you done?<eos> What I had to.<eos> Mon-El was right.<eos> You are a Cadmus man.<eos> J'onn, please, it's not the whole story.<eos> I will not let you leave.
Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?<eos> You betrayed everyone at the DEO.<eos> Your friends.<eos> Our family, everyone that I love.<eos> You did that for me?<eos> Family's complicated, honey.<eos> I'm bringing you in.<eos> Not alive, you're not.<eos> If you want to bring me in...<eos> You're gonna have to shoot me.
Not alive, you're not.<eos> If you want to bring me in...<eos> You're gonna have to shoot me.<eos> If you do it...<eos> I'll understand.<eos> You are always the best part of me.<eos> No, the green wire attaches to the other green wire.<eos> No, the other green...<eos> I...<eos> I'm gonna head over to you.
Just be here with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Just...<eos> Just sit here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, just like this.<eos> Do you need anything else?
Sources.<eos> Plural.<eos> I'm not gonna take your word for it.<eos> Way too much fake news out there.<eos> I can't risk it.<eos> So, what, you're willing to put people's lives in danger than risk hurting your reputation?<eos> Careful, ponytail.<eos> You're at DEFCON 3 with the moxie.<eos> We're the paper of record in this town.<eos> From now on, you need at least two independent sources verifying every single quote, no matter whose life is at stake.
He's a good man.<eos> And even if he is siding with Cadmus, there has to be a reason.<eos> He's either, I don't know, threatening him or they're blackmailing him, or they are mind controlling him or...<eos> I am the only one left who believes in him.<eos> Well, you're gonna be there when they find him.<eos> Okay?<eos> And you're gonna help protect him.<eos> - You're right. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Double or nothing?<eos> There's no way I'm giving you a grenade.
We don't know anything, all right?<eos> Hank, are you sure you can't get anything from this guy?<eos> Cadmus must've found a way to shield his thoughts from me.<eos> But we will find something, Winn.<eos> We always do.<eos> Everything I've tried, it's led to nothing.<eos> And if they hurt her, your father,<eos> - I'm sorry, but this is his fault.<eos> - Agent Schott.<eos> Winn, you know what you need right now?
You claim Cadmus stole the alien registry?<eos> - Yes, I can confirm that.<eos> - So who was your source?<eos> I'm sorry, but that information is confidential.<eos> You just said you were on the record.<eos> Which is it?<eos> It doesn't matter who told me.<eos> What matters is the story.<eos> Not unless I can verify your story's origin.<eos> You expect people to just trust you?
Well, that's a leading question, Mr. Carr.<eos> I never said I was involved with them.<eos> I'm not the story.<eos> Cadmus is.<eos> All right.<eos> Off the record.<eos> I won't reveal it came from you.<eos> You give me a name, I'll verify it myself and bam, we're off to the races.<eos> So...<eos> Who told you about the stolen list?
We show everything.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> As my grandmother used to say in the shtetl, "A half-truth is a whole lie."<eos> The American public has a right to know the whole truth, Danvers.<eos> And until you can provide me with more than just an NFA source, the story is DOA.<eos> Dad.<eos> Alex, listen to me, there isn't much time.<eos> Cadmus is gonna slaughter them, everyone they've abducted.<eos> Now, I can stop them, but only with your help.<eos> I wanna trust you, but I have to know that you're telling me the truth.
- I have to protect him.<eos> - Alex, listen to me.<eos> I am not gonna let anything happen to Jeremiah.<eos> I promise.<eos> But you are putting all of your focus on him when you should be focusing on the aliens we are trying to find.<eos> And when we find them, you risk making a bad call, putting him in danger.<eos> Or worse, getting yourself hurt.<eos> I have to go, I'm sorry.<eos> I have to figure out how to get this article run.<eos> I'll call you later.
Okay.<eos> And bingo.<eos> Find anything?<eos> Yeah, GPS coordinates for everywhere this van has been.<eos> I know where Cadmus is.<eos> - Want me to go with you?<eos> - No, I gotta do it alone.<eos> I wish I had what you two have.<eos> - Go away, Brian. - Get out of here.<eos> You're gonna need this.
But I can't let her interfere with our plans.<eos> - Should I take care of her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But nothing permanent.<eos> She just needs to be redirected.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> She's with me.<eos> You shouldn't have come after me, Alex.
- It was all a lie.<eos> - No.<eos> No, everything you told me in the woods.<eos> You said that you were working for Cadmus for me.<eos> And I am.<eos> From the moment Cadmus took me prisoner they told me they were gonna kill you and Kara unless I did what they said.<eos> I made my choice.<eos> Protect my girls at all costs.<eos> How could you think that we would want you to hurt others to protect us?<eos> There are some things that you will never understand until you're a parent.
- You don't threaten me.<eos> - Lillian, do you really think that I would walk into the lion's den without a whip?<eos> I planted 10 Haldorr particle mines all over this facility.<eos> Stop the launch.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - You wanna bet?<eos> The rest of the bombs are on a dead-man switch.<eos> I let this go and the entire place lights up.<eos> - I won't stop this.<eos> - I don't need you to.
Everyone, we need to get to the exit.<eos> Secondary engine ignition.<eos> Everyone, hold onto something!<eos> Main engine ignition.<eos> Report!<eos> Detecting spacecraft launch on a hyperbolic trajectory.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Cadmus.<eos> Gotta be.<eos> Ugh! Uh, hey, Alex, can I call you back?
- It's a happy ending to what was...<eos> - Winn!<eos> - a harrowing series of events.<eos> - Oh, thank God, you're safe.<eos> Oh, I thought I lost you.<eos> You're firing me?<eos> You deliberately published an article using CatCo resources on a competing social media platform, which is not only a conflict of interest but also a direct and flagrant breach of contract.<eos> But you refused to run the story.<eos> I thought what I was doing was right.<eos> You weren't right, you were lucky.

One wrong statistic about the stock market and suddenly we're in the Great Depression.<eos> One misattributed quote from a candidate and you put a fascist in the White House.<eos> The rules are there for a reason.<eos> To make sure you get the story right.<eos> That's not luck.<eos> That's being a good reporter.<eos> You know what the worst part is?<eos> I was rooting for you.<eos> I'm sorry I disobeyed your orders, J'onn.<eos> But you shouldn't have done what you did.
- Yeah, I did.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause I'm not dating some unemployed slacker.<eos> Though you do make good arm candy.<eos> Mmm... Don't I?<eos> Potstickers.<eos> Still piping hot.<eos> Here, eat one.<eos> Or all of them.<eos> I promise you'll feel better.
Hey, we picked up a honing signal on a teleportation beam.<eos> The ship is locking onto our coordinates now.<eos> We'll have back up ready if you need us.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Kara!<eos> Why did you follow me?<eos> I didn't want you to come up here by yourself.<eos> Well, maybe I wanted to come up here by myself.<eos> Why would you want to beam yourself up to an unknown spacecraft?
How did you escape the blasts?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> When Krypton exploded, the Kryptonite rained down, killing everything.<eos> We had to get off planet to persevere.<eos> And to find you.<eos> So that we might return, now that the atmosphere is hospitable.<eos> To make Daxam great again.<eos> Daxam was never great.<eos> Has the Kryptonian rubbed off on you so much so that you have forgotten?<eos> I know you're fond of a pretty face, but be reasonable.

Excuse me.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I must attend, as well.<eos> So, you survived the first dinner with the fam...<eos> - You're a liar.<eos> - I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Can you really blame me for wanting to just be Mon-El, a regular guy from Daxam?<eos> With how you feel about Daxamites, if you had known that I was the crown prince, would you even talk to me?<eos> You didn't even give me the chance.<eos> I tried to tell you so many times, okay?

This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.<eos> You benefited from its cruelty.<eos> What about that Kryptonian Emissary?<eos> Your guard...<eos> Do you even feel guilty?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I can't even look at you.<eos> I'm telling you, we did not take anything.
I don't think that's a coincidence.<eos> - You think she set him up?<eos> - Exactly. When was the last time you spoke to Lyra?<eos> I mean, I've been trying to call her all day.<eos> Let me guess, her phone is disconnected.<eos> I don't get it. She framed you, Winn.<eos> Look, I got a partner out there who thinks that you're going to be his 30th arrest of the month.<eos> That's a station record.<eos> I need proof that you weren't involved, or they're going to pin this on you, and I won't be able to stop them.<eos> If it's proof you need, then we'll get it.
You shouldn't be here.<eos> Where should I be, then?<eos> Hmm? Just rotting in jail?<eos> If it's any consolation, it wasn't personal.<eos> What took you so long, hmm?<eos> I mean, you've had plenty of other opportunities to dupe me.<eos> Don't you know how marks work?<eos> You have to gain their trust.<eos> It's called a long con for a reason.<eos> No, I don't believe you.

Hey! So, have you just been playing me this whole time?<eos> What does it matter?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Why don't you help me understand?<eos> Tell me the truth for once.<eos> It's my brother.<eos> They've got him.<eos> No, you told me that you came here alone.<eos> I told you a lot of things.<eos> He's as good as dead now, thanks to you and your friends.
What, that's it?<eos> What else am I supposed to say?<eos> Nothing's changed for me.<eos> Just tell me what to do, okay?<eos> Tell me what it is and I will fix it.<eos> You can't!<eos> Okay? You can't take back the fact that you lied to me.<eos> - You can't un-ring that bell.<eos> - Well, I can try. Just forget about you and me for one second.<eos> Do you even understand the second chance you've been given?
So, what's next?<eos> I guess Bastian and I will find a new place.<eos> There's nothing keeping us here.<eos> That's it?<eos> You're just gonna leave?<eos> Don't you hate me?<eos> Not even close.<eos> - So, what now?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> She lied to you.
There's nothing keeping us here.<eos> That's it?<eos> You're just gonna leave?<eos> Don't you hate me?<eos> Not even close.<eos> - So, what now?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> She lied to you.<eos> You're just going to forget about it?<eos> Aren't you afraid she's gonna hurt you again?
- There's... - I'm not dumb, I see things.<eos> Listen...<eos> Whatever idiotic thing he's done, I'm sure...<eos> He has his reasons.<eos> You gotta decide if those reasons are good enough for you or not.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't mind, I let myself in.<eos> I just wanted to, um, say a few things...<eos> Before I lose you forever.<eos> 'Cause I owe you a lot...

Before I lose you forever.<eos> 'Cause I owe you a lot...<eos> But most of all, I owe you the truth.<eos> My name is Mon-El.<eos> I'm the former Prince of Daxam.<eos> And I was a spoiled, useless person, that I didn't know.<eos> Until I met you.<eos> And I love being a hero because it means I get to spend every single day by your side.<eos> And I love the way that you're honest to a fault.<eos> And the way that you fight for those you care for.
You're right, okay?<eos> I'm a liar. And I really hope that you can still see the good in me.<eos> Please.<eos> Were you ever gonna tell me the truth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You just want things to be easy, Mon-El.<eos> But being a hero and falling in love, those are not easy things.<eos> They're hard and they're messy.<eos> And they hurt sometimes.<eos> - I would never hurt you on purpose...
You should leave this planet and never return.<eos> I deserve better than being lied to.<eos> You do.<eos> You're right, okay?<eos> I'm a liar.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> No, it's over.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> I'm going to get you out.<eos> I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I'm a liar.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> No, it's over.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> I'm going to get you out.<eos> I'm so sorry I lied to you.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> What smells so... Oh, is that hash browns!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> I'm trying to make you breakfast in bed.
Okay.<eos> Not that I doubt you, okay?<eos> But a series of battles with interstellar bounty hunters doesn't seem like a good way to ensure public safety.<eos> Alex is right.<eos> I want you staying out of sight until we can figure out who is behind this.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You want me to hide?<eos> Sometimes hiding is a strategic necessity.<eos> And since you asked,<eos> I too think that you should hide.
What, the game?<eos> No!<eos> I love this game.<eos> I hate...<eos> I hate being stuck inside.<eos> Look, look.<eos> I could be there and back so fast.<eos> No, no!<eos> J'onn said you can't go anywhere as Supergirl.<eos> Should have never let you watch the news.
Looks like someone's controlling him. Whoa, whoa.<eos> It's working.<eos> What's working?<eos> Okay, so, I reconfigured this thing to go off if there's another messaging device nearby.<eos> Which means there is a bounty hunter and he is close.<eos> Can you control it?<eos> No!<eos> I just feel pins and needles all over. - Okay...<eos> - It's no good!<eos> You have to run.
Queen Rhea placed the bounty...<eos> You know, for a second there, I actually almost believed them.<eos> I mean, you're not safe.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> I mean, how?<eos> I know them.<eos> In their minds, they honestly believe that if they get rid of you, then I'm just going to go back home.<eos> We need to retaliate.<eos> I mean, if we strike back, we could force them to pull the bounty and leave Earth.<eos> Uh, listen, I like revenge just as much as the next geek but need I remind you that they have an impenetrable warship?
Just to see if...<eos> Look, if this is about dinner...<eos> Why didn't you show up?<eos> I should have, but...<eos> The whole situation, it just brought up too many painful memories.<eos> What about Maggie?<eos> And all the things you said to her back then...<eos> That wasn't painful?<eos> Anything I said to her, she had coming.<eos> She dedicated five years of her life to you and you bailed on her.

That's why we have to talk to your mother.<eos> But J'onn just said we can't engage with them.<eos> No.<eos> He did not say that.<eos> He said we can't attack them.<eos> We can still talk to her.<eos> Then you can get her to realize that all she really wants is for you to be happy.<eos> And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.<eos> Your mother can change.<eos> You just have to talk to her.
Please just try to understand that letting him stay here is the right thing to do.<eos> Whatever connection you think you've found with my son during this tryst is a lie.<eos> - Hey, are you all right?<eos> I don't feel so...<eos> I should have handled this myself from the beginning.<eos> Where did you get Kryptonite?<eos> Our planet is littered with the corpse of yours.<eos> No, don't!<eos> I crossed an ocean of stars looking for my son.<eos> I'm not going to let you get in my way now.
You have my word.<eos> I'm sorry, Kara.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> So long as you're safe.<eos> Don't go. - Mon-El.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Son.<eos> I can't tell you how thrilled I am to see you here.<eos> Mon-El, why don't you go clean up while we prepare for departure.
You hid the truth about Emily, you made her seem like the bad guy.<eos> And then before that, you didn't tell me what really happened when you came out to your parents.<eos> And how badly they reacted.<eos> - You don't like to talk about you.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, I think that when your parents didn't accept you,<eos> you stopped trusting people that are closest to you.<eos> And I totally get that.<eos> But, Maggie...<eos> You don't have to be guarded with me.

I'm not here to judge you for things that happened in the past, I'm here to help you heal.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did she do to you?<eos> She had Kryptonite.<eos> We need to get you under a yellow sun lamp.<eos> No.<eos> Rhea was about to kill me, and Mon-El sacrificed everything to save my life.<eos> Now we have to save his.<eos> I can't let you do that.
You make it look so easy, to do the right thing that you wouldn't even guess that it's that hard.<eos> But it's hard.<eos> You sacrifice a lot for everyone else and...<eos> I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record here but I admire you.<eos> Well, I'm not going to forget the way you sacrificed yourself for me.<eos> Ever.<eos> So we saved each other today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just like Romeo and Juliet.<eos> You really need to finish it.

You'refiringme ?<eos> Return with us to Daxam.<eos> No.<eos> You should leave this planet and never return.<eos> I'm not done with this world.<eos> Whoo! It is another beautiful day in National City, and the Girl of Steel is ready to take on the world.<eos> I am here to kick some ass, take some names, and do it all with an endearing smile on my face.<eos> So, bring it on.<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> There is literally nothing for you to do.
No.<eos> You should leave this planet and never return.<eos> I'm not done with this world.<eos> Whoo! It is another beautiful day in National City, and the Girl of Steel is ready to take on the world.<eos> I am here to kick some ass, take some names, and do it all with an endearing smile on my face.<eos> So, bring it on.<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> There is literally nothing for you to do.<eos> Nothing?<eos> I challenge you to find an eight-year-old stealing candy.
So, bring it on.<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> There is literally nothing for you to do.<eos> Nothing?<eos> I challenge you to find an eight-year-old stealing candy.<eos> It's like somebody slipped law-abiding serum into the reservoir.<eos> Did somebody do that?<eos> Is that illegal?<eos> I could stop 'em.<eos> We'll let you know if something comes up.
Wait, did you hear that?<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I heard about last night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, I'm fine.<eos> I just... I need a favor from you.<eos> - The whistleblower I met with said Spheerical faked their lab results.<eos> So I need to file a FOIA with the FDA.<eos> You don't need CatCo's help for that.
Let the grown-ups do the actual reporting.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Hold on.<eos> have Graphics come up with a new headline.<eos> I've got a lead on one of the guys who was supposedly a test subject for the Spheerical human trials.<eos> I'm seeing him tonight.<eos> Hector, can you cancel dinner?<eos> This is gonna take me till at least eight o'clock, and I fully intend on crashing afterwards.<eos> That's disappointing.<eos> - You don't have an appointment.
For instance, would you be willing to go to dinner if I was a factor?<eos> No.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> Is it because I cracked the nano code alone?<eos> Seems petty for you.<eos> Just stop, Jacky.<eos> You know I wish you all the success.<eos> But?<eos> I'm still not going for dinner with you.<eos> Do you have fun here?
Do you have fun here?<eos> I feel good about the work we do.<eos> You had fun with me.<eos> I mean, ruining your eyesight staring into a microscope.<eos> Throwing said microscope at my head when I was insufferable.<eos> I don't like how things ended with us.<eos> You could have made it easier on me.<eos> It's not like I wanted to go.<eos> I'm not here to make it harder.<eos> I just miss you.
Anyway, I... I was also wondering...<eos> - Maybe another time. - Oh.<eos> Lena, are... Are you, um...<eos> Yeah, I think Jack and I need to talk.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - We... We are out.<eos> Because nothing gets in the way of romance.<eos> Jack!<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> Hey, listen, I feel a connection to you.
Yeah, I think Jack and I need to talk.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - We... We are out.<eos> Because nothing gets in the way of romance.<eos> Jack!<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> Hey, listen, I feel a connection to you.<eos> Like a man-nection?<eos> We should hang.<eos> You should call me.
Oh, no.<eos> You did not just say that.<eos> - I'm ridiculous.<eos> I know. - Yeah.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - For what?<eos> I made you choose.<eos> L-Corp or me.<eos> I was greedy.<eos> You were hurt.
I'm really sorry.<eos> You were just doing your job.<eos> It's all any of us can do.<eos> Winn!<eos> Hey, how's the most amazing girlfriend in the entire universe?<eos> Um, first round's on me, by the way.<eos> Actually, all the rounds are on me.<eos> - Forever. Always. - Wow!<eos> Um, and I got you your very favorite Earth dessert.<eos> Mmm! Hey, you know you don't have to try so hard around me...
- Yeah.<eos> She was there.<eos> - Did you say thank you?<eos> Once.<eos> To a divorce lawyer.<eos> It was uncomfortable for everyone involved.<eos> What's this, more alternative facts?<eos> It's all my research on Spheerical.<eos> I thought I'd help your story.<eos> What's in it for you, Ponytail?
Again, not very financially responsible.<eos> I already control Jack.<eos> Why would I kill you when I can control you, and, by extension, L-Corp?<eos> Think of that merger.<eos> Okay, Jacky, put it down, all right?<eos> Jack, listen, I know you're in there somewhere, okay?<eos> You listen to me, all right?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You've gotta get out of here.
And when I got there, Lillian was tidying his room like he'd been away on a business trip.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> Cold and calm.<eos> Until I think about Beth dying in jail, and then I feel warm for a minute.<eos> - You're in shock, Lena.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Loss does strange things to my family, and I've lost a lot of people.<eos> Well, you're not gonna lose me.<eos> I think when I feel things again, I'm gonna be very, very afraid... Of the person I might be.<eos> You don't have to be afraid.
I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> - Mother.<eos> Father.<eos> - My son.<eos> You've betrayed me, my love.<eos> I'm not done with this world.<eos> - Lena Luthor?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
A man named Peter Thompson is serving a life sentence at Albatross Bay Supermax.<eos> You will free him within the next 36 hours or your sister will die.<eos> And I know you can, because I know...<eos> You're Supergirl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I knew I recognized you from the elevator.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> The people that I work with, they will find me.<eos> And when they do, you will be in a world of hurt.
You will free him within the next 36 hours or your sister will die.<eos> And I know you can, because I know...<eos> You're Supergirl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I knew I recognized you from the elevator.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> The people that I work with, they will find me.<eos> And when they do, you will be in a world of hurt.<eos> So, I am giving you one chance.
They've clearly been planning this for a while.<eos> Whoever took Alex is a ghost who doesn't want to be found.<eos> Then what's the right question?<eos> Who is Peter Thompson, and what does he mean to our ghost?<eos> So where did you study?<eos> Undergrad at Oxford, Masters of Engineering from MIT.<eos> I went to MIT.<eos> Did you have Martinez?<eos> I think I was there quite a few years before you, but I will take the compliment.<eos> And I will offer you one in return.
Rick?<eos> Jeez, I haven't seen you since graduation.<eos> You look great.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> You break my father out of prison yet?<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> Can't or won't?<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> That's not how this works.<eos> Now, why don't you try and play nice, Kara?
I remember when Alex had the chicken pox, I was eating lunch by myself.<eos> You came and sat with me.<eos> I was 14.<eos> And I didn't have the nice house or the perfect family that you and your sister had.<eos> You think we had it easy?<eos> You have no idea what Alex sacrificed for me.<eos> Or what I was going through!<eos> Why, because you had to hide your superpowers?<eos> I was hiding bruises!<eos> Do you have any idea what it's like to have your mother tell you you're garbage every single night?
Let him sweat it a while.<eos> We got what we wanted.<eos> What?<eos> All we know is how he knows my identity.<eos> We know that Rick's pinned his whole sense of self-worth on Peter Thompson.<eos> Thompson is the key to getting Alex back.<eos> Do you like what you see?<eos> It's all very interesting.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> I want to give you elevator access, so you can come up to this floor without an escort.
I was looking through your designs and there's a small problem.<eos> It requires an element that doesn't exist on Earth.<eos> You see, we have 118, and this would be categorized at 260.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> I think you do.<eos> It was when I thanked the gods at dinner, wasn't it?<eos> You're an alien.<eos> And this device just proved it.<eos> Red is never good on this planet.<eos> I don't know who you are, but I am not helping you build anything.

Well, you really nailed his essence, I'll give you that.<eos> - What?<eos> - I mean, that thing...<eos> He couldn't decide whether to hug me or not.<eos> That's vintage Dad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My father would never be playing these games.<eos> He'd be wanting to get the hell away from here and making sure that he never went back to prison.<eos> I've been planning this for a year.<eos> Did you really think I didn't prepare for you,
Kara!<eos> I sent out a signal, I thought you were coming.<eos> He re-routed the IP address.<eos> He sent us somewhere else.<eos> Do you have any idea where you are?<eos> I was unconscious.<eos> I could be hours away or I could be in the city.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Alex, it's Rick.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
See, there's a lifetime of firsts that we're going to do together.<eos> So, you hold on, okay?<eos> Hold on until I get to you.<eos> You promise.<eos> Promise me!<eos> I...<eos> What?<eos> Alex!<eos> What happened?<eos> I told you not to rush in.
I got her to be herself, Kara.<eos> I have just as much to lose as you.<eos> You should've listened to me.<eos> I thought I made myself clear.<eos> Our business is done.<eos> Now get out of my office before I call security.<eos> I'm the one who hasn't made myself clear, Lena.<eos> And I'm sorry for that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I lied to you.
Now get out of my office before I call security.<eos> I'm the one who hasn't made myself clear, Lena.<eos> And I'm sorry for that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I lied to you.<eos> I pretended to be of this world but only because I know how much your mother loathes aliens.<eos> And I presumed you'd be the same.<eos> That's what people do when they hear I'm a Luthor.<eos> They presume.<eos> Everything else I told you was the truth.
I don't work with people I can't trust.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> You are nothing like your mother.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Please, Lena.<eos> Don't let my one lapse in judgment keep us from doing great things.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> That's all I can ask.<eos> Lena.<eos> Kara. I'm glad I caught you. Um...
Don't let my one lapse in judgment keep us from doing great things.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> That's all I can ask.<eos> Lena.<eos> Kara. I'm glad I caught you. Um...<eos> Can I ask your advice about something?<eos> Someone.<eos> Now's not a good time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I call you back?
Bye.<eos> Thanks, brother.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Look who it is.<eos> You know what?<eos> I love these falafels. Do you?<eos> Because they are, like, the best in the city.<eos> I gotta say.<eos> Yeah, they are the best in the city.<eos> You know that because I told you about this falafel stand.
Wait!<eos> You know the attack on Simmons Square? Yeah.<eos> What about it?<eos> That woman.<eos> The one with all the crazy powers?<eos> Everyone's looking for her, right?<eos> I know where she lives.<eos> Wait!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
It's okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> It's all right, see?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> We've been in here a long time.<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> Mmm. This is a really good burger.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here with me.<eos> I'm just trying to help you, Marcus.
I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> It's all right, see?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> We've been in here a long time.<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> Mmm. This is a really good burger.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here with me.<eos> I'm just trying to help you, Marcus.<eos> I'm trying to help you and your mom.

This is a really good burger.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here with me.<eos> I'm just trying to help you, Marcus.<eos> I'm trying to help you and your mom.<eos> I promise you that.
It's a bunch of satellites.<eos> - The skies are clear.<eos> - Yeah. Good.<eos> That's... That's what I thought.<eos> It's good.<eos> Still isn't working?<eos> Was it me throwing it down in disgust or the sparks that gave it away?<eos> Can you give us a minute?<eos> Failure is a part of the process, Lena.<eos> I told you this was going to take time.
I told you this was going to take time.<eos> It's not about time. I'm just not getting it.<eos> You know, maybe we should pay a visit to Stryker Island.<eos> Get Lex Luthor to come in and save the day.<eos> You think he could get this working?<eos> Lex was the genius who was supposed to save the world.<eos> You know, I...<eos> I just thought if I could make this work, I would prove to the world and to my mother that I was as good as the golden boy.<eos> I think most of all, I just wanted to prove it to myself.<eos> You don't have to prove anything.
You know, I...<eos> I just thought if I could make this work, I would prove to the world and to my mother that I was as good as the golden boy.<eos> I think most of all, I just wanted to prove it to myself.<eos> You don't have to prove anything.<eos> You're smarter than Lex.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not saying that to make you feel better.<eos> I'm saying it as a scientist.<eos> As someone who knows.<eos> But you need to stop trying to think like your brother.
Marcus.<eos> Marcus.<eos> Is there anything I could get for you or your nephew?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> Um, actually...<eos> A couple of milkshakes and some curly fries from Noonan's would be great.<eos> - Sure thing.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're gonna love the curly fries.
Is there anything I could get for you or your nephew?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> Um, actually...<eos> A couple of milkshakes and some curly fries from Noonan's would be great.<eos> - Sure thing.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're gonna love the curly fries.<eos> Have you ever had curly fries?<eos> You're...
My father was a soldier, too.<eos> Marcus, where is your father?<eos> He died when we were escaping our planet.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that.<eos> I know how that can be.<eos> It can be beyond hard.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Did we have a date?<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> No, I just thought I'd surprise you.
I didn't.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I went and checked, and my parents' ship definitely had left for Daxam a few weeks ago.<eos> But thinking I saw her, it... I thought it would make me feel anger.<eos> But I felt, um... Other... Other stuff...<eos> I hate that I still care about her. Hey, we can't will ourselves to not feel anything.<eos> Life doesn't work like that.<eos> On Daxam, that's exactly what we'd do.<eos> We'd drug ourselves, so we literally didn't feel anything.<eos> You're allowed to miss her.
You were right, J'onn.<eos> This is a DEO matter.<eos> I should not have involved myself.<eos> James.<eos> Look, I know what I said earlier on, but we could really use your help here.<eos> It has to be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm black?<eos> You look the same as he does too.<eos> - Why don't you talk to him?
We will find you.<eos> You have no idea where I am or what I'm doing.<eos> How does it feel to be powerless?<eos> If this is about Mon-El, you have to come to terms with the fact that he chose to stay here.<eos> No, he made a choice to come home, to be king to his people.<eos> And we would have been happy to go, but you were too selfish to allow that.<eos> What's she saying?<eos> Everything I do, I do for my people.<eos> Everything you do for yours is to bolster your broken ego.<eos> You need this planet to worship you, the last daughter of a failed world, because otherwise, your survival means nothing.
Well, what do you wanna do?<eos> Well, they're linked telepathically, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, if I break through to him, maybe he can break through to them.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Why won't it shut down?<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - What I had to do.<eos> For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.
For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?<eos> Marcus.<eos> I need you to look at me.<eos> I told you I would keep you and your mother safe and I am not breaking that promise.
Where the hell am I?<eos> I've been taking care of you ever since Supergirl nearly killed you when she attacked our portal.<eos> Supergirl tried to stop you.<eos> I should have stopped you.<eos> You lied to me and used me.<eos> I did what I had to do for my people.<eos> But I did it for you, too.<eos> I meant what I said on the ground.<eos> You are a marvel.<eos> And I know that you are meant for bigger things, better things.
Surely we don't need to measure anything.<eos> We're women.<eos> We're tough, we're wise, and we're way above this pettiness.<eos> So let's just roll up our sleeves and talk peace.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> I'm Cat Grant.<eos> Known on Earth as Queen of All Media.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, Cat Grant, I'm Rhea, and Earth now has a new Queen.<eos> Oh, well, let me just give you a little bit of friendly advice, Rhea.
One that we can carry out without you.<eos> Not quite.<eos> My cybernetic core has been enhanced.<eos> I can interface with the onboard Daxamite computer system.<eos> We'll pass through undetected.<eos> Cool.<eos> Not cool.<eos> And when we're on board, Alex can wrestle back control of the positron cannon at the DEO.<eos> It'll be a tight squeeze to find Lena and Mon-El before she fires.<eos> I suspect you're up to the challenge.
And now it's time to go.<eos> I'm not a fan of the alien invaders, but I have to say, they did nice work here.<eos> I thought we were on the same team now!<eos> What are you...<eos> Hey.<eos> What you said before about Maggie, if, um...<eos> If she was on that ship...<eos> You were right.<eos> I'd do anything that I could to save her.<eos> So, you better hurry.
Humans only, dear.<eos> Disable the projector.<eos> Danvers, this is Lillian Luthor.<eos> We're clear of the supership and safe.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Turn it back on, Mother.<eos> I came for you.<eos> Not them.<eos> Supergirl helped you.
Your time is up, Agent Danvers.<eos> The positron cannon is ready to fire.<eos> You need to use it.<eos> Alex, do you read?<eos> Supergirl stayed up there!<eos> Madam President, I need more time.<eos> You have your orders.<eos> Now complete your mission.<eos> It's over, Rhea.<eos> I came back to give you one last chance to do the right thing.
Previously on Ray Donovan...<eos> I know what I'm asking you to do is dangerous, but I'm out of options.<eos> I got nowhere else to turn but family.<eos> I don't expect your help.<eos> God knows I don't deserve it.<eos> If any of you want to walk out of this room right now, I wouldn't blame you.<eos> Fuck you, Frank.<eos> You want Sokolov, we do it my way.<eos> Wear the fucking shirt, Ray, or you're done.
What's that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You got a pen?<eos> What you doing, Mick?<eos> Writing a screenplay.<eos> It's gonna be a killer.<eos> Ooh, writing.<eos> I didn't even know you could read.<eos> And I didn't know gas stations sold women's clothes.<eos> You got a B on your health inspection.
I know it's weird.<eos> I-I called one of the nurses at the hospital.<eos> Uh, how... how's your mom?<eos> She, um...<eos> She, um...<eos> Oh, my Go... I'm so sorry.<eos> Aw, man.<eos> I didn't mean to, um... I'm gonna go. I'm sorry.<eos> Well, hey, can... can I... Can I walk with you for a second?<eos> Don't you have to work?
That better?<eos> It was better when she died.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Write what you know, Mick.<eos> You're late.<eos> I had wrestling practice.<eos> Jay, brah, you and I both know that a rich, powerful black man in America...<eos> It's a three-hole punch, Bunch.<eos> - Huh? - Well, I didn't know.<eos> Yeah, you did, 'cause I told you last time.
Four fucking people work here.<eos> Not just three.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> What's going on, Bunch?<eos> - Daryll's not counting me.<eos> - What?<eos> And Lena, bossing me around with paper and fucking coffee.<eos> Jesus fucking...<eos> I moved my family back from Pismo Beach for you, Ray.<eos> I'm here to help you.
I miss Avi.<eos> Have you talked to him?<eos> No.<eos> Like, I wouldn't set this up unless I knew that we could make something happen.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Let's do this. - You're in the right place.<eos> You're in the right place messing with us.<eos> Yes.<eos> Jay White, I'd like to introduce you to the man himself, my brother Ray Donovan.
How are you happy like this?<eos> Well, I'm with you. Um...<eos> I'm high.<eos> There's birds outside chirping.<eos> I never hear birds in New York.<eos> Just got to listen.<eos> See?<eos> Hey, do... Do you... do you want to, like, hang out?<eos> I could go get a bottle of wine or something or... Is... is that cool?<eos> Do... do you have to go?
I have a good feeling about this couple.<eos> Three kids, moving here from Evanston, Illinois.<eos> Can you meet me at the house?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, Con.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You make varsity?<eos> Got to cut weight, but, yeah.<eos> What are you cutting to?
Sure.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, Con.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You make varsity?<eos> Got to cut weight, but, yeah.<eos> What are you cutting to?<eos> One thirty-eight.<eos> Call Terry.<eos> He'll give you a hand.
Did you bring any dolls?<eos> Dools?<eos> No, why?<eos> My uncle always gives me dolls.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's not time to play games.<eos> There's much to do tomorrow.<eos> To sleep now.<eos> Many thanks, children.<eos> These are for you.
I need to sleep.<eos> With these power cuts, and storms...<eos> I don't like storms.<eos> The kids neither.<eos> Àngel says they make him feel small.<eos> Another of Àngel's existencial problems.<eos> Who prescribes your drugs to you?<eos> The kids uncle is a doctor.<eos> He studied many years.<eos> Your therapist doesn't prescribe you anything?
Psychologically it's unacceptable.<eos> Vulnerable to what?<eos> Àngel!<eos> Àngel, what are you doing here?<eos> Bats.<eos> Th-they come here to sleep.<eos> Who was the man who was here?<eos> Which man?<eos> There was a man a minute ago here.<eos> For sure Ema told you that.
Same as the other.<eos> And I'm gonna kill you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Calm down.<eos> - Clara!<eos> - Yes?<eos> You didn't tell me everything<eos> You need to tell me now. Why did Àngel say I was a 'bitch like the other'.<eos> Who is 'the other'?<eos> I see their uncle didn't tell you everything.
With the man.<eos> I'm the man of your dreams!<eos> Why are you standing there in front of me?<eos> Trying to impress me?<eos> I've seen bigger than that.<eos> Go get dressed.<eos> You never had a boyfriend!<eos> What?<eos> Clara told me.<eos> And what else did she tell you?
Today no because thankfully I was there.<eos> So when did the abuse take place?<eos> They are victims of abuse the whole time.<eos> Especially the boy.<eos> He goes with him often.<eos> The boy goes to see the man?<eos> No, the man comes and takes him away.<eos> Kid, when did you last see him?<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> Don't lie to him, tell him the truth. Or we won't be able to help you.
Get away from here, get away!<eos> Let me in!<eos> Ema, open this door!<eos> Clara tell him to leave!<eos> Tell the kids to open!<eos> - Tell that man to leave!<eos> - But which man?<eos> That one!<eos> Open the door!<eos> - Clara will bring you your pills!
- Biophile.<eos> - What?<eos> Biophile.<eos> It must be illegal.<eos> - I think the time has come to seek help.<eos> - Yes!<eos> We need help.<eos> Because the police won't do anything and we must tell their uncle.<eos> Yes, you're right we must tell the uncle.<eos> What's wrong, you're feeling ill?
- Yes!<eos> We need help.<eos> Because the police won't do anything and we must tell their uncle.<eos> Yes, you're right we must tell the uncle.<eos> What's wrong, you're feeling ill?<eos> You're feeling tired?<eos> - I don't know, I'm hot.<eos> - You're hot?<eos> Well, let's go to your room.<eos> You'll be more relaxed there.
Well, let's go to your room.<eos> You'll be more relaxed there.<eos> Come, come.<eos> Today you'll be a bird.<eos> But you won't be able to fly.<eos> Take, this will calm you down.<eos> Medicinal<eos> After the parents were murdered we came four times.<eos> We have little time.<eos> Why don't you come with me?
After the parents were murdered we came four times.<eos> We have little time.<eos> Why don't you come with me?<eos> So?<eos> I don't like girls.<eos> They smell bad.<eos> My son neither.<eos> But you can't stay like that all your life.<eos> It didn't help my poor Marcelito.<eos> I'm sure you'll start liking it.
But you can't stay like that all your life.<eos> It didn't help my poor Marcelito.<eos> I'm sure you'll start liking it.<eos> In any case, I'll be waiting for you.<eos> Your uncle will arrive soon.<eos> - Who prescribes your drugs?<eos> - Their uncle is a doctor.<eos> Medicinal<eos> And now I'm cutting your wings.<eos> If he'd told you, you wouldn't have come.
He made them hate me.<eos> You never accept any faults do you?<eos> The only person they loved after their parents was José.<eos> And you want to dirty everything because of jealousy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I thought we were in this together, to help them.<eos> Help them?<eos> From what?<eos> They saw their own parent murdered in front of them, that's not enough for you?<eos> You need to add more traumas for you to feel good?
And you want to dirty everything because of jealousy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I thought we were in this together, to help them.<eos> Help them?<eos> From what?<eos> They saw their own parent murdered in front of them, that's not enough for you?<eos> You need to add more traumas for you to feel good?<eos> Murdered?<eos> So, ...it's true that the previous one killed them?<eos> That idiot policeman told you?
I'm going to go put the boys to bed.<eos> I am so close to getting Axe.<eos> You will get him... on something else.<eos> Sandicot is a circle.<eos> It leads right back to you.<eos> I think I'll get Axe on something else.<eos> Everybody pays.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> I understand, Terry. And that's why if I get paid on time next week, which, when you're a contractor, you never really know.<eos> But then, of course I pay you, Terry, right away, first fucking thing I do.
This might be like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Golden frog poison.<eos> I tried to smoke it once. Shaman jumped across the tent to stop me.<eos> And glad I am that he did. Otherwise, I would have to enact this rich pageant without your good and wise counsel.<eos> The deal goes out at $18 dollars a share tomorrow.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> I'm worth $125 million dollars.<eos> Yeah, you may well be soon enough, but don't allow yourself to feel it just yet.<eos> That clouds the thinking at the exact moment when you need to be clear-headed.
I'm selling my share of the firm to my partners.<eos> It's been a long time coming. Tomorrow is liberation day.<eos> You never tally your sheet until the lockup period is over, but even I have to admit it does feel great.<eos> You did a good thing here, son.<eos> You absolutely did.<eos> I hope that's true, Dad.<eos> I really do.<eos> Is this...<eos> Weird?<eos> I was gonna say "feeling as right to you,"
Wait a sec.<eos> You're doing it off the chart?<eos> The chart makes it clear.<eos> And right before bonus time.<eos> That's cold, even by my standards.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's not how we do it here, on paper, not like that.<eos> Asymmetrical returns, right?<eos> Not just in the stocks, but in our people, too.<eos> I need you to sit down with each one of them. I want you to probe for their strengths and for their weaknesses. I want you to figure out who's gonna outperform your data and who has already had his best year.
Wow.<eos> Why the flower bomb?<eos> Because I still feel like things aren't right between us, and I don't like it.<eos> And I want them to be.<eos> Well, these are unnecessary... but beautiful.<eos> He's trying to dig himself out?<eos> Man picked an appropriate shovel.<eos> Do you realize that at this number, I'm worth close to a quarter of a billion dollars?<eos> Up high, kid!<eos> I'm gonna get an Ice Juice from the fridge. You want one?
He's still finding his footing. But he's scrappy and deserves the chance.<eos> So I fired Pununzio instead.<eos> He's kind of a weasel.<eos> Good a reason as any.<eos> And now you're baptized by blood.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> Like a real drink?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe like a whole bottle of a real drink.<eos> You're not gonna be in that clown car for long.
Like a real drink?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe like a whole bottle of a real drink.<eos> You're not gonna be in that clown car for long.<eos> I love it.<eos> It's a great car.<eos> Look, I didn't want to do this on site.<eos> That's why I offered to take you to coffee.<eos> Do what?<eos> This is for you.
It's a great car.<eos> Look, I didn't want to do this on site.<eos> That's why I offered to take you to coffee.<eos> Do what?<eos> This is for you.<eos> Open it up.<eos> That's $250,000 dollars... as a personal thank-you from me to you, on Klaxon.<eos> I'm well-compensated, more than well-compensated.<eos> Yeah, officially and on the books, with records of the transactions everywhere.<eos> But I wanted to spiff you above that.
Pounded a company he's in.<eos> Your friends at the bar helped. Everyone stepped up.<eos> Good.<eos> Those don't look like Bruno's.<eos> Fuck Bruno.<eos> Ryan did those up in the wood-burning oven.<eos> Remember our real first date?<eos> Caviar.<eos> I was trying to dazzle you.<eos> Well, you did.
I believe I can do all that.<eos> Bittersweet day for me today, Dake.<eos> Why's that, sir?<eos> You must have impressed some people while you were in New York, the Attorney General among them.<eos> Sir?<eos> You've been named interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District.<eos> I've been named...<eos> A.G. said, "Smarts and ambition are coming off him"<eos> like heat waves from an Oklahoma blacktop."<eos> You've got to get on the train.
Nobody is watching this.<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> Hey.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> I'm on my way in.<eos> John.<eos> You didn't say that you found Katie Pine.<eos> Who told you about that?
Where's Keith?<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> Hey.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> I'm on my way in.<eos> John.<eos> You didn't say that you found Katie Pine.<eos> Who told you about that?<eos> You shouldn't be thinking about that.
Phones have been ringing off the hook.<eos> Now we've got press coming from all over.<eos> Commanda?<eos> Hold up.<eos> Hey.<eos> Question for you.<eos> Do you have any reason to believe there is money being laundered through Thunderbird Casino?<eos> Well nothing organized, just small stuff.<eos> You know who's doing it?<eos> Point you in a direction.
The killer had Katie Pine for over a week, finished off Curry in just four days.<eos> Might be nothing.<eos> Might be situational.<eos> Or he's accelerating.<eos> Isn't that how these guys work?<eos> It takes more and more to get them excited so they speed up through their routines.<eos> He might be tired of Keith already.<eos> Drink.<eos> Okay Keith, this is gonna be very hard to watch but I need you to watch it.<eos> So if you can't keep your eyes open, I can help you.
- Nah-ha.<eos> I'm not happy. - Hello, boys.<eos> Not happy at all.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Nooo!<eos> You have smitten us down.<eos> Whatcha doin'?<eos> I'm just, uh, teaching Aiden the fine art of smiting the people.<eos> So I, uh, I ran into Don today.<eos> He said that you should come by.
Nooo!<eos> You have smitten us down.<eos> Whatcha doin'?<eos> I'm just, uh, teaching Aiden the fine art of smiting the people.<eos> So I, uh, I ran into Don today.<eos> He said that you should come by.<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay. Right.<eos> Yeah, today at four.<eos> He said that he's had some turnover lately and he could probably get you some shifts.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> Your staff that night.<eos> Names and numbers.<eos> Write 'em down, please.<eos> And any customers you recall, any regulars.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah, write those down too.<eos> And then we'll be out of your hair.<eos> Toxicology says Todd Curry had a, a cocktail of drugs in his system, prescription stuff, stuff a doctor wouldn't mix.<eos> No 'cause it will make you sick.
So, uh, a few nights ago a client of yours cashed out,<eos> which means that you probably sold him some chips recently.<eos> Would you happen to have any of that money left that he paid?<eos> Is this a shakedown?<eos> No.<eos> Because look around, there's not a lot you can pull out of me here.<eos> This is not a shakedown, Francis.<eos> If you'd open your eyes, you'd see that something positive was happening here.<eos> How's that?<eos> Well I'm coming for your help, which means I'm not coming for you.

This is the VCR thing?<eos> It's not his business.<eos> Yeah, well, it's not like he's gonna tell anybody.<eos> Well,<eos> I don't like it, Eric, so don't do it.<eos> Your mother is nothing, Edie.<eos> She's a hole in the air.<eos> I want you to think about how you're gonna finish Keith off, okay?<eos> Picture it.<eos> 'Cause once you do it, no one's gonna hurt you again.
'Cause once you do it, no one's gonna hurt you again.<eos> Tonight you say goodbye to the little girl who your mom shit on and say hello to whoever you want to be.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> I got a truck with a busted transmission and I'm down a driver to the flu so,<eos> clients calling left and right.<eos> Heavy is the head that wears the crown, eh?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> So, I ran into my sister.<eos> That's okay, Don.<eos> I know she called you, you don't have to pretend.
Well how good of you to provide him with that opportunity.<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> No. It was my call.<eos> This is new ground for him.<eos> He'll savour it.<eos> It buys us time and if I'd asked you wouldn't have let me bring her on stage.<eos> You're damn right I wouldn't have.<eos> Because you just might have given this guy the climax that he was after and now he's gonna finish the kid off.<eos> We can share this.<eos> You don't have to carry the whole thing.
Is there anything you want to tell your parents?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Like if you, like if you could talk to them.<eos> What would you say?<eos> Would you say you love them?<eos> WHAT ELSE?<eos> We're gonna give them something!<eos> We're gonna give them a message.<eos> Give it some thought.<eos> I'm not gonna let you torture them.

Oh, I know.<eos> No one's work is as important as yours, God knows.<eos> Which is sort of the point.<eos> Why did she promise to come?<eos> To your dinner?<eos> To my dinner.<eos> Knowing how busy she is.<eos> It's like she set it up to fail.<eos> We're trying to have a kid.<eos> She tell you that?
Knowing how busy she is.<eos> It's like she set it up to fail.<eos> We're trying to have a kid.<eos> She tell you that?<eos> That's none of my business.<eos> Yeah, well, here's something detective-y for ya.<eos> I was searching for her cigarette stash, I know she's smoking again, which I'm thinking it's not cool, right, for the baby but, the joke's on me because<eos> I didn't find any cigarettes, I found these.<eos> You're drunk.<eos> You want to think about what you're doing.
You cleaned up.<eos> It's done. It was nothing.<eos> It was fluids mostly.<eos> Where did you run into him?<eos> In a bar.<eos> You could have called me.<eos> I would have...<eos> I didn't want to interrupt whatever you were doing.<eos> I-I was just catching up on paperwork.<eos> Thank you.
- Shh-shh-shh.<eos> - Untie me! Untie me!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Oh my God. Before they come.<eos> There's a woman upstairs sleeping upstairs.<eos> - Unite me. Untie me.<eos> - Be quiet.<eos> - Please!<eos> Please! Please!<eos> - You gotta be quiet now.
Previously on Cardinal...<eos> Just please tell me why you're doing this.<eos> You should be happy.
Hey.<eos> You should have told me you were coming.<eos> I'd have got you a flight.<eos> You would have said not to come.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Anyway, I like the bus.<eos> Well it's just it's not a great time, Kel.<eos> I know.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> I thought you can use some company.
It's Woody Baldwin.<eos> Dammit.<eos> Edie, what's going on?<eos> I-I dropped my earring.<eos> Jesus.<eos> There it is.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> It's, it's stupid, I tripped on the steps at my house.<eos> I, um, hit my head on the railing.<eos> You need to see a doctor.
There it is.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> It's, it's stupid, I tripped on the steps at my house.<eos> I, um, hit my head on the railing.<eos> You need to see a doctor.<eos> I did.<eos> He said I'm fine.<eos> You should go home.<eos> Rest.<eos> I'll get someone to cover for you.
It's in the vest!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Eric.<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> John!<eos> We checked every inch of the school.<eos> There's no sign of Keith London.<eos> We're looking for a body, aren't we?<eos> You should go to the hospital, get that looked at.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nothing broken.<eos> He's gonna need a change of clothes.<eos> Yeah. I'll get it.<eos> Chateau Guay Motel.<eos> What happened?<eos> They got Eric.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I could tell them that he hurt you.
Are you aware of the support services available to you?<eos> I am.<eos> Because these things, they stay with you.<eos> Lidstrom?<eos> Got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got you, John.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Gran, my hands are full.<eos> Do you want your steam or not?
Maybe, but why the cocktail?<eos> Why not just a simple tranquilizer and be done with it?<eos> Because he's not a doctor, he doesn't know any better.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> I'm asking.<eos> Are we missing a piece?<eos> You're being investigated for corruption.<eos> That's why I was transferred to CIS.<eos> I told you, there's nothing to find.
Are you hungry?<eos> People keep bringing me food.<eos> I just wanted to let you know I've completed my investigation.<eos> I'm submitting my report to Sergeant Musgrave this afternoon.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> In Financial you find someone who broke the law.<eos> You do the math.<eos> You nail him.<eos> Black and white.<eos> The task you have been given, you're gonna have doubts.
You know, he didn't want me to come here.<eos> He doesn't think I can handle it.<eos> It's me he's trying to protect.<eos> John, you know you're not supposed to be here.<eos> Go home.<eos> I'm not staying.<eos> Let SIU do their thing.<eos> I just wanted to say thanks.<eos> You're good at your job, Noelle.<eos> You don't need me to tell you that but...
I work at a pharmacy.<eos> He's in the system.<eos> Divalproex Sodium.<eos> That's what he got.<eos> It's a mood stabilizer.<eos> That'd be for my mom.<eos> But should you really be talking about that?<eos> It's kind of private.<eos> Do you think he'll be long, your dad?<eos> Tell you what.
Whatever you have to do.<eos> I just want it to be over.<eos> Your call to Corbett.<eos> You wouldn't record it and then erase it.<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> You'd talk in person.<eos> Leave no trace.<eos> It happened.<eos> You know it did.<eos> How much did he pay you?
It makes no sense.<eos> You'd talk in person.<eos> Leave no trace.<eos> It happened.<eos> You know it did.<eos> How much did he pay you?<eos> Enough.<eos> Criminal conspiracy.<eos> Obstruction of justice.<eos> What was it worth to you?
Talk.<eos> Sir,<eos> Cardinal's not a rat.<eos> There's no connection between him and Corbett.<eos> We're not done looking.<eos> If your unsanctioned investigation into Cardinal continues,<eos> I'll make it known.<eos> Sergeant, with respect, I know you're looking for a reason you haven't got Corbett all these years but it's not Cardinal.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry.

You Cool with the one on the left?<eos> - Mike, I'm with Lucy.<eos> - Who?<eos> My girlfriend, Lucy. Hi.<eos> How you doing?<eos> We... we're... we're dating.<eos> Still?<eos> - Josh, step into my office.<eos> - Ay.<eos> So what do you think of my office?
we had lots of fun. - Yeah, it was cool...<eos> - Totally. Runnings.<eos> Cool runnings.<eos> - What... what does that mean?<eos> - Do you want to go to the bar?<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> And long story short, uh, I'm not allowed to use the bathroom at any Hardee's location across North America ever again. - Wow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's intense.<eos> I can't believe I'm telling you all this really embarrassing, private stuff about myself, you know?

But I just...<eos> I just... I trust you. I can tell you anything.
How does Mike know all this stuff about me?<eos> I'd like to thank my informant, who at this time I will not name... because I'm blanking on it, uh, but it's Josh's girlfriend.<eos> She told me everything.<eos> Just blabbed away.<eos> Hey, Josh... Josh... How could you do that?<eos> The entire world is laughing at me.<eos> Because Mike told everybody, not me.<eos> Yeah, of course Mike told everybody.<eos> I would expect that from him, but not from you.<eos> - I trusted you. - I know.
Of course. That goofy stuff is part of why I love him.<eos> Thanks to you, he hates me now.<eos> Here we go.<eos> He just sent me a really cold text asking if I can meet him downtown 'cause he wants to "tell me something in person."<eos> I'm sure it's fine.<eos> How mad can he be?<eos> Bring out the accused!<eos> Make way for the Lord's work.<eos> You shouldn't have told secrets about Josh.<eos> He opened up to you, and you broke his trust.
And I had to kill him? That's nuts.<eos> I'm a murderer now.<eos> - That's crazy. - Yeah.<eos> Sorry, Lucy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The charges have been dropped!<eos> Wait, you... you still gonna hang someone, though, right?<eos> Uh, no, not today.<eos> Hey, congrats, man. You got a good one.
You know, we can hear you at night.<eos> Drinking mother's red tea in your quarters.<eos> The screaming.<eos> It's not working, is it?<eos> The Witness is always there.<eos> It worked once.<eos> Maybe because he wanted it to.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It could kill you, James.<eos> Or do you even care anymore?
- There's only two of us.<eos> - If we don't go there now,<eos> - we could lose it forever! - That's suicide!<eos> Cassie, Ramse, Jennifer.<eos> This could be our only chance.<eos> Or we could get them all killed.<eos> We should return to the facility and formulate a plan.<eos> You go do that, then.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Jones give you that?
Yeah, it's a machine.<eos> Hey, don't get touchy.<eos> Jesus, maybe we should shave.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Thanks. I remember that one, too.<eos> All right, you had your fun. You got some shots in.<eos> Now tell me what I need to know.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you need to know?
- You are a rabid dog.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You're blind.<eos> - I'm blind.<eos> Then tell me what I'm missing.<eos> Tell me the future.<eos> Jennifer.<eos> Jennifer Goines?<eos> Turns out the key to the universe is chock full of nuts.<eos> - You need her.
The house.<eos> Cassie.<eos> That's the only life we managed to erase.<eos> I didn't come here today to save Cassie.<eos> This is a long fight.<eos> You're only halfway there.<eos> It's gonna hurt.<eos> Things inside of you are gonna break.<eos> Things you never even knew you had.<eos> I'm gonna tell you something I probably shouldn't.

-Thirteen months.<eos> Style section.<eos> Oh, that would explain why I don't know you.<eos> Man's tie is a window into his soul.<eos> We just ran a piece on it.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So, uh, what does my tie say about me?<eos> It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.<eos> Anyway, recognized you, just wanted to say hi.<eos> I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.
We're reaching out to as many people as we--<eos> Did we just lose them?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> The Ohio governor is calling from a payphone.<eos> This is the president.<eos> Mr. President, I've changed my mind.<eos> If the offer's still open,<eos> I'd like to accept additional troops for the state of Ohio.<eos> Just say the word, Roger.<eos> Whatever you need.
It is wonderful what one can achieve if one tries.<eos> Between ourselves, Llanabba hasn't a very good name in the profession.<eos> We class our schools into four grades here -- leading schools, first-rate schools, good schools, and schools.<eos> The status of this school is... school.<eos> And school is pretty bad.<eos> Dr Fagan can hardly expect all those things for the salary he's offering.<eos> Das ware lacherlich...<eos> Ja?<eos> Ja.<eos> Oh, well, I think you'll find it very suitable.
Hm!<eos> I know all about you.<eos> Follow me.<eos> This is the common room.<eos> Wait here, please.<eos> Come in here, you.<eos> - Yes, Captain Grimes.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> What do you mean by whistling when I told you to stop?
I've met two of them. Yes.<eos> Yeah? They're both bitches.<eos> I'm engaged to be married to Flossie.<eos> Not the male-looking one, the haybag.<eos> They're both fairly masculine.<eos> Yeah. We haven't announced it yet, so keep it to yourself. Nobody knows.<eos> - I might not go through with it.<eos> - Right. No.<eos> Chop chop! I'm thirsty!<eos> How are you finding your mob?
Sorry, who are you?<eos> Please don't say you're called Tangent.<eos> I'm Beste-Chetwynde, sir.<eos> I think you're teaching me the organ this morning.<eos> Oh -- yes.<eos> Well, are you terribly good?<eos> Erm...<eos> Did you go to the pub last night, sir?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> I expect you're wondering how I came to be here.
I expect you're wondering how I came to be here.<eos> If things had worked out differently, I'd still be a rector in Worthing, my own house and a church and a congregation.<eos> It was all very pleasant... at first.<eos> Until my doubts began...<eos> Were they as bad as all that?<eos> They were insufferable.<eos> And they arrived very suddenly one day, while I was having tea with some friends of my mother.<eos> I suddenly realised... .. that I couldn't understand... .. why God had made the world.<eos> At all.<eos> No, I mean... I could understand that once you're granted the first step, everything else follows.
But why did God begin it all in the first place?<eos> The Bishop thought it was a phase that would pass.<eos> It didn't pass.<eos> Eventually I had to resign my living.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Do I smell of drink?<eos> A little.<eos> Comes of having no breakfast.<eos> May I?<eos> Has Prendy been telling you about his doubts?
I have, actually.<eos> It's a funny thing, I can't quite explain it, but I've always felt that one can't be unhappy for long, providing one does whatever one wants.<eos> That's a good philosophy.<eos> I must say that I...<eos> I find the boys utterly intractable.<eos> Do you?<eos> My wig may have something to do with it.<eos> Have you noticed that I... I wear a wig?<eos> - No. I didn't. Do you?<eos> - I told you he does.
Well, I suppose they'd just laugh at something else if it wasn't that.<eos> Yes. Perhaps it's good to localise the target of their ridicule.<eos> It's all very well for you -- the boys admire you.<eos> Losing your leg at Gallipoli, capturing that enemy machine gun.<eos> I can't get my chalk to work on the board.<eos> Yeah, that's because the little turds put varnish on it.<eos> Beat any boy you see doing that.<eos> Well, we must go and face the mutinous beasts again.<eos> Perhaps one day I'll see the light and go back to ministry.<eos> Here you are. You'll want this.
On your marks. Get set. Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Oh, Philbrick?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I've been told to put up more tents. Like a blinking Arab.<eos> This is not what I was made for.<eos> I'm looking for the hurdles.<eos> Oh, they got burned for firewood.<eos> I'll have to order some more.<eos> I suspect you're wondering how I came to be here. At this school.
Does that sound too terribly boring?<eos> - No. No.<eos> - Pennyfeather!<eos> Can I have a word, old chap?<eos> - Would you give me one moment? - Uh-hm.<eos> Oh, dear, I fear I'm in the soup again.<eos> Oh. I see.<eos> One moment's indiscretion and my whole career's in doubt.<eos> If I get fired as a teacher, there really is nothing else one can resort to.<eos> Well, why don't you talk to Dr Fagan?
It's cool.<eos> And that's all there is to it.<eos> Leslie.<eos> What are the terms of my situation, my working situation with Stephen?<eos> You're both going to perform essentially the same tasks more or less until we determine who's better at them.<eos> Like, right next to each other?<eos> Yes.<eos> So do you need me to say much more?<eos> - No. I get it, Tom.<eos> And we were able to help you with it.
What does John do?<eos> We're not supposed to talk about that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, but he called me from somewhere.<eos> He's never done that before.<eos> I saw him.<eos> I was with him.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> I can't say, Alice, for certain.<eos> You mean you don't know, or you're not allowed to tell me because you're a Tavner?
- I can't.<eos> - I'm married.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You were telling me.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's right, right before you stabbed me.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fucking married, so...<eos> Listen. Hey.<eos> I'm going to help you out.
It's just an evidence room.<eos> Police protected.<eos> I stand trial in two weeks for something I'm sure somebody told you about.<eos> People like talking all about it.<eos> I need you to put something in an evidence box.<eos> I need you to get it in there tonight.<eos> I need you to put this box in the other box.<eos> How do you expect me to get in there?<eos> It's not Fort Knox.<eos> I've been helping you all day.
You don't know it.<eos> What do you know about Milwaukee?<eos> - Same as anybody.<eos> - It's an ice box.<eos> Sun hardly shines.<eos> Our economy's factory-based, dwindling since the '60s.<eos> Endemic violent crime in Milwaukee.<eos> Because the premiums were too costly, our police insurance pulled the most vulnerable and harmed police off the street... the slow-witted, the overweight, the twerps, the little ones, the tiny cops, John.<eos> This city did that, this goddamn place, and they stashed them in the evidence room.<eos> So I'm saying you may have to fight off a tiny policemen tonight.

Charlie.<eos> So anyway, with Glen, it all got a little too dark for him, and he snapped.<eos> So you pretty much just want to make a really loud noise.
If he does, I'm going to fire him.<eos> That is cool.<eos> You want to watch?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm jacked about this.<eos> You're hard.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> His Luxembourg numbers were all fucked up.<eos> I had to bring back that nice little Asian kid to shore up his piping.<eos> And hey, if you're missing me, well, I wanted to make a little something special for you... if you are, so...
That is what I did in this instance.<eos> I implemented a plan without authorization.<eos> And in this instance, at this time, the plan began to unravel.<eos> Mr. John Lakeman, you're requested on floor two, interview room 216.<eos> Mr. John Lakeman.<eos> Where's the bag?<eos> Doing great, kid.<eos> Hi, John.<eos> So, John, I decided on my demands.<eos> Let's just say I'll share them with you in Milwaukee, in the good ol' U.S.A.
Got it, man.<eos> Hello.<eos> - John?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Gregory Gordon, McMillan HR. Hey, man.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - How's the trip going?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> So, John, if a new employee is unable to produce the required documentation within 30 days of being hired, the employee must present a receipt for the application for those documents.<eos> So I think you need to get me that.
Yeah.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Happy in what?<eos> Like at work?<eos> Well, it's all connected.<eos> It's actually called the illusion of separation.<eos> Dr. David Bohm.<eos> It deals with the illusion of separation in regard to personal versus professional life.<eos> There is none, essentially.<eos> Anyway, I'm a resource for you at McMillan.

If I Get hurt Real bad<eos> There'd be nothing to fix<eos> Hold or fold<eos> Nothing to lift Or find or transfer<eos> Nothing to sleep on or remember<eos> Nothing to hide, forget Or figure out<eos> Nothing to conceal or carry Break, wear down Wear out or bury<eos> Sweetheart<eos> Hey, it's Ed.<eos> You asked me last week if I would tell you if John wasn't okay.
- Guy on the phone.<eos> - Every time.<eos> Samantha Cantar?<eos> One, two, three, smile.<eos> Carlson Sohns.<eos> Father, husband, public servant, and pretty damn good racquetball player.<eos> Glenn.<eos> Yeah, Tom.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> What do you need?
Samantha Cantar?<eos> One, two, three, smile.<eos> Carlson Sohns.<eos> Father, husband, public servant, and pretty damn good racquetball player.<eos> Glenn.<eos> Yeah, Tom.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Some money and time, some resources, and some faith.<eos> I've been wondering when I can finally pay you back, Tom.
This time, if I go back with no progress, with backward action, then I'm told "no," well... and it actually means no.<eos> It also makes the "no" that I first got, which wasn't really a "no," a real "no."<eos> Then you're fucked.<eos> Well, Tim, I'm almost fucked.<eos> I'm at the extent of my budget.<eos> I'm at the extent of my manpower.<eos> My friends, who I count on, well, they keep dying.<eos> You're probably next.<eos> So can we step on it?<eos> What do you need?
We're gonna work on that.<eos> I've noticed you've been hanging out with Dennis McClaren.<eos> Has that become a valuable workplace friendship for you?<eos> It was.<eos> Then something happened.<eos> Okay, we can address that.<eos> We can make a plan to address that.<eos> How often do you experience stress, John?<eos> More than average probably.<eos> If McMillan provided you with a discount to a local fitness center, would you take advantage of this opportunity?
We can make a plan to address that.<eos> How often do you experience stress, John?<eos> More than average probably.<eos> If McMillan provided you with a discount to a local fitness center, would you take advantage of this opportunity?<eos> Probably not.<eos> I don't know. Maybe.<eos> Like a gym?<eos> Yeah, gym. Fitness center.<eos> Maybe.<eos> John, what time of day do you feel is best best for you to participate in a wellness activity?
I don't know. Maybe.<eos> Like a gym?<eos> Yeah, gym. Fitness center.<eos> Maybe.<eos> John, what time of day do you feel is best best for you to participate in a wellness activity?<eos> Before work, during lunch, after work, or other.<eos> During lunch.<eos> Would you like to participate in a wellness activity?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you like card tricks?
I'm okay.<eos> Just been traveling.<eos> Hey, Lakeman.<eos> Leslie.<eos> I marveled at you today, Lakeman.<eos> Okay.<eos> Marvelously wandering here and there... except to your desk.<eos> Just fucking wandering around, to and fro, all day.<eos> I mean all day.<eos> - How old are you, son? - Thirty-four.
Okay.<eos> Marvelously wandering here and there... except to your desk.<eos> Just fucking wandering around, to and fro, all day.<eos> I mean all day.<eos> - How old are you, son? - Thirty-four.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> That's what you do at 34.<eos> Just wander around.<eos> May I share with you what I was doing at 34?
Ah, thank you, Gayle.<eos> Leslie, can I have a word?<eos> Well, I was just about to dig in, Lawrence.<eos> - Is it important?<eos> - It is, but dig in.<eos> And then stop by my office later this afternoon.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> We wrapped up here.<eos> Luxembourg. Just having a beer at this bar.<eos> Sending a little video message to you and the girls.
I love you guys so much. Can't wait to get home.<eos> I... Holy shit!<eos> Are you choking?<eos> Fuck! What is this?<eos> Herpes simplex one, guy?<eos> But you're choking?<eos> Oh, great. Are you gonna die?<eos> Fuck! What do I do?<eos> I choose life.<eos> I'm gonna give you mouth-to-mouth, guy.
- McClaren, Dennis.<eos> - But you can call me hero.<eos> - Cool Rick.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Yeah, we landed safely.<eos> I had to go straight into work.<eos> Um... Honey...<eos> Audrey, um...<eos> There's something that I have to tell you.
- But you can call me hero.<eos> - Cool Rick.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Yeah, we landed safely.<eos> I had to go straight into work.<eos> Um... Honey...<eos> Audrey, um...<eos> There's something that I have to tell you.<eos> And I'm sorry... to have to tell you this, but I...
I'm repurposing.<eos> Do you want me to help you rip off the other one?<eos> Is it driving you crazy?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> You know that I need symmetry!<eos> - It's hard to look at, huh?<eos> - Now you're just being a bully.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> This is a gift for you.
I could have a football injury.<eos> - I got a wicked headache.<eos> - You shot a guard.<eos> You weren't acting like a responsible gun owner.<eos> I don't care.<eos> - I don't care if he dies.<eos> - And I do? We all think about taking down these cabrones, but we don't act on it 'cause we got things to live for.<eos> You gotta get outta here and see your girl.<eos> Look at me. Hey.<eos> You need to take a timeout, okay?
- And I do? We all think about taking down these cabrones, but we don't act on it 'cause we got things to live for.<eos> You gotta get outta here and see your girl.<eos> Look at me. Hey.<eos> You need to take a timeout, okay?<eos> Why don't you help me clean up?<eos> We could do it together.<eos> Busy hands could help clear your head, huh?<eos> My head hurts, all right?<eos> I want nothing to do with you.<eos> Maybe your shadow can help you play cleanup.
After they seen my cheetah toes, everybody been fightin' over me.<eos> - You see? I told you you'd kill it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You called it.<eos> How about you?<eos> Same shit, same day?<eos> Yeah. Something like that.<eos> You all right, girl?<eos> You sound funny.<eos> Listen, I gotta tell you something.
Don't you be no self-centered bitch when it comes to her.<eos> She doin' all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> She's a good kid.<eos> Well, tell her I'm busting my ass out here, trying to get us set up, so she better not be pullin' shit.<eos> You tell her that from me.<eos> - Yeah, I'll tell her.<eos> - All right.<eos> Mmm. Don't touch.<eos> What, you don't like it when I...
Get... get in. - What?<eos> Trust me, I've seen it done.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - People fit.<eos> Just get in.<eos> Get the fuck in there.<eos> Don't close it all the way. Shhh!<eos> Hey. Let me give you a little preview of how this thing's gonna end.<eos> See, any minute now, your boyfriend will be captured, taken to the bubble, where he will be forced to shit in a bucket.<eos> And you'll be lucky if you're not tossed in there right behind him.
It went through arbitration.<eos> It was... a guard's word against a dead inmate's.<eos> But where there is guilt, there's recourse.<eos> There's always pins that can be pushed under fingernails.<eos> How do you plan on getting to his fingers when you're in here, in a riot, and he's out there, with no charges against him?<eos> Maybe, if you wish hard enough, he'll suddenly decide to sit down and write a confession called "I did it."<eos> Yes... that's good.<eos> - But that's good...<eos> - No, that's not good. Red, let's make a deal.<eos> If you help me out of this, I will write you a glowing commendation for your file.
Yeah, but she's never been a real prisoner a day in her life.<eos> She ain't in mourning. She ain't outraged.<eos> This is our fight, T.<eos> Ours and Poussey's.<eos> And you're gonna let some fuckin' white woman, like, karaoke our song.<eos> That's fucked.<eos> I got this.<eos> You get to keep the laptops?<eos> No, we keep them during the year and then we return them so that they can update or replace them over the summer.<eos> Oh, so what did you think of class?
Oh, so what did you think of class?<eos> I'm sorry we spent so much time on citations.<eos> Erik thinks we need to know MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of these is my brother's.<eos> For chess.<eos> He's a total nerd.<eos> He's at Carnegie Mellon now.<eos> Oh, my God! Do you like musical theater?<eos> Because I have something amazing to show you.
Ruiz!<eos> Maria Ruiz, please!<eos> Please, help me!<eos> Why the fuck would I do that?<eos> It's 120 degrees in here.<eos> The stench... My vomit is almost reaching the rim.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No can do. You know there will be severe consequences for this.<eos> You know that, Ruiz? Riots end, and inmates go to Max with years added to their sentence.<eos> If you help me, I will help you.
You know that, Ruiz? Riots end, and inmates go to Max with years added to their sentence.<eos> If you help me, I will help you.<eos> That's what everyone that's ever fucked me over has said.<eos> What about your kid, Ruiz?<eos> Think about her.<eos> If you help me, I can make sure your sentence doesn't get extended.<eos> Hey, no kicking!<eos> Piscatella already put five more years on my sentence for no fucking reason, all right?<eos> My daughter won't even know my name by the time I get out anyway.<eos> Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?
Not like it's a real paper.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, we ain't quoting secondary sources using APA or MLA, and we ain't studying SAT words or growing salad, and we don't even have a library in this school 'cause it got made into a nursery for our fucking hood rat babies!<eos> Janae.<eos> Two zip codes from here they got laptops and art galleries.<eos> They got so much culture, they ain't even knowin' they stealing' ours.<eos> It's a load of shit.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wish you weren't, but it's true.<eos> The Thurston students are privileged and advantaged, and sometimes you feel like you have to work twice as hard to get half as far, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
Previously on Power...<eos> James St. Patrick, you are under arrest for the murder of Special Agent Gregory Knox.<eos> Julio is the distro now.<eos> He'll keep you in weight.<eos> Ghost put me in charge of this shit.<eos> And Tommy left me in charge of everything.<eos> - I don't feel safe.<eos> - I got you.<eos> I'm giving you as much money as I can.
I was at the penthouse with Tasha when the Feds raided it.<eos> And I met Angela.<eos> The bitch wants blood.<eos> The fuck is going on with Ghost, anyway?<eos> Thought he was supposed to be out by now.<eos> All I know is, he didn't get bail.<eos> I want out.<eos> I want both yours and Tasha's names off the shop's paperwork.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> You're not going anywhere.
Damn right, we can't, and that goes for you two too.<eos> If you were called up to testify under penalty of perjury, you would have to admit that you knew Angela Valdes had romantic relationships with Knox and St. Patrick.<eos> James St. Patrick, a known associate of Thomas Egan, the man your office is trying to prove is Ghost.<eos> And that's the story.<eos> Not Angela and St. Patrick.<eos> The story is St. Patrick and Egan.<eos> The story is St. Patrick and Ghost.<eos> Okay, so what do we do?<eos> Unfortunately, we have to wait for the prosecution's next move.<eos> In the meantime, you need to make some calls on the prison's phone system.
What's upper management saying about Ghost's arrest?<eos> Lying... saying we ain't gonna be touched by it.<eos> But you ain't sticking around to find out, right?<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> We push a shit load of product in my territory.<eos> Maybe your connect might be interested in hearing what I could do for his organization.<eos> A'ight, so listen up.<eos> When somebody orders two bottles of Citrine 2005, you hit 'em with one bottle and a Truth matchbox.<eos> What's in it?<eos> You don't need to know.
Bet, so shit look legit, just in case we get audited.<eos> A'ight, get back to work.<eos> You have a collect call from the Manhattan Correctional Center.<eos> Will you accept the charges?<eos> Yes.<eos> Andre, how are things at the clubs?<eos> Good, James. How are you?<eos> Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to be here a little bit longer than I anticipated.<eos> I heard.<eos> What do you need?
What's poppin'?<eos> Nothin', man.<eos> I'm just tired of all this shit going on with my parents.<eos> My dad didn't make bail. He wants us to come visit.<eos> Does that mean he's guilty?<eos> I told you, I knew your dad for a long time.<eos> He did that shit.<eos> He guilty as fuck.<eos> I knew it.<eos> But you should still go see him.

Tony, this is the last time I'm gonna be able to make this trip by myself.<eos> I am just too damn sick.<eos> I just can't make it.<eos> The oncologist said that he could get me on that experimental treatment, but he's gotta see the cash up front.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> The money didn't come through this time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, it's fuckin' killing me.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> You know, you got enough to worry about in there.

Where'd St. Patrick grow up?<eos> He and Egan are both from Queens.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> You ever play in the snow before?<eos> Nah.<eos> The snow can be unpredictable.<eos> Never know how many inches you're gonna get.<eos> Got you a goddamn blizzard your first time out.
I'll keep a low profile.<eos> But if shit does go sideways and I do get arrested, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Get out!<eos> Tommy, man, I'm sorry.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Y-yo... - Shut up.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Run.<eos> I'll give you a head start.
Or prosecute both of you guys under the Kingpin Statute.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Both laws target organized crime and have Draconian sentencing guidelines against major drug dealers.<eos> You'd both be charged as drug traffickers... And I think you know, I can't win that case.<eos> We're talking about a mandatory life sentence, and if they can prove you killed Lobos or anyone else in the commission of your drug crimes, it gets worse from there.<eos> So they wanna make Tommy the Kingpin because they think he's Ghost.<eos> They're gonna offer me a deal to flip him.<eos> If I know John, yeah.<eos> He loves a snitch.<eos> And I know that's a tough call for you, but now that they got the murder weapon, the fingerprints, and the DNA,
They say it's painless, but actually it's not.<eos> See, the drugs paralyze you, but you conscious.<eos> You feel everything, hear everything, smell everything... Wide awake.<eos> Then you have a heart attack.<eos> Shit all over yourself.<eos> Last one I seen, took the dude a full 45 minutes before he stopped twitching.<eos> That's what's gonna happen to you.<eos> That's exactly what's gonna happen to you.<eos> You had my kids here and you're gonna let their father die for something he didn't do?<eos> I don't know if Proctor told you this, but Jamie's fingerprints were at the crime scene, his DNA was under Greg's fingernails, and they found the murder weapon at Truth.
Tommy.<eos> You sound tired.<eos> I am.<eos> It's good to hear your voice, brother.<eos> How you holding up in there?<eos> Not so good.<eos> If I go down for this, they're giving me the needle.<eos> Fuck out of here, man.<eos> You ain't going out like that. You can't.<eos> You scared?
Go get smarter than your Uncle Tommy.<eos> - All right, see ya.<eos> 'Riq, 'Riq, hold up a minute.<eos> See you, Baby Girl.<eos> See ya.<eos> Yo, man, what's up with you?<eos> Why all the shade to your mom?<eos> Oh, it's nothing. I-I'm fine.<eos> 'Riq, it's an uncle's job to make sure you're all right.<eos> Look, I know it's hard on you.
I don't know. I ain't the god damn post office.<eos> Ms. Grant, you don't have a record.<eos> You haven't committed a crime.<eos> As far as I can tell, you're a good person.<eos> Answer my questions and you can get back to your life, your shop, your son.<eos> If you don't cooperate, I can't help you.<eos> See, the thing is, you already know the answers to these questions you askin' me.<eos> You know when he moved out, when he was sleeping on the couch, when she sold her ring.<eos> Because of you.<eos> He left her for you.
If you had never left Greg for St. Patrick in the first place, Greg would still be alive.<eos> Yes.<eos> Being with James St. Patrick was the biggest mistake of my life.<eos> I blame myself too.<eos> Is that what you want to hear?<eos> And now it seems the best possible outcome ends with both Greg and Jamie dead.<eos> That's the remedy our justice system offers, an eye for an eye.<eos> But I am going to see this through. I would do anything to get justice for Greg.<eos> Anything?<eos> Then you should clear his name and finally admit to being the mole.
Yeah.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I just gotta talk to somebody, go get this warehouse in order.<eos> The Serbs fucked everything up again.<eos> Our first shipment is coming in two days.<eos> - Yo, J. - What's up?<eos> This is the most important shipment of your fucking life.<eos> You know, most guys, they come in here, they want everybody to know how tough they are.<eos> But you're hiding it.<eos> When Biscuit tried to fuck with you, you snapped his wrist like it was a fucking breadstick.
No.<eos> You and Tommy Egan, you come up together, pushing drugs in Queens.<eos> I said I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> All right, wrong guy. All right.<eos> Then you won't mind if I go to that chink prosecutor with this, will you?<eos> Mak?<eos> What do you think he's gonna do if I go to him and tell him I got proof that you're Ghost?<eos> How fast do you think you'll get the needle then?<eos> - What proof?<eos> I ain't telling you shit.
You're either gonna pay me and I'll keep my mouth shut or you ain't gonna pay me and I ain't gonna keep my mouth shut.<eos> Now, what's it gonna be?<eos> What's your fucking price?<eos> Bingo.<eos> 20,000 to this address.<eos> And then every week after that.<eos> And I want Egan to make the drop. 'Cause ain't nobody else gonna be as committed to making sure I get my money and that I lose my singing voice.<eos> Okay?<eos> You get that done.<eos> Hey, Tommy, I was gonna call you.
She's just a family friend, right?<eos> She known me and Ghost a long time, all right?<eos> She seen some things.<eos> But she ain't about that life, you know?<eos> You make sure she doesn't know anything real about your drug business.<eos> Because she's a weak link.<eos> You have the stuff for my ex?<eos> Tommy, it ain't a good situation, but I got it under control.<eos> Just gotta stay cool and trust me.<eos> Trust you?
You know I'm not careless...<eos> James.<eos> Don't say anything else, kay?<eos> James, stop it.<eos> Stop lying.<eos> You did it. I know you did it.<eos> I'm being set up.<eos> You set me up, huh?<eos> Is that why you want me to take your deal?<eos> If you're a man with any ounce of goodness left in you, the man I thought you were, take this deal, stay alive, and spare your wife and kids all the pain you're causing them.
Everybody gonna buy in off-premises.<eos> And no cash on site.<eos> Bring everything in through the front door. And make sure you're seen doing it.<eos> But bring the customers in around the back, so they ain't seen.<eos> That's it. All right?<eos> Let's get it done.<eos> I need a minute, and it can't wait.<eos> What's up?<eos> Julio shut down the drugs in the club 'cause he thinks we got too much heat.<eos> Look, I'm telling you, my bottle system is on lock.
She's doing her best to soldier on, but I don't think she can handle it.<eos> Can I... can I talk to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come here, baby.<eos> It's your father.<eos> Daddy, I'm sorry.<eos> Oh-no-shh-shh-shh.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know how hard this is on you.
You got one of those.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they're just trying to break you.<eos> Angela's deal...<eos> How much time would that be? Don't...<eos> How much time would it be?<eos> We will find a way out.<eos> I promise you.<eos> But you have to trust me.<eos> What you want?
You're welcome.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> I'm not... here because you're innocent, St. Patrick.<eos> I'm here because you can pay and your money will allow me to help those who actually deserve it.<eos> Look, man, I admit I need you.<eos> What I don't need is your judgment.<eos> Wow, that...<eos> That's why you really called me here?<eos> It kills you, doesn't it?<eos> Someone being able to see through you, someone... someone reminding you that you did it the cheap way, just like the rest of these cats in here.
It kills you, doesn't it?<eos> Someone being able to see through you, someone... someone reminding you that you did it the cheap way, just like the rest of these cats in here.<eos> Hey, look, I get it, man.<eos> Y-you have every advantage:<eos> money, polish, intelligence.<eos> And yet still, your choices brought you here.<eos> Look here, man, your parents went to college, right?<eos> Raised you in this big house, big backyard, house full of books, right?<eos> Exactly. So you're the one with the advantages, not me.<eos> Look, man, it's real easy for you to feel superior about my choices when you haven't had to make 'em.

So you're the one with the advantages, not me.<eos> Look, man, it's real easy for you to feel superior about my choices when you haven't had to make 'em.<eos> It's not about education or economics.<eos> It's character, my friend.<eos> Look, you're my client, man. I got your back.<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you get off for this crime, but...
Wait a minute. Wait, what is that? What's on the table?<eos> Can you enhance that?<eos> Ask and ye shall receive.<eos> How long has that breakfast been there?<eos> Three hours.<eos> Why would they put breakfast out so early?<eos> I will tell you why, so that I would sleep through it and they could make jokes about how long I slept, like, "Oh, nice of you to join us", you lazy, unsuccessful loser."<eos> This-this-this is proof.<eos> Can you make me a copy of this? Already done.<eos> Josh, hey. Josh, you want proof?
So maybe I am a parent sympathizer, because I like your parents!<eos> I like your parents.<eos> I don't know why that's a crime.<eos> They're nice to me.<eos> They gave me popcorn.<eos> They showed me a very good movie that I will now never see the ending of, all right?<eos> I'm not gonna spend money just to see the last 14 minutes of it.<eos> No, I'm probably gonna end up "Wikipedia-ing" the synopsis, like an animal!<eos> The point is your parents are nice to me.<eos> And by the way, they're nice to you, too.
Look, look at this stupid book they gave me.<eos> Ooh, you're in for a treat. That book changed my life.<eos> What?<eos> No, that...<eos> No, no. Listen, that's-that's not the point.<eos> I don't need them to save me.<eos> If I want to do an IRA, then that-that's my business, right?<eos> "Do an IRA"? Do you even know what an IRA is?<eos> Uh-huh, it's, like, um, a savings bond.<eos> Do you want me to explain it to you?
- Bye-bye!<eos> - Hey. - Hi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, guess we should probably get going. Josh, wait.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry. - It's okay.<eos> - No, it's not okay.<eos> You were totally right, okay?<eos> I like to think I have my shit together, and then I spend ten minutes with them and I-I feel like I'm a kid again, like a-a stupid kid who wants their parents to say she's good enough.<eos> Thank you for coming. Thanks, Daddy.<eos> I suppose to you've got to get back to the office, or is Monday not a workday for you?
Get your affairs in order.<eos> Tha-thank you.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> - Josh, I got a gig. - What?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, this ad agency, they want me to do some big national campaign.<eos> Oh, my God, this is so...<eos> this is so exciting.<eos> I know, right?<eos> How's work for you?
She's got a new job, which is... that's a good thing; it's a good thing.<eos> But she's, like, hanging out with all these cool, successful people, and I'm worried she's, gonna, like, outgrow me, you know?<eos> Is that-is that crazy?<eos> Dude, come on.<eos> Of course she's gonna outgrow you.<eos> Hmm.<eos> And probably, like, pretty soon.<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Hi.<eos> Josh, how fast can you get ready?
- Wow.<eos> - It is so special.<eos> Thanks, thank you.<eos> Looks like you used a lot of color.<eos> Mm. Really looks like you used a lot of paint.<eos> Thank you, yeah, I did.<eos> Um, Mike?<eos> Dude, I gotta be real. It's not great.<eos> Okay, well, that-that's not constructive or helpful.<eos> What-what part specifically don't you like?
It looks like a painting of me sucking a dog's dick.<eos> And the dog is saying, "Woof, woof, cowabunga."<eos> Thanks for the blow..." Yeah, okay.<eos> Let me rectify.<eos> Just do a last-minute alter-oo.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Okay, what about that?<eos> Is that any better?<eos> - Well, now you're just giving a thumbs-up.<eos> Makes it look like you're really enjoying it.
Stop trying, okay?<eos> Stop trying to be some cool, new dude.<eos> You're driving me crazy. Just please, please just be guy that I met.<eos> I miss that guy.<eos> A lot.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I guess I could try a bit harder at, you know, not trying.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can we go in?<eos> Hey, uh, you want to know something kind of embarrassing?
Killing is a privilege left only to the gods.<eos> Come.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Inside every man, lives a legion, a thousand versions of himself.<eos> One of them is blocking your path forward.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> M.K., your gift is the most powerful I've seen in a long time.<eos> But you're letting someone else control it.<eos> And tonight, you will discover who that person is.<eos> See, these mirrors show you everything you've ever done.
M.K., your gift is the most powerful I've seen in a long time.<eos> But you're letting someone else control it.<eos> And tonight, you will discover who that person is.<eos> See, these mirrors show you everything you've ever done.<eos> Memories so dark, your mind has buried them.<eos> Are you prepared to face them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, breathe.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
Hello, Ryder.<eos> Well, you look like your father.<eos> You look like you survived quite the battle.<eos> Uh, can we bring some food, some wine from the kitchen?<eos> I'm fine, really.<eos> Please, I insist.<eos> What brings you all the way here?<eos> It's the nomads, they raided us.<eos> Quinn always kept my father's people protected.<eos> And now you need my protection.

Delicious.<eos> Tate ran away.<eos> Do you think they'll find him?<eos> They always do.<eos> So?<eos> What's it like?<eos> What?<eos> I've been at this monastery since I was 11, and I've never seen the master take on a novice before.<eos> What's the worst thing you've ever done?<eos> Now imagine that reflecting back at you a thousand times over.
Good people.<eos> We all have.<eos> I'm ready to go back.<eos> And face the mirrors?<eos> To face myself.<eos> So be it.<eos> M.K.!<eos> Mom?<eos> I warned you.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
You're released.<eos> How's our little conqueror?<eos> All ready for his baptism tonight?<eos> He still needs fresh air and sunlight.<eos> If I could just take him out for a little while...<eos> Well, I wish that were possible.<eos> Please, Quinn.<eos> You can't keep us here forever.<eos> Why, you make it sound like you're a prisoner.<eos> Veil, be sensible, we both know how dangerous it is for you out there.
No conscience, no heart, no honor.<eos> I'm not a clipper anymore.<eos> What are you then?<eos> Why don't you try a different rock?<eos> - I don't see you helping.<eos> - Of course I'm helping.<eos> Not gonna get anywhere on an empty stomach, are we?<eos> How you planning on finding this woman of yours anyway?<eos> If she's anywhere, she's in the badlands.<eos> Ah, then you're in luck.
- Of course I'm helping.<eos> Not gonna get anywhere on an empty stomach, are we?<eos> How you planning on finding this woman of yours anyway?<eos> If she's anywhere, she's in the badlands.<eos> Ah, then you're in luck.<eos> 'Cause I'm going that way myself.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Got a bit of unfinished business there.<eos> What kind of business?<eos> What, so you get to be all mysterious and silent and I've got to give you my personal soliloquy?
What, so you get to be all mysterious and silent and I've got to give you my personal soliloquy?<eos> Just get back to your rat. I don't need your help.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You got any idea where you are?<eos> Could be outlying territories.<eos> Makes the badlands look like the goddamn greatlands.<eos> Trying to get out of here alone is just useless as smashing a chain with a rock.<eos> There, that's better.<eos> I told you we'd never get anywhere on an empty stomach.<eos> Oh, you want my help now, huh?
Oh, you want my help now, huh?<eos> Push it.<eos> There!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Oh, where you headed?<eos> North!<eos> I'll hit the badlands eventually.<eos> All right. Fine!<eos> Talked me into it.<eos> This is the last time I'm helping you out.
You just said it yourself the other barons, they have no stomach for a battle.<eos> Nah, they'll wanna avoid bloodshed if at all possible.<eos> Those barons are the people responsible for the system I'm trying to break.<eos> I want you to try diplomacy because it's your only card.<eos> Frankly, we just don't have the resources to fight off another attack if they all come at us together.<eos> And they decide that the best thing for the badlands is to slit my throat...<eos> Well, that being the case, I suggest we draw swords and kill 'em all.<eos> Well, here. Come on.<eos> We're here. What do you think?<eos> I promised you the sun.
When I first came out here, I used to come to this place all the time.<eos> I know.<eos> What do you mean, you know?<eos> You know you brought me here before, right?<eos> When?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Years ago.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When Ezra had you in that weird apartment on Santa Monica Boulevard?
How do I make this thing into a PDF?<eos> What... what's a PDF?<eos> All right.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Hey, guys. Sandy Gagic here.<eos> As most of you are already aware, several nude photos of Natalie James have been leaked online.<eos> The young star is best known for her work in the Waterfall series, and her Golden Globenominated portrayal of a teen prostitute in Wendy Sanborn's Bridgeland.<eos> The images come as a surprise to fans who see James as an American sweetheart.<eos> The actress could not be reached for comment.<eos> Back to you, Karen.
We heard great things about, um, one of your girls from a couple we know.<eos> What was her name again, babe?<eos> London.<eos> Is London here?<eos> You bet she is.<eos> Excuse me, I'll go get her.<eos> All right.<eos> What do you think of this one, honey?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you enjoy SM, London?
Come on.<eos> Are you gonna tell her?<eos> There's nothing to tell, Abs.<eos> I didn't do nothing.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> No matter what you do in your life, you always end up with the right one.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Bernadette was never right for Terry.<eos> Colleen was never right for you.
He's all right.<eos> He's all right.<eos> - Eight.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> You beauty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, how 'bout this guy?<eos> How 'bout him?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you like the fight, Abby?
Police!<eos> Stop!<eos> Can I Taser her?<eos> No!<eos> Let me Taser her!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, thank God for that!<eos> One move and you're down!
You all right?<eos> That's Charli.<eos> How's your sister?<eos> Oh, she's... she's fine.<eos> She's married and she's got a couple of kids.<eos> I just found out I'm pregnant.<eos> You left it late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I suppose I did.<eos> You'll love it.
You met briefly at that golfing thing.<eos> Hey, mate, good to see you again.<eos> And you, and you.<eos> Hi, Syd. Long time.<eos> I thought you'd be earlier.<eos> No, I... I had to go and see Linda.<eos> This is what it takes to get her to come home, you know?<eos> A crime scene.<eos> It's terrible, isn't it?<eos> She was her best friend, has she told you?
You know, you tell people that you're pregnant and they're all, like, "Oh, wow!<eos> "Oh, my God, you're going to be amazing!" Huh!<eos> What if I'm not?<eos> I can't see myself in elasticated jeans, wiping arses.<eos> What?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Now, imagine we have one who looks like her.<eos> Oh, now, she's cute.<eos> You wouldn't mind that face looking up at you.<eos> I'm going to remind you of that when she needs feeding at four o'clock in the morning.
Your life without Stephen.<eos> Get back!<eos> Go on, get back!<eos> See them bastards out there?<eos> 20, 30 journalists, all wanting a piece of us.<eos> This is how innocent people get treated.<eos> Have you seen the photo they're using of him?<eos> They're painting him like a murderer!<eos> It's been a tiring day.<eos> Do you think you should have a rest?

They're painting him like a murderer!<eos> It's been a tiring day.<eos> Do you think you should have a rest?<eos> You know, I'll... I'll run a bath, or something.<eos> I'll make you...<eos> Offer me tea and I'll take your head off!<eos> You were no use in there.<eos> Letting him say whatever he wanted.<eos> This isn't my case.<eos> I told you, Linda, I'm here as a friend.
This isn't my case.<eos> I told you, Linda, I'm here as a friend.<eos> You think I'm kidding myself about Steve, don't you?<eos> Ignoring what's staring me in the face.<eos> I've no idea.<eos> Yeah, well, I do, because I know him.<eos> I've lived with him.<eos> I've held him.<eos> I've had him inside me, and that is not a man that hurts young girls.<eos> I want to help you.
And you!<eos> And you wonder why I never come back.<eos> 'Breaking news tonight.<eos> Polesford resident Stephen Bates has been charged with the murder of teenager Abigail Toms.<eos> Abigail's burned remains were discovered in woodland yesterday.<eos> Poppy Johnston is still missing.<eos> 37-year-old Bates will appear in East Midlands Magistrates' Court tomorrow.<eos> I don't think he killed those girls.<eos> Something doesn't feel right.<eos> Look, do you not think you're getting too close to this?
Your case will be listed in two days from today for a bail hearing before the Crown Court, when a date will be fixed for the preliminary hearing.<eos> Take him down.<eos> Phil, it's me.<eos> Paul.<eos> How's the holiday in murder town?<eos> Oh, it's fine for me.<eos> I think Helen's finding it hard, though.<eos> Yes, well, going home does strange things to people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, that info I sent you, did you get a chance to take a look?
Tell me the story.<eos> It's what I do, Adam.<eos> I sabotage my life.<eos> You know, you think I was unhappy, but maybe it was the opposite.<eos> Maybe I was just terrified of the happiness I was feeling.<eos> Does he know about us?<eos> What do you think?<eos> How about I tell him?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's a great idea, then how about I tell the rest of the force?<eos> Cos that'll go down well, shagging your colleague's girlfriend. You'll be trusted undercover.

You'll be trusted undercover.<eos> Helen, I didn't come here to have a scrap with you.<eos> I came here because...<eos> Yes, to talk to you about the baby, but also to say that, if it is mine... and I reckon there's a pretty high chance it is, don't you...? that I want to be a part of its life.
Is she really worth it?<eos> Linda?<eos> 'You have two new messages and five saved messages.<eos> 'Helen, it's Jenny.<eos> Have you spoken to Paul yet?<eos> Ring me back.<eos> 'Bye.<eos> 'Hey, Hels, I'm just heading into town, 'why don't you meet me in the pub in a bit?<eos> Paul, we need to talk.<eos> Paul, I've got to tell you something.
I thought you hated the countryside.<eos> Oh, not the countryside as such, just everyone in it.<eos> And how often do you find out that one of your best friends is having a... cause for a celebration?<eos> I demand Champagne immediately, or, er, failing that, several pints of strong Continental lager.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Hey! What is this place?<eos> Hell on Earth.<eos> So, I popped in to see the coroner and I saw the body.<eos> How did you do that?
And if you ever want to talk...<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Which paper are you from?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Which newspaper?<eos> All right. Last chance, before I really hurt you.<eos> What newspaper?<eos> The-The Post!<eos> Right. Why don't... We'll pay you... to tell your side of the story.<eos> Why don't you get out of here before I shove those stupid glasses up your bony tabloid arse?
Wait here.<eos> Shit!<eos> I've got him!<eos> I've got him!<eos> OK, OK...<eos> Look, it was just a bit of robbing.<eos> They're insured.<eos> It's the Poppy and Abi show, isn't it?<eos> Everyone's making a nice bit of coin out of it.<eos> Oh, you should be ashamed of yourself.

Why would she lie?<eos> What's she got to gain?<eos> She's got text after text proving the affair.<eos> She gives Bates a rock-solid alibi for the time you've got him murdering Abigail Toms.<eos> You're determined to prove me wrong, aren't you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's not about you.<eos> Why don't you see what's staring you straight in the face?<eos> You will not be the star of this investigation if you convict an innocent man.<eos> Would you rather she take her story straight to the papers?
You will not be the star of this investigation if you convict an innocent man.<eos> Would you rather she take her story straight to the papers?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll take it once round the block.<eos> Ah, by the way, your mate Linda's here.<eos> Would you like to be the one to tell her?<eos> She's lying.<eos> Polesford's full of little bitches like that.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Oh, and you'd know, would you?
What's she like?<eos> Is she pretty?<eos> She's young.<eos> Hm. Firm tits?<eos> Slim waist?<eos> Know your enemy.<eos> We learned that a long time ago, didn't we?<eos> Who is she?<eos> Helen, please tell me, what's her name?<eos> You don't want to know.
Me.<eos> How historic?<eos> 20-odd years ago.<eos> And the perpetrator?<eos> Peter Harcross.<eos> He was a local councillor in my hometown, works in Hull now, few years off retirement.<eos> Local government?<eos> This'll get attention.<eos> I want him done for it.<eos> I'm so sorry you've had to live with this.
Then you guys would be all pissed at me.<eos> We would be all pissed at you, yeah.<eos> Get it back.<eos> While you're in there today, conduct your interview like an ordinary industrial engineer, and get the bag and then this part is over.<eos> While I'm in there trying to look ordinary, you want me to steal something from a police office.<eos> This task hasn't even started yet, John.<eos> This bag still has to get to Iran. That's the thing.<eos> That's the hard part. We haven't even started.<eos> So get the bag.<eos> And don't cause a dust up, because you're gonna need this cover in Iran, you know.
Starting really to dislike you.<eos> I'm need very much to calm my rocking boat.<eos> So, let's settle it down here.<eos> I mean, I don't even know who you are, you know?<eos> I would just like to know who you really are, you know?<eos> I mean, you seem like two people sometimes. To me.<eos> Good at piping, poor at it, undivided attention, then completely fucking split attention between piping and God knows what.<eos> I just want to know who you really are.<eos> I mean, I know you're John Lakeman, right?<eos> And I know you like John Lakeman, and I don't like John Lakeman.

Well, let's get a breakfast in before that.<eos> - See you in ten?<eos> - See you in ten.<eos> John, can you come in here, please?<eos> This guy says he wants to tell his wife the whole thing.<eos> He's holding his phone.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I had an erection.<eos> Not from being in a room with a sex worker.<eos> I think mostly I was excited about helping you gather information, and one thing led to another and...
Bluebirds.<eos> But not much else really.<eos> You know, the ocean's not really blue.<eos> Nor is the sky. Nor me.<eos> Ever, really. Till now.<eos> I feel so weird.<eos> Let me put some of those up, on my way back to the hotel.<eos> You gonna be okay?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Just knowing you cared... just knowing you cared enough to stop and have a cold one?
Okay.<eos> Midnight.<eos> Hey, maybe it's time to come home.<eos> Okay.<eos> How we doing with that paperwork, John?<eos> Not as yet.<eos> Clock's ticking.<eos> For sure.<eos> John?<eos> I'd like to share my demands with you.
Well, as the Wolf says in my favorite movie,<eos> "Pulp Fiction", let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet.<eos> Show us what you got.<eos> You got what you wanted, man.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> I did my part.<eos> What were you gonna do to me with your stupid tree branch?<eos> Brutalize you.<eos> Break all the bones in your face to signal to you what I'm willing to do to continue the job I'm doing.

I'm just a little surprised.<eos> Well, I'm throwing with my left hand.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I have to be left handed today.<eos> Why?<eos> Because someone's coming to interview me today.<eos> Fuck.<eos> So you summoned me here just to practice being left-handed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you have to do it all day?
If someone has experience regarding people, reading people, like a job like yours, they can excel at it.<eos> Very good.<eos> You've made it further than anyone I think I've ever played.<eos> Now I can take the bill.<eos> It is good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I feel like I've heard it before, it's...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Here's my e-mail.<eos> Send me yours and I'll give you the name of that album.
Stephen. John. Come up here.<eos> Show me how you can conjure perfection.<eos> Show me your attachment to the form we place so lovingly, under our shared world.<eos> Stephen. Lakeman.<eos> How about it? Draw your most perfect circle.<eos> Draw it out of you, and then draw it on the screen here.<eos> Show me your attachment to the perfect form, to perfection.<eos> So how are we doing, John, on this new morning?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> You know, John, I spent some time last night just... Well, pondering how I was going to respond to you this morning.
We'll start with that.<eos> We'll, uh... We'll build from there.<eos> I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.<eos> And well, it reminded me of you.<eos> So... it seems you'll be staying on for this weekend's duck hunt.<eos> And then it seems you'll have a new morning of your own at some new endeavor.<eos> I wish you well.
Then we just stood here.<eos> Then I felt a feeling...<eos> John.<eos> John, you're wife's here.<eos> Hey, Dennis.<eos> Hey, John.<eos> John, come here.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I made things hard for you.
What is?<eos> You can't reach the controls from the seats.<eos> What's the point in that?<eos> Or do you have stretchy arms, like Mr Fantastic?<eos> Oh, I stand, like this.<eos> You never thought of bringing the seats a bit closer?<eos> No, not so far, no.<eos> Where's the steering wheel?<eos> Well, you don't steer the TARDIS, you negotiate with it.<eos> The still point between where you want to go... ..and where you need to be, that's where she takes you.
Who's collecting the data?<eos> - Is the big question.<eos> - So what do we do, then?<eos> Well, if they're badges then...<eos> - What? Where's...? Where's it gone?<eos> - Oh, it's on your back.<eos> Yours too.<eos> So, everyone you walk past can see what you're thinking.<eos> What if you really fancy someone?<eos> Well, I suppose it means that you have to maintain - eye contact with them.
Two portions. One portion.<eos> Is there going to be food sexism even in the future?<eos> Is this bloke utopia?<eos> It's probably reading me as two people.<eos> The heartbeats.<eos> If you're going to travel 20 light years, you're going to want to make sure you've got somewhere to sleep at the end of it, aren't you?<eos> - So, what do you do?<eos> - Sorry? Two hearts?<eos> You send a rocketload of intelligent robots up ahead of you.<eos> They build you a place to live, so that, when you arrive, it's all waiting.

"What's wrong"?<eos> Seriously, "What's wrong"?<eos> I've never seen anyone die before.<eos> A few hours ago, we were standing in a garden full of dead people.<eos> - That was different.<eos> - How?<eos> They were dead already.<eos> Morally and practically, that's not a useful distinction - unlearn it.<eos> Don't tell me what to think!<eos> I'm your teacher - telling you things is what I do.

We bring the plan forward.<eos> - When, sir?<eos> - Now!<eos> In daylight.<eos> No time for outrage.<eos> - You've never had time for anything else.<eos> Right?<eos> - Don't be smug.<eos> Smug belongs to me.<eos> Are you really 2,000 years old?
Run!<eos> What?<eos> Agh! Out of my way!<eos> Quick!<eos> Get to the shore!<eos> Agh! Doctor!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Bill!<eos> Bill!<eos> You did it!
We need to talk.<eos> Your oath.<eos> - Give us a coin.<eos> - What?<eos> "The new Lord Sutcliffe was found starving on London's streets..."<eos> The inheritance was contested, everyone got super mad... blah, blah, blah...<eos> "Urchin boy deemed legitimate"!<eos> My God!<eos> It worked!<eos> You did it.

Chance would be a fine thing!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> How about that for a new idea?<eos> I didn't ask to be re-assembled, did I?<eos> Knocking.<eos> What was that about?<eos> No-one's going to open the door, just because you're knocking!<eos> Getting cocky now, are you?<eos> Why?<eos> What do you think you know?

Job done!<eos> OK. Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> He's your grandad?<eos> That's awesome!<eos> Mine went greypacking on the Great Wall Of China with his boyfriend, but they got arrested for trying to steal a bit.<eos> Bit of what?<eos> The wall.<eos> OK...!<eos> You want a hand?
We need to have a talk about your taste in music.<eos> You coming up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This freaky Scooby-Doo house!<eos> Bill, if you get scared in the night, you know where I am, yeah?<eos> What?<eos> Just, if you need any...<eos> of my help, or my whatever, you know?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> I get that you're into me, but, um, sorry, you're not my type.
Night, then!<eos> Why didn't you get a room next to me, like we said?<eos> What? I don't know.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> I'm not cool enough, is that it?<eos> No. Shut up!<eos> These are my mates, too.<eos> Paul!<eos> Not funny!<eos> Do you fancy him?
'Eliza, he's your son.<eos> 'Your loving son.'<eos> My son? !<eos> Forgive me...<eos> Forgive me.<eos> 'When you saw what the creatures had done, 'you understood, didn't you?<eos> 'The lice could keep your mother alive, 'if you protected them, 'tamed them, fed them.'<eos> If you could save the one who brought you into this world - wouldn't you? !<eos> Your silence is a confirmation.<eos> I did what you told me because I thought you knew best.
Goodnight, sir.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> A piano?<eos> You've put a piano in there? Why?<eos> Goodnight.<eos> You don't learn, do you, sir?<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you want dinner?<eos> I've got Mexican.<eos> Look, I know you miss it all.
Betty, move in with me.<eos> You have a wife.<eos> Whom I adore.<eos> You're insane.<eos> No.<eos> I'm quite rational, actually.<eos> Monogamy is not natural.<eos> It is a construct of religious authority.<eos> And a foolish faith in authority, my dear Betty, is the worst enemy of truth.<eos> Truth being that rules don't apply to you?
How do people get pleasure by marching in step?<eos> It makes me think they've been given their big brains only by mistake.<eos> Turn around!<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want you to listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> Rebellion will get you nowhere in life.<eos> You step on enough toes, and I promise you, one day you will trip.<eos> I'm not going to apologize for thinking that...<eos> That's exactly what you're going to do.<eos> The headmaster is willing to give you one last chance, so I want you to go in there and say you're sorry.

No, Father, please.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> - You need an education.
How would you expect to go to school?<eos> I'll learn Italian. I'll le...<eos> - I'll learn faster than anyone has ever...<eos> - Albert.<eos> learned it before.<eos> So...<eos> - So you're abandoning me?<eos> - No<eos> I'm looking out for your future.<eos> It's time you learn to be independent and take responsibility for yourself.
- So you're abandoning me?<eos> - No<eos> I'm looking out for your future.<eos> It's time you learn to be independent and take responsibility for yourself.<eos> You will live with your cousins until your studies are complete.<eos> Now go back to school.<eos> Pauline! Maja!<eos> The train will not wait for your hair to be pinned up.<eos> Coming, coming already.<eos> Albert, I left you two roast hens, green beans and potatoes.

Come.<eos> - I won't forget to eat, Mother.<eos> I also left you a few extra marks.
Assassinated in the street.<eos> I just saw him yesterday.<eos> He was coming to dinner on Sunday.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> That's quite all right, Fraulein.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like some time alone with my husband.<eos> Why did you send her away?<eos> I don't want to be disturbed by the press.<eos> I need Betty to answer the phone.<eos> I know why you need Betty.
Did you hear what the man said?<eos> You're on a list.<eos> The killers are dead.<eos> - And they have accomplices.<eos> - No<eos> I will not kowtow to bullies.<eos> And I will not sit by and wait for fascists to kill my husband.<eos> I want to leave, Albert.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't even like Germany.
- Thank you.<eos> Fine, fine, but his treatise on God is hearsay.<eos> "Natura Naturans?" Please.<eos> And what does it even mean?<eos> It means God and Nature are one and the same.<eos> I am a certified teacher now, if you need a Latin tutor.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Albert may take you up on that.<eos> I will?<eos> Professor Weber tells me you need a little help in the humanities.
Here you are, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "The surest way to corrupt a youth is to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently."<eos> Nietzsche?<eos> Excellent.<eos> "If you step on enough toes, one day you'll trip."<eos> Confucius?<eos> Close. My father.<eos> Albert.<eos> A letter for you.
- I've told you before.<eos> I'm going to be a professor.<eos> I will think for thinking's sake.<eos> That is the most indulgent thing I've ever heard.<eos> I'm sure from your bourgeois perspective it would seem indulgent. What?<eos> My bourgeois per...<eos> But I'm going to Zurich Polytechnic.<eos> Y-You failed your entrance exam.<eos> I won't fail again. - Who do you think's gonna pay for this Zurich Polytechnic, huh?<eos> The same people who pay for you to keep plundering your businesses into the ground.
- Albert, come here, son.<eos> Don't let those academic fools in Zurich change you, Albert.<eos> Their knowledge is their weakness, while your imagination is your strength.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you for everything. - Oh.<eos> Well have a safe journey.<eos> - Marie, wait!<eos> - Just go, Albert.<eos> Please!<eos> Marie, I'm going to write to you.
- It's Wags.<eos> Wags, where you been?<eos> Wags, I've been calling you.<eos> Call you back.<eos> You haven't been drinking.<eos> Your eyes are clear.<eos> Let me see.<eos> It's not shaking.<eos> I want to get this out.<eos> When I started here, I made a promise to you, and you to me.
"Gee, what is she doing with him?"<eos> I had no idea you felt that way.<eos> If the quarter ended today, we'd be underwater like Crimson fucking Tide.<eos> Sansomic has pulled us down to negative 2.3%. But we have three days to turn that around.<eos> So, what do you have for me?<eos> I'm peeling back the skin on Territory Petroleum.<eos> They're sitting on good numbers. If they come out, it'll bump seven...<eos> It's too late.<eos> When the numbers come out, we're a dead man walking.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be on the Sandicot muni-bond deal?
I was talking to Victor.<eos> Why were you talking to Victor?<eos> You know why.<eos> Sure as shit.<eos> Changes what I can pitch.<eos> By design.<eos> Well, you may have solved one problem, but you made the crucial one much harder to solve.<eos> So you got nothing.<eos> No, I have just what you need.<eos> But apparently, I can't give it to you.
There's this currency play.<eos> Are you transmitting me the details telepathically?<eos> Okay, just...<eos> There's this guy...<eos> Everett Wright. We're bros. From college.<eos> Fucking Eveready, he was always better than me.<eos> He trades currency over at Richards. Started crushing it right out of school.<eos> Thing is, he's a great guy. I love him. When I landed my job here, I thought,<eos> "Damn, I finally crept ahead."<eos> But if I tell you what he's got, you'll love him.
I want to take the business to the next level.<eos> To raise capital.<eos> You never even have to ask me before writing a check.<eos> No, I don't want to just take it from you.<eos> I want the business to have outside validation.<eos> An actual cap raise.<eos> You sure you're ready?<eos> 'Cause what you're asking, if you're not ready...<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I'll call Boyd. And he'll have the right guy at Spartan-Ives sit with you about expanding.

And he'll have the right guy at Spartan-Ives sit with you about expanding.<eos> Lobster?<eos> Yeah, to impress you.<eos> You impressed?<eos> So, Mafee tells me that you're not happy over at Richards.
You didn't have to walk down here to see if I knew where Wags was, boyo. You could've just called.<eos> You came in here because you want it to be about you. Because you need it to be about you.<eos> And I am here for exactly that purpose. Really?<eos> Let me into that kitchen.<eos> What specific role does Wags serve for you?<eos> He's my personal bullshit detector. And he makes me laugh.<eos> Well, I can fill that role.<eos> You'll be my bullshit detector?<eos> Absolutely. Like a double shot of Skin Bracer across the chops.<eos> Well, let me do the same for you.
Yeah, I imagine it did.<eos> You know, for the longest time, I couldn't synthesize it. How that story came out in the paper, how there was just enough in that article to bait the U.S. Attorney's Office.<eos> Yeah, it was a bad beat, no doubt.<eos> Well, since then, I've had a lot of time to just sit and think, and slowly, it dawned...<eos> If I lost, someone else must've gained.<eos> So I ran a thousand simulations a day in my head. And over and over again, Bobby, it came back the same.<eos> I was your stalking horse.<eos> You did the transaction. You left the opening.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I was just about to say the same thing to you.
Just so we're communicating, you know I mean the guy who works across the hall, right? Michael Wagner?<eos> Wags? Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I know my research was right.<eos> I also know it doesn't matter now, 'cause the game has changed.<eos> How strong is Nigeria defending?<eos> It's their version of the Alamo.<eos> Krakow and Malverne are gonna be looking to pull out.<eos> You should, too.
I'll get to him last.<eos> This has been... It's been a fascinating one.<eos> There are those who are weak but don't have it, and those who have it but are strong.<eos> I've isolated the one who has it and will give it...<eos> Watley. He's been running an avoidance play, but that's at its end.<eos> I'll push for a suspension if that's what it takes to sit him down.<eos> There's plenty of support out there.<eos> The AG wants this, and soon.<eos> You'll have it.<eos> I will if you say I will.
Mike's putting the band back together again, just like I told him to.<eos> Fuck, you told him to?<eos> I thought he was free-balling.<eos> Conditions are right to get going again.<eos> We'll tail the shit out of the auction. The fucking Feds can spare the 15 bips.<eos> Then we can talk about the 26-weeks.<eos> We have to get some volume going now.<eos> So relax.<eos> That'll do it.<eos> When I started here, I made a promise to you, and you to me.
You saw your hero, a man you deemed better than you, laid low.<eos> That's empathy.<eos> Why did his plight cut you so deep?<eos> What made you so vulnerable to this idea of fading away?<eos> Axe hired a fucking Chief of Staff.<eos> Her name is Steph Reed.<eos> So now he doesn't need you anymore.<eos> And if he doesn't need you anymore, no one does.<eos> You have outlived your utility.<eos> There is nothing left for you to do but die.
Her name is Steph Reed.<eos> So now he doesn't need you anymore.<eos> And if he doesn't need you anymore, no one does.<eos> You have outlived your utility.<eos> There is nothing left for you to do but die.<eos> But you're not dead. Which means it is time to pivot.<eos> To evolve into what it is you'll become next.<eos> Wendy reassembled me, piece by piece, on that bench.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> And I decided I had to give you the chance to make the change here you need to.
I can see that.<eos> We nailed that.<eos> The old Malachi Crunch.<eos> The market is shifting already. It is done.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Larry... in a few moments, the FBI are gonna come walking through that door and they're going to arrest you.<eos> You can't run.<eos> There's no time.<eos> Rhoades fucked me like you thought he would.<eos> And you got the call before you went on, didn't you?
I executed 68 innocent men.<eos> I believed I had to.<eos> That's the man we have to target.<eos> We've got to find the scrap of a soul. That's left in there after everything he's done.<eos> Tom!<eos> Tom!<eos> No, no...<eos> What happened?<eos> You'd have been so proud.<eos> What would you say if I told you that today you had. An opportunity to serve your country?
Today?<eos> Tomorrow morning.<eos> You think I'd miss your celebration this evening?<eos> Of course.<eos> Your wife must be looking forward to it.<eos> It is a promotion for her as well, isn't it?<eos> For you.<eos> Really, franz.<eos> You don't look well.<eos> You should pace yourself.
You're not gonna tell, are you?<eos> Busy day?<eos> I... Saw you walking down the other side of the street. And...<eos> Don't get me wrong, this isn't something I usually do, But can I buy you a drink?<eos> I'm doing just fine.<eos> I'm aaron berkman.<eos> Not gonna tell me your name?<eos> You know what, pal?<eos> There's plenty of tables. You got a problem with me?<eos> Maybe you should double the hell back out of my bar.
You had my photograph in your office safe.<eos> You sent a man to try to kill me. And sabotage my communications.<eos> How is he?<eos> Has he not reported in?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Someone of your rank behind enemy lines, is that wise?<eos> Is it wise that someone of your rank... Is offering to work for the allies?<eos> This was not the protocol.<eos> Change of plan for my security.<eos> I need to know if I can trust you.
I'm neither.<eos> Where is she?<eos> I shouldn't be here, I should really get back.<eos> Who says?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Yeah, who says?<eos> Crummy job anyway.<eos> Boss gets all the glamour, takes all the credit. And that is why I'm my own boss.<eos> Smart.<eos> Everybody in this country always tells you what to do.
Help the germans get it done?<eos> We speak the same language.<eos> Don't make me hurt you.<eos> I won't be dragged from my office in the middle of the day.<eos> Fair enough. There's a library across from my office, third floor.<eos> Hang a yellow sash on the curtain instead of blue.<eos> I've asked your team before, what is it you want me to do?<eos> I want you to help build aurora's cover as helene bauer.<eos> Go on.<eos> She'll be your handler, she'll provide you with regular instruction.
Where was she taken?<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> Please.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Dieppe. You.<eos> Standing on top of that tank on fire.<eos> Not you.<eos> The best part of that was the view.<eos> Seeing that jeep at the far end of the field carrying you back.<eos> And you... You get to relive those moments, you get to... See them, to smell them.
What the hell's going on?<eos> I told him where he might find his friend, miri. You did what?<eos> She was probably transported along with the other.<eos> Dieppe insurgents to a holding station. Near val-des-plaines, just north of paris.<eos> Harry, bring him back. Neil!<eos> Neil!<eos> Go back, harry.<eos> Don't do this. Sinclair's orders!<eos> Even if you could find the holding station...<eos> Even if she's still there, still alive, What are you going to do? What, you're going to break her.

Neil is insubordinate, harry clearly can't bring him in line!<eos> And your vaudevillian is in love with aurora.<eos> I've seen him resist the extremes of his own pain.<eos> But when I threatened her back at my apartment, He became compliant immediately.<eos> That's not even his failure;<eos> It's yours for letting the two work together.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, I cannot trust the lot of you.<eos> This arrangement is off.<eos> Franz.<eos> You know I can't let you do that.
Thank you.<eos> These are my favourites too!<eos> No, I mean for coming all this way.<eos> It was selfish of me to think you would have the time.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> And I had to be here for this evening.<eos> How's your room?<eos> Perfect.<eos> 402, just down the hall.<eos> I missed you... Hearing your voice.
We have friends.<eos> We can keep you safe.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Your son klaus.<eos> Be kind to him.<eos> I will.<eos> I meant what I said before, son.<eos> So did i.<eos> Krystina.<eos> Aurora, his feelings for you make you all vulnerable.
Listen to what he has to say.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Do you know what happened at dieppe?<eos> The russians bring real men,<eos> Real weapons.<eos> Were you there?<eos> Thousands of men cut down on french soil.<eos> For you.<eos> Stalingrad is a long ways away.<eos> You want to wait for the reds, you might be waiting a while.
A difficult time for her.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the obergruppenfuhrer seems to think. All she needs is a family to keep her busy.<eos> I see.<eos> It's funny how men. Always think they know what's best for a woman.<eos> Sounds like you've met the men I work with.<eos> In poland, things are more progressive.<eos> We are free to make our own rules. About working, children,<eos> Romance.<eos> If you want something, all you have to do is take it.
I had to.<eos> How do you keep going?<eos> Knowing that I don't matter.<eos> No matter what happens to me, The fight will continue.<eos> Like your friend.<eos> I keep thinking of her voice, How she sang.<eos> So proud.<eos> So free, Even in the face of death.<eos> I didn't know her name, But she reminded me. That the reason we fight,<eos> I'll let you work.
No.<eos> No, he never did.<eos> Why are we here, duncan?<eos> Ernst, i...<eos> I'm sorry to have to meet like this but... I'm afraid I need your help one more time.<eos> I appreciate your retrieving my son from siberia, But I hadn't foreseen you taking that as licence to keep coming.<eos> To me for favours.<eos> It's not like that at all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it you want?
Can I ask you a favour?<eos> If you could get him a set, I'm sure it would help keep his mind off things. Until this is all over.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> I know the shame. He must be feeling as a prisoner.<eos> So, please, duncan, When you see him, Let him know that I'm very proud of him.<eos> I admire your courage, duncan.<eos> The war has taken your elder son;<eos> William is still missing.<eos> It seems unfair that... My son is given all this luxury.<eos> I can't thank you enough for what you have done.
For rigaud, we take it. What about transport.<eos> To poland? How did things go with your contact?<eos> We need to find another way.<eos> Let's just focus on getting rigaud back, please.<eos> We need rigaud back, unharmed.<eos> You come to my home.<eos> Involve my wife.<eos> Pull me from my work.<eos> You fail to mention that the most wanted man. In france was present at a meeting I protected.<eos> We didn't owe you that information.
You come to my home.<eos> Involve my wife.<eos> Pull me from my work.<eos> You fail to mention that the most wanted man. In france was present at a meeting I protected.<eos> We didn't owe you that information.<eos> You made a commitment not to compromise my credibility. You failed.<eos> I will not risk getting shot for treason.<eos> Because your word cannot be trusted.<eos> You called this meeting.<eos> You want something.
Our obligations to each other.<eos> Are now over.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Your father-in-law is working on a top secret project.<eos> Called operation marigold. How do you know this?<eos> We broke into his briefcase at your party.<eos> We think that operation marigold is a new, bigger oil refinery. In poland capable of pushing oil production. Through the roof and guaranteeing a nazi victory.<eos> Franz, I need you to help me find it.<eos> Why would I do that? You spoke to me once. About ending the cruelty and the death camps.<eos> I'm offering you a chance to help end this war.
That time, that, um... That kiss.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I... it was a mistake.<eos> Is this sinclair talking? No.<eos> Alfred, Look at me.<eos> I am.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> I don't feel for you the way I felt for rene.
Don't worry, Mama.<eos> I won't need to marry.<eos> I plan to be a scientist.<eos> Oh, my beautiful daughter.<eos> What a joy it is, to celebrate your birth.<eos> Seems any day now, we will be losing you to another man.<eos> But we could do worse than you, Albert.<eos> Not much.<eos> Ow. Who knew inviting you into our home those years back, we would expand our merry band so exponentially?<eos> Dear Maja is as much a sister to our girls as she is to you.
So... I do enjoy sailing.<eos> Albert, you would tell me if something was troubling you.<eos> Of course, Mariechien.<eos> You know I'm a modern man, Albert, but my Marie is risking a great deal with you.<eos> I expect you to do right by her.<eos> Safe travels, son.<eos> Okay.<eos> God, I close my eyes, and her face is all I see.<eos> This conversation is far past insufferable.<eos> You should have joined us.
Of course not.<eos> Albert's probably not even...<eos> Well, not even what?<eos> Oh, you know how he gets.<eos> Ah, you mean distracted?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's just consumed by whatever's right in front of him.<eos> Mmm. It can be very charming.<eos> But also very frustrating.<eos> If it makes you feel better, I haven't had a letter since he's been back in Zurich.
Do not speak of her that way.<eos> Of course.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I'll get them now.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was careless.<eos> It really has been over with Marie for some time, but... I just... I didn't want to hurt her, so I... didn't say anything at all.<eos> But it's done now.<eos> I've made it clear.<eos> And... as unfair as I was to her, I've been ten times more so to you.
And then what?<eos> Miza.<eos> Then what?<eos> You change diapers all day long?<eos> Wipe noses?<eos> Sing lullabies?<eos> No. I will earn my degree, Papa.<eos> - I swear it.<eos> - For years, I taught you never to rely on a man for anything.<eos> Do I really need to explain the situation to you, Papa?
Do I really need to explain the situation to you, Papa?<eos> I just don't want you to punish yourself for the rest of your life.<eos> Not for making a mistake one night.<eos> It wasn't a mistake.<eos> And it certainly wasn't one night.<eos> You were in Zurich...<eos> the Swiss are experts at taking care of unfortunate circumstances.<eos> I would never do such a thing!<eos> I want to have Albert's child.<eos> I want more for you.
No one cares what I have to say.<eos> But there is a position I know of.<eos> Decent wage, steady hours.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's in Bern at the patent office.<eos> Um, clerical position, but very interesting work.<eos> You could employ some of your engineering knowledge.<eos> I'm a scientist, Marcel!<eos> I'm better than a clerkship.<eos> - You need money.

No, you need a job.<eos> Why not ask your father could he set you up in the factory in Milan?<eos> Because he humiliated me.<eos> I'm done with him, after the letter to Weber.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that perhaps your father reached out to Weber because he cares about you?<eos> Be practical, Albert.<eos> If you will not get a real job, how on earth will you survive?<eos> Maja.<eos> Big brother.<eos> We missed you in Milan.
I love her, Maja.<eos> She's-She's like nobody I've ever met before.<eos> I felt this... this pull towards her.<eos> Since I saw her, I... I should be thrilled, but...<eos> But?<eos> Well, now I feel this opposing force pulling me down.<eos> I'm just getting started with my life.<eos> I'm-I'm worried that if I marry her, I'll never take flight.<eos> What other choice do you have?<eos> You have a visitor.
But what is the ether?<eos> What kind of substance has such remarkable properties?<eos> One has to twist all of physics into knots just to make it work, but it must exist, or else...<eos> Are you a Jew?<eos> I subscribe to no religion.<eos> You look like a Jew.<eos> Are you sliced?<eos> Down there?<eos> Does it feel odd to fornicate if you're sliced?<eos> Timo, your father isn't paying me to tutor you about the ins and outs of... about girls, but if you'll indulge me, I'll show you that mathematics is as elegant as the finest of women, and just like women, it might seem intimidating at first, but the truth is anyone can do it.
The two of us. Huh?<eos> Mileva... you're the love of my life.<eos> And I will do the right thing for you and this child.<eos> I promise.<eos> "Private lessons in mathematics and physics, "given most thoroughly by Albert Einstein.<eos> Trial lesson free."<eos> Sounds promising.<eos> This is a new low, Albert.<eos> It's just temporary till I find something better.<eos> If you're in such straits, the job in the patent office is still open, and...
Mileva.<eos> You've always been my closest friend, Helene.<eos> And you love children.<eos> What if you took my baby?<eos> No, Mileva...<eos> Everything I've worked for...<eos> Forget I said that.<eos> It's horrid.<eos> I haven't been sleeping...<eos> If it is what you need, Mileva...

We should codify our little salon.<eos> We'll meet regularly...<eos> - Nightly.<eos> - Nightly. Fine.<eos> With the express purpose of ruminating on philosophy, science, music, art...<eos> And women.<eos> And women, too.<eos> But we need a name for our little association.<eos> The honor is yours, Einstein.<eos> You made this possible.
- Yeah?<eos> The Nobel is a major new prize.<eos> Maybe you will win one someday, yes?<eos> Hmm. No.<eos> You were right about me all along, Papa.<eos> I'm... I'm only a dreamer.<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> I...<eos> I've never told you this, Papa, but... when I'm lost, it's always your voice I hear in my head.
Telegramma per Albert Einstein.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Perhaps it's for the best.<eos> How could you say such a thing?<eos> It is sad, yes, but you no longer have any obligation to marry this girl.<eos> Papa gave it his blessing.<eos> Papa is dead.<eos> You told me that your life was just getting started.<eos> Now, here you are, free to pursue your dreams with no responsibilities.<eos> Perhaps this is God's way of giving you another chance.

If I had had any idea...<eos> When I saw her being lowered into the ground... it was like a piece of me was torn away.<eos> A piece of me buried alongside her.<eos> And I knew the only person who could fill that void... is you.<eos> And I hate you for that.<eos> Go on hating me if you choose.<eos> I know I deserve it.<eos> And I know I...<eos> I don't deserve you.<eos> But I will never feel anything but love for you, Mileva.
You can't think properly without sleep.<eos> I don't need sleep.<eos> I need more coffee.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you remember our thought experiments on gas theory at university?<eos> Those weeks we spent holed up in my room?<eos> I remember quite a lot of experimentation, yes. Not all of it to do with science.<eos> What if we were going about it all wrong?<eos> What if, instead of studying gases, we studied a cup of coffee?<eos> You really must sleep, Albert.
You never did.<eos> Do you remember when you dug a trench in the snow, covered it with a canvas and declared it your winter palace?<eos> I wanted to sleep there. But mama wouldn't have it.<eos> You were always so independent, Miza. So strong.<eos> You seem happy again.<eos> I am.<eos> And what about resuming your studies?<eos> I'm working with Albert every day, exploring the most fascinating topics in physics.<eos> I don't need a degree for that.<eos> And that's really enough for you?
And to you Frau Einstein!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> We do appreciate the help.<eos> Of course, darling.<eos> I remember when Albert was born.<eos> Such an exciting time. But also a difficult one.<eos> I had no idea how to care for myself, not to mention a child.<eos> It isn't easy, is it?<eos> I made so many mistakes!<eos> With any luck I can help spare you the worst of them.
Third?<eos> My God, Albert, you're writing another one?<eos> If I can find another good idea, something provable through experimentation.<eos> Mileva's doing some research for me...<eos> Einstein.<eos> Your mother is here.<eos> She abandons her boy for hours on end, she refuses to be taught how to cook, and she leaves all the cleaning to me.<eos> Now is that fair?<eos> Mother, we spoke about this.<eos> And I agreed to indulge the notion that you could use some assistance writing your essay.
Einstein.<eos> It is fascinating what one can deduce about a man just by knowing his name.<eos> I don't believe it...<eos> What?<eos> Lenard.<eos> They're giving him the Nobel. For cathode ray tubes a tenyearold innovation.<eos> Suddenly you care about awards?<eos> I care about science living and breathing in the present and not suffocating in the past.<eos> And yes, I'm not ashamed to say, I want some recognition for my contributions.<eos> I understand how you must feel.
Einstein, I need yesterday's...<eos> Yesterday's, today's and tomorrow's.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Albert?<eos> Albert? I'm worried about you...<eos> I approved a patent for a device that's now inside that very clock tower.<eos> Every minute, it sends a signal at the speed of light to clocks in Geneva, Basel and Zurich, synchronizing them.<eos> But what if we sent a signal to a clock on a moving train?<eos> Albert, you could use a good sleep.
I'm only trying to help.<eos> You've been shoving your 'help' down my throat since you arrived.<eos> Mileva, calm yourself.<eos> That's quite easy for you to say, isn't it?<eos> You do what you want, go where you please. And I'm here.<eos> Not in a laboratory or in front of a classroom as I should be...<eos> Perhaps I'm mistaken, but didn't you fail your exams?<eos> Mother, please.<eos> The girl needs to face the truth, Albert.<eos> You need a wife to make you a home, not a...
You are his clerk.<eos> Mother, you should go.<eos> Go, go where?<eos> Home.<eos> If you think this creature can make you happy, then I promise you, son, you are in for a life of misery.<eos> He won't sleep.<eos> I don't know what to do...<eos> I can take him.<eos> Thank you...<eos> I made you something.
"The introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous."<eos> Superfluous!<eos> I love that word.<eos> I preferred 'idiotic', but alas.<eos> "In conclusion, I wish to say that in working at the" problem here dealt with, I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M. Besso...<eos> And that I am indebted to him for several<eos> You thank Michele.<eos> Of course I thanked him.<eos> His advice was instrumental.<eos> But I've helped you with so many papers.
Duder, I know you can see me, and I kind of need your help here.<eos> Doctor will be with you in a minute.<eos> Oh, come on. Um...<eos> Okay, I got broken bones incoming.<eos> Um, you'll-you'll text me a picture of the ultrasound?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - I got to go.<eos> Duder, wait up!<eos> I'm just saying, it's not that difficult.<eos> That's easy for you to say.
Oh, come on. Um...<eos> Okay, I got broken bones incoming.<eos> Um, you'll-you'll text me a picture of the ultrasound?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - I got to go.<eos> Duder, wait up!<eos> I'm just saying, it's not that difficult.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> You weren't up half the night with him.<eos> You just have to manage your time better.
And I'll get my C.D. from the car.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I started to think you found a better offer and bailed on me.<eos> No.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> I'm just kidding. Relax.<eos> Let me fill you in.<eos> Nurse Storms here had some mild contractions overnight.<eos> - They were nothing, really.<eos> - Easy for you to say.
You can't expect his wife to.<eos> Yeah, I think I just have too much on my plate.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna change my scrub top, and I'll see you later.<eos> Maggs, you okay?<eos> No. I'm not okay.<eos> I'm definitely not okay.<eos> Why did you tell me about the staff position?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I-I found out that you had to re-certify, and I got protective.
This is about your stuff.<eos> Your stuff is my stuff.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> The pregnancy?<eos> Not connecting with it at all.<eos> I feel terrible about it.<eos> I keep having these ridiculous dreams, and...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I am so sorry that I told you about the job.
It's not permanent.<eos> Cognition could revert back in a few months.<eos> You would need someone patient to help you relearn while the brain recovers from surgery.<eos> The music comes from here.<eos> And that's where you live.<eos> The most beautiful pieces I wrote, I wrote to you.<eos> If it comes to it, would you teach me how to play them again?<eos> I just came from recovery.<eos> Kim's doing well.<eos> Thought you wanted to know.
It doesn't get more clear than that.<eos> Unless this letter says differently.<eos> It's in Hebrew.<eos> Classic Katz.<eos> Writing me a letter I can't read.<eos> Let's get her to read it to you.<eos> Her flight hasn't left yet.<eos> Uh, there's no time.<eos> Ah, yes, there is.<eos> You just need a fast car and somebody reckless to drive it.
Now get out of my E.R.!<eos> I can't believe I'm the one rushing to the airport for love.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Because you're the hopeless romantic.<eos> I'm always the bridesmaid.<eos> That is not true!<eos> You just hadn't met your one.<eos> Now my one is crossing the pond without me.<eos> Well, she hasn't left yet.<eos> Thank you for doing this.
You got enough gas left in that tank for one last job?<eos> Is everything okay out there, honey?<eos> Yeah, baby, I'll be in in a minute.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - It's okay. Look, I'm sorry you wasted your time.<eos> Come on, guys, I guess she doesn't care about dancing.<eos> Dancing?<eos> Oh, didn't I mention?<eos> It's '90s night at the Groove House.<eos> Not like you'd care, of course.
- Oh, thank you.<eos> - Where'd you get it? Uh, actually, I'm a graphic designer, so I made it.<eos> - Oh, that's awesome.<eos> - Thank you. Actually... weird coincidence, because I'm looking for a new logo to be designed.<eos> Oh. I'd love to check out your stuff.<eos> Is it cool if I get your number?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> For you.
Okay, that's great.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Who was on the phone?<eos> - Oh, it was nobody.<eos> Khalid's just translating a hieroglyph for me.<eos> Lucy, we are so close.<eos> And yet so far.<eos> I'll be taking the treasure. Khalid!<eos> I trusted you.
Lucy, one of the things that I love about you is how brave you are.<eos> Carpe diem.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Owen!<eos> - Hi. - You came.<eos> - I'm so glad.<eos> - Hey... oh.<eos> I...<eos> Hey, hey, wait, I actually, um...<eos> I just came to give you this.
Yes, I remember when I had to ask Carolyn's father.<eos> Boy, I was nervous. Sweating bullets.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He grilled me.<eos> Josh, can you call us the minute you do it?<eos> - Oh, absolutely.<eos> - And if you could possibly, possibly manage it, pictures.<eos> - Yeah, of course, Mrs. Parker.<eos> - For Pete's sakes, call me Carolyn.<eos> You're about to [bleep] my daughter in [bleep] till your [bleep] falls off.
There's so much to prepare.<eos> Watson, the game is afoot!<eos> Ha, ha!<eos> Is this the wine we had on our first date?<eos> - Ye... yes it is, yep.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Gosh, and here we are again, huh?<eos> Just, uh... just full circle.<eos> - Yep. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, are you getting sick?
So, uh, are you still clerking for that judge?<eos> No, I left that job over five years ago.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> I'm actually over at Hayes, Weber, and Rudnisky now. I hear they're pretty rough on their associates over there.<eos> Well, I don't have to worry about that now that I'm a partner.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're a partner? Holy...<eos> The youngest partner in the history of that firm?<eos> Guilty.<eos> How old are you? 32? I just turned 31.
Don't lie.<eos> - Okay, it's not great.<eos> - Further.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's not good?<eos> Say what's on your mind. You know it.<eos> Say the words.<eos> It sucks.<eos> This wine sucks.<eos> How did you do that?
- Okay, it's not great.<eos> - Further.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's not good?<eos> Say what's on your mind. You know it.<eos> Say the words.<eos> It sucks.<eos> This wine sucks.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> How did you know this wine sucked?
10:00 p.m., blackout drunk again.<eos> Midnight, party starts.<eos> - What? Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I mean, that... - Yeah.<eos> - That-that all sounds, uh...<eos> - overwhelming.<eos> - Oh, yeah, big time.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Eat that shit.<eos> You should probably get going soon to that strip club.
- But, Greenberg...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - Uh, hanging in there.<eos> - How's life on the outside?<eos> - It's fine. Uh, I just, uh, finished an episode of Shark Tank.<eos> This guy pitched these socks that you can kinda draw on, so, like-like, you can, like, customize the socks and, like, write things on the socks... like, if you're on a team...<eos> Oh, God... I'm sorry.<eos> Did you want me to wait?<eos> No, no, you... you need to live your life.

You don't know what it's like in here.<eos> You don't know what it's like.
- Josh. Yeah, okay, they think I did.<eos> Just, I'd like... it's not a big deal.<eos> I left a bit early.<eos> Who cares about some stupid party?<eos> Who wants to see the bachelorette party pictures? - Oh, my God, me, me, me, me, me.<eos> - Oh, my God, that was the craziest night we've ever had.<eos> But also the most important.<eos> It cemented our friendship forever.<eos> Guys, I feel the exact same way.<eos> I know we made you do a few things - that made you uncomfortable.
- Why?<eos> - This deck of cards is what can only be described as wheelchair humor.<eos> Mike, you're being an asshole, okay?<eos> You're gonna ruin my rehearsal dinner.<eos> - You ruined my bachelor party!<eos> - I'm sorry I left, okay?<eos> But can you really blame me?<eos> Who the hell wants to get blackout drunk<eos> - at a shitty strip club?<eos> - Well, you do, or at least you used to.
- You ruined my bachelor party!<eos> - I'm sorry I left, okay?<eos> But can you really blame me?<eos> Who the hell wants to get blackout drunk<eos> - at a shitty strip club?<eos> - Well, you do, or at least you used to.<eos> Yeah, used to!<eos> Used to!<eos> I don't like doing that shit anymore.<eos> Yeah, or is it that you just don't like me anymore?
Can you sign this?<eos> Sure, kid, what do you got?<eos> A baseball poster?<eos> Nah, it's from your old days as Josh's best friend.<eos> That was a good year.<eos> Sorry, kid, I don't do that anymore.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to do batting.<eos> All right, Guerrero, don't hold back!<eos> Yeah, nice... nice swing.<eos> - What do you want?
All right, Guerrero, don't hold back!<eos> Yeah, nice... nice swing.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Just want to apologize, man.<eos> Nothing to be sorry for, man.<eos> It's better this way.<eos> We're both doing exactly what we were born to do.<eos> You're marrying Lucy, and I'm playing baseball.<eos> Uh, I've probably done enough batting.<eos> Mike, I-I totally believe you have exactly what it takes to be a professional baseball player.
No wedding without my best man.<eos> Well, Coach, it's been a crazy ride.<eos> It's no secret we didn't always see eye to eye, but even though I'm leaving the clubhouse today and I won't be there for the doubleheader against the Water Bears and the Sky Grizzlies, I want you to know I will always consider Chattanooga my home, and I will always, always bleed Mud Dog blue.<eos> So I guess what I'm trying to say is...<eos> You're out.<eos> - Hey! - Hey!<eos> Ah, they're gonna miss me.<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> I know I do.<eos> Yeah, hey, I miss you too, buddy.
I need help, someone to work alongside me.<eos> Do you have someone particular in mind?<eos> Time is not absolute.<eos> Holy hell.<eos> I've devised my own principle of relativity.<eos> It's the redefinition of the universe.<eos> This is what we've been chasing.<eos> You thanked Michele.<eos> Of course I thanked him.<eos> But I've helped you with so many papers, but you never thought to put my name in any of them.
Herr Einstein, it's... genius.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please, stop.<eos> May I come in?<eos> My name is Dr. Carl Jung.<eos> I'm a friend of your father's.<eos> Can you tell me why you wanted to hurt yourself, Eduard?<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> Don't cry, little one.<eos> When I come home, I'll play you some Mozart.
You look handsome tonight, Babu.<eos> Not now, Miza.<eos> It's okay, the children are asleep.<eos> Please, get dressed.<eos> We're going to be late.<eos> The last thing I want to do is paint on a smile and chatter about the weather with strangers.<eos> We hardly ever have any time for ourselves anymore.<eos> Please, Miza, you look very beautiful, but this invitation is an honor.<eos> We cannot cancel.<eos> Perhaps you should go without me.
He's being too kind, Your Majesty.<eos> He also tells me you're a Jew.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, my parents...<eos> You understand, we are not like the Prussians.<eos> Herr Einstein, we have no quarrel with the Jews, as long as you are God-fearing.<eos> Oh, I am, Your Majesty.<eos> Terrified, actually.<eos> I'd like to continue our work together, so why don't you come to Prague with me, Jakob?<eos> Maybe I could get you a position at the University.
Albert, I'm flattered, but I've received another offer.<eos> A professorship?<eos> No.<eos> Assistant to Philipp Lenard.<eos> Well, Lenard's a genius.<eos> Of course, you must accept.<eos> Yes, but he's got a bit of a reputation.<eos> Quite a taskmaster, apparently.<eos> Honestly, I get a pit in my stomach just thinking about it.<eos> I know how you feel.
It's not my fault everyone in this city is rude.<eos> They're rude?<eos> You spent the night scowling like a scolded child.<eos> We don't know anyone in this city.<eos> I thought you'd want to meet people.<eos> Then why didn't you introduce me to anyone?<eos> It's bad enough I'm invisible to everyone else, then you ignore me, too.<eos> I was simply talking with other people.<eos> Yes.<eos> You had plenty to say to that chesty brunette.
And now?<eos> I think, of all the mysteries in the universe, people are the hardest for me to fathom.<eos> But my wife is really quite brilliant.<eos> Have you been with someone in Brussels?<eos> With someone?<eos> What... what, what do you mean?<eos> This woman.<eos> Did she meet you there?<eos> This is from that silly girl I met at that party.<eos> Why is she writing to you in such a trifling way?
With someone?<eos> What... what, what do you mean?<eos> This woman.<eos> Did she meet you there?<eos> This is from that silly girl I met at that party.<eos> Why is she writing to you in such a trifling way?<eos> You can't possibly be jealous, Miza.<eos> Have you been intimate with her?<eos> Intimate?<eos> I, I have never been unfaithful to you.
Who would have imagined such a little troublemaker would grow up to be a great scientist?<eos> Now if only someone would teach him what to do with a hairbrush.<eos> Poor Albert, he's been so miserable in Prague.<eos> But he's got a prestigious position there, doesn't he?<eos> It's his wife.<eos> He'd never admit it, but he regrets the day he married her.<eos> It's so nice to have you in town, Albert.<eos> The last time I saw you, you must have been the same age as my girls.<eos> We always had fun together.<eos> Ah, you liked my sister better than me.
I was having a delusion.<eos> I thought I was on fire.<eos> Guess why it's blue.<eos> Because it's lonely?<eos> Very clever, but no.<eos> The air forms billions of tiny pockets that scatter the light from the sun.<eos> The blue light scatters more than the other wavelengths, and that's why you see the blue.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> But I can appreciate a blue sky without knowing anything about physics.<eos> Why would you need to know anything about physics?
Always thinking about big ideas?<eos> Never remembering to take care of little things?<eos> I have a friend, a psychiatrist, who thinks that husbands and wives' psyches must be in balance.<eos> Mileva and I certainly are not.<eos> You seem discontent.<eos> Mileva's unhappy all the time.<eos> It makes life at home unbearable.<eos> So I find reasons to stay away.<eos> But then I miss my children.<eos> That must be very difficult or you.
He's legendary.<eos> The man who pulled nitrogen out of thin air.<eos> I could say something to him.<eos> The Academy would be the perfect place for you to do your work.<eos> I can't move to Berlin, Elsa.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know I couldn't wait to get out of Germany when I was a boy.<eos> If I came back, it would only be because I want to be with you.<eos> Is that so terrible?<eos> I'd... I'd very much like to... to be something to you, Elsa, but there are other people to consider.
You're serious?<eos> Indeed, four is fundamental.<eos> There's four elements:<eos> earth, air, fire and water; four poles of the compass; and four poles of the psyche:<eos> thinking, feeling, sensation and intuition.<eos> And who knows, Albert?<eos> Perhaps... there is even a fourth dimension.<eos> So, what's your diagnosis, Doctor?<eos> Schizoid with delusions?<eos> I am a friend of the family so, I wanted to come and see you personally, but I think it would be more appropriate if you worked with one of my colleagues.
But I was young then, my ego got in the way.<eos> Now, we haven't spoken for... a very long time.<eos> I said some terrible things to him, and I never had the humility to ask him to forgive me.<eos> I wonder if he could.<eos> I wonder if I could forgive him.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Imagine what it would be like to be that little spider, Teddy.<eos> Going round and round, the world must look very... very different.<eos> My God.<eos> Someone's here to see you.
Mama, please.<eos> I want to know.<eos> Actually... it was my fault.<eos> And your father was the one who put the fire out.<eos> Well, I was having my own bout of melancholy, just like you are now.<eos> And wasn't paying attention and one of you boys got hold of some matches.<eos> Why didn't you ever tell me the truth?<eos> I needed you to feel safe with me.<eos> You idolized your father, Eduard.<eos> But he was never there and I could see how painful that was for you.
Or maybe it is these days.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What's a young posh lad like Jamie doing down the Dog And Crown?<eos> There was a metro ticket in his stuff.<eos> I'll see if there's images of him.<eos> Well, he was down there twice last week, which fits timewise with when he took that beating.<eos> If Jamie was looking for trouble, that pub is certainly the place to find it.<eos> Aye.<eos> Listen, son.<eos> If I don't know everything, I can't help you.
'Are you still there?<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - Lucy Curran.<eos> She's Rory Marston's girlfriend.<eos> How did we not know that?<eos> Of course Jamie and Rory knew each other.<eos> They... They met through me.<eos> When was that?<eos> When I first started going out with Rory, about a year ago.<eos> So, through you,
No.<eos> Rory would never hurt anyone.<eos> Kenny?<eos> I need you to find Rory Marston and bring him in.<eos> 'What's the charge, ma'am?<eos> ' Well, what do you think?<eos> The murder of Jamie Marshall.<eos> Rory, you need to stop running.<eos> You can't run from this, son.<eos> I'm here for you... .. but you can't do this on your own.
Out where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Out, y'know?<eos> Have fun, get in trouble, maybe go back to that Hurt Locker place.<eos> I should stay here with Denis.<eos> What about Jesse?<eos> Nah. He's, uh... got his God thing goin' on.<eos> Needs his rest.<eos> It's already 2:30 in the morning.<eos> I think you do, too, luv, huh?
That's implied consent.<eos> It's you, isn't it?<eos> You don't belong.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Is that so?<eos> And what did you do?<eos> _<eos> You know my crimes, Eugene.<eos> Why don't you tell me about yours, from one evil person to another?
You know my crimes, Eugene.<eos> Why don't you tell me about yours, from one evil person to another?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You, uh... defiled her?<eos> Maimed her?<eos> Murdered?<eos> _<eos> You don't belong here, my friend.
You had to see for yourself.<eos> You had to see.<eos> Once they find out you are the mistake, that is where they will put you.<eos> And not just for an hour or two, but forever.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You have to trust me, Eugene.<eos> I want to help you.
You seen Him? !<eos> You got Him back there? !<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh. Hey. Your DVD.<eos> Like you said, there's nothing on it.<eos> I was gonna do that sooner or later but... thank you.<eos> Yeah, I heard the shooting was pretty bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was.<eos> Is that why you got a gun?
Oh. Thanks again.<eos> You ever put on a bullet proof vest and get shot in the chest?<eos> I... can't say that I have.<eos> But it sounds fun.<eos> It is.<eos> We should go sometime.<eos> I-I-I'd like that.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, it's Pronsias.<eos> What do you want?
Tulip, love, maybe you should give that place a rest.<eos> I got it.<eos> We're good.<eos> Hear that, Cass?<eos> He's got it. We're good.<eos> So, what are you boys doing, huh?<eos> Babe, I know you don't want to hear this...<eos> Jesse.<eos> We've been over this.<eos> You really, really need to get some...
Without God, there's no structure.<eos> No order.<eos> Without someone at the wheel, we hit the rocks.<eos> It's just chaos.<eos> There has to be someone in charge.<eos> You see, without God, we...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you, Papa.
Come here, let me see it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, see, you've got to be careful now.<eos> All right?<eos> The sun's bad.<eos> The sun's very, very bad.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come here.<eos> Drink this. It'll help you heal.
All right.<eos> Good man.<eos> Padre.<eos> I'm not the one we need to be worried about.<eos> You remember Ixtapa?<eos> Back when we were still on the run from the Rodriguez Brothers?<eos> You had that bad earache.<eos> Must've been for, what... weeks?<eos> Going from crappy small-town doctor to doctor.<eos> You were in agony.
It must have been... 15 to 2.<eos> But we fought 'em...<eos> Teddy, Nunes, that albino with the teeth.<eos> Remember?<eos> We ran them off, and we got the hell out of there.<eos> Must have been about an hour later, way up the road, you suddenly realized the earache had gone.<eos> Couldn't feel that pain no more.<eos> No more running out at night, Tulip.<eos> No more bulletproof vests.<eos> This is what you need...
Must have been about an hour later, way up the road, you suddenly realized the earache had gone.<eos> Couldn't feel that pain no more.<eos> No more running out at night, Tulip.<eos> No more bulletproof vests.<eos> This is what you need...<eos> You used The Word on me.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I was so worried.<eos> You slept, though, right?<eos> Did you dream?

Do you know who I am?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For the next 20 minutes, you're garbage.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We're the professionals.<eos> I see a mistake has been made.<eos> I wanted women.<eos> I will compensate you for your time, but I must show you the door.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We're gonna show you the door.
- Emma.<eos> - Hi, Annie.<eos> I'm so grateful, I can't tell you.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - You know the rules.<eos> No touching.<eos> Jason sends his love.<eos> Be nice to see him.<eos> He'll come next time, I promise.<eos> So, Kevin, this is Emma Banville, the lawyer I told you about.
I'm so grateful, I can't tell you.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - You know the rules.<eos> No touching.<eos> Jason sends his love.<eos> Be nice to see him.<eos> He'll come next time, I promise.<eos> So, Kevin, this is Emma Banville, the lawyer I told you about.<eos> She's agreed to look at your case.<eos> - How much is she costing you?
Let's be clear here, not just for me.<eos> But happily it's irrelevant because we own the man who took them.<eos> - You'd better be right about this.<eos> - You seem rather stressed.<eos> Shall I come over and hold your hand?<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> Nonetheless, I'm coming.<eos> And you can do something for me.<eos> Russell's lawyer, I want information on her.<eos> Why don't you Google her?
What's wrong with having photos?<eos> It don't mean I touched her.<eos> God, you are so bloody thick.<eos> I can't do this any more.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've got two kids of my own, not just his.<eos> Even Derek's saying enough is enough.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Annie!<eos> Cops manage to recover images from those burnt pics, you're toast.
You'd avoid all the publicity that it would involve.<eos> It's important.<eos> We all need to know what happened with Linda.<eos> It might give you closure.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> Get off her!<eos> Get off her!<eos> Beth!<eos> I suppose you're gonna say it serves me right.<eos> Serves you right.
That'll give you cause to move on Miriam, and there's nothing Banville can do about it.<eos> Banville knows the rules.<eos> She plays by the rules.<eos> Now, you try a short cut, she'll sniff it out and make you rue the day.<eos> So, no.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Emma!<eos> I am so sorry, Zeinab.<eos> - No, really.<eos> - You managed to miss the whole thing.
- Emma.<eos> - Emma.<eos> Emma.<eos> - Timothy.<eos> - I like that name.<eos> - Byebye.<eos> - Byebye.<eos> Obviously, we still have to do the home visits.<eos> - Whatever you need.<eos> You're not going to like this.
No.<eos> It's the day after Linda was reported missing.<eos> The first place they searched was the school and the school grounds.<eos> Kevin helped them.<eos> It gives the prosecution a plausible theory why Kevin reburied Linda's body.<eos> He moved her back to a place he knew had been searched.<eos> What chance of the police searching it again?<eos> It's just a theory.<eos> Blows a big hole in your theory.<eos> This, plus the photos of Linda, plus the family refusing the exhumation, which you need to prove your forensic anomalies, it's not a case you'll win.

And it will backfire on Banville.<eos> As for the Coroner, ordinary decent common sense will prevail.<eos> My involvement...<eos> You do realise what else is going on here?<eos> A leadership contest which you'll only win if you pull the union and youth vote from that Trotskyite dickhead you're against.<eos> And who did you let walk out that door, disappointed and angry?<eos> An ex-shop steward with serious heft in the movement.<eos> You think he's going to support you now?<eos> Go with him to the Chief Coroner's hearing.<eos> At the very least, you need to write a letter on his behalf.
Sir Alastair.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> Him.<eos> I helped his son get a Green Card.<eos> America, the country everyone hates and everyone wants to live in.<eos> Really?<eos> Why don't you go back there, then?<eos> The small matter of the Kevin Russell retrial.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> I wonder if you even needed the Pullings move.
Probably heard about your latest headlines.<eos> It would be nice if you could try not to make his last days awful.<eos> What do you want me to do, Mum?<eos> Do you want me to stop doing what I believe in, what I'm actually good at?<eos> I want not to worry about you all the time.<eos> I want you to be settled, to have a...<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, I had a chance.<eos> I had a chance at all those things.<eos> You were 18.
Sorry about that.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll clear it up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Yusef Attar wants to meet me.<eos> What, he's here in the UK?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Em, you can't.<eos> You have to steer clear, now more than ever.
Kretchmer asked me to talk to you.<eos> He must be pleased.<eos> I hear Russell blew himself up in court today.<eos> I blew him up.<eos> But it was just dumb luck.<eos> Kretchmer wants to take the win. .<eos> He wants you to end the trial now.<eos> But how?<eos> I don't have that power.<eos> Then you'd better find it.
She was intimidated into not testifying, but once the press are at the door, she'll have to talk.<eos> And once she's outed, how long before the other girls decide to get ahead of the story, before the story destroys them too?<eos> And then they're all gonna be talking about some creep with a camera and a smooth mouth in Suffolk in 2003.<eos> You'd ruin their lives too?<eos> Where are your bloody ethics?<eos> You're a lawyer.<eos> Who just saw her innocent client walk in front of a truck.<eos> So, fuck my ethics!<eos> We just wanna know about Linda.<eos> Did you go to her or did she come to you?
I'll call the press.<eos> She said they were a goingaway present.<eos> - Who for?<eos> - Her boyfriend.<eos> Who was he?<eos> Did he work on the base?<eos> I dunno.<eos> - What was his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I still owe you for my ribs.
24 hours after your girl's disappearance,<eos> Logan was posted to Kuwait alone, two weeks ahead of his squadron.<eos> He's part of this, all right.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> He's a staff sergeant with the 114th Air National Guard at Andrews, just outside of DC.<eos> Even got you his home address.<eos> Larry, you're an angel.<eos> Wait till you get my invoice.<eos> It's a fourhour drive.<eos> And you better get started, because if the Military finds out you're here, they're gonna hide Logan in Korea or some place.
I want to shower and change my clothes.<eos> There's a toilet down the hall.<eos> Come now or not at all.<eos> I didn't tell her everything.<eos> Logan said there was security business on the base that night.<eos> Private planes landing, VIPs.<eos> Got a pen?<eos> Call this guy.<eos> Douglas.<eos> Tell him you want details of all flights in and out of the base the night that Linda disappeared.
No, she moved away a long time ago.<eos> Don't know where.<eos> Could I borrow one of these?<eos> So this is it.<eos> The old officers' mess.<eos> Olivia Greenwood.<eos> Yes, I am still questioning Banville.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where... is none of your business, Jenna.<eos> I'll call you.
You think I can swing that?<eos> And even if I could, that still doesn't prove that Kevin Russell didn't do it.<eos> We need to find the girl.<eos> We need to find Rachel Lee.<eos> Because she lied.<eos> She told a big fat lie.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's Tony. Tony Pullings.<eos> What do you want?
Excuse me, please.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Are you close?<eos> Because to get his hopes up again and then...<eos> I'm close.<eos> I'm meeting someone now.<eos> We'll talk soon.<eos> Douglas, thanks for coming.<eos> No problem.<eos> I didn't want to tell you this over the phone.
I'm close.<eos> I'm meeting someone now.<eos> We'll talk soon.<eos> Douglas, thanks for coming.<eos> No problem.<eos> I didn't want to tell you this over the phone.<eos> Dom says you've got two planes.<eos> Gulfstream out of Smith Airfield, Virginia.<eos> A C-5 out of Hamburg.<eos> There were other flights, but these are the two you want.
Good luck tomorrow with the cops.<eos> Thanks, Dom.<eos> Right.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You can't just walk back in here after disappearing for three weeks.<eos> The worst time of my life and you just waltz back in.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, the job came in...<eos> Not one phone call, one email.<eos> I sent you a Skype message.
You love them.<eos> You stay up all night with them.<eos> You bring them home.<eos> Miriam's not the first terrorist to sleep in the living room.<eos> Kevin's not the first murderer to sleep in the office.<eos> They're your children.<eos> You'll never give them up.<eos> Don't kid yourself.<eos> And I know I'm lazy.<eos> But I'm good for you.

Do you remember the autopsy report?<eos> She was buried here.<eos> If you were exposed, you and your bloody sinister cabal...<eos> Why would we kill a girl, even by accident, then conceal the facts?<eos> You're scared.<eos> Is it for yourself, or is it for someone else?<eos> Get out!<eos> Met the love of my life here.<eos> And then I lost him.<eos> You were 18.
Nothing connects to the girl.<eos> Not quite nothing.<eos> That's another issue, isn't it?<eos> You, at least, are in the clear, as long as you hold your nerve.<eos> Do you think Banville will just give up?<eos> Her client's dead, her credibility's shot.<eos> Any normal person would.<eos> So, will you head back to the States? Mm-mm.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I think you should.
'Trust me.'<eos> I had the dream again.<eos> Me on the wall.<eos> My dad.<eos> The photograph.<eos> How did it end?<eos> It didn't.<eos> It never does.<eos> And he's gonna die soon and it's all gonna be left unsaid.<eos> Then why don't you talk to him, have it out?
Absolutely.<eos> She was handing out leaflets and knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'<eos> Why has she changed her hair?<eos> 'Well, I did win and Laura and I are in it together now for the long haul.<eos> For better or for worse.'<eos> 'So that's where we leave them, the new leader and his family, in a brief moment of relaxation before he starts the biggest battle of his career.'<eos> How did you become her?<eos> Douglas, it's Emma.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry to call you so late.
Banville knows.<eos> She went to see my mother.<eos> Well, your mother is hardly in a state to talk...<eos> I have security software which monitors searches in my name.<eos> After she saw her, she went online.<eos> She searched for me.<eos> You said you'd look after me.<eos> Remember?<eos> My silence... your protection.<eos> We gave you a new life abroad, away from all this.
Then be careful.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm off.<eos> Back to the Middle East desk.<eos> What about Ruby?<eos> Well, she's off the list.<eos> No longer a person of interest, apparently.<eos> And now there's no one watching over her.<eos> Not even us.<eos> I'm sending you a file.
I'd like to talk to you about something other then relativity.<eos> I wish I could just move beyond the damn theory.<eos> This is the idea I had been missing to complete relativity. Acceleration and gravity are the same thing.<eos> And an astronomer could prove it.<eos> I found you an astronomer.<eos> Name is Freundlich.<eos> I will never feel anything but love for you, Mileva.

For me, it's everything.<eos> And general relativity is.<eos> Well, it's the most beautiful idea I've ever had.<eos> The culmination of all my hours daydreaming as a boy, all, all the years of study, of battling those who doubted me.<eos> I want the world to see, finally, what I see and marvel at the magnificence of what God has created.<eos> Well, if you want to make them marvel at the magnificence, perhaps you shouldn't rush off to Berlin before our work here is done. Hmm?<eos> Why are you suddenly in such a hurry to return to a country whose citizenship you have renounced?<eos> I counted the hours, Albert.<eos> And now, finally, here you are.<eos> You made it all happen, Elsa.

Only on the condition that I accompany you.<eos> You can't bear to be away from me.<eos> True, but I also know you're not always as adept at social niceties as you are with equations.<eos> I can help iron the inevitable wrinkles.<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> Margot, dear.<eos> I was just congratulating cousin Albert on his upcoming expedition.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> The academy.<eos> You had a visitor, a mathematician with whom you broke an appointment. Varicak?
What about your family?<eos> Mileva's furious with me regardless of.<eos> We've certainly given her reason.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Even so, she is not the monster you made her out to be.<eos> Does she deserve the scorn that will surely be heaped upon her if word spreads?<eos> Do your boys?<eos> Elsa, I moved my family to Berlin for you.<eos> You came to join the academy.<eos> Because it brought me near to you.
Albert Einstein's household. Those were your terms, were they not?<eos> Yes, if you are intent on forcing us to remain in this intolerable situation.<eos> I am.<eos> For the boys.<eos> They need their father.<eos> I would be near, no matter what.<eos> You aren't near as it is.<eos> We both know if you move out, weeks will go by without them laying eyes on the man they adore.<eos> Would that be worse than growing up with two people who can't bear to be in the same room as each other?<eos> I am not letting you walk away from the boys.
Greg was running off the books.<eos> He got Egan confessing to killing Lobos with Ghost.<eos> I'll get you the money.<eos> I promise you.<eos> I got proof that you're Ghost.<eos> What's your fuckin' price?<eos> 20,000 to this address.<eos> And I want Egan to make the drop.<eos> Tommy, trust me.<eos> Trust you?
Get your windpipe crushed, just one less bullshit-ass nigga.<eos> Pull your skirt up, bitch.<eos> What the fuck, Angela?<eos> Are you actually trying to get this case thrown out before trial?<eos> I told Angela not to pursue the traffic stop. I told her to let it go. And this is the one time you listen to the guy in charge?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Saxe is right.<eos> It's not like you not to go the extra mile, Angela.<eos> Look, let's not lose our cool here, all right?<eos> When St. Patrick told you about the traffic stop, did he say anything else you're leaving out?
And did you talk to Tommy about making the money drop for Teresi yet?<eos> - I will - Tell him to also see if he can confirm Teresi's involvement in the murder of Roberto Solletti.<eos> I got it.<eos> And what about this Silver guy, man?<eos> You sure you bettin' on the right man?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, we're all in this together.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I do.<eos> I absolutely trust you.
What are you bitchin' about?<eos> Runnin' over my boy, breaking his legs.<eos> Homie's out of control.<eos> Yo, man, I'll...<eos> I'll talk to Tommy.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Don't seem like y'all on the same page. And now I got a soldier who can't fuckin' walk.<eos> Like I said,<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Let me ask you this, if Tommy don't trust you to do your fucking job, why should I?
Yo, man, I'll...<eos> I'll talk to Tommy.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Don't seem like y'all on the same page. And now I got a soldier who can't fuckin' walk.<eos> Like I said,<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Let me ask you this, if Tommy don't trust you to do your fucking job, why should I?<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to your boy, Domingo, but he should have kept his fuckin' mouth shut.<eos> Needed to show a little bit of respect.<eos> And so do you.

I could be sending you right into a trap, but I got no choice.<eos> We're all fucked together on this one.<eos> When you go,<eos> James had something he wanted you to find out, if you can.<eos> Confirmation about Teresi being involved in a hit on Roberto Solletti?<eos> Tell Ghost I got this.<eos> What the fuck is this about, Tommy?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> "Don't worry about it," he tells me.<eos> You lost the DNA so you need me, right?

You lost the DNA so you need me, right?<eos> I'm not gonna say nothin' to help you.<eos> You may have the degrees and a badge, but I'm not as stupid as you think.<eos> I don't think you're stupid, Tasha.<eos> Stupid's not Jamie's type.<eos> Gullible, maybe.<eos> I certainly believed him when he said he was going legit.<eos> You were right to believe him.<eos> Did you believe him when he told you that he stopped seeing me?<eos> He told you about that?
Stupid's not Jamie's type.<eos> Gullible, maybe.<eos> I certainly believed him when he said he was going legit.<eos> You were right to believe him.<eos> Did you believe him when he told you that he stopped seeing me?<eos> He told you about that?<eos> I figured it out.<eos> Right after that woman tried to kill him at Truth, he came over and he told me he needed more time for us to be together.<eos> Later, I realized what he needed was you.<eos> All that time we spent meeting up, sleeping together and... he was coming home to you.

Handicapped people get all the best parking spots.<eos> Yeah, Tommy, but by doing that, man, you don't realize now you're chopping off my fuckin' balls.<eos> Think about it; now I gotta go and talk Cristobal back into the fold again.<eos> I mean, there's only so many extra keys I can throw the fuckin' Tainos, man.<eos> You see all this you're talking about right now?<eos> It's not my problem.<eos> And the fact that you're trying to make it my problem means that you are becoming my problem.<eos> You understand?<eos> I got something I gotta do. I'ma be gone a while.<eos> But I gotta ask you something.
The fuck's up with that?<eos> I didn't say nothing about that.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> I just told him that we both got picked up, that's all.<eos> And how the hell would I know if you were in there longer?<eos> Look, bro, on some G shit, you and I ain't got no more beef. All right, I'm just movin' weight like I'm supposed to.<eos> - We cool.<eos> - Do your thing, man.<eos> I heard you were... offered a gift the other day.
And how the hell would I know if you were in there longer?<eos> Look, bro, on some G shit, you and I ain't got no more beef. All right, I'm just movin' weight like I'm supposed to.<eos> - We cool.<eos> - Do your thing, man.<eos> I heard you were... offered a gift the other day.<eos> One you didn't accept.<eos> Yeah, I couldn't accept it.<eos> That gift would have helped me and the kids.<eos> We should have talked before you said no.<eos> Your little friend just came to visit and she offered me a gift too, one I don't think you would like me to take.
Here you go.<eos> You let me know if you need anything else.<eos> How do you work here without fuckin' all these girls?<eos> Oh, man, it's bad for business.<eos> Hey, we open in a half hour.<eos> So what were you sayin' about Julio fuckin' up?<eos> Yo, what are you doing? Snooping in my fuckin' room.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where'd you get all that money from?<eos> I'm not telling you shit.
All I know is my friend's information must be good.<eos> You showing up tells me that.<eos> All I know is that my boy inside gots kids.<eos> We just want to make sure nothing fucks up his case.<eos> I guess you didn't go the extra mile for Teresi.<eos> So why didn't the Feds ever pick you up?<eos> Or you never did any real work.<eos> You just hung out with made guys.<eos> I was as fuckin' real as they come.<eos> You might want to watch your fuckin' mouth.
How does Tony know that kid?<eos> Look, Connie, the less you know, the better.<eos> - Oh, no, no!<eos> - Drop it.<eos> - Drop it, okay?<eos> - Fuck you, fuck you.<eos> I'm sick, I'm a woman, but this is my house, and I have a fuckin' right to know what goes on under my roof!<eos> In 40 years of marriage, Tony never once... Not once...<eos> He never once lied to me, and that shit is not gonna start now.<eos> Tony's just trying to keep you alive and happy.
I'm gonna get him transferred.<eos> Oh, nice work, yo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it ain't all good news, James.<eos> I think the Ruiz recording may have surfaced.<eos> And it's not good.<eos> The prosecution has it, huh?<eos> A Homeland Security Agent.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Look, if Mak had it, he'd be introducing it in court right after announcing a RICO action against you and Tommy. He's not doing that.
I'll know more tomorrow, but... if this recording does directly incriminate you, there may only be one way out of this mess. It's not happening, come on. You know that, yo.<eos> I'm not flippin' on Tommy, man.<eos> Did he go see Teresi's guy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, and?<eos> He said he couldn't be 100% sure, but the guy jumped when he brought up Solletti's name.<eos> - Bingo.<eos> - So did Teresi's wife.<eos> I thought so.<eos> And the sick fuck wrote everything down, asked me to give it to you.
But shit's going down with Ghost.<eos> Truth closed.<eos> I don't know how I'ma pay you next month.<eos> That sounds like a you problem to me.<eos> I don't give a fuck how you do it.<eos> Just get it done.<eos> Hey, what's good, brother?<eos> What's Tariq doing here, man?<eos> He here to have a good time.<eos> I think it's time for you to be getting home to that beautiful daughter you got.
Downtown.<eos> Shit, what you doin' hangin' with these niggas?<eos> I don't know, they real.<eos> Unlike my family at home.<eos> Where you from?<eos> I'm from here.<eos> Your parents know you're here? Hell no.<eos> Yours?<eos> They don't give a fuck where I'm at.<eos> Did Slim tell you to do this?
You see why I say you gotta choose.<eos> St. Patrick or Egan.<eos> It only helps St. Patrick if he flips and builds a case against Egan.<eos> Who specifically on the prosecution team has heard this?<eos> Well, I told Saxe about it, but he hasn't heard it.<eos> You and I are the only ones who've heard it.<eos> Tommy, no!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck, Tommy?<eos> I told you to stay the fuck in there!
What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck, Tommy?<eos> I told you to stay the fuck in there!<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> He's a federal fucking agent!<eos> Yeah, well, now we in this together.<eos> We both implicated.<eos> So... gettin' Ghost to flip on me ain't really an option for you no more.<eos> Is it?<eos> So, let me ask you something.
Yo.<eos> Got the payment.<eos> You're good for a week.<eos> I'm gonna need you to keep 'em comin', though.<eos> I need something else too.<eos> That friend of yours, Tommy Egan,<eos> I want to meet him.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Not gonna be paying you any more money, either.
You joking', right?<eos> The prosecution made an argument that I had a conflict of interest, that by you not accepting the deal they offered,<eos> I wasn't representing you.<eos> Well... you alone.<eos> Yeah, but I would have never taken that deal, man. And I would have never turned on...<eos> The judge doesn't know that.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> We don't do nothing.<eos> Silver's your guy now.<eos> Now, I know you don't like him, but he's your only way out.
Oh, I know.<eos> If St. Patrick was using the nightclub business to hide a murder-for-hire payment, we could argue the whole company is corrupt.<eos> - A RICO case.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And once Judge Tapper hears about this, we have a whole other way to nail St. Patrick.<eos> Hey, Marshall, it was a damn shame to hear about your transfer.<eos> Danbury's pretty drafty this time of year, ain't it?<eos> How the fuck you know about that?<eos> You know how it works around here.<eos> I ain't got shit to say to you, convict.
Impressive.<eos> You like that?<eos> Yeah, look at you, rolling that blunt.<eos> Most of the girls I've been with don't even know how to roll they hair.<eos> In that case, how do you roll a blunt, white boy?<eos> Don't y'all usually use bongs and shit? Yeah.<eos> Us white boys we use bongs.<eos> Big ole bongs like this.<eos> - Let me see. - This bong here.<eos> You like that?
And now I'm hearing Tasha might have to testify.<eos> Some asset fortified hearing?<eos> It's an asset forfeiture hearing.<eos> Silver really doesn't have a choice.<eos> If Tasha was running the family books, then she would need to get on the stand and verify any activity.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> Tasha's as involved as the rest of us.<eos> The weave shop that she's been managing, it's being used to clean my money.<eos> How the fuck am I just hearing about this now?<eos> Because it was need-to-know, and until now, you didn't need to know.
You know, I've personally never been to prison, but the stories I've...<eos> Simon, I don't have time for this.<eos> You know, I, for one, don't believe you did it, even though everyone is saying you did, but... not me.<eos> I'd like to think you're not capable of such atrocities.<eos> You're right, I'm innocent. That's the spirit, James.<eos> You must keep your mind focused on the case, not about things on the outside, like your financial situation, for example.<eos> I heard about the freezing of your assets.<eos> It's heartbreaking.<eos> How do they expect your family to live?<eos> I'd like to float you a marker until this whole mess is over.
Saw them together at the club the other night.<eos> At Truth?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna be working at this hole-in-the-wall spot<eos> Dre's setting up for some party.<eos> Do you want me to keep an eye out for anything?<eos> No, mama, don't worry about it.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Yo.<eos> Gotta be aware of your surroundings.<eos> You don't want no one sneaking up on you.
Mr. Silver, those are some very compelling points.<eos> You have anything you want to say to dispute them?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> We'd like to present a witness.<eos> I'd like to call James St. Patrick to the sand.<eos> You swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?<eos> I do.<eos> Mr. St. Patrick, are you aware of the check the prosecution cited?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I don't know where you grew up, but when somebody gives you a check for seven figures, you tend to remember... That's a lot of zeroes.
I know it was you.<eos> When did it happen?<eos> Tell me the truth, Tommy.<eos> She said I was hitting it right?<eos> When that Milan shit popped off.<eos> He saw LaKeisha as a problem and solving it meant one thing. So instead,<eos> I stashed her away.<eos> I didn't plan on hitting it, it just... happened.<eos> A bunch of times.<eos> I guess I should thank you for saving my girl's life behind my back.
You will be processed out of the system with this court's apologies.<eos> If you are guilty of this or any other crime, I hope a more professional prosecution team will bring you to justice in the future.<eos> But for now, sir, you can go home.<eos> Thank you, Angela.<eos> Don't thank me, Jamie.<eos> You didn't do this one.<eos> Maybe you didn't do this crime, but we both know you're not innocent.<eos> Yo, Grim, I'ma need a new clean ride.<eos> Place is a little dusty, but the bitches ain't bad.<eos> The fuck you want, nigga?
He ain't like us.<eos> He ain't from where we from.<eos> And the shit you got him involved with is changing him. He's lying and...<eos> And if I can see it, you best believe Tommy and Tasha will.<eos> Kanan, you got back in this because you want what's yours, right?<eos> Well, what's yours can still be had.<eos> How?<eos> Because Milan's dead and I'm in.<eos> With Milan being dead, your path back to the top is wide open.<eos> And I want to help you, Kanan.
I got a call about my dad's will.<eos> You mentioned you received a sizable settlement.<eos> Who called?<eos> He said he was my dad's lawyer.<eos> Wanted to meet about some problem tomorrow.<eos> - Wouldn't say what.<eos> - Well, it sounds shady.<eos> Is there any chance you could come?<eos> I wouldn't wanna get taken advantage of, you know, especially with the fuzziness.<eos> I'll say to you what I say to all of my clients.
Now, the will, as I'm sure you'll agree, is no longer valid, so if you'd just sign that...<eos> Say no more.<eos> It's your money, after all.<eos> And it's a small price to pay for this family reunion.<eos> Now, once you get back on your feet, I think that we should...<eos> Well, geez, you tell me.<eos> What is it we used to do together?<eos> I know I'd love to hear some stories, look at some photos.<eos> I can tell you a story right now if you'd like.<eos> You were 11 or so.
He doesn't trust us. But he trusts Peyton.<eos> I could get her to ask him to hear us out.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> They're the ones that can't even get on nasdaq.<eos> Off the phone, please, Mr. Davis.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> I'm telling you!
This is the highlight of my week.<eos> Liv, this is Justin, my friend from work.<eos> Justin, this is Liv.<eos> - Hey, there.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Your text freaked me out.<eos> "Get over here stat."<eos> We're on zumba instructor brain.<eos> That explains a lot.<eos> I hope you're a zombie, or the snacks here may have been more than you bargained for.

- Ravi, enough!<eos> - Open your eyes, Peyton!<eos> - My eyes are wide open.<eos> Why are you being such a dick?<eos> It isn't obvious?<eos> It's because I'm in love with you.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Shoot me up, doc.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to do this.
Lots of weird-ass peppers.<eos> We can do tasting flights and...<eos> Hey.<eos> This our new muscle?<eos> I wouldn't say ours.<eos> The club will offer brains of one's choosing.<eos> For a price.<eos> Dino's specialty is acquisitions.<eos> Dope.<eos> As for our establishment's name, I give you the scratching post.
Well, Yas is with Mama.<eos> Thank you. Tariq spent the night over at Calvin's.<eos> And Raina's at a sleepover too.<eos> They'll be back sometime this afternoon.<eos> I just figured they'd be here, you know, seeing as though I just got out.<eos> I figured we'd celebrate as a family.<eos> Yeah, well, the kids have been through a lot, Ghost.<eos> They just need some time.<eos> We need to talk about Tariq.<eos> Guess you need some time too, huh?
Mr. St. Patrick?<eos> James, it's so good to see you back in a suit.<eos> You look like a-a new man.<eos> And you look the same.<eos> I always look the same.<eos> I have quite the ghastly portrait in my attic.<eos> Uh, that's a reference to a book, James, about a beautiful boy named Dorian Gray...<eos> Yes, I've read it.<eos> Look, I hate to break up our book club we're having, but I'd like you to get out of my club.<eos> Why are you so suspicious of me, when all I want is the best for you, for everyone, really?
Tasha took money from you? Mm-hmm.<eos> How much?<eos> Oh, details are so gauche.<eos> If you agree to work with me in a new business venture, I will forgive every cent of your loan.<eos> That shit again. No, no.<eos> Something better.<eos> A real estate group. You would be the CEO.<eos> I'd simply be a silent partner.<eos> Silent?<eos> What's in it for you?

No, no.<eos> Something better.<eos> A real estate group. You would be the CEO.<eos> I'd simply be a silent partner.<eos> Silent?<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> Well, the business under your name would garner a minority business development loan, and a tax break that will make this lucrative for both of us.<eos> Okay, so you've come to my club to tell me you need my black ass to make you more money?
Ghost got too much heat on him right now for me to make a move.<eos> Well, you better get moving, motherfucker.<eos> Or I will put a bullet in this boy's ass for fun.<eos> I ain't no fucking babysitter.<eos> Don't fuck this up.<eos> I ain't gonna fuck this up... why you keep saying shit like that?<eos> I ain't gonna make a move till I can get him clean.<eos> Where you got Tariq?<eos> Queens.<eos> I'll give you the address once Ghost's ass is in the car and the money's in hand.
No shit.<eos> I knew he was lying.<eos> But you're smarter than him.<eos> I know you're not gonna let him beat you.<eos> What's the business?<eos> Real estate.<eos> Guess he needs a black face for a tax break and a headline.<eos> Hmm, well... it's good press.<eos> That could work both ways, right?<eos> I mean, Simon Stern doing business with you is good for your image.

Fuck yeah!<eos> You want a piece of this?<eos> You want a fucking piece of me, bitches?<eos> Fuck!<eos> You disresected me for the last time.<eos> What you deserve is that Dre kills you, motherfucker!<eos> And this is what you deserve.<eos> Yo, yo, yo.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hey, you lucky I'm cramped from being in that motherfucking trunk.
That's what I'm telling you, all right?<eos> Petar played us both.<eos> Tatiana...<eos> Tatiana, thank you for telling me who to believe.<eos> Yeah, rot in hell, you fucking bitch.<eos> I think you'll be a great successor to Milan.<eos> I hope we'll be in business for a long time.<eos> Me too.<eos> Although I didn't particularly enjoy my ride here, I respect the way you guys work.<eos> But trust me, I ain't never gonna let you walk behind me again.
But trust me, I ain't never gonna let you walk behind me again.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> After you.<eos> You're a funny guy, Tommy.<eos> Yeah, you ain't seen nothing yet, hmm.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> Couldn't get rid of me that easy, motherfucker. Right?<eos> Don't try no stupid shit.<eos> We got Tariq.<eos> You do exactly what the fuck I tell you to do, or we gonna kill that little nigga.
Put it in park.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> You better not pull no motherfucking bullshit moves, or Tariq is gone for good, you hear me?<eos> I'm not fucking playing with you, man.<eos> K, what I got to do to get my son back, man?<eos> Come on, K, I just got out the motherfucking joint. You know that.<eos> I'm low on that, man.<eos> I ain't got no fucking money right now.<eos> Well, if you want your son alive, you'll figure some shit out.<eos> Not having no money never stopped you from getting money before.
So what should I say? Tell her the truth.<eos> You gonna get the little nigga.<eos> You better not fuck this up.<eos> Hey, Tasha, I was just about to call you.<eos> What's up, T?<eos> I went to pick up Tariq from his sleepover, and he wasn't there.<eos> Calvin said something about some girl?<eos> He left his house to go see a girl. Yeah, he called me.<eos> He called you?<eos> Why you?
About fucking time.<eos> I wasn't about to accept a check from this motherfucker.<eos> We just stole your money back.<eos> And Ghost about to get what he deserve.<eos> I'm here, son.<eos> We going home.<eos> You look good, Ghost.<eos> All dressed up like a fucking civilian.<eos> People really believe that act?<eos> I never done a fucking thing to you.
- You said you set Kanan on fire. - I did.<eos> How the fuck is he still alive?<eos> Half of him is fuckin' burned, Tommy, okay?<eos> Scarred.<eos> His face, his chest, his arms.<eos> Arms?<eos> Holy shit, Tasha was right.<eos> What's Tasha gotta do with this?<eos> The night that you got locked up and Tariq went missing. Yeah, okay.<eos> She didn't tell you?
Yeah, that fuckin' crazy bitch.<eos> That one.<eos> She kidnapped him.<eos> So Kanan fuckin' shoots her to save Tariq's life.<eos> Ghost, this story is so fuckin' weird.<eos> If you were anybody the fuck else, for any other fuckin' reason, you'd be dead right now.<eos> I know.<eos> Come on, I guess you guys need a ride.<eos> Yo, 'Riq.<eos> Tariq, let me ask you something.
Tasha, he was with Kanan, okay? Kanan kidnapped Tariq.<eos> And apparently it ain't the first time.<eos> So... Slim was Kanan this whole time?<eos> Go shower up, son.<eos> And give me your clothes when you're done.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Tasha, where are the girls?<eos> Tasha, where the girls?<eos> In their rooms.<eos> Look, okay, I... I never got a chance to tell you what's been going on with...
Tariq used to be a good kid, Ghost.<eos> Then he started talking back, stealing guns, and lying when you decided to leave this family for her.<eos> I didn't leave our family. I left you.<eos> Right.<eos> You left me.<eos> Because our life together was real.<eos> And with Angela, you could pretend to be something you never were.<eos> Come on, Tasha, let's just cut the shit, all right?<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with you, nor me. It's about Tariq and motherfuckin' Kanan!<eos> Well, we wouldn't be talking about motherfucking Kanan if you killed him ten years ago, like I told you to.
Like the call you made when you didn't tell me that Ruiz was wearin' a wire?<eos> You know, the night I killed him?<eos> Yeah, I know. Proctor told me that you broke into that FBI agent's apartment to try to get the tape back.<eos> I didn't get it back.<eos> I know, I did.<eos> But not before I heard every blessed detail.<eos> From Milan to stabby-stabby.<eos> So who had it, huh? Who got it?<eos> Proctor?<eos> He played it for you?
I didn't get it back.<eos> I know, I did.<eos> But not before I heard every blessed detail.<eos> From Milan to stabby-stabby.<eos> So who had it, huh? Who got it?<eos> Proctor?<eos> He played it for you?<eos> Ghost, there was a tape.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> That's all you need to know.
That was part of the deal.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Let's see what he got to say about it.<eos> That don't sound good.<eos> What's he sayin'?<eos> Begging for his life.<eos> Yeah, J was a tough motherfucker.<eos> You tellin' me this pup took out Julio all by hisself?<eos> And cut off the tattoo.<eos> To make it right, we wanted to offer the kill to you.

Oh, well... that was nice.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, don't shoot, don't shoot.<eos> This motherfucker was a lone wolf.<eos> Tommy, he's voluntarily bringing you one of his own, dog.

Tommy, he's voluntarily bringing you one of his own, dog.<eos> Chill!<eos> You think bringing' me a scrub like this is gonna make up for me losing my distro?<eos> I want the territory we gave you for Julio.<eos> I can't do it without approval from upstairs.<eos> Who, the Jimenez?<eos> I'll talk to 'em.<eos> They're fuckin' crazy, man. They're butchers.<eos> I don't think...<eos> Or I could just shoot you in the face right now, and they'll come lookin' for me.
Diego, what the fuck, man?<eos> Let me go!<eos> Let me go!<eos> So our guy in narcotics tells us they got a call from a potential informant.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That can't be.<eos> And there it is.<eos> That's your rat.<eos> A good manager gives her employees exactly what they've earned, and since you've been more concerned about snorting than helping us sell it...
What is real is the fact that you been hanging out with Kanan.<eos> I need to know how you met him.<eos> I was on the street.<eos> And he told me he was a friend of Shawn's.<eos> And he told me he knew you from back in the day.<eos> But he didn't tell me why he was mad at you.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Nothing to deserve him hurting you.<eos> He didn't hurt me, though. He saved my life.<eos> And he must have had his own reasons for doing that, son, but look, no matter how nice he was to you, you heard what he said,
And he must have had his own reasons for doing that, son, but look, no matter how nice he was to you, you heard what he said,<eos> Kanan's a bad man, done some bad things.<eos> I mean, he murdered his own son.<eos> Shawn said he was in jail for a long time.<eos> Is that why he was mad at you?<eos> Kanan was in jail because he broke the law.<eos> That's it.<eos> Had nothing to do with me.<eos> And Mom?<eos> Neither your mother or I did anything to hurt Kanan, no matter what Kanan or Jukebox told you.
Don't get hung up on where for now, huh?<eos> Right.<eos> I need a pick-me-up.<eos> Pleasure, Councilman.<eos> 'Sup, little man.<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> Oh, they're out right now, but Big Mama's back there with Yas.<eos> Okay, we'll keep it quiet.<eos> Hey, look, Tariq, I just wanna let you know that Kanan ain't coming back.<eos> So you ain't gotta be scared.
Hey, look, Tariq, I just wanna let you know that Kanan ain't coming back.<eos> So you ain't gotta be scared.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> - Uncle T. - 'Sup?<eos> Did you help my dad put Kanan in jail?<eos> No.<eos> And... and...<eos> I mean, honestly, 'Riq,<eos> I didn't know nothing about it.<eos> Why, what did Kanan tell you?
- You're the idiot.<eos> Do you realize if Dad goes to jail for good, Tariq, we won't have any of this?<eos> No more penthouse.<eos> No more video games.<eos> We'll be broke.<eos> Is that really what you want?<eos> Damn it, 'Riq, listen to me.<eos> - Yo, get outta my room.<eos> - Ow, Tariq, stop!<eos> Too bad Mom's not here to save you.
We'll be broke.<eos> Is that really what you want?<eos> Damn it, 'Riq, listen to me.<eos> - Yo, get outta my room.<eos> - Ow, Tariq, stop!<eos> Too bad Mom's not here to save you.<eos> You look beautiful tonight.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> The ring is a particularly nice touch.<eos> I guess this suits you after all.
Uh, you hear all that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come in.<eos> We have something to show you.<eos> Tasha, what are you doing here?<eos> Look, Terry, this ring... It's just part of the costume.<eos> I mean, you were the one that told me that I needed to stand by James so he doesn't end up in jail.<eos> I did say that and I wasn't being fair, okay?<eos> Look, I don't have the right to ask anything of you.<eos> You should go.
What if I had met you first?<eos> So... what do we need to talk about that's so important?<eos> I need you to call Teresi for me.<eos> That old gangster?<eos> The one that took out Soletti?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause that old gangster witnessed me kill a marshal in prison.<eos> Well, that wasn't very smart.<eos> Yeah, as not smart as you killing a Homeland Security Agent?<eos> - Proctor told you?
Why would he do that?<eos> 'Cause he ain't our lawyer anymore, Tommy.<eos> He's an accomplice.<eos> Well, unless we shut his ass up. We don't have the recording.<eos> We don't have the body.<eos> We don't know what kind of instructions he left in case something happens to him.<eos> What I'm saying is if this fucking body shows up, it traces back to you and me, man.<eos> You fucked up when you killed the agent, and I fucked up when I killed the marshal.<eos> So here we are yet again, needing each other to set some shit straight.<eos> I'll go talk to Proctor. You need to fucking...
Well, you know something.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna talk to me, or they're gonna kill you.<eos> It's up to you which happens first.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I'm a busy man. What do you want?<eos> It's good to hear your voice, Tommy.<eos> How's my Connie holding up?<eos> She looked sick, but you know that.<eos> Cut the small talk.<eos> What do you want?
It's a lot of time to think about, you know, my life and, uh...<eos> The biggest lesson that you learn is that the only people that really matter are your family.<eos> Yeah, it sounds like group therapy has done wonders for you, but if this conversation isn't about money, I got other shit...<eos> Tommy, look...<eos> I don't know any other way to say this.<eos> I'm your dad.<eos> You're my son.<eos> And I want to meet you.<eos> My dad is dead, motherfucker.<eos> No, I was told to call you, and I did.
Previously on Power...<eos> I'll deliver Julio to you, and you take him out.
No, don't worry about it.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if you don't mind.<eos> Hm.<eos> I didn't know you had a lady.<eos> I wouldn't call her my lady.<eos> You know how it is these days.<eos> It's a gray area.<eos> Well, if need any help cleaning up around here,<eos> Tasha can put you in touch with our housekeeper.
Terry?<eos> The lawyer, Silver?<eos> Y'all still talking?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, 'Keisha, I gotta tell you something.<eos> Mom?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, I want to show this to you.
And believe it or not, I understand a little of what you're going through.<eos> - Cullen: I saw the picture. - Roger:<eos> So did I.<eos> You did?<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes you do things that you think are nobody else's business, and then they blow up in your face, so...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the Board, they publish calendars of firemen, sexy, scantily clad, in weird positions, oftentimes oiled public servants, and you think that because a fireman is sexy that he can't do his job? No?<eos> Me neither.<eos> Judge Wright, you must admit that you showed a lapse in judgment.<eos> No, sir, with all due respect, the only lapse in judgment I showed was forgetting the fact that anyone in the 21st century can hack into anyone else's personal items.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the Board, if you want to go ahead and punish me or censor me, I will take my lumps, but I will not agree with you, and I refuse to apologize.
Of course.<eos> If there are no further interruptions...<eos> You're right, Dr. Fuentes.<eos> This fracture is not from the mallet, although its proximity to the mallet strike does give us cause of death.<eos> Very good.<eos> But the damage is too small to be of significance.<eos> No, not if the mallet blow could have caused a subdural hematoma.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> The blood would accumulate and expand in the intracranial space until something caused it to rupture and kill her.<eos> The small, sharp force blow you discovered is more than enough.
don't you think I know that?<eos> Luckily for you, it's all been taken care of.<eos> Damon, what the hell did you do?<eos> Look. I...<eos> Magical neck snap.<eos> Never gets old.<eos> Isn't this the part where you start running?<eos> I've spent my entire life running from you.<eos> I'm not running anymore. What are you doing out here?<eos> Just thinking about how proud I am of you and your brother.
Shocker.<eos> I like being a sociopath.<eos> You know, I'm not burdened by things like guilt or love.<eos> So then this merge happened with my brother Luke, and I won, which was great because I absorbed his ability to do magic, but now I can't stop thinking about how Luke died, how Liv's life is ruined.<eos> For some horrible reason, I can't shake how badly I feel about it.<eos> You feel bad?<eos> Yeah. So when I absorbed Luke's magic, I must have gotten some of his qualities or something like empathy.<eos> So I googled how to process emotional pain, and they said if you write everything down in a letter and burn it, you'll be healed.<eos> So I started writing, and this water literally started pooling in my eyes.<eos> Has that ever happened to you, like... Like water just... Just oozing out of my eyeballs like I'm some alien creature excreting fluids.
History repeating itself.<eos> Of course, the other possibility is that, if his father WAS murdered, whoever did it would be afraid that Jacob was going to expose...<eos> Yes, well, I'd rather not make any assumptions just yet.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> In the meantime, Sergeant Goodfellow, here, will take your statements downstairs.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Father Brown.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you all right?
Martin is the chief clerk.<eos> If Harrogate gets sent down, he'll be left in charge.<eos> Really?<eos> Should have been me, of course.<eos> Harrogate's never appreciated those of us who really put the hours in.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Harrogate.<eos> Please, don't go anywhere.<eos> Inspector...<eos> You'll have to wait your turn, Father.<eos> I've a few observations I'd like to share with you.
I had a few personal items to collect before the place gets shut down.<eos> Are you going to tell anyone about me?<eos> Was this Billy's horse?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did it live up to its name?<eos> A lame donkey could have run faster than that.<eos> It was very brave of you, coming here alone.<eos> I'm a man of God.<eos> I am never alone.<eos> And will your God telephone for an ambulance if you have a little accident?
She's confused.<eos> She does not know what to think.<eos> I lost my wife to illness, my son to the war.<eos> I couldn't stand it if I also lost my daughter.<eos> I think she needs time to think.<eos> That's the one thing I may not have.<eos> I am here because I've discovered that Billy planned the robbery.<eos> - I've spoken to one of his men. - Billy? Are you sure?<eos> The one question that's been going around in my head all day... ..is why me?<eos> Why was I taken to the vault with you?

But that's still no reason for putting the whole future of St George in jeopardy.<eos> But, My Lord, shooting?<eos> It's like golf.<eos> It livens up a good country walk.<eos> Yes, but, with respect, My Lord, golf does not involve the slaughter of God's creatures.<eos> Controlling the bird population doesn't trouble the Vatican, Brown.<eos> As you well know.<eos> But, My Lord, why not meet Mr Duke after your homily at St Mary's?<eos> Or at the theatre?<eos> Are you all right, Brown?
Er, the door was open.<eos> Is hiding in a lady's dressing room normal behaviour for a priest?<eos> You played a nun masquerading as a plantation owner.<eos> Sure you were very good.<eos> But there is another detail in the credits which interests me.<eos> Temporary wardrobe mistress,<eos> Ethel Davies.<eos> I imagine that a leading lady has to trust her wardrobe mistress absolutely.<eos> After all, she makes you look the part.<eos> And although she was with you for...
But you knew that I could tell nobody about what you told me.<eos> I believed you would find a way.<eos> Oh, Father, I have been such a fool.<eos> You can still gain God's forgiveness.<eos> But He will only forgive if He knows that you are truly repentant.<eos> I want this torment to end.<eos> Then you must take responsibility for your crime.<eos> I'll be hanged...<eos> If you go to the police yourself, then I believe the church will be lenient.<eos> But if they come to you...
Probably.<eos> But then, we all do things we regret later... .. don't we... .. Winston?<eos> You know, some people say I have my head in the clouds.<eos> Ethel has chosen not to kill your uncle and has handed herself in.<eos> How dare you interfere!<eos> ~ Where are you going?<eos> ~ To kill him myself!<eos> Ethel cannot protect you for long.<eos> She's not an actress.<eos> So I can't afford to waste time talking to you.
I know her lines.<eos> I know where she stands.<eos> Well, yes, I'm a couple of years older than her, but if you and Peter will just give me the chance to show what I could do.<eos> ~ Act one, scene four?<eos> ~ Fine.<eos> All right, when you're ready, my dear.<eos> Is that...?<eos> Must have been a tough decision for them.<eos> Very difficult.<eos> ~ Are you all right, Lady Felicia?
I was going through a really emotional time, and I don't know, Dr. Gurgler, if you've ever been through anything like that.<eos> Well, actually I have.<eos> I recently went through a devastating breakup, even had a good cry in the car on the way over here.<eos> But, um, anyway, all is forgiven.<eos> Yeah, boy.<eos> You're the man now, dog.<eos> That is very sweet.<eos> Now, Rishi, why don't you tell him a little bit about your freelancing?<eos> Oh, that's great. Ah do you have a reference we can call?<eos> Uh, yes, I do, actually, and he'd love to talk with you.
Why don't you have a seat inside, and we'll get started?<eos> Now, of course there's a variety of top-notch specialists here in Manhattan.<eos> Excuse me a second.<eos> Top-notch specialists right here in Manhattan.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Psst, pamphlet.<eos> Ahem, pamphlet.<eos> I left a pamphlet.<eos> Get away from the door!<eos> Are you okay?
Ah!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, my God. I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> What... you got the...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You get me fired, you break my window, and then you wake me up from a good dream?<eos> I got hit by a city snowplow, and I was living off the settlement money, man.<eos> It was like a dream come true.<eos> Look, Dr. Bergdahl, we're not here to antagonize you.
Oh, here's where I left my jacket.<eos> And I've been walking around in my daughter's cheerleading windbreaker for the last two weeks.<eos> No, you know what?<eos> A decent person would've called about a mysterious man's coat, but I guess you, Dr. Lahiri, are just a little too inconsiderate to think about any...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I puked all over you.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Get it all out.<eos> You're gonna be all right.
Being so close to the woman you love and not being able to tell her.<eos> You do love Katie, don't you?<eos> So, it was suicide, then?<eos> Ah, no, it was, in fact, murder.<eos> - But you just said he killed himself.<eos> - Yes, he did, he did.<eos> Um, er... it was murder... made to look like suicide masquerading as murder.<eos> Yes.<eos> You couldn't let him go back out on the circuit, could you?<eos> He was going to take the woman you love away.
I worry about you sometimes.<eos> Do you?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're fearless.<eos> You see something, you go for it.<eos> No matter what the risk.<eos> It's inspiring, I suppose.<eos> Is it?<eos> Sure.<eos> Being around you, it makes me smile.
Well, the, uh, the left shoe that, you know, made this footprint is worn away on its inside edge, so...<eos> It was dark-<eos> - I-I hid as soon as I got to the alarm.<eos> I don't think I saw him walk at all.<eos> The gun dealer you spoke to described a man who had trouble walking.<eos> That could explain the uneven wear. Mmm.<eos> Gun dealer?<eos> Yeah, we thought we had a lead on where the weapon came from, but I sent the dealer the pictures we talked about.<eos> No luck.<eos> So, does anyone else live here with you?
He shot Mr. Duncan in his own kitchen.<eos> Maybe Duncan knew him, trusted him.<eos> Here, in contrast, we have a ham-fisted attempt to sneak up on Mrs. Powell through her backyard.<eos> It's out of character.<eos> Something's different.<eos> You two need to see this.<eos> The police are sure it was the Aceway Killer?<eos> Well, I don't see how there could be any doubt.<eos> My husband was on Flight 1059.<eos> Are you afraid he might come after you again?
Attention, all students, please make your way to the quad for a mandatory assembly.<eos> - Ladies first. - Ugh!<eos> Gandhi once said the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in service.<eos> And I look forward to serving you as Hester's new... Vice principal.<eos> As of today, we have a new leader...<eos> Principal Turner.<eos> What's the deal?<eos> Thank you, Vice Principal Beaver.<eos> It's Bevier.<eos> Kids, I'll be honest with you.
Oh, Kit's case?<eos> Honestly, we're not sure just yet, but, um, it's looking like it.<eos> Mm. Says you.<eos> There's a murder-suicide in town.<eos> Your buddy Kit? Same unit as the killer.<eos> Same whacked-out antics.<eos> So...<eos> Look, we're not going anywhere, all right?<eos> And if you care about your buddy, you'll let us handle this.<eos> Nah, I think I'm gonna be coming with you.
(Finch) We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
Yeah, I wanted to know what to write in your birthday card.<eos> Well, everyone away from the car.<eos> I just got off the phone with my dad.<eos> The car is being seized in the morning.<eos> Turns out they won't let me keep my present.<eos> It's just like my eighth birthday when they made me return Macaulay Culkin.<eos> They bought you a boy?<eos> You were rich.<eos> Oh, boy, the car's right here, and you can't even use it.<eos> That's like me having you two for waitresses.
I just... I just always have wanted little baby curls.<eos> That's him.<eos> That looks like real hair to me.<eos> No, not him.<eos> Him.<eos> I think I just saw that thing on Animal Planet last night.<eos> - Time to trap the wildebeest.<eos> - Go for it.<eos> Hey, NYPD.<eos> May I have a word with you?
- Extra clams?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> So, how's your case going?<eos> Think we found the killer.<eos> Your employee Eric is in custody.<eos> Eric?<eos> Seemed like such a good kid to me.<eos> Seemed that way to me, too.<eos> There's just one loose end.<eos> When we asked you before, you said that Eric was with you the morning of the murder, and you even showed us a time card.
Yeah.<eos> This is us.<eos> So, uh, you gonna join us upstairs for a nightcap?<eos> My daughter keeps a surprisingly well-stocked bar.<eos> You know, I would love to, but, uh, I got to get to work.<eos> This late at night?<eos> Oh, mom, remember?<eos> I told you he was recently involved in a shootout.<eos> Yeah, you know, we keep crazy hours and we're in the middle of a major investigation and, uh, we got a meeting with a witness, so, uh, unfortunately, I can't do it tonight.<eos> But it was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Potter.

293 Oak Street, Idaho Falls.<eos> Red door, pear tree.<eos> This looks like the place.<eos> If this is Thorvin's half-brother, he might also be his killer.<eos> We don't know how he might react.<eos> I'll keep cover in case he decides to flip out or flee.<eos> Mr. Igawa?<eos> I'm Sheriff Walt Longmire from Absaroka County in Wyoming.<eos> This is Deputy Moretti.<eos> You mind if we come in and speak to you?
All right, we'll take it from here.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Copy that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 10-4.<eos> - All right, Andy, let's go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, it was great working with you guys.
Yeah, we found that out the hard way.<eos> I don't know how the hell you found me here, but you being here jams me up.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> We need you to testify against Dano, Vincent.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> Victor Dano is a merciless, stone-cold killer who would whack his mother for 50Gs.<eos> He would.<eos> But I ain't out here for my health.<eos> You see, there's a very big price for me back East.<eos> I give you my word, I can get you in and out of the city in 72 hours.
Frank, I am quite confident there isn't anything that you don't already know.<eos> Marone.<eos> What part of "no" don't you understand?<eos> The "N" or the "O"?<eos> I am not gonna testify against Victor Dano, okay?<eos> And nothing you say is gonna change my mind.<eos> I know.<eos> Melissa?<eos> What are you doing dragging my granddaughter into this?<eos> What's the matter with you?
All he really did was get into it with two individuals in the funeral party.<eos> Disruption of a funeral service-- that's a class "A" misdemeanor.<eos> He didn't really disrupt.<eos> He did have words with two members of the party who made some comments about the cap he was wearing.<eos> It was a Red Sox cap, sir.<eos> You know how that can go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just didn't think he should go back to prison for it.<eos> I'm gonna ask you a question and I expect an honest answer.<eos> Did anybody talk to you about this?
Okay.<eos> Try this bluff.<eos> I know who finances your PAC.<eos> Oh... that brought you up short.<eos> How would that sound, me telling the press who's laundering his money through your PAC?<eos> Okay, Mr. Sweeney.<eos> I will consult with Diane and Cary.<eos> I will look through the evidence.<eos> But I won't be in court.<eos> I won't be seen with you.
It could make the difference in your campaign.<eos> - You've raised a lot of money, too.<eos> - I have. He's quite a character, isn't he: Redmayne?<eos> He is.<eos> A bit provocative?<eos> I guess.<eos> My campaign manager is angry.<eos> Why's that?<eos> He thinks Redmayne was in my column and then he wasn't.<eos> After he spoke to you.
Don't forget me.<eos> Now I've seen everything.<eos> A window that talks?<eos> !<eos> Okay, can you explain again how I take this medication?<eos> One a day with food.<eos> Yeah, but what kind of food, girly?<eos> Stuffed cabbage, a nice bowl of soup?<eos> (sighs) Any idea when you'll get to me?<eos> Well, there's four old people ahead of you, so how's Thursday at 1:00?
- But it is really, isn't it?<eos> - It is, yeah, I'll go with that.<eos> The 20 seconds after you've been hit by that is worse than 20 seconds after you've been hit by a nuclear bomb.<eos> You're vaporised, exactly. Or just, what do you do with that?<eos> You vomit, you just...<eos> It's horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.<eos> - Beautiful story.<eos> - It is a lovely story.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I'm happy to share it with you.
If any of you had done it, I would have married you, goddamn it.<eos> How do they stamp them, Stephen?<eos> Well, they've got a little thing inside their little hymen.<eos> A little printing event, that goes on, just as it comes out, getting its best-before date.<eos> - That's clever. That's very clever. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> The cartridges to refill a chicken are really prohibitively expensive.<eos> LAUGHTER - Well, yes, you've rather revealed my trick...<eos> - Oh, they're great.<eos> Meanwhile, on the chicken farm, Barnes Wallace...<eos> And so, having spent a little time having it large with you all, it's time to look at the scores.
He is still the bad guy here.<eos> He is playing them;<eos> he is playing everybody.<eos> Fine, so who do you think he really is?<eos> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.<eos> This isn't your first time being investigated by IA, is it, Detective?<eos> You should know, we're opening a formal review of your record, going back over the last three to four years.<eos> Which is exactly what Liam wants.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> He's playing you, too.
- Yes.<eos> Uh, it was used as an insecticide, uh, but because of its high levels of toxicity, it's been banned for years.<eos> It's also been banned because it's colorless and odorless, making the perfect compound to poison somebody with.<eos> Poison?<eos> What... what are you suggesting? Well,<eos> I am... I'm suggesting that I think someone is trying to kill you.<eos> That's absurd, I...<eos> It really is the only explanation.<eos> I'm sorry, but you wanted straightforward, right?<eos> I can see why Liam wanted me to see you.
Germans will be all over it looking for any sign of survivors.<eos> Now, two of the crew followed training, made contact.<eos> Resistance is getting them out.<eos> But our bombardier went off here, south-south-west.<eos> - I can lead the Germans off his trail.<eos> - What've you got to drop?<eos> I could mock up some flight logs.<eos> - We'll track down the bombardier.<eos> - And Alfred and I will head to Toulouse, make an extraction plan with Nightingale<eos> - and meet you there.
We, um... we need you to change your itinerary.<eos> We have friends on the way with a special package.<eos> Oh. This "package"<eos> ain't the breathing kind, is it?<eos> Invisible ink on sheet music I can do, but I'm a civilian and I do what I do on my terms, - and moving human packages is not...<eos> - Bijou.<eos> Nobody move!<eos> Papers on the table!<eos> Papers on the table.<eos> You're sure you weren't followed?
- Okay. - It's coming!<eos> I have to stop the bleeding, right?<eos> Hang on! Hang on!<eos> - Is it too tight?<eos> - No, tighter.<eos> It's all right.<eos> - My name is Gabriel.<eos> - Danielle.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You'll be all right.
Madame Bellaire said you might be willing to be photographed and interviewed for my portrait series,<eos> Men of Our Time.<eos> - Did she?<eos> - But it won't take a minute. - Well...<eos> - why not? Right here?<eos> - Ah... maybe something more artistic.<eos> - Oh, you know the flags.<eos> - That would make a statement.<eos> "Symbols shape belief, and belief... shapes action."<eos> Maybe you could persuade some of your men, your men in uniform, to stand beside you, huh?
- No, please, over here.<eos> Here!<eos> Yes, yes. Perfect.<eos> Yes, gather.<eos> Gather around.<eos> Ah, if... if you could come in.<eos> Yes. Ok.<eos> Very good.<eos> Wait!<eos> May I have my photo taken with you, please?
It's defective.<eos> I need another one. Now!<eos> It's not even wired up.<eos> There's something stuck inside.<eos> Will this do?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> That's why we aspire to a higher standard of purity... purity of thought,<eos> - purity of purpose.<eos> - Purity of race.<eos> Yes, which reminds me, Mayor, there is a new initiative that I wanted to share with you.
The train was sabotaged.<eos> Whose work was it?<eos> You have kind eyes.<eos> What a strange thing.<eos> Tell me what I want to know, and this will all stop.<eos> - No more pain.<eos> - Oh, that is kind, isn't it?<eos> Who are you working with?<eos> I wanted to protect them... my people, my girls.<eos> We held hands, didn't we, you and I?
What do we do about this?<eos> I know where everything was.<eos> Louis. As soon as this man is gone, you are going to the police.<eos> Not to report spies.<eos> You tell them you caught Henri... trying to force himself on me.<eos> And I called for help and you defended me.<eos> No one will blame you.<eos> And there's nothing more to say about what happened here.<eos> I'm sorry this had to happen<eos> I want to go with you.
I'm Celeste from Paris.<eos> And what did you do in Paris, Celeste?<eos> I was an artist.<eos> How wonderful!<eos> When I was younger, I trained as an artist, too.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My instructors told me I was talented, but it's not for me to say.<eos> But I've always been inspired - by the female nude. - Hmm...<eos> I'd like to spend more time with you.
She plays both sides.<eos> She plays the long game.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> I know every Resistance cell within five miles.<eos> He's not one of us.<eos> Think!<eos> How did he find you?<eos> I didn't find him.<eos> I found you.<eos> I followed you.
The Gestapo, they're here, look!<eos> Get rid of them.<eos> - Tell them that he's gone.<eos> - Why should I?<eos> - You're going to shoot me anyway.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Come on, you've got to hide.<eos> In that closet at the end of the hall.<eos> Listen, Simone, I've been watching you.
Starting today, property values go up.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - We're cleaning the streets.<eos> Of yellow stars.<eos> Tell us more about what you saw.<eos> You don't need to know more.<eos> - The Gestapo looking for you?<eos> - Alfred has a gift.<eos> A perfect memory.<eos> So if anything happens to you, your story survives, word for word,
Look at them. They're not any better than we are.<eos> We could live as they do, at least for a time.<eos> Think of it. Elijah, we could hide in plain sight.<eos> We could live ordinary lives.<eos> Silence.<eos> Well, aren't you a handsome one?<eos> He looks like dessert to me.<eos> No!<eos> Wait, wait, wait! I can help you.<eos> Now I am... I am the personal servant to the Count de Martel of the very estate you just mentioned.
Why do you think I was so hard on them?<eos> But I'm regent.<eos> They should respect me.<eos> I didn't sign up for this.<eos> Sure you did.<eos> You chose to be their leader. The target on your back, it comes with the job.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> Say the word, all right?<eos> Me and my guys will... You'll what?<eos> They see me siding with you against my own kind, I'll just be proving them right.
I'll have your tablet, sir.<eos> And your I.D.<eos> The secretary will see you now.<eos> ELIZABETH: I first wanted to congratulate you for ferreting out corruption within our department.<eos> You did your country a great service.<eos> Thank you. (stammers)<eos> The intention was not to take a shot at you, per Se.<eos> Uh, there was a larger goal... involved.<eos> - That's why I'm offering you a job.<eos> I'm agreeing with you.
He's right.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Inside.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> How long has it been since you were attacked?<eos> Three, four hours.<eos> The real question is, how long till I become like them?<eos> Brothers, sisters...<eos> I know I have no right, I have no standing to ask you -- you anything, but these are desperate times, so ask I must.<eos> I confess my transgressions, and I will accept whatever punishment you dole out.
- Just... if you could just... See if the badge was tampered with or something.<eos> I mean, if it's broken, or...<eos> Whatever.<eos> It'll really help.<eos> Mr. Allen.<eos> Barry Allen?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm Greg Turk.<eos> I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone.<eos> I don't usually make house calls, but I've been trying to get in touch with you for several months.
We did a good job.<eos> Well.<eos> Night, sir.<eos> Night, Florence.<eos> Dwayne.<eos> Er, sir.<eos> I wanted to apologise.<eos> No, I should be apologising.<eos> I threw you in the sea.<eos> Yes, but, erm, the way I spoke to you was entirely wrong.
Right.<eos> For the past few days, your attitude, your behaviour.<eos> You've been a little... odd.<eos> Odd?<eos> Maybe the wrong word.<eos> Erm, distracted.<eos> Preoccupied.<eos> Like you have something on your mind.<eos> You're right.<eos> ~ Something I've been wanting to talk to you...
Stop!<eos> That's it!<eos> How can I go to Paris?<eos> You wouldn't survive a week.<eos> Dwayne, how do you know so much about hen dos?<eos> A great magician never reveals his secrets.<eos> She can't go unless we agree to the transfer.<eos> ~ She'd hate me.<eos> ~ It would be in complete confidence.<eos> I think it's time I was honest with you.
"Thisdecisionwasmine, butwasnotmadealone.<eos> Ihaveconsulted withvaluedconfidants, topmenwhomItrust withmyownlife.<eos> Thishasbeenadifficult winterforus all, butwe'llsurviveit.<eos> Wewillprevail."<eos> Pardon Hewlett?<eos> What-- ( groans )<eos> I'll finish Hewlett.<eos> You lot take the rest.<eos> Happy New Year, Major.<eos> Oh, dear, what have they done to you?
- What?<eos> - For me or for you.<eos> No, where is your mother?<eos> She did this to me.<eos> Juliette, she said there was a possibility of some side effects.<eos> She didn't know this would happen to you.<eos> Now, please. You need to calm down.<eos> No, I'm done calming down, okay?<eos> You and Nick and Adalind and all of this Wesen insanity, I am so sick of it.<eos> Okay, I was normal before I met all of you.
Yeah, we're in the same cycling club.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, his body was found yesterday off of one of the biking trails.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Zack's dead?<eos> What happened?<eos> We were hoping you could help us figure that out.<eos> Me?<eos> We talked to some of your cycling club.<eos> They said Zack followed you.
Mrs. Jackson, you can't blame yourself.<eos> Yeah, blame the gang members having a shoot-out in the middle of the street.<eos> Do you know who did it?<eos> Do you know who killed my Reginald?<eos> The detectives are working on it as we speak.<eos> In the middle of the street?<eos> There must have been witnesses.<eos> Surely someone saw who shot my husband.<eos> Unfortunately, at this time, no one has come forward with any information.<eos> No one will talk to you because you're the police.
Not a fair question, all due respect.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, clearly, I'm not you, and I don't have that relationship with Garrett that you have.<eos> Oh, come on, Sid, give me a straight answer.<eos> Absolutely I'd help out.<eos> But I'm a sucker for people trying to help their kids out.<eos> And anybody who knows you knows you're not.<eos> No, that came out wrong.<eos> I mean, um, boss, you're built differently.<eos> And anybody who knows any of your kids, how they turned out-- they'd wish they could have talked to you when they were raising their own.
Excuse me, I am perfectly calm.<eos> Yeah, you sound perfectly calm.<eos> Enough.<eos> This thing's echoing in my ear from you two acting like children.<eos> Get it together.<eos> Echo?<eos> Wait.<eos> That's it, Walt.<eos> There's got to be a hollow space located in the hull somewhere that's causing the signal to bounce around like an echo whenever the boat swells.<eos> Yes, there should be a crawlspace above you.
I, uh... always did tell you the truth, so, um...<eos> I was wondering if you could tell me the truth.<eos> What could I do better so that Th-the mistakes that I made with you... that I-I don't make them again?<eos> You are who you are.<eos> But you're challenging and sometimes impossible because no woman can stimulate that mind of yours forever.<eos> If you want honesty after a while, you lost interest in me-- I could tell-- and that hurt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no malice in you, Walter.<eos> Just facts.<eos> And, um... Things didn't go exactly like we planned. ...the fact is, before you get involved with someone else, make sure you can make a real connection.
I want to celebrate, too.<eos> When it's safe.<eos> We should get you back to the castle.<eos> But why?<eos> No one knows we're here.<eos> And we are alone.<eos> Mary, we needn't rush anything.<eos> You have never rushed me.<eos> And you have always been by my side.<eos> I feel safe with you.
You will do what your family needs.<eos> Or I will tell Francis all that I know of you and his wife.<eos> He will cut off my head, Antoine.<eos> Who will get you Elizabeth then?<eos> Well, you won't help me now.<eos> Why should I think you'll help me if I let you live?<eos> And remember, if the nobles learn of the affair, the law demands Mary's head, too.<eos> Will you risk Mary's life for a few nights of passion?<eos> You have two hours.<eos> End it with Mary, or I will end both of you.
She led me straight to the man she works for.<eos> The man who sent her to follow me.<eos> Follow you?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Francis?<eos> My brother.<eos> Antoine knows about us?<eos> About Scotland?<eos> Nothing of Scotland, not yet.<eos> Why would he have you followed?
Follow you?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Francis?<eos> My brother.<eos> Antoine knows about us?<eos> About Scotland?<eos> Nothing of Scotland, not yet.<eos> Why would he have you followed?<eos> Does he suspect you of something?<eos> Is... is there some issue between the two of you?
At your age?<eos> I'm 27!<eos> And?<eos> Max, I can't breathe.<eos> And I'm here to apply for a pastry chef.<eos> Also 27, but I've looked this old since I was 6.<eos> For a while, I thought I had that Benjamin Button's disease.<eos> I'll take the pastry chef first.<eos> Why don't you sit over there and wait.<eos> I won't be long, because frankly, you don't have the time.
Thank you.<eos> NAFEESAH: Dad?<eos> The police are here.<eos> Sorry if we are disturbing anything.<eos> No. No, you're not.<eos> This is Bilal, my wife's brother.<eos> Hiya.<eos> I came to pay my respects.<eos> And now he's leaving.<eos> Actually, since you're here I'd like a word, if I may.
No.<eos> Can you describe him?<eos> I'm not about to forget.<eos> We're gonna need you to come to the station and put together an e-fit.<eos> Ah, I dunno.<eos> I mean, he's still out there.<eos> We need your help, Mr Dwyer.<eos> So does this mean I'll have to give evidence?<eos> ~ One thing at a time, eh?<eos> ~ Tariq here's gonna look after you.
Maybe that something got her killed.<eos> This is a bad time for me, my boss will be home any minute.<eos> Listen, Sofie.<eos> Worse time for Viviana.<eos> She was killed this morning.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> May I... may I help?<eos> That'll buy us 40 seconds.<eos> Go. All right, Viviana texted you this morning.<eos> She wanted you to meet her at the park?
Freakazoid next to him likes to have his girls covered in food.<eos> Then we have Sir Scarf right here...<eos> Well, Reiko, what did you say about him?<eos> Right, he's a biter.<eos> And then man-bun just has a lot of mommy issues, so...<eos> Billy, Viviana had a bite mark.<eos> That's our guy.<eos> Okay, on it.<eos> Scarf.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Because you're going to be locked up right here in the US for the rest of your life.<eos> And by the way, you look nothing like David Hasselhoff.<eos> Now give it up, y'all, come on!<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Demolishing a Trans Am, was that necessary?<eos> Oh, um, yeah.<eos> Thanks to the boys' baseball bat, a killer's behind bars, and we didn't have to involved the State Department.<eos> So, I've finished my report.<eos> Captain, may I speak with you please?
I didn't expect a ticker tape, but I could use a chair.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Whoo, Jesus.<eos> The first prison riot, I broke both my ankles.<eos> I shattered them. They got me with the water cannon.<eos> They blasted me off a second-story catwalk.<eos> Pow!<eos> Right on the concrete.<eos> God dang, are you guys buying any of that?<eos> Jesus, what's wrong with you?
- You changed into that?<eos> - Yeah, I...<eos> - Was I supposed to dress like that?<eos> Well, was I supposed to dress down?<eos> Oh, God, maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe they want young and rebellious.<eos> Yeah, or maybe they don't invest a million bucks in you if you've got holes in your jeans.<eos> Damn it, I could've...<eos> Excuse me, Miss Howe, Miss Clark?<eos> Mr. Bondham will see you now.
2123 Clarendon Street.<eos> He's even still logging on.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, Tom Rendon?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, we're the people whose game you stole.<eos> - Oh, Mutiny.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Very cool.<eos> I was kind of hoping it would find its way to you guys.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I've struggled with my injury every day since then.<eos> I fear I may never regain the use of my arm.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. Edwards, this was probably a bad idea.<eos> It's okay, Harold, you don't have to say anything more than you're comfortable with.<eos> But... you know the way you talk about your accident, the loss of your friend, the pain, it seems as though you've carried this grief for some time.<eos> Everyone grieves in different ways.<eos> Hey, glasses, tell him about all your nut ball friends.<eos> Maybe he can give you guys a group therapy discount.<eos> I think by now, you count as one of Harold's nut ball friends, Lionel.<eos> With you people, there's no other kind.
Sid?<eos> You here?<eos> I've been waiting seven years for this.<eos> I have received direct threats on my personal cell phone.<eos> Someone is coming after us.<eos> You tell your boss to call me back immediately.<eos> Hello, Alicia.<eos> I'm sorry it's come to this.<eos> I'm aware of your relentless pursuit and subsequent elimination of the engineers involved in Northern Lights.<eos> Did you really think that while you were watching others, no one would be watching you?
Harold, whoever you are, I'm begging you, let me have this.<eos> Harold.<eos> Move away.<eos> John, don't shoot.<eos> Shane, listen to me.<eos> I watched someone close to me die before my eyes.<eos> Like you, I thought I needed to make sure that everyone responsible for that murder paid with their life, and that almost did it.<eos> I had my target, I had my finger on the trigger, but I realized that as certain as I was that these people deserved retribution, that life was infinitely more complicated than that.<eos> You may never know what happened on that day, but if you do this, if you condemn his life, there will be no doubt what you did to him.<eos> Even when your world stops, the world around you keeps moving forward, and you will too, but if you die here, that bright, beautiful, lively woman that fell in love with you here will forever die with you.
I can do that.<eos> Maybe I can get an application.<eos> Yeah, sure, come on by 51.<eos> We'll get you one.<eos> - Then we'll talk.<eos> - Kelly.<eos> No, he wants to get something off his chest, let's let him.<eos> Huh? Right, Adrian?<eos> All done.<eos> It was nice meeting you two.
You just gonna tiptoe right to the edge, huh?<eos> I promise you I'll stand right behind you to give you the last push.<eos> God's mistake?<eos> God's mistake?<eos> Really? You think I was made by God?<eos> Last I checked, fire was the devil's tool.<eos> I'm warning you, Detective.<eos> Do not push me. Or what, Gish?<eos> You gonna burn me up?<eos> When I'm done with you, you're gonna burn yourself up.
This is, like the weirdest foreplay ever.<eos> Hook up?<eos> What would make you think I want to hook up?<eos> Oh, because I business flirted?<eos> That's Wharton 101.<eos> It was more than business flirting.<eos> You begged to come to my office, show up wearing a see-through shirt.<eos> That was not by choice.<eos> It is cheaply made.<eos> I came here to talk to you about our business, and possibly get you to invest in a small, but spirited...
Why not get married?<eos> - We're going to.<eos> - No, I mean now. Tonight.<eos> What?<eos> Don't get crazy-- you have to plan weddings, JT.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> - Yeah. - The last one was planned, and that didn't turn out so well.<eos> That was not my fault.<eos> No, but wait, he has a point, though-- why wait?<eos> I mean, God knows what could happen, especially with you two.
90 percent.<eos> That's good enough.<eos> Remind me never to piss you off.<eos> Flash drive.<eos> Leave it, we don't have time.<eos> No, we're not leaving empty-handed.<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Thanks, JT.<eos> Think you were followed?
Daddy, don't.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Why would someone try to kill you?<eos> Come on, sweetheart, these people are crazy out there.<eos> It ain't the first time someone didn't love the idea of going back to jail.<eos> I don't wanna talk about that.<eos> I wanna talk about you.<eos> How are you, sweetheart, huh?<eos> How's everything going with the wedding planning?<eos> Well, that's actually something we wanted to talk to you about, sir.
Just ask.<eos> - You know ***?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> All right.<eos> Listen, I want you to go see him and pick us up somemore guns.<eos> I'll give him a call, he'll be expecting you.<eos> Alright?<eos> Of course.<eos> And I'll go with you when you go after Rusty if you need.
Are you from the power company or something?<eos> No, I'm just looking for some people.<eos> Do you know the Winship family?<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> George?<eos> I'm sorry I locked you up in that place.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.<eos> There's something wrong with this town.<eos> You've always known it.<eos> It'll fight you.
- I'll give you ten minutes.<eos> - Thanks, Shane.<eos> Peter Lattimore?<eos> I'm Kara Pine with TruthVox.<eos> I came here looking for Camille Winship.<eos> TruthVox.<eos> That's out of Chicago, isn't it?<eos> You flew all the way from Chicago for a girl who died four years ago?<eos> Actually, I drove.<eos> I've been, um, asking around town about you, and some people told me that I should speak with you, that you and Camille might have something in common.
They're gonna think I'm a murderer.<eos> They're idiots.<eos> Who cares what they say?<eos> They used to be my friends.<eos> [knocking]<eos> (Dale) Sit.<eos> Sit.<eos> - Dale Evans?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I was hoping to speak to you about a house fire that occurred in 2002.
I'm marrying Tommy.<eos> You should.<eos> I've been... trying to get back something that's already gone.<eos> - (Chloe) Mommy.<eos> - (Wright) Chloe, Chloe, wait.<eos> Are you going away again?<eos> You know what?<eos> You were right about me when you said I was an angel.<eos> I am.<eos> And the thing about angels is that they're always there, watching over you even if you can't see 'em.
I did it to protect you.<eos> You lied to us.<eos> You really want to have that discussion right now?<eos> About who lied to who?<eos> He was in our attic, Rowan, with Chloe asleep upstairs.<eos> He's her father.<eos> Look, I know how much you loved him.<eos> And seeing him again...<eos> I can't imagine how confusing that is.<eos> So what happened between you two... I get it.
What, like suicide?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Henry.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Do you want to get something to eat?<eos> I knew your mother.<eos> We did that logging protest in '84 together.<eos> She used to bring you to the rallies... but you were littler then.<eos> Your mother was a good one, she was.<eos> And what happened to you two... awful... just awful.
You tell, all right?<eos> It's really important.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Chloe, who was that man?<eos> Let's go.<eos> You seem upset.<eos> Why don't you tell me what's been going on for you this week?<eos> - I'm done.<eos> - Done?<eos> Sitting here, talking to you.

You didn't think I needed to weigh in on this?<eos> - She's my daughter.<eos> - Keep your voice down.<eos> This isn't about you or your feelings.<eos> It's about Camille.<eos> If you ever want her to have a normal life again, this is where it starts.<eos> As painful and cruel as it may seem, death is a natural part of life, and many have argued that it's death that gives life itself meaning.<eos> Without death, would we accomplish as much?<eos> Would we connect to each other as deeply?<eos> I have been so inspired by all of you...

They need some of that support.<eos> Over the last few days, they have experienced something extraordinary, and they would like to share that with you now.
That's a tough thing, telling your kids that the dog died.<eos> You can't just keep going, What? No, he's-Where'd he go?<eos> Oh, look, there he goes.<eos> I don't know, he's-<eos> That little scamp. There he goes, go get 'em.<eos> Go get 'em!<eos> Told my kids the dog died and we dealt with it. And I was proud of them how they expressed their feelings about it. I was proud of them how they dealt with their feelings and what they said about it and how they processed it and I realized, this was a positive thing.<eos> That's how you start thinking as a parent, a lot of things you don't think would be positive really are, 'cause-'cause a dog dying is an opportunity to deal with death with your kids.<eos> It's like a dry run for Grandma. It is, it is.<eos> Dog dies, you talk about it, you deal with it. Later on, you go, so, you know all that stuff we talked about? About the dog?
I got confidence.<eos> Ladies love that.<eos> No, she won't like you.<eos> She won't.<eos> Go away.<eos> Please, just go away!<eos> We got a sighting of the stolen truck.<eos> Yeavely Park.<eos> I want you all to know this was a very difficult decision for us.<eos> It was between you and a senior citizen bingo party.
I was coerced. Abducted and coerced.<eos> - By who?<eos> - If I tell you that, I got to get some kind of guaran...<eos> I understand you were just trying to protect me.<eos> But there's nothing... nothing that you can do to stop me from carrying out my father's work.<eos> I know that now.<eos> I don't want you to go, Alfred.<eos> But you're either with me or you're against me.<eos> And if you're against me, I don't have a choice.<eos> I'm with you, Master Bruce.
How you doing, Mr. Nygma?<eos> I got you an aspirin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Detective Gordon!<eos> Bruce.<eos> I heard the news. I...<eos> I was worried something happened to you.<eos> I'm very relieved.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Th-The last time that we met, I was... I was very hard on you.
Forget it, Jim.<eos> The man with the knife was short, fancy clothes. Walked funny.<eos> Ah, Mr. Galavan.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> The pleasure's all mine.<eos> I'll meet you in the lobby, Master Bruce.<eos> - Oh, why not dine with us?<eos> - That's very kind of you, sir, but I don't think it's appropriate.<eos> And I know that Master Bruce wants to speak to you on his own.
You like this place?<eos> I've never been here before.<eos> To be honest, I don't... - go out much.<eos> - Well, I hope I can change that.<eos> There's always some tedious function - I could drag you to.<eos> - I just... I wanted this opportunity to thank you, in person, for saving my life.<eos> Oh, you're very kind.<eos> The truth is, I don't know what came over me.<eos> I don't think I was in complete control of my faculties.<eos> I also wanted to speak with you face-to-face.
It's his.<eos> My ancestors were swordsmiths.<eos> They knew that to good steel, it had first to be forged.<eos> I look at tonight...<eos> I look at tonight as a baptism of fire.<eos> A fire from which we will emerge stronger.<eos> Our resolve forged to bring about a new day in Gotham.<eos> I've felt pretty alone since moving here.<eos> Until I met you.<eos> But I-I don't want to come between you and a friend.
Your mother is dead because of your weakness.<eos> But what you need to realize is that your weakness was her.<eos> My mother was a saint!<eos> The only person who truly cared about me, and now she's gone!<eos> And I have nothing left!<eos> A man with nothing that he loves... is a man who cannot be bargained. A man that cannot be betrayed.<eos> A man who answers to no one... but himself.<eos> And that is the man that I see before me.<eos> A free man.<eos> Are the EMTs with you?
You try to run, I will find you.<eos> I won't.<eos> In fact, I'm coming down.<eos> What the hell is going on down there?<eos> We've got another hit man.<eos> He's just taken out all of our backup.<eos> I'm going down to end this. You...<eos> He just killed four cops!<eos> You're not going anywhere on your own. He's right.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Oh, uh... you're free to go.<eos> We'll drop your charges.<eos> Right, well, you know, thank you very much indeed.<eos> Look, Bullock, I'm gonna need some clean bandages, I'm gonna need a car... and a couple of guns.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - What are you going to do?<eos> I've got no choice.<eos> No time.<eos> I've got to go visit him.<eos> - I'll come with you.
So nice of you to greet us, Madeline.<eos> I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland.<eos> Sticks and stones, Raymond.<eos> Describing your breakfast?<eos> I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's gonna take more than reassigning me to break my spirit.<eos> I'll turn this place around just like I did the Nine-Nine.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Everyone, this is your new commanding officer,<eos> Raymond Holt.<eos> He's going to be with you for a long, long time.
Amy was the gym floozy.<eos> The gym floozy was under my nose the whole time.<eos> Oh, I am over the moon.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Over the moon.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So what is this?<eos> Casual?<eos> Serious?<eos> I need to know how to make fun of you.
Captain.<eos> The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is.<eos> I told 'em he got sucked up into an airplane engine.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> I can't put that pigeon head on, Gina.<eos> Wuntch has defeated me.<eos> This is how it ends, with me standing on the urine-soaked floor of an elementary school bathroom in a third-rate bird costume.<eos> - I quit.<eos> - No.<eos> I did not follow you to PR to watch you quit.

Before we put them up, I want to hear your thoughts.<eos> - I love them.<eos> Once again, my advice has, like, saved the city.<eos> - I came up with the slogan.<eos> - It's tacky to take credit for stuff.<eos> - We're here to apologize.<eos> I can't prove you took my moose tracks, so I shouldn't have yelled at you.<eos> - I'm impressed.<eos> It takes a big person to admit when they're being a total dum-dum.<eos> - We want to make it up to you.
They all attended 12-step programs.<eos> None of them the same one, but they all have the same leader, a creep with a record of torturing animals.<eos> I'm talking dogs.<eos> I found the Oolong Slayer, and his name is...<eos> I never do this, but I kind of ordered rye.<eos> Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay?<eos> I'm trying to blow my friend's mind over here.<eos> Could someone get this lunatic some rye?<eos> His name is James Dylan Borden, and he works the night shift at creep-a-palooza... the mannequin factory in Red Hook.<eos> I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.<eos> We just have to turn this debacle into a straight-up "bacle."<eos> Guess I should be getting back.<eos> Uncle Ray, thank you for loaning me you best detective for lunch.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Of course, she is entitled to 45 minutes as per her union contract.<eos> Okay, well, great to see you.<eos> Bye, baby.<eos> A minute, Detective Diaz.<eos> What's going on with you and Marcus?
Uncle Ray, thank you for loaning me you best detective for lunch.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Of course, she is entitled to 45 minutes as per her union contract.<eos> Okay, well, great to see you.<eos> Bye, baby.<eos> A minute, Detective Diaz.<eos> What's going on with you and Marcus?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your shoulders tightened when he said "baby."<eos> Your nostrils flared when I asked what was going on with the two of you.
My God, you guys are such pathetic nerds.<eos> But maybe that's what I need right now, pathetic nerds.<eos> Okay.<eos> You pathetic nerds can help me.<eos> Thank you?<eos> You are so welcome.<eos> Peralta, Diaz.<eos> This is Inspector Knausgaard and Deputy Inspector Carlsson.<eos> Their flight here was eight hours.<eos> It's been a pleasure talking with you about the duration of your flight.
You should know that.<eos> If I got stung by a bee, I could die.<eos> Detectives, I've been talking with the inspectors.<eos> There's been a development in the Kottbullediamant case.<eos> Excellent pronunciation, Captain. Tack.<eos> They believe our perp may have smuggled more stolen Swedish diamonds into Brooklyn.<eos> Oh, well, thank you for the tip.<eos> Have a wonderful flight home.<eos> We will send you the jewels as soon as we find them.<eos> They're staying and working the case with you.
Yeah.<eos> So we'll be taking the jewels back to Sweden tomorrow.<eos> Yeah. Guess you were wrong about us, huh?<eos> Bet you feel pretty stupid.<eos> Actually, when you're wrong, that means you've learned something.<eos> And any opportunity for learning is good.<eos> Ugh.<eos> You are the absolute worst.<eos> I hope you die in a fjord.<eos> No, no, we are trying to say we are happy - to have worked with you.
Terry regrets the way he answered the phone.<eos> - We're at Goodwin's.<eos> There are multiple gunmen.<eos> They've blocked all the exits, they've taken the security guards hostage, and we're looking for a place to hide.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> - Awesome?<eos> - Awesomely serious.<eos> I am not enjoying this, no matter how much it is 100% my favorite movie come to life.<eos> - The important thing is keep Gina safe.<eos> You have a civilian with you.
Well, Sharon liked it, Sarge.<eos> All right, listen, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I've got it totally under control here.<eos> Love you, bye.<eos> Great.<eos> So I'm gonna go get your birth plan and then summon your wizard.<eos> Oh, Sharon, I heard you had gone into labor in our police station.<eos> I hope you don't contract an infection.<eos> Yeah, we all hope that.<eos> Hey, Cap-i-tan, Could I speak with you outside for just one moment?
Dish, sir, dish.<eos> Gina, no.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, but we simply don't have time to hear about the captain's sordid romantic past.<eos> What have you become?<eos> A hero in a time of crisis.<eos> You stay here and take care of Sharon.<eos> Ugh. What if she's still pregnant when I get in there?<eos> Then you'll deal with it.<eos> Sir, we're going to get Frederick right now.<eos> I'm sure he's over whatever little fight you guys had.
Yeah, yeah, but you tell him.<eos> He was... is...<eos> He'll be the one who understood how to fight the French, Not with a conventional war, but with a guerrilla<eos> The French Army is very superior so instead of fighting them in battles, they fight them everywhere without warning, not giving them a moment's peace, attacking and then leaving<eos> So, the French knows that in the future the Undaunted will organize the guerrilla<eos> - and wants to kill him first.<eos> - Exactly. Seriously, you should watch the first Terminator movie.<eos> We need to talk to him.<eos> Can I help you, Miss?<eos> I need to talk to you.
I can explain.<eos> How?<eos> Julián.<eos> Julián.<eos> Lola isn't what she says she is.<eos> Here it is.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> - In 2015.<eos> - We are in 2015.<eos> Stay here until a Ministry car comes to get you.
Either of you.<eos> We can't cope.<eos> Camille and I... .. can't cope.<eos> Without you.<eos> Two.<eos> Oh, thank you, sir.<eos> Yes, you're welcome.<eos> ~ You're here already?<eos> ~ Er... yes, I am.<eos> ~ I called for you at the beach.
All the towels are still in place, haven't been touched.<eos> Er... so, she let them in and then got in the bath?<eos> So, she had a bath with a visitor here?<eos> Is that something ladies do?<eos> We can only live in hope, eh, Chief?<eos> So, she let them in late at night and then bathed.<eos> She knew her killer.<eos> ~ Maybe it was one of her friends. ~ Yeah.<eos> Dwayne, Florence, bag everything up and get started on background checks.<eos> ~ Camille, let's you and I go and meet this peep of hens. ~ Sure.
I shall look forward to hearing all about it tomorrow evening.<eos> Hm? Come again, Sarge?<eos> Gloria is an old friend of mine.<eos> I'm meeting her for a drink tomorrow evening, and I'm sure she'll tell me all about her special night out with Officer Dwayne Myers.<eos> ~ Hey.<eos> ~ Hey.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Of course.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I think it's time I was honest with you, at least, as honest as I can be, which may well not be very honest at all in the grand scheme of things.
(Katya voiceover) Previously on Allegiance...<eos> The moment we have enough information to prove that Black Dagger is real, we go straight the FBI.<eos> We work together as a family.<eos> (Victor) The money for Black Dagger will end up in Italy.<eos> (Natalie) The transfers arrive at a bank in Rome in three days.<eos> Someone must be there to identify who picks it up.<eos> (Victor) If we can't get Alex to Rome, we lose the trail on Black Dagger, and it's the only trail we have.<eos> The drive.<eos> The documents on the flash drive you found at the apartment were SVR-encrypted.
Yes.<eos> (Endo) I cannot promise it will be available for long.<eos> I have many suitors.<eos> [imitates Chinese accent] I'm sure you do, Endo, but I want it more.<eos> For yourself or for the Chinese MSS?<eos> (Sam) Does it matter?<eos> If you have secondary market plans, it matters a great a deal.<eos> The MSS wants it and we want to keep it for ourself.<eos> (Endo) Meet two days from now.<eos> We will contact you when you're here.
Quick reflexes.<eos> Plus, I'll spike the guy's tea so his reflexes are slow.<eos> No, but there are two of them.<eos> - Him and his guard...<eos> - Alex, calm down.<eos> Italian Intel will provide backup.<eos> Along with a couple of our own GRS guys,<eos> I should have at least eight friendly guns around me.<eos> How far away?<eos> They're not gonna be in the room with you.
- We shouldn't have left you behind.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Maybe I do need to work on my flirting.<eos> Come on, let's go dunk our heads into cheese and chocolate.<eos> - Friends.<eos> - Friends.<eos> Wait!<eos> Don't go.<eos> Grenda, was it?<eos> I must speak with you.
Is it functional?<eos> You are asking very invasive questions of someone who just recently saved your life.<eos> See, I don't know that you just saved my life. Hmm.<eos> I know I woke up with a gash in my head.<eos> The head wound was from where the sleeper pod was hooked into your brain.<eos> The entire system was losing power and you both soon would have died, had I not taken action.<eos> Cutting the interface was to release you from the pod.<eos> And then you dumped us out in the snow and left us to die.<eos> You attacked us.<eos> I wanted to kill you, but my daughter pled mercy on your behalf.
The business of incarceration is extremely lucrative and virtually recession-proof.<eos> The Citadel Corrections Company has more than quadrupled their holdings since they were founded 20 years ago.<eos> They now have 19 facilities all across the country.<eos> 59,603 prisoners in their charge.<eos> Guess I had it wrong all this time.<eos> Crime does pay.<eos> Agent Hotchner, it's good to see you, sir.<eos> Thank you again for coming all this way.<eos> Hopefully we can help, Warden.<eos> Oh, Agent Rossi, hey, it's great to meet you.
They transferred him up out of here.<eos> He all right?<eos> Mr. Sam Pritchett.<eos> I'm Agent David Rossi.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Can't complain.<eos> Well, you could, but who'd be listening, right?<eos> Can I get you something? Water?<eos> Coffee?<eos> I, uh, I wanted to ask you about Devon White.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You all right?<eos> It's ok.<eos> You're gonna be ok.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> Shavers.<eos> I trusted him.<eos> Well, there'll be an investigation.<eos> When we get back to D.C. someone from our office will contact you.
No.<eos> I'm Jace Corso.<eos> Which makes you... not.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> At first, I thought you were just someone who kinda looked like me, not enough to fool anyone who knew me but enough to bluff anyone who didn't.<eos> Now taking a closer look, I see that's not the case.<eos> We're identical.<eos> So what could it be? Clone's a logical guess.<eos> The tech exists, but to pull that off you'd have to scan me, and you can't do that without my noticing.<eos> Besides, dupes have an average shelf life of two to three days and I've been trying to chase you down for months.
I was curious to see if their rep matched their strut.<eos> So I accepted the offer.<eos> The day I'm supposed to join up, the Galactic Authorities get an anonymous tip and raided my safehouse.<eos> I almost got nicked I was on the run for a week.<eos> When things quieted down, I was going to reach out to apologize for missing the op.<eos> I didn't want them thinking I was unprofessional after all.<eos> Well, imagine my surprise when I learned that I was actually seen boarding The Raza with the rest of the crew.<eos> I checked the security footage from the space station and, sure enough, there I was, getting on that damn ship.<eos> Someone who looked a lot like me anyway.<eos> And I've been chasing you ever since.
Three.<eos> This is Two.<eos> Please respond.<eos> There's gotta be another way.<eos> I think they're weakening.<eos> Okay just hang on.<eos> Just one more.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> Just let me catch my...<eos> It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Shall I stop?<eos> No.<eos> Easy tiger.<eos> Ahh! There you are.<eos> Don't start.<eos> Did you finish that "thing" you needed to do?<eos> Don't start.<eos> Hey, you have to talk to her.<eos> What am I supposed to say, huh?<eos> I don't know but it's obvious there's something between the two of you, or at least there was.
But then, when you came back and you saved our asses, I was like: "Damn.<eos> I really like this girl."<eos> Yeah, you guys, I mean.<eos> You guys are great man.<eos> I may not say it enough but--<eos> Or at all.<eos> Ever.<eos> But you guys--<eos> Hey! Hey you!<eos> What's wrong with you guys?
Six respects you.<eos> If there's any confrontation, you'll be able to reason with him.<eos> You have to go.<eos> ...For the duration of your travel, your body will remain here in cryo-sleep.<eos> When your clone returns for bio-mass recycling at the end of the trip, its experiences and memories will be uploaded, transferred back, and reintegrated with your own.<eos> Is it safe?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It's the safest way to travel.<eos> With your true body here, you're never in any real danger.<eos> Your clone could travel into the center of a star, and you'd be perfectly fine.
Hey, I didn't even want to take this job, remember?<eos> You and your little boys club talked me into it.<eos> She's just a kid. Excuse me?<eos> She can't handle this.<eos> If she's going to ride with us we can't protect her forever and you know it. Hello?<eos> I'm standing right here.<eos> It's my choice.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> You better hope nothing happens to her.<eos> Look, I told you guys, I'm good to go okay.
There's only so much in here.<eos> There's nothing we can be doing right now anyways.<eos> To him, it's an efficient use of time.<eos> Sure, if you're a robot.<eos> He feels things same as you.<eos> He just doesn't show it.<eos> What happened to Two hit you pretty hard, huh?<eos> Just caught me off guard is all.<eos> I didn't think they'd really do it.<eos> We all know there was something between you two.
Do you have the device?<eos> We just got a little bit of a situation here.<eos> Two teams, fan out.<eos> Is anyone else getting a little light-headed?<eos> The air is getting thin.<eos> We've got to make a plan, while we can still think straight.<eos> Don't everybody talk at once.<eos> We're supposed to be good at this sort of thing.<eos> Some of us are, anyway.<eos> I'm in this as much as you are.
Whatever this thing is, three corporations were willing to kill for it.<eos> I'm thinking it's something that's extremely dangerous.<eos> All the more reason to get it off the ship.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe we should ask Two what she thinks.<eos> What, we're not gonna trust her now?<eos> Because she's not who we thought she was?<eos> Welcome to the goddamn club.<eos> The device is online, activating field, ten percent.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
I hate cake.<eos> So we get into Ferrous' good books by getting in this other rival corp's bad books?<eos> Yes, you want Ferrous Corp to be your friend.<eos> We'll do it.<eos> What?<eos> Shouldn't we talk about this?<eos> No.<eos> We'll do it.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I will send you the coordinates and, uh good to be back in business with you.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, still a lot of puke to scrub.<eos> Let's make that a priority.<eos> The things you say are hilarious - and poignant.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yeah, you have an amazing skill at telling people what they need to hear.<eos> I'm sorry. Did I ask you to pull down my panties and blow a compliment up my butt?<eos> Nobody likes a suck-up, Chanel #5.<eos> Oh, Ms. Chanel, I almost forgot.<eos> The Dean of Students called, and she needs to see you right away.
Are you done?<eos> Okay, Chanel, why don't you head back to the house and start getting it ready for rush.<eos> It's gonna be a totally rad one this year.<eos> We have a side boob mixer, followed by a white party, where everyone is encouraged to wear/be white.<eos> In regards to your fatwa against me, Dean Box Munch,<eos> I'm sure you are aware that my daddy is the largest donor to this university's endowment.<eos> I would not get personal with me, sweetheart.<eos> I don't fight fair.<eos> I may not be able to revoke its charter today, but there is no way that Kappa, at least the way it's constituted now, is surviving the year.<eos> You know what, I could not agree with you more.
We can't just leave her here; she was our friend.<eos> Ladies, that's the door.<eos> Hell Week begins now.<eos> Good evening, idiot hookers.<eos> I'm very happy to welcome you to Hell Week here at Kappa House.<eos> Could you speak up, please?<eos> I'm having trouble hearing you.<eos> I said, "Welcome to Hell Week!"<eos> When you stupid dugongs first waltzed through that door, I could tell you thought you were gonna have it easy.<eos> Well, let me relieve you of that misconception, because you're about to get hazed harder than a suburban banquet hall during bat mitzvah season.
You don't have any respect for any of us or the rules of this house.<eos> You don't deserve to be president.<eos> She does have a point.<eos> Okay, pledges, line up for tonight's festivities.<eos> We're going to play a game called Cocaine or Dildo.<eos> Ooh, that sounds fun but also kind of like hazing and illegal in, like, what, six different ways.<eos> But I brought Trivial Pursuit: '90s Edition.<eos> Sounds boffo, but we're having a house-only night tonight.<eos> Okay, works for us.<eos> We're moving in, to keep an eye on you girls, for the rest of the week.
Zayday! It's empty.<eos> Zayday isn't down there.<eos> The lights went out.<eos> Oh, my boobs!<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> You tased the Red Devil. Denise!<eos> Denise, where are you?<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> I'll come and get you!
Once again, death came to Kappa House, and once again that death, while tragic, has brought us all closer together.<eos> I even kind of like Zayday now.<eos> And I got gifts.<eos> Giant, pink chopsticks.<eos> No.<eos> They're custom-made pink nunchaku.<eos> Oh. If I can impart anything on you slits over the course of this year, it's that Kappas don't take any crap from anyone.<eos> Guys, I joined this sorority to feel close to my mom, to get a taste of the sisterhood that she was so inspired by.<eos> And after last night, I really feel it.<eos> I'm with you guys, no matter what.
I just find it so shocking that Chanel #2 would betray you like that.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you find it so shocking?<eos> Because you also tried to sleep with Chad, Number Six.<eos> And you tried to frame me for murder!<eos> I mean, I went to jail because of you!<eos> I'm so sorry, Chanel.<eos> I promise to never betray your trust again.<eos> You most certainly won't betray my trust ever again, because you will never have my trust ever again!<eos> Look, we think you need to contact Number Two, and just give her a chance to do right by you.
Zayday is contemplating slaying her.<eos> If she's the next victim, we need to find her and help her.<eos> All of these clues are terrible.<eos> I guess it's like Daddy always says:<eos> "If you want something done right, pay someone a lot of money to do it for you."<eos> Now... why don't you all strap on some oat bags and go poop huge green turds in the street, like the sad old mares you are.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I moved in.<eos> I live with you dumb hos now.
Let me lay out a hypothetical for you.<eos> In this state, there's no statute of limitations for homicide.<eos> Now, hypothetically, if I was at Kappa that night, and I did, hypothetically, cover up this hypothetical negligent homicide, I would hypothetically not be responsible for that girl's death.<eos> But I would hypothetically undoubtedly be an accessory after the fact.<eos> So when these murders started up, even if I hypothetically thought they were related to the events of 20 years ago, I couldn't, hypothetically, start offering up information to the... hypothetical police, or anyone else, for that matter,<eos> because I risk, hypothetically, implicating myself.<eos> Hypothetically, of course.<eos> So instead, you'd let him just keep killing people, your students, just to protect yourself.<eos> I just figured... that eventually someone would shoot the bastard.<eos> Now it's different, because they came after you.
I'm the founder of an organization called the Department Of Paranormal Exploration or DOPE.<eos> I feel it may be time to let you ladies in on a little secret.<eos> Since these killings began, I have focused my investigation on a single theory...<eos> That the perpetrator of these murders was not being caught... because he's a ghost.<eos> Now, these recent developments have proven, much to my horror, that I am right.<eos> If I may, I'd like to set up some of my equipment to get some electromagnetic field readings.<eos> Maybe see if the microphones pick up any ghost chatter.<eos> Now, I must warn you, if your boyfriend was murdered, he may not be ready to pass over, and may come pay you a visitation.<eos> If that happens, I beg of you, do not have sex with him.<eos> What is wrong with you?
He had a callback for that show on the Syfy Channel where they run around with the night vision goggles.<eos> Look, let me handle this. Oh, like you've handled all this so far?<eos> All you've done is sit back and watch as we've gotten picked off one by one.<eos> Earl Grey was a good man, with powerful arms and a sexy accent, and now he's dead.<eos> His blood is on your hands!<eos> I'm sorry, Dean.<eos> She's wrong.<eos> No.<eos> She's not.<eos> You know, the only benefit of meeting you is that I now know I clearly have a type, and that type is a moron.
Murdered to death.<eos> Well, I am sorry that took so long, but, you know, a watched pot never boils.<eos> Uh...<eos> Sanka?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you know that the word "sanka"<eos> is derived from the French "sans caféine"?<eos> Dean Munsch, first let me say how honored we are that you've invited us into your hideously furnished home.<eos> What do you want, Chanel?<eos> Well, now that there's no one else around to compare you to, we've realized that you are kind of an amazing woman.
All those in favor of kicking Grace out of Kappa House?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> That's not in the house rules.<eos> All those in favor of temporarily changing the house rules so that I can kick Grace out of Kappa House?<eos> Sorry, Jack Skellington.<eos> You're out.<eos> Fine.<eos> It was really great getting to know all of you.
I'm tired, Charlie.<eos> I'm tired, and I'm pissed off, and I feel helpless sitting in this room waiting for him to take another shot at us.<eos> God damn Sid, man.<eos> To almost lose the two of you, it's...<eos> When are you gonna go visit Mikey, Paige?<eos> Aw, come on.<eos> He's in there all alone.<eos> He keeps asking for you.<eos> Can't you just check in?<eos> Look, I don't know what happened between the two of you, but if it was me, I...
TRESSA:<eos> I love my parents to death.<eos> But there's reasons why we sneak, 'cause we don't wanna hurt the people that we love.<eos> When my mom got home, she looked like she wanted to cry because she missed me, she wants me to stay home.<eos> But I mean, this is what I love to do, and if she loves me, she'll let me do what makes me happy.<eos> Aw!<eos> My first birthday.<eos> KELLY: "My munchkin.<eos> Dad's princess.<eos> "We're so proud of you and all your accomplishments.
-Just when you saw that buck.<eos> And he's gonna be going like, "Is she gonna be willing to take this shot?"<eos> Of course, I will.<eos> Gotta make my papa proud.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm proud of you already.<eos> Everything you've done in your life, you've made me proud.<eos> Good and bad.<eos> Really?<eos> Even bad?<eos> I'm always gonna be proud of you.
Um...<eos> Well, it's called Latina Abuse.<eos> What it is, is it's extra degrading compared to the other stuff.<eos> -CAMERAMAN:<eos> What's your name, bitch?<eos> -Ava.<eos> -CAMERAMAN:<eos> Ava what?<eos> -Ava Kelly.<eos> -Nice to meet you, Ava.
KELLY:<eos> Don't, honey...<eos> Tressa.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> And the ability to travel everywhere, like, that's awesome.<eos> -KELLY:<eos> You know what?<eos> You can still...<eos> -What's the cost, though?<eos> KENDALL: Does this all register with you?
Thank you.<eos> Is this the first time you've been here?<eos> My son saw it happen this time.<eos> I never wanted him to see me like this.<eos> How old is he?<eos> 7. [Crying]<eos> You two have the option of staying here, or if you have someplace else you'd rather stay the night...<eos> Uh, I have a friend we could stay with.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, I need you to tell me exactly what your husband did to you.
Unless he's recording them.<eos> Greta: I know this is all my fault.<eos> Unsub: You think I want to do this?<eos> Look, I know you had a rough night.<eos> Why did you have to make it worse?<eos> I'll do better.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm tired of giving you second chances.<eos> []Hey, talk to us, hot stuff.<eos> I feel like I don't deserve to talk to you, because I have terrible news.
[Bat clatters on floor]<eos> You wish.<eos> We need a medic down here ASAP.<eos> Greta.<eos> Greta, are you ok?<eos> Conner?<eos> He's ok.<eos> He's safe.<eos> He's safe. I promise.<eos> You're gonna be ok.
Plus, with all due respect, there's only one man I'd trust leading a mission to the supermarket.<eos> - And who's that?<eos> - The only man who knows where it is.<eos> Looks like I'm back in the game.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Welcome to Operation Supermarket Sweep.<eos> Does that make you Dale Winton?<eos> Yes, and I'm liberated by that.<eos> You and this dipshit will be travelling to the most dangerous, inhospitable place on Earth.<eos> And I will be right behind you...
They're called The Spectrum.<eos> Good with numbers, bad with people, like Rain Man?<eos> Nah, these weren't men. They're birds.<eos> Yats did this?<eos> That's right. Lots of murderous women.<eos> - Were they fit? - Fit? They were terrifying.<eos> A savage stampede of women.<eos> Hoarse, greedy animal cries escaping from their blood-stained lips.<eos> Well, obviously it wasn't that bad, but it was still pretty scary.<eos> Listen, if I wanted to, like, swerve 'em, could I come with you lads?
I discovered the doctor's antidote is a compound of sesquiterpene lactones and allium ursinum.<eos> - Wild garlic and wormwood. - I found wild garlic in the woods!<eos> - And you're sure about the antidote?<eos> - Before the bombs, I was a scientist.<eos> - I taught chemistry.<eos> - OK.<eos> Suze, you and Yamato go and find the plant.<eos> I'll stay with Laura.<eos> And if you're not back in time, then I'll do what I have to do.<eos> I admire you, Tom.
But how do I make a relationship survive?<eos> Right, you know this swinging business? It's tricky.<eos> If this is about orgy etiquette, I'll go feed myself to a pack of cannibals.<eos> Oh, Suze, you don't actually think I'm a swinger? - I saw you snog the Prime Minister.<eos> - Pete is having a massive mid-life crisis.<eos> - I'm just riding the storm.<eos> - But how can you do that?<eos> - To keep him.<eos> - So there's no hope, basically?<eos> Listen... if you really love Tom, don't let anybody come between you.
- but she left at noon for Granada. - Thank you.<eos> You know what we have to do.<eos> Tomorrow you're not going to a procession.<eos> You'll meet the Queen before she departs.<eos> Now go and rest.<eos> A question I'm...<eos> Where's Ernesto?<eos> Go and rest.<eos> Leave Ernesto to me.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Great. I think it's great.<eos> And about the situation in Cuba?<eos> Not so great.<eos> I think it's about time I stopped acting.<eos> I come from a humble family, and I'm proud of it.<eos> Nobody has given me anything for free.<eos> But I can treat a sick man much better than some men than can tell a wine glass from a water one,<eos> - I assure you. - You love my daughter Amelia?<eos> Of course I love her.<eos> I'm here, dining with you.
By the authority the Holy Church grants me,<eos> I, Tomás de Torquemada, sentence this man to death at the stake.<eos> There's no way, not with the Queen, not with the Pope.<eos> I have never met someone who uses religion like that, for his own political interests.<eos> That's because you're too young, dear, History is full of "enlightened" people.<eos> If we don't fix this tomorrow, even the tabloids - will know about us.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> I still think the only way is a military intervention.<eos> Allow me to tell you a thing, Alonso.<eos> I admire you, a lot, and I'm sure before long you'll be one of the best agents in the Ministry.
Well then, how do you know?<eos> Rumours.<eos> Don't try to defend him.<eos> He's enchanted you, too.<eos> I don't blame you, friend.<eos> Federico is capable of selling a swimsuit to an Eskimo.<eos> He's a charmer and I appreciate that, but it's just that he... he's looking for something that I... that I am not.<eos> You understand?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> And I don't know why I'm discussing these things with you.
What?<eos> Each man individually.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) Sleep!<eos> Did you pay them by chance?<eos> What trickery is this?<eos> With the dead there are no tricks.<eos> Who are you? -You know well the ghost of the commander.<eos> I warn you that if you are not dead you will leave here a corpse.<eos> Tell me, what do you want?<eos> -To speak with you, Don Juan, you will come with me to your punishment receive, for Satan claims you at once.
Later they'll go for a drink.<eos> I'll go.<eos> And you should go.<eos> That way you can ask your granddaughter about your life.<eos> I think I'd rather not know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well I plan on going to say goodbye to Federico.<eos> Federico?<eos> Careful, that poet's really grown on you, huh?<eos> And I think he wants something more than a chat with you. No.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry about everything.<eos> Um... we should, uh, give them a minute.<eos> Can I, uh...<eos> So, um... along the, um... along the same lines of, uh, reconciliation, I wanted to, uh, apologize for the whole... interview thing.<eos> I, uh, should have made sure that you were all included.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Uh... I just wasn't thinking.<eos> Distance between family is never good.<eos> I don't like fighting with you guys.
And for next time, hire better comedic actors.<eos> I've never seen a woman as sharp as you.<eos> The Galician's Tavern is the Ritz compared to this.<eos> Why all the spitting, they're like footballers. - Don't get distracted.<eos> We have something to do.<eos> Let's talk to that young man.<eos> It's a hunch.<eos> Are you Alonso de Entrerríos?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can we sit down with you?
Cannon fodder.<eos> That's History for you, war, death and losses.<eos> But you must never tell that to the children.<eos> I must leave.<eos> I need to check on the ships which set sail at dawn.<eos> If you don't mind, I'll stay here until my partners come back... Which they should've by now, actually.<eos> Is everything alright? - Yes, everything's fine.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> You're back.<eos> I needed to talk to you, I was not completely honest with you before.
Amelia, I leave in a few hours.<eos> And maybe I'll die, serving the country and the Holy Mother Church.<eos> Don't lose hope.<eos> I'm sure you will survive.<eos> Ah, you're a seer.<eos> - I like your prediction.<eos> - No, I...<eos> Amelia, when one leaves for war, he knows he has an appointment with Death, and sometimes you can't avoid it.<eos> But I don't fear death, Amelia.<eos> No, I fear dying before I could love you.
- No.<eos> Death penalty commutable if you enlist in another ship, like the San Juan, which sails tomorrow at this same hour.<eos> - Thank you, sir, thank you.<eos> - Enough, enough.<eos> Don't be such a flatterer.<eos> In addition, I have an order you have to fulfill.<eos> - Anything.<eos> - You see that man?<eos> Don't ever leave his side.<eos> He must come aboard the San Juan like you, whatever the cost.
Not avoiding me?<eos> It's been two days.<eos> I know that you want distance, but we are king and queen.<eos> I saw you... the night I returned.<eos> You were sleeping with Lola.<eos> The two of you and your baby.<eos> Well, the baby refused to sleep for days.<eos> Lola and I were just exhausted.<eos> There's no need to explain.<eos> I know that there is nothing untoward going on between you.
I saw you... the night I returned.<eos> You were sleeping with Lola.<eos> The two of you and your baby.<eos> Well, the baby refused to sleep for days.<eos> Lola and I were just exhausted.<eos> There's no need to explain.<eos> I know that there is nothing untoward going on between you.<eos> But it still hurt to see you at peace with them.<eos> Gave me a glimpse of the happier life you could have.<eos> I want a happier life with you.
They might take your head, as well as your new counting house.<eos> It took me longer to find the twins' nanny.<eos> She changed her name after marrying.<eos> She did more than marry.<eos> She married a noble.<eos> Wonder how she managed that.<eos> I hope I haven't kept you.<eos> It's a great honor being invited to speak with Your Highness.<eos> If this is about your charity project, my husband and I would be honored to...<eos> Actually, we were hoping to speak with you about your time at the castle.
You're a lie, Henry.<eos> Because I brought you here to ease my conscience.<eos> Oh, but you were a lie in life, too.<eos> Everything you ever spoke of or promised were all lies.<eos> Loyalty, duty... even France.<eos> Nothing mattered more to you than yourself.<eos> Why are you arguing, Mother?<eos> Because, my darlings, I'm afraid our time together must come to an end.<eos> Now, you need to find peace, away from this place.<eos> I will be with you one day, I promise. To you, it will seem very soon.
So we might find the happiness she's found with Francis.<eos> All very neat and tidy, isn't it?<eos> Well, hardly.<eos> Perhaps you think you're some gallant defender of Mary's, but look around.<eos> You've spawned harmful gossip with your male pride, and she's doing everything she can to stop it.<eos> I don't care if your heart leads you my way or not, but I won't have it lead you to Mary.<eos> She's my oldest friend, and I'll see her protected from any threat, gallant or otherwise.<eos> You're quite fierce when you want to be, aren't you?<eos> Are you mocking me?<eos> I'm admiring you.
Throw it away?<eos> Did you throw away Mary's love when you had it?<eos> Besides, why are we even fighting about this?<eos> Everybody makes mistakes.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> Some things can't stay in the past.<eos> Some things are too unforgivable.<eos> When a person is willing to sacrifice lives for their own petty interests... that is one of those things.<eos> Mary?<eos> I hate to disturb you, but... are you all right?
As I do now.<eos> Your words were hard to hear, but they were true.<eos> Appearances matter for people like us.<eos> Condé and I can appear to have no friendship that is more than political.<eos> I can't stand to see you hurt.<eos> I don't want you to feel so alone.<eos> But I am alone.<eos> We both are.<eos> We don't have to be.<eos> I'd like to stay with you tonight.
And what?<eos> You reached that decision calmly, rationally?<eos> Me and Stevie had a little set-to, nothing too serious.<eos> Apart from you were cautioned for assault.<eos> Yeah, er... OK, but, look, that was just band stuff, you know?<eos> I've changed.<eos> We all have.<eos> And this... This is ancient history.<eos> But history does have a habit of repeating itself.<eos> See, we got hold of a contract between you, Stevie and Grand Central Beer.
- Oh, she's not real.<eos> It's a song on the first album, and not a particularly good one at that.<eos> It was clearly a one-nutty-fan operation.<eos> You're a fan.<eos> Are YOU Daisy Buttercup?<eos> Yes, I am not a fan.<eos> Just following Angela Matterson's orders?<eos> ~ Oh, yes.<eos> ~ And was it worth it?<eos> Did anything ever happen between you and Angela?
He was pretty adamant in that recording.<eos> I think he had no intention of changing his mind and signing that contract, and that is why you had to kill him... .. so you could forge his signature and collect the half a million dollars you so needed.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> How would I forge his signature?<eos> Oh, it's not that hard.<eos> I mean, not if you had the means.<eos> Just place this under the contract where Stevie's signature should be, and just trace it over.<eos> The thing is, if you had done it that way, then you would be able to see the indentations where you went over Stevie's signature.<eos> Erm... there.<eos> Half a million dollars split between you and Stevie.
It's just phenomenal.<eos> And then there's, well... well, everything else, really.<eos> Every time I've lost the plot or couldn't find a piece of evidence, or literally have nowhere to turn, there you were.<eos> I... I mean, it's like we've been partners for years.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I have a confession.<eos> I received a letter from Camille.<eos> ~ Oh?<eos> ~ With very detailed instructions on how to deal with you.
Charlie.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Everything okay in here?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> What are you...<eos> Josh.<eos> Josh, we got to go.<eos> Debbie, where's Faye?<eos> Officer.<eos> Officer, we need to talk to you.
Our victim has an interest in the Center.<eos> I know all about your case.<eos> Emma Wilson, hmm?<eos> I've never seen her in my life.<eos> She never set foot in that place.<eos> Why are you investigating them?<eos> We investigate every extreme group in the country.<eos> Arab, Jews... that's our job.<eos> But more specifically, it's none of your goddamn business.<eos> Rabbi Lev sent me to follow you.
You don't want to masturbate right now?<eos> Well, not in this elevator.<eos> Well, I want to drink, so...<eos> And I want to smoke, so...<eos> So cyril ought to be able to jack it.<eos> Pam, shut up.<eos> Well, we tried.<eos> And just where, exactly, were you hoping to smoke that cigarette?<eos> Magnum p.I.'s house.<eos> But since I'm stuck in here with you people...
I guess the same reason I don't know what grits are, or... hush puppies!<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hush puppies are little balls of fried cornmeal batter.<eos> Mm. Not really, though.<eos> Well, and also shoes.<eos> Well thank you, Cyril.<eos> I was just angry, now I'm confused and angry.<eos> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> This is captain Ray Gillette, welcoming you aboard from the flight deck.
O'Dublin tequila?<eos> I mean vodka, maybe.<eos> They obviously know their way around a potato, but...<eos> My point... is maybe you should worry about what's gonna happen to us when they find out you're not Slater!<eos> Cyril, I should worry about all kinds of shit.<eos> But you know what they say about stress.<eos> C'mon, anybody?<eos> Exactly, the silent killer.<eos> What?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Hello, is he in?<eos> Not at the moment-- can I take a message?<eos> I'd really like to speak with him.<eos> We're supposed to be playing racquetball at the moment.<eos> Racquetball?<eos> Steven doesn't play racquetball.<eos> Are you telling me I'm not standing on a racquetball court as we speak?<eos> I don't know where you are, sir.<eos> Well, that's a shame.<eos> If you had a bit more spatial awareness, you'd realize I was standing right behind you.
Mr. Brown. Thanks for coming down.<eos> Whatever. Let's make this fast.<eos> We just have a few questions.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> These two?<eos> They stole a portrait worth thousands of dollars from my office yesterday.<eos> Uh, well, we'll, uh, sort that out in a bit.<eos> First, uh, have a seat.<eos> We wanted to talk to you about...
His name is Donovan Gaines.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, I...<eos> Save your protests for the trial.<eos> You, Donovan, are the man who stole a truck from Axiom Parcel Delivery last week.<eos> You are the man who used that truck to steal two zebras from this facility.<eos> And when their delivery did not go as you had hoped, you're very likely the man who murdered Dr. David Chang in cold blood.<eos> No, no, you're crazy.<eos> I didn't have...<eos> Detective Bell, could I speak to you over here for a moment?
How can you even...<eos> 'Cause that's the way it goes, Robbins.<eos> Call Bailey.<eos> Tell her we're on.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Now, arguably, the most important part of the brain is the part that makes us hope...<eos> Dream...<eos> Imagine.<eos> One singular, almost immeasurable part is what makes you you...
I am so sorry.<eos> I just<eos> This tumor is making me crazy.<eos> Edwards.<eos> As bad as you want to get that tumor, that's as bad as I want to watch you get that tumor.<eos> You're tired and frustrated and terrified, but guess what.<eos> I don't give a damn.<eos> You're supposed to be my mentor.<eos> You are my mentor.<eos> I believe in you, I look up to you, I want to be you.
All right, honey.<eos> Let me get some ice on that.<eos> I heard a crash.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, Gloria turned her ankle.<eos> I don't know if she's gonna make it down for dinner.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Should I bring your food upstairs?<eos> No, she just wants to rest.<eos> She told me to eat with you downstairs.
She mad.<eos> What?<eos> Give me that.<eos> "Thanks for the dumbest breakup text ever.<eos> Don't call a girl awesome, then break up with her.<eos> If I'm so great, why'd you dump me?<eos> Get over yourself, you insensitive troll"?<eos> What is her problem?<eos> She can't talk to you like that.<eos> She's not. She's talking to you.
And we shall.<eos> There are many ways to pleasure each other and I'm open to all of them, except the one that produces a child.<eos> And what if I refuse?<eos> As your station is as low as it can go and I'm a princess, let's do things my way, shall we?<eos> Well, given those terms, I... I must respectfully decline.<eos> You can't just walk away.<eos> Oh, if I'm not myself, you wouldn't like me anyway, Princess.<eos> Oh, seeing I'm leaving you without a mentor, I will give you this one lesson free of charge:<eos> there are those who merely believe they have power, and there are those who actually have it.<eos> We wish to speak with you about your request for funds.
Well, I didn't ask Elizabeth to approach me, nor do I particularly want to make a deal with her.<eos> But Navarre, a very small nation...<eos> Strategically positioned at our backs.<eos> Needs to find money from somewhere.<eos> You've been conspiring with our enemy.<eos> Give us one reason why we wouldn't kill you now.<eos> Well, I'll give you two.<eos> If I don't return safely to Navarre, my wife Jeanne will be understandably upset... and all the more eager to accommodate England.<eos> Besides, consider my position.<eos> I came here to make a deal with you rather than Elizabeth.
She thinks we plan to attack her?<eos> She sees it as the first steps towards positioning you... a Catholic queen, to take her throne.<eos> Of course it would appear that way.<eos> We've practically declared ourselves her enemy.<eos> I hope that France will see its way clear to giving Navarre the money it needs.<eos> It really seems that that would be best for everyone.<eos> As bile is a cold humor, your body must be heated to balance it.<eos> Delightful.<eos> This is a well-known cure for syphilis.<eos> God's mercy with you.
That's the energy you feel.<eos> It's what made me curious.<eos> You like it here?<eos> The best thing about this city...<eos> Is that it's one day's journey to our home on the coast.<eos> You are safe here.<eos> I'm the Emperor.<eos> I'm not safe anywhere.<eos> You might stoop to scaring children, but your persecution only makes the Holy Spirit burn stronger within us.<eos> All the mo reason to put an end to you.
This place gives you visions.<eos> Some of my dreams have come true including one about the Nazarene, Jesus.<eos> But I haven't dreamt about anyone dying tonight.<eos> Good night, Emperor.<eos> Last chance...<eos> Come with us while it's quiet.<eos> You know we can't.<eos> But we would be free...<eos> Free to preach and baptize again.<eos> If I go with you, I'll just drag Saul after you.
We'll try.<eos> But if you're gone, who's gonna lead us?<eos> 'Cause I don't think Thomas can cope.<eos> James.<eos> It's James!<eos> By this time, he'd been missing for three days.<eos> His mother was beside herself with worry.<eos> But there he was, in the temple, debating and arguing with the priests as though it was the most natural thing in the world.<eos> I had that dream.<eos> And I knew then that I had to be here with you.
This is my fault.<eos> And I will deal with you later.<eos> Right now we have an important guest to prepare for.<eos> How could you?<eos> Herodias, she's a child.<eos> This is clearly the fault of my own servant, and I will deal with her.<eos> You may punish your servant as you wish, but these girls, they belong to me.<eos> You are both banished from my household and will be gone by morning.<eos> Now get out!<eos> Look, I know what he has done to you all.
We are all still brothers, then?<eos> Of course. Ah.<eos> And we will meet again?<eos> I promise.<eos> Well, then.<eos> I shall risk your lives no longer.<eos> I will leave now, teach his message as I go.<eos> Yes, by the time I get to Tarsus, I will have a hundred followers.<eos> You will do more than any of us.<eos> God be with you all.
We have to help.<eos> In any way we can.<eos> Then let's go.<eos> Those ones.<eos> Let me see.<eos> I've heard from the schools of Shammai and Hillel.<eos> They will all stand with you.<eos> It's nearly time.<eos> Before you go, I...<eos> I need to talk to you about your wife.
- Captain Crane.<eos> - Private.<eos> There's a woman in holding at the fort.<eos> Claims she has important information about the war.<eos> Who is she?<eos> We're not certain.<eos> At first we thought her to be a runaway slave, but her demeanor, clothing and attitude are, um, unusual.<eos> Very well, have Donovan question her.<eos> He did.<eos> She'd like to speak with you and you alone.
Uh... the Abiero spell will return you to the moment the spell was cast.<eos> But it-it, it will require a great deal of power.<eos> I will have to draw on the energies that normally shield this house.<eos> So, we'll be vulnerable to attack?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then we should commence.<eos> We found your journal.<eos> My mom, my sister.<eos> It's guided us, helped us fight evil.<eos> Everything that we do is because of the legacy that you started.
But was impossible to know if it would be remembered, saved or wind up in the proper hands.<eos> Sometimes all it takes is to put pen to paper to make a difference.<eos> It's the Horseman and Katrina.<eos> The hex guarding the house won't hold long.<eos> - I'll delay them.<eos> - Crane?<eos> You will die out there.<eos> If you succeed, it won't matter.<eos> And if you do not, there will be greater problems than my death.<eos> - I'll go with you.
Execute a verification scan of their public key, make sure they're legit.<eos> Oh, it's legit.<eos> You see the number?<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Don't talk to her.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> The two of you don't belong here, not with Gus, not trapped in this place with him.<eos> You don't deserve what's going to happen to you.
You don't belong here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Don't talk to her.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> The two of you don't belong here, not with Gus, not trapped in this place with him.<eos> You don't deserve what's going to happen to you.<eos> What are you?<eos> 24?<eos> 25?<eos> You've got your entire lives ahead of you, the whole world ahead of you, and with your skills, those minds, the potential you have, the chance you have...
You didn't dream of a life in a super-max prison or on the run or doing whatever the hell Gus tells you to do, which is actually the worst option.<eos> You dreamed of power.<eos> You dreamed of being successful, of running companies, of building something great.<eos> You should be getting wined and dined by venture capitalists, not working for some gun-wielding lunatic.<eos> Which one of you do you think he'll shoot first so he only has to split the money two ways instead of three?<eos> Pete, he needs us both to run the auction.<eos> We're safe.<eos> Look at Ian.<eos> Gus won't even move him.<eos> You think it'll be different for the two of you?
She's a Hexenbiest. I'm a Grimm.<eos> Wu, we're at the spice shop with Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> You're on speaker.<eos> Hey, a woman was attacked on the highway.<eos> She's okay, but the guy who attacked her is not.<eos> Got ourselves another frozen stiff.<eos> You got a location?<eos> Route 4, mile marker 17.<eos> - Okay, we're on our way. - Yeah.<eos> I should probably go with you guys.
I wish I could tell you it wasn't.<eos> I take it that the cause of death is blunt-force trauma.<eos> It looks like a massive skull fracture in the parietal region, but she just came in, so I've only done a preliminary exam.<eos> Once I've finished my autopsy, I'll give you a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Castle, I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Now that we have a body, maybe that will give us some leverage.<eos> Taylor, we need to talk.<eos> My lawyer said not to speak with you.
Listen, Taylor, if you want to stay out of prison, now's the time to tell us the truth.<eos> Ms. Haskins, welcome back.<eos> You seem to be representing everyone in this matter.<eos> Before we begin, Mr. Whitfield is here only because you said you have information on his wife's whereabouts.<eos> Cole, you said that you spoke with Eva this morning.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She said it was over and that she was leaving town.<eos> Detective, did you find Mrs. Whitfield or not?<eos> Oh, we found her... In the Hudson...<eos> Murdered by you.
This does not bode well for your re-election.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Test his blood.<eos> And when you find no trace of alcohol but the presence of acetone, see that all charges are dropped.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> All of the bribes you accepted in the form of endorsements from LeMarchal publications will be exposed.<eos> And you'll lose everything, just like you threatened to take from Jack.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> Choose wisely.<eos> I'll be watching you.
Love you.<eos> Bye. Ow.<eos> - Nice sensitivity, dumb-ass.<eos> - What...?<eos> Dad!<eos> Okay, cut it out, both of you.<eos> NADINE: The desk officer is waiting to brief you on your first meeting.<eos> - Ecuador?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> And Matt and Daisy are here to have a word with you this morning.
None.<eos> Then, um, I just need to draw your blood.<eos> Well, I'm on a tight schedule.<eos> I hope you don't mind if I multitask.<eos> So, what does the CEO of one of America's biggest oil companies want from a peon like the Secretary of State?<eos> Chip Harding is here because he believes you should be doing more to help Ashmont Petroleum secure drilling rights in Ecuador, as opposed to the Chinese.<eos> ELIZABETH: But the proposed area of the Amazon is highly sensitive, which is what our desk officer for the region is here to discuss.<eos> It's Laura, right?<eos> (clears throat) Uh, yes, ma'am.<eos> Let me first say how thrilled I am to finally meet you in... person.
Well, some would argue that you did that, first by uncovering the conspiracy, and second by your unprecedented trip to Iran.<eos> Come on, he's not gonna ask that.<eos> DAISY: Oh, well, it's a fair interpretation of the facts, ma'am.<eos> Uh, fine.<eos> While I was glad to do my part, the fact that we are now on the other side of a constitutional and global crisis is a testament to our president's courageous leadership.<eos> Madam Secretary, you were present when Iranian Foreign Minister Javani was killed, along with several others.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Tell me about that horrifying scene.<eos> Who was there with you, and-and what happened?
They're fine.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Kids are a blessing.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Course, when they look back at the Amazon and what we did to it, they'll think we must have hated them.<eos> Again, ma'am, these remarks...<eos> No, no, it's interesting, because, you see, if we chop it all down, we pretty much guarantee that the planet overheats, and our kids will live in a totally destabilized world.<eos> (scoffs) Well, then at least they'll be able to go to war with each other over fresh water.<eos> - That'll be kicky.<eos> - Madam Secretary, are you quite all right?
Big mess in Russia.<eos> Very big, very messy. But you didn't hear it from us.<eos> Nadine Tolliver,<eos> Thank you so much for coming in.<eos> And this is Laura... something something.<eos> Uh, Vargas.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Uh, look, I-I don't want to be rude or whatever, but I've got a gala I'm supposed to - go to in a little while...<eos> - Oh, Mr. Walton, please.<eos> The secretary had hoped to discuss an opportunity with you.
Now, what do you think you're doing?<eos> Playing, ma'am.<eos> Well, we must all have our amusements.<eos> But do not let your mother catch you at such playing, understand?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Hathorne.<eos> Greetings, my dear girl.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> It is I who am here to help you.<eos> Oh, I thank you for whatever kindness you may intend, but I'm rather busy at present.
It pains me to find you sunk in doubt.<eos> Since the incidents in Salem... And my father's death, I...<eos> I doubt everything.<eos> I've even begun to doubt the existence of witches.<eos> No.<eos> Never doubt there are witches.<eos> Miss Hale...<eos> Anne...<eos> Has something else happened?<eos> I mean to you?
When you learn to talk to your father again where he is, then you will be ready to hear what he can tell you.<eos> In the meantime, weep no more unless it is to bring the rain.<eos> We will meet again, little owl, and soon.<eos> Until then, tell no one that we have met.<eos> Their time for knowing me is not yet.<eos> And trust me, I will know if you have told anyone.<eos> And things will not go lightly for you.<eos> We are just dying to hear your opinion.<eos> Do bring miss Hale to dine.<eos> Sebastian is most anxious to meet you.
That's Yaron.<eos> He's the new Soccer Counselor.<eos> He's from Israel.<eos> - Ya-what?<eos> - Yaron.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yaron.<eos> - Ya-reun?<eos> - Ya-ron.<eos> I'm so happy to meet all of you.
I don't blame you, Mark.<eos> There's such ill-feeling at the court, no-one trusts anyone.<eos> But I've come to you because you're close to the Queen, and I'd really love to know why she's so unhappy and if there's anything that I can do to remedy it.<eos> It's no wonder she's unhappy.<eos> She's in love.<eos> With whom?<eos> With me.<eos> You're amazed.<eos> I'm not as amazed as you might think.<eos> I've seen how she looks at you.
Why does she keep looking up at the tower?<eos> Because she thinks there's still hope.<eos> So, she will not be able to tell me from the other officials.<eos> It will save her alarm.<eos> Good, Christian people... .. I am come hither to die.<eos> For according to the law, and by the law, I am judged to die -<eos> I can't hear her.<eos> You'd think she'd speak up for her last words.<eos> I am come hither to accuse no man... .. nor to speak any thing of that whereof I am accused and condemned to die.<eos> But I pray God save the King... .. and send him long to reign over you. For a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never.
It's horrible!<eos> You look the same and now I'm just this middle-aged-looking... person.<eos> HE LAUGHS<eos> Can I...?<eos> Where's the loo?<eos> Um... it's, I think...<eos> If you'd told me that I'd be sitting opposite you, having a friendly... I know! It's good, though.<eos> Yeah, I mean when you dumped me, I was like... oh! ~ But then you realised your mistake and wanted to get back, but I was already with...<eos> I think I was drunk.<eos> Drunk for three months? Ha! But it's so great to see you.
You and Taylor are gonna fix this.<eos> Carter, I'm dumped.<eos> Okay, I'm done.<eos> I've gotta pack up, get my truck fixed.<eos> Head back to Pennsylvania.<eos> Max, please be here when I get home from school.<eos> (Carter) I'm coming!<eos> Sorry, sorry. I'm here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your mom and I wanted to talk to you as soon as possible.
Choi In Ha.<eos> Could you set up a meeting with her?<eos> Why my daughter?<eos> You know that she's close with Ki Ha Myung.<eos> I feel that it may be better to attack him instead.<eos> Chairman. Don't worry. I won't be mean to her.<eos> You know me.<eos> I'm such a nice person that it's hard for people to refuse me.<eos> How good was I to you 14 years ago?<eos> It's because I want to create another good relationship like I have with you.
- Yeah.<eos> I called into the office, and they told me to come in right away.<eos> So I'm planning to stick with it no matter what.<eos> Like you said, if I'm going to find a way, I should find it in there.<eos> Fighting.<eos> Fighting.<eos> You have to go that way.<eos> This is my workplace.<eos> I have business to attend here, too. Let's go.<eos> It's because I want to create another good relationship like I have with you.
What message?<eos> That everything I've possessed in my life and everything I'll come to possess... that I'll assume the responsibility for them with her, together.<eos> The message from your son was... 'Everything I've possessed in my life and everything I'll come to possess...' 'Tell her that I'll assume the responsibility for them with her, together.'<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Does it mean Chairman Park was a part of it?<eos> Tell her that I'm sorry for having left her alone and for not having realized it sooner.<eos> He also told me to tell you that he's sorry that he didn't know, and that you were alone.<eos> Tell her that from now on... I'll always be there with her.<eos> Please tell her that for me.<eos> He also wanted me to tell you that he'll always be with you from now on.
What's your interest?<eos> This is Indiana Hope, the victim of a hit-and-run last night in Kings Cross.<eos> So, what's this got to do with my case?<eos> Indiana's a key witness in a major AFP investigation and I need to know if there's any link between your girl... and mine.<eos> Indiana.<eos> Indy.<eos> You know her?<eos> Yes, she lived with us for about six months.<eos> Must be, what, eight years ago?<eos> How did she come to live with you?
I didn't like being held responsible for whatever they got up to.<eos> I'm an older sister, I know what you mean.<eos> I keep expecting her to walk through the door any moment.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, we've only got a few more questions.<eos> When did you last see Indiana?<eos> We haven't.<eos> Not since she left.<eos> Any reason why?<eos> She stayed with you for six months, she was best friends with Karly and then nothing?
So you've never seen this man before?<eos> No.<eos> But you claim that he was sent by your ex-boyfriend Oscar Ramirez to scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's got this weird idea that he can scare me back into his arms again or something.<eos> That's insane, right?<eos> Can't you arrest the guy?<eos> We need a little more, and it is insane, but it's not uncommon.<eos> A lot of people with obsessive minds can concoct extreme rationale for their behavior.<eos> Has Oscar contacted you directly?
That's what I thought.<eos> My name is everett, and I'm an alcoholic. All:<eos> Hello, everett.<eos> I... [ sighs ]<eos> I'm also partial to prescription medications, Gambling.<eos> I suppose I should throw in nicotine, food, porn.<eos> And I've been known to lie, especially to, uh, Try and keep my job.<eos> [ sighs ] right? [ chuckles ]<eos> I'm you, and I'm an alcoholic.<eos> I'm me, and I'm an alcoholic, And I just wanted to share with you... How I've recently hit bottom.
So, what can I do for you?<eos> We know Bruce Epstein was a hit man for the Romano family.<eos> We know you were his girlfriend.<eos> Fiancée.<eos> And he also told me never to talk to cops.<eos> Really? So you have no interest in finding out why he was killed?<eos> Since when is the NYPD interested in the murder of a hit man?<eos> We need to find out who sent him to Bianco's house, make sure he wasn't set up.<eos> And to make sure you're not in any danger.<eos> Look, we know he confided in you, okay?
What do you want to know?<eos> Who sent him to kill Bianco?<eos> He wasn't there to kill Bianco.<eos> Why was he there?<eos> He was there to kill Bianco's wife.<eos> Anna was the target?<eos> Why? I have no idea why.<eos> Who hired him to kill her?<eos> Her husband.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk to you without my lawyer, you know.
You're still very beautiful. Your Majesty.<eos> I'm beginning to forget what you look like.<eos> You should visit the palace occasionally. Your Majesty.<eos> Then please begin the ceremony.<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Didn't you say you couldn't attend today?<eos> [Wang Sik Ryeom] I'm becoming more religious.<eos> Sir. [Kim Jong Sik] you should dot the mole together with the King. Your Majesty?<eos> Park Soo Gyeong] would it be okay if I did it with you?
Little tiny legs?<eos> Lazy eye?<eos> Canadian...?<eos> "Canadian"?<eos> That's the border we should be watching.<eos> He's just a guy.<eos> Where'd you meet him?<eos> At school.<eos> So, he's a student.<eos> God! What is with you guys?
Oh, hey, what are you guys doing up?<eos> Oh, give me a break.<eos> I heard you breathing up there.<eos> Great, then I can jump right in.<eos> Why don't we invite Gregory over for dinner?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He knows I grew up in the circus, he doesn't need to meet the clowns.<eos> Honey, I promise, your mom and I will be on our best behavior.<eos> We'll make him feel really welcome.<eos> Well, he did say he'd like to meet you.
Well, he did say he'd like to meet you.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> You'll see.<eos> He's a terrific guy and I think he really cares for me.<eos> I'm sure he does.<eos> Which brings up the question:<eos> Where are you in the relationship?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Are you plankin' him?<eos> I'm not talking about this with you.
Mind if I stick around and meet him?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.<eos> Take the kid that is yours and go.<eos> Whatever.<eos> All right, let's hit it. Oh...<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, Baxter.<eos> This is Gregory.<eos> Gregory, this is my little brother Roscoe and Roscoe's dad.<eos> Hi. Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm fine.<eos> Where can I hang this?<eos> The closet's back there, but that's where my little brother sleeps.<eos> What?<eos> Welcome, welcome, welcome.<eos> Welcome.<eos> - Welcome.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Mom, Grandma, this is Gregory.<eos> Oh, it is so nice to meet you.
No, I got here first.<eos> It's my room.<eos> Okay, here's a fun idea.<eos> What if we put a tent in the living room, and you could pretend you're camping every night?<eos> What am I, seven?<eos> That was pathetic.<eos> What's pathetic is I have to return a tent. Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> What brings you by?<eos> I needed to talk to you guys.
Who said that?<eos> Dickens?<eos> Jackie Chan.<eos> So the gun lobbyists were dismissive of the Congressman, saying they don't waste their time with one-termers like Troy.<eos> But anyway, even if they were involved, I highly doubt that they would outsource the job to the Russian mob.<eos> What about the oil companies?<eos> Pretty slimy, pun intended, but none of our sources say they were involved.<eos> Well, considering how much oil comes out of Russia, they are the most likely candidates to have ties to the mob.<eos> I'm interrupting, I know, but, sir, there's a reporter in the lobby.<eos> She insists to speak to you.
Yet this kidnapping was just the opposite.<eos> It's not adding up.<eos> Benjy, can't we borrow against your campaign fund?<eos> No.<eos> No, that's illegal.<eos> I--I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.<eos> This message is for the people who are holding Sophie Troy.<eos> We have received your demands and we are taking them very seriously.<eos> At this time, we want to ensure Sophie's well-being and are willing to fully cooperate with you.
Whatever the Congressman's involvement, the clock's ticking on Sophie.<eos> Who's that?<eos> The Congressman's intern.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I can't tell you how much it means to me.<eos> Take care.<eos> I feel like I should be holding a telethon the way I'm asking strangers to donate money for Sophie's ransom.<eos> Have a seat, Congressman. We need to ask you about an intern in your office, Michelle Golovin.<eos> A former intern.<eos> She no longer works for you?
But he did seem more nervous than usual.<eos> Yes, I had a relationship with her.<eos> While Michelle was still your intern.<eos> Again, mea culpa.<eos> But I was single, we were both consenting adults, and this was before I met Sophie.<eos> Believe me, after that I wasn't interested in anyone else.<eos> He told me we'd be together soon.<eos> He doesn't love Sophie, you know.<eos> He only married her for his career.<eos> Did he try to end things with you?
But I also know his weaknesses.<eos> He's selfish.<eos> He thinks about himself first.<eos> Like I have to be available for him whenever he wants.<eos> Ohh, I know the type.<eos> Probably won't even use protection, right?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> That's my responsibility.<eos> Look, despite what the Congressman is saying, I just want you to know that I believe you.<eos> And if you'll agree to take a medical exam, we can prove that he had unprotected sex with you last night and is just lying to save himself.
Allow me to say, sir, that I have learned from your boldness.<eos> At Trenton, at Princeton, and even more so here at Valley Forge.<eos> We fought no battles at Valley Forge to my recollection.<eos> On the contrary, sir.<eos> You fought the greatest battle of all.<eos> Preserving this army through its dark winter so that we might now have this chance to take the fight to the enemy.<eos> For that reason, I owe you my humble respect and an apology for ever doubting your leadership.<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> He won't see you.
Yes, yes, I have feelings for you.<eos> Feelings that could grow.<eos> But this is Philadelphia.<eos> There are conventions.<eos> First and foremost, obtaining my father's approval.<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> Of course.<eos> And I'm afraid he may draw conclusions that don't help your cause if I'm away too long.<eos> He sounds like a formidable man.<eos> Many would agree with you.
- Can't say I have, no.<eos> Cannot say or will not say?<eos> Hey, where'd you get that flask?<eos> That's Maclnnis's.<eos> Oh. What's it doing here and where's my bloody flask?<eos> To hell with yours!<eos> Where's Maclnnis and Tanner?<eos> They ain't showed today and they didn't show yesterday.<eos> I don't understand why you think I should've seen them.<eos> Because I sent them to follow you.
We've heard so much about you.<eos> I'm Debbie.<eos> This is Jackie.<eos> We're in your mom's PFLAG group.<eos> We were just finalizing plans for our fund raiser.<eos> It's a hoedown.<eos> Now, Jackie, I thought we agreed we're calling it a square dance.<eos> Yeah, well, a hoedown sounds so much more fun, doesn't it, girls?<eos> Oh, and you two have to come.<eos> Everyone's dying to meet you.
What makes you say that?<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> These scientists, is that just a diversion to keep people calm?<eos> I'm not asking for me.<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> But Rhonda needs to know.<eos> It's going to be fine.<eos> Promise.<eos> 'Dr Hendrix to radiology.'<eos> I owe you guys a huge apology.
How could we just lose the Secretary of State?<eos> It was a massive assault.<eos> We're getting reports that Javani is dead.<eos> It's possible that Secretary McCord's detail was completely overwhelmed.<eos> Does the State Department know anything, Ms. Tolliver?<eos> We've been back-channeling through the Swiss and Czech embassies in Tehran, but so far nothing.<eos> I have one of Secretary McCord's detail on a video feed...<eos> - John Kendall.<eos> - Put it up, Major.<eos> JACKSON: Mr. Kendall, do you have the secretary?
- What's this?<eos> - Mr Barrow's found a job. - Has he?<eos> Has he, indeed?<eos> Well, I'm glad your efforts have paid off, Mr Barrow.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Thank you, Mr Carson.<eos> Mr Carson, I thought I might walk down to the village, if you've no objection.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Oh, you could pick up some silver polish at Bakewell's.<eos> I might come with you.
Oh, you could pick up some silver polish at Bakewell's.<eos> I might come with you.<eos> Her ladyship won't like that.<eos> It's very discreet, the colour.<eos> It's called Nude.<eos> That won't strengthen your argument.<eos> I'll go.<eos> If you'd like to wait in the drawing room, m'lady.<eos> Miss Denker will tell her ladyship that you're here.<eos> Oh, it was you I came to see, actually.
- Yes.<eos> Well, I've been thinking and I thought I might try to be someone else<eos> - when I get to my new position.<eos> - We do change as life goes on.<eos> Or we could if our past would let us.<eos> You know what, Miss Baxter?<eos> I listen to Anna, you should listen to Mr Molesley.<eos> Forget about Coyle and your time in prison.<eos> You think the strong decision would be to see him but you're wrong.<eos> The strong decision is to take away his power over you.
- D'you know, I don't think so.<eos> - In fact, I feel lighter already, really.<eos> - Well, I'm thrilled and I can't pretend otherwise.<eos> - But you still love cars?<eos> - Don't worry, I still love cars.<eos> You're not alone in that, I just...<eos> I don't want to race any more.<eos> Then you'll have to find another way to express your love.<eos> More to the point, I have to find a job.<eos> - Mr Carson, are you all right? - Ye...
- Well, I -- - Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> - Ssh!<eos> Speeches.<eos> You made a mistake, Miss Denker, in your haste to be rid of me.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - She never likes to be predictable.<eos> .. And I am a cousin of her father's...<eos> If you mean what you say, Daisy, I shall drink a toast with gusto.<eos> I do, I'm coming to the farm.<eos> Then I hope we'll be seeing a lot more of you there, too, Mrs Patmore.
The last time Francis and I spoke, we came to blows.<eos> I believe he regrets the outburst and thinks a proper sendoff would help ease tensions.<eos> So this is a joint effort?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> I'll tell you in the hopes that you're frank with me about why it is you want me to stay.<eos> Mary, your private life is lived in a very public way.<eos> In a home filled with hundreds of nobles and servants.<eos> There's always talk of the king and queen.<eos> More so because they're mesmerized by you.
It's good to be a royal this time of year.<eos> Well, seasons change, along with everything else.<eos> And who knows what kind of royal delicacies may soon be touching your lips.<eos> King Antoine, I'm flattered, but you must stop, please.<eos> You're beginning to make me feel uncomfortable.<eos> Well, that was never my intention.<eos> I apologize, truly.<eos> Accepted.<eos> Lord Narcisse.<eos> I was looking forward to seeing you, ever since I heard you lost everything due to your financial misadventures.
Would you consider yourself a kind man?<eos> Kind and generous.<eos> It-it shames me to seek such comfort, to crave human touch, but I do.<eos> I think I can help you.<eos> Or rather I know someone who can help.<eos> She's just upstairs.<eos> Louis, I am so sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> Manipulating me or believing me capable of such deception?<eos> Poisoning your family, then working beside you, fighting beside you.
But you're not really a married woman anymore, are you?<eos> I am, Louis.<eos> In the eyes of the Church and the world,<eos> I am Francis's wife.<eos> And I will never do anything to compromise my duty as queen.<eos> I don't have the same freedom as a man or a king to stray beyond my marriage.<eos> And given what I've been through, I have nothing to offer you, Louis.<eos> I hear you.<eos> I do.<eos> But of all the reasons you expound of why we can't be together, none are of the heart.

Not for me.<eos> I lost key support in the African-American community.<eos> It wasn't personal, Peter.<eos> So, you don't personally think I'm a racist, but saw a political advantage in calling me a racist?<eos> I didn't specifically call you a racist.<eos> You know, I see little comfort in that.<eos> Let's just get through this.<eos> Then we can get back to you using me politically.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good to see you all.
He might even come back.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> She didn't seem like she was... working.<eos> We've been letting Gil get away with that for a few years now.<eos> He said he could bring either a... a call girl or a Democrat.<eos> People voted, said they'd rather the call girl.<eos> That was a joke, right?<eos> No.<eos> Well, was there a vote about me?<eos> What about you?
Why the hell not?<eos> We both have rifles.<eos> Let's see what comes of this.<eos> Kick that weapon to me.<eos> I'm going to the top of that building.<eos> There's ammunition up there.<eos> Where is the rest of our team?<eos> I need help here.<eos> Hey, watch out.<eos> Behind you!
- I don't need an option.<eos> It's not up to me to have an option.<eos> - Because you're a man.<eos> - Come on.<eos> That's beneath you.<eos> No, it's not, because I just said it, and you still haven't answered.<eos> Look, bottom line, I like people.<eos> I like you.<eos> I mean, you seem smart, I think.<eos> I don't know why that next fetus wouldn't turn into you, or me, and what would be lost to the world if it were to be aborted.
Sure.<eos> You want something else?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> This is the third school Dylan has had to leave.<eos> Look, I'm sure you'll find a good school.<eos> Mm. And that school will ask him to leave.<eos> My life is strangling any chance of him living his.<eos> You're being followed, Kalinda.<eos> What?<eos> The men we stopped in the SUV, the ones following you to school, they weren't following Dylan.
Thank you for meeting me like this.<eos> No problem.<eos> Gives me a chance to concede in person.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Good job.<eos> So, what couldn't wait?<eos> Come work with me.<eos> Work with you?
You know, okay, for all of Lori's faults, and believe me, there are many,<eos> she never got on my case about school.<eos> She just trusted me enough to leave me alone and let me figure stuff out for myself.<eos> Miss.<eos> This employee bothering you?<eos> No. I was just, um, talking...<eos> - What?<eos> - He's kidding.<eos> This is my uncle Shane.<eos> It's nice to finally meet you.
Molly, I say this out of love:<eos> Leave me the hell alone.<eos> Aw. And I say this out of love:<eos> - Get up!<eos> Get up! Get up!<eos> - Oh, go away.<eos> Go away!<eos> Go away. I'm not gonna stop.<eos> - Go away!<eos> - Ah! I knew you still had it in you.
See? You may end up getting t-boned by that rhino yet.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Hey, Molly, hold this for me.<eos> Huh? Okay.<eos> You can watch change, or you can be a part of it.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Oh, god. Ha-ha!<eos> (Laughs) - Hold this.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Kay, I will follow you anywhere!
What do we do?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Check in your jump bag, grab me anything, wraps, straps, tubing, anything we can use as a makeshift rope.<eos> Come on, stick with me.<eos> I got you, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Ambo 61.<eos> Brett, report!<eos> Listen.<eos> Just give me a sign that you're okay.
Whose idea was it?<eos> Mine.<eos> We got along fine, but, uh, but his career hit the skids, and... he became bitter and vicious.<eos> How come your thing fell apart?<eos> Just... bad timing.<eos> So it's agreed.<eos> We are both fresh out of serious relationships, looking to have some fun... - Mmm? - Fool around...<eos> Go on a cross-country crime spree.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm glad I got to spend some time with my father... and he got to know all of you.
Hey, Welch! Hit the hinges!<eos> Otis!<eos> Get him!<eos> (Pridgen) Folks, I think we all learned a lesson here today about why we don't freelance.<eos> Isn't that right, Gutter Ball?<eos> Don't talk to my guy like that.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> (Casey) He made a great save today.<eos> That old man would be dead if not for him.<eos> And if he got a little too eager out there, it's only 'cause he was trying to prove himself to you.
It's fucking football.<eos> I mean, you tell somebody to put a helmet on and run headfirst into another speeding object just like that and of course this is what you... who does that for a living, let alone for fun?<eos> It's fucking insanity.<eos> The whole thing is insane.<eos> You're fine, Mr. Strasmore.<eos> - What do you mean? - No swelling.<eos> No new blood, no old blood, ventricles look healthy.<eos> You have the normal, healthy brain of a 39-year-old man.<eos> So I pass?<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with you neurologically, but judging on the symptoms in your file, the problem is more likely psychological.
If they were, somebody had to have left them in.<eos> What was the name of the student this was directed at?<eos> Simon George.<eos> Unfortunately, when he turned 18, he dropped out just weeks before he was supposed to graduate.<eos> Do you have an address on him?<eos> He was living with his foster parent, but last I heard, he left home.<eos> I felt we had failed him, but I had no proof who had done this.<eos> If this kid Simon thinks the janitor was involved, it could be revenge.<eos> Let's go the precinct and run a background on the janitor.<eos> Do you guys mind if I tag along with you?
No.<eos> But I think I know where he's going.<eos> This is all about Simon's father.<eos> There's only one place Simon could be: where his father is buried.<eos> It's on the mountain.<eos> You can't drive there.<eos> We got to go after him.<eos> Is he gonna get out of this?<eos> - Eventually.<eos> - I'm coming with you.

Adalind's child.<eos> No surprise there, I suppose.<eos> You're one of the Royals.<eos> Yes.<eos> The one who's going to get the child back.<eos> Well, I don't know where she is.<eos> I believe that you don't, but I also believe that you could.<eos> Sorry you wasted your bail money.<eos> My God.<eos> You're still loyal to the Grimm even after what he's done to you.
My God.<eos> You're still loyal to the Grimm even after what he's done to you.<eos> You know, I admire loyalty when it's deserved, but this borders on tragic.<eos> You know, it might be more tragic for a Royal to die in Portland.<eos> For me, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I thought for sure you'd be interested to know that Adalind's pregnant again.<eos> And that is a surprise why?<eos> Think about it.<eos> Nick assumed he was sleeping with you, so you can't really blame him for cheating with Adalind.
The other very much respects life.<eos> And every day, we have to choose which one we're gonna be.<eos> And I admit...<eos> I have been both.<eos> Now, n-no, no, no. That is... it is nothing to be proud of.<eos> Life is precious, and it should only be taken when your very survival is at stake.<eos> You have to fight the instinct, basically, that draws you to blood.<eos> The feeling of blood in your... In your throat and the... the... the...<eos> The taste of it in your...<eos> Yeah, that... it's... It's important that you, uh, that you... you don't let it get the better of you.
There's more footage from West Burnside.<eos> I'll pull it up.<eos> All these cars are starting to look the same to me.<eos> Whoa, wait.<eos> I got something.<eos> Is that the captain's?<eos> It's him.<eos> It puts him in the area within one hour of the first killing.<eos> He's here.<eos> I need to see you both... now.
422 Mountain Estate Drive.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> No. Not this time.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> I don't want you getting pulled down with what I have to do.<eos> Considering who's in the compound, my guess is it's going to be heavily guarded.<eos> How are we going in?<eos> Quietly.<eos> We need some things from the shop.<eos> - Coming with you.
Do you think he played a part in this one, too?<eos> I don't have any evidence of it yet, sir, and we haven't found any actual proof that Jerry Tyson is still alive.<eos> It's possible that Kelly Nieman is a serial killer in her own right.<eos> She's as shrewd and high functioning of a sociopath as he ever was.<eos> If Dr. Nieman is involved in this murder, how can I make sure that she doesn't slip through our fingers again?<eos> You could bring Castle in to consult on this case.<eos> No, detective.<eos> Sir, he knows the Nieman case inside and out.<eos> He could be a huge asset.<eos> Well, I am inclined to agree with you, but...
She's got to be Tyson's girlfriend.<eos> He taught her everything he knew.<eos> We got here too late.<eos> Nieman cleared out. She's gone.<eos> You think you've got this all figured out, but you don't.<eos> We meet again.<eos> Like the song says.<eos> Kate Beckett. Mm.<eos> Such lovely features.<eos> What skilled hands could do with you.
Well, that's a relief.<eos> What can you tell me about Susan Watts?<eos> I'm not familiar with that name.<eos> She was a client at Newstart Horizons.<eos> Many women are.<eos> So you never met her there?<eos> I donate to Newstart Horizons, detective, but it's not where I spend my time, and I don't know Susan Watts.<eos> Does this refresh your memory?<eos> She got a job that apparently doesn't exist.<eos> She also had cosmetic surgery performed by you.
This is all about your mother.<eos> Sorry, Ryan, I got caught in traffic.<eos> Boudreau is probably long gone by now.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> He ordered a Cobb salad at Cafe Julius.<eos> So he may be in there eating.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check. I'll call you back.<eos> Wait, Amy Barrett!<eos> Wait... wait, I need to talk to you.
Wait... wait, I need to talk to you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Detective Beckett.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - No!<eos> Wait.<eos> We've been looking for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mike's lawyer told me you'd show up.<eos> He said not to talk to you.
If it's him, he won't be able to make a move without us knowing it.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Okay, look all you want, Detective Esposito, she's not here, and I have no idea where she is.<eos> What about your client Amy Barrett?<eos> My office gave you our information on Amy Barrett.<eos> I can't help it if her contact information is out of date.<eos> Yeah, I bet you can't... just like you have nothing to do with Detective Beckett's disappearance.<eos> You seem to think that I'm something that I'm not.<eos> And how could I be involved?<eos> I was with you at the time.
This was planned.<eos> They've been preparing this for months.<eos> Looks that way.<eos> This was about Beckett.<eos> No.<eos> That interview, that was meant as a... as a message to me.<eos> He wants me to suffer.<eos> Why?<eos> Why is Tyson fixated on you?<eos> If he's directing this at you, he may try to communicate.
If you bring me back there, I'll show you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making sure you stay out of my way.<eos> You know what I love about this car?<eos> All the trunk space.<eos> Get in.<eos> If I'm lying and they are down there, they're gonna miss me soon.<eos> They'll know you're out here.<eos> They'll kill you both.<eos> Despite the situation, I want you to know I admire you.
Might I remind you the entire world will be watching you today?<eos> You'll give your quote to Fiona, you'll acknowledge the crowd, and you'll escort me to the car.<eos> And try not to sleep with anyone along the way.<eos> Prince Liam, with heavy hearts we offer our condolences to you as a grieving nation.<eos> One of the great things about my brother was he wasn't afraid to be his own man.<eos> I'll miss him.<eos> My God.<eos> You wretched brats.<eos> Your brother, my first-born son, and you can't find the decorum, the civility, to honor his memory.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
I'll do better.<eos> I can't be on benefits.<eos> Of course.<eos> You seem terribly nervous.<eos> Am I that intimidating?<eos> It's just...<eos> - Well, I've heard things. - Oh?<eos> What sort of things?<eos> That... some of the women have had to do things to keep their jobs.<eos> With you.
Thank you very much.<eos> I haven't been sleeping much lately.<eos> Have you seen Alex or talked to her?<eos> About anything other than work?<eos> No. She's writing her boards today.<eos> Alex.<eos> That's what you're talking about, right?<eos> - Her boards.<eos> - Writing her boards... is that even safe?<eos> Safer than you two stressing her out.
Okay. Uh, let's get a rundown of the gear.<eos> You need anything, you let me know.<eos> Corporal Delkus, you're relieved.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not leaving you, sir.<eos> Go.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Delkus, you showed good instincts out there.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You too, guys.
Sure.<eos> Amanda?<eos> I can't imagine what You're going through, but you'll be back to work before you know it.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> If I can clear an Internal Affairs homicide inquest.<eos> Plus or minus a psych evaluation.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> And when we got there, there were these people.<eos> Are you all right?
I will figure this out.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Hey, Stan.<eos> - Uh, I'm late for a meeting.<eos> All right, maybe find me later?<eos> About what, exactly?<eos> I've got a few more questions about Nina.<eos> What is with you?<eos> I don't know, Stan.<eos> There was something going on with you and Nina.
I appreciate it.<eos> But I'm pretty sure he'd want you to hang on to this stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You meant so much to him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, how are you holding up?<eos> I wish I could say I was keeping it together, but it hasn't been easy.<eos> You must really miss him.<eos> Especially since Branch just started working with you.

Actually, Ferg, you stay here.<eos> Tell the applicants I'm sorry to cut things short.<eos> I'll see them at the shooting range.<eos> How is he?<eos> Bullet passed underneath his left clavicle.<eos> He's lost a lot of blood, but all things considered, he's a lucky guy.<eos> Where's his wife, Brandi?<eos> Didn't know he had a wife.<eos> - Sheriff, we got to go.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
street value.<eos> Each one of those cases of pseudoephedrine could be worth tens of thousands of dollars.<eos> What did you find at the crime scenes?<eos> Found some slugs at the warehouse and at Greg Collette's home.<eos> I figure we should run ballistics on all of them.<eos> Even though the robbery at the Collette home looks like a random smash-and-grab, I decided to make some calls on Greg Collette anyway, see if he has any enemies or any recent run-ins.<eos> - Is that why you brought Travis in?<eos> - Uh... no.<eos> Uh... he brought himself in.<eos> Said he wanted to talk to you in private.
Unless one of our shooting victims can give us an I.D.<eos> Greg.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Are they taking half-decent care of you in here?<eos> Uh, no complaints so far, you know.<eos> Uh... [clears throat]<eos> Marc, this is Sheriff Walt Longmire, who I was telling you about.<eos> Sheriff, this is my friend Sergeant Marc Van Zandt.<eos> Actually, it's retired Sergeant Van Zandt.<eos> Nice to meet you, Sheriff.
What are you doing here?<eos> My new boss, Malachi, generously offered my catering services.<eos> What is your excuse?<eos> I'm here on business.<eos> I hoped this day would never come, for Martha's sake.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> [horn honks]<eos> [indistinct conversations]<eos> Put it on my bill. [laughs]<eos> Hey, I'm gonna have to catch up with you later.
She knew everywhere we'd be stopping along the way.<eos> Well, does that sound like her?<eos> She was impulsive.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, she was great, but she wasn't like the rest of us.<eos> - How was she different?<eos> - She would just disappear, and then we'd get a postcard from, like, Turkey or Uganda or some random place.<eos> She brought a guy back once.<eos> He didn't speak any English, and he was just really weird.<eos> I don't really know how to explain it, other than she just didn't think about the consequences of her actions.<eos> So, it's possible that she got on a bus and, uh, followed you here, picked up a stranger on the way?
I am so sorry.<eos> It's funny.<eos> When Hector asked if I knew about the Bear Helper, I thought he was talking about the story.<eos> But he was talking about you.<eos> Who's the Bear Helper?<eos> A long time ago, a Cheyenne woman and her child were fleeing from Crow warriors.<eos> It was winter, so they were alone and scared.<eos> And she became more afraid when... when she noticed a bear was following her.<eos> But then the bear said to the woman,<eos> "I am following you to cover your tracks with mine so the Crow will not find you."
- Hey, man.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We, uh, need to report something.<eos> Crime report?<eos> Not really.<eos> We just, uh, saw something while we were out hunting.<eos> You can take this one.<eos> Come in, guys.<eos> All right, take a seat.<eos> Be right with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I tried to stop them.<eos> Gab didn't run away.<eos> She was kidnapped.<eos> Linda found this ransom note in her mailbox this morning.<eos> It says that Gab will only be released if all rape charges against those oil workers are dropped.<eos> I ran to May's to get her to drive me here.<eos> Please, Sheriff.<eos> Please find my daughter.<eos> Ms. Langton, Vic will stay with you in case they try to contact you again.
!<eos> I'm getting photos that we can show our next victim so she can identify her rapist, 'cause I know it's gonna happen again.<eos> And I know it's gonna be one of you assholes.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> So, what happened out there, Ferg?<eos> Sheriff...<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Completely.<eos> You didn't deserve that, especially given all the good you do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, Sheriff.<eos> Do you want an apology receipt or something?<eos> Mr. Hoyt?<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I need to talk to you about your son, Peter.
Hm.<eos> About the Res...<eos> Yep.<eos> Mathias.<eos> We got to call him, smooth things over.<eos> Well, Mr. Simic didn't want to talk to me, but apparently he had quite a bit to say to Archer here.<eos> I know where to get another car.<eos> Where?<eos> Follow me.<eos> I thought we had a deal, me and you.
Because they exist and they're convenient.<eos> I like not getting phone calls.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Do you have any idea how many messages I've left with Ruby?<eos> A couple.<eos> I can see how hard you're working to find who killed my man.<eos> Shot, you mean.<eos> No, killed.<eos> He coded upstairs ten minutes ago.<eos> Was there anybody with you?
The Attorney General, David Rosen.<eos> And these agents are here to question Phillip Durant, the man you picked up last night.<eos> Then I imagine they'll have a few questions for you.<eos> We found him at a convenience store, buying lottery tickets.<eos> I guess he was feeling lucky.<eos> - I don't believe this.<eos> - You don't want to talk, that's fine.<eos> We'll use your friend Phillip's testimony.<eos> - This is over.<eos> - God, what the hell is it with you people?
Questioning my authority was not his right!<eos> His blood is not on my hands!<eos> It's just... I can't believe I'm really here, the Oval Office.<eos> I still feel that way, every day.<eos> Me too.<eos> It's kind of smaller than I thought it would be, though studies have shown people actually were smaller back when the White House was built.<eos> Researchers have discovered that the average height of an American soldier during the revolutionary war was about 5'7", though Thomas Jefferson was 6'2".<eos> Susan, do you know why you're here?<eos> I think I can guess, which is why I brought the presentation materials on my vaccination proposal.<eos> I also had a few thoughts on tax reform that I'd love to discuss with you, but we don't have to do it all tonight.
What?<eos> The president is asking you to be his new vice president.<eos> Why?<eos> "Why?"<eos> I'm a terrible choice.<eos> I just got elected.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> This town has a way of taking people and turning them into politicians.<eos> I don't want a politician.<eos> But if I were the vice president and then something happened to you...
That's mildly disturbing.<eos> I'm not looking to start anything.<eos> Folks, just let me talk to my nephew.<eos> - Shay, what are you doing here?<eos> - Crash, stay there.<eos> Crash, you're bothering these nice people.<eos> Let's get your things.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Crash, you should get inside now.<eos> He's not going with you.
Taylor...<eos> None of these people have anywhere else they need to be tonight.<eos> Carter, I need to do this now, by myself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, I'm sorry.<eos> My year's allowance will go towards buying you a new phone.<eos> You know...<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I was due for an upgrade.<eos> All right, Kyle's gonna drive me to work and you might see me after school, but it's your dad's night tonight, okay?
No, I get it.<eos> We understand that you're frustrated and you have every right to be.<eos> I, um...<eos> I haven't been doing a very good job lately.<eos> I know that it was hard to learn that I was staying at Kyle's, and I'm sorry.<eos> But we are going to make sure, going forward, that things are better for you.<eos> All right.<eos> So do you have anything you'd like to talk about?<eos> Patricia always says that I should...<eos> Be open and honest with you guys.
- What is all that?<eos> - What?<eos> I like to be prepared.<eos> For what?<eos> The apocalypse?<eos> They say it might rain.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> You guys ready to hit the road?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> We're escaping the rat race with you.
What's the hurry?<eos> Crash is leaving, maybe for good.<eos> (Elizabeth) Hey. - Did... did Carter just leave?<eos> - Yeah. - (David) When is she coming home?<eos> - No idea.<eos> Sweetheart, what's going on with you two?<eos> I saw it last night, I'm seeing it right now.<eos> Nothing, we're fine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - What's up with you guys?
Crash is leaving, maybe for good.<eos> (Elizabeth) Hey. - Did... did Carter just leave?<eos> - Yeah. - (David) When is she coming home?<eos> - No idea.<eos> Sweetheart, what's going on with you two?<eos> I saw it last night, I'm seeing it right now.<eos> Nothing, we're fine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - What's up with you guys?<eos> We wanted to talk to all of you at the same time.
This is about a guy with a grudge.<eos> A very dangerous guy.<eos> I have to know I did my best for you.<eos> You've always done your best for me.<eos> Wow.<eos> It appears that...<eos> Excuse me. I'm looking for Detective Wells.<eos> Oh, well, I'm her boss.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Nice to meet you.
You don't have to explain.<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> What you said earlier,<eos> I couldn't stop thinking about it.<eos> What's that?<eos> "Some men don't deserve to be walking the earth."<eos> Ma'am...<eos> We have to put you in lockup until we can get you in front of a judge.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'd be happy to wait with you, if you want.
That pimp from Cicero?<eos> About a year ago, I borrowed some money from him just to get on my feet, and he said that he would do things to me and Johnny if I didn't pay.<eos> What do you owe?<eos> A lot.<eos> That your dinner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got to hurry.<eos> On my way to the library.<eos> I got to cram for this test.<eos> You all right, Sarge?
My husband is in a punk-rock band, and my mother doesn't approve... still.<eos> It's been eight years.<eos> Is... is he okay?<eos> He's back.<eos> His BP is not fluid-responsive.<eos> He's most likely bleeding inside.<eos> I need that ultr...<eos> Oh, God, it hurts!<eos> Tom, listen.<eos> We got you, okay?
What if he's doing the same thing now?<eos> Say something.<eos> Look, I've watched you two suck face for years.<eos> You've disgusted me for a long, long time.<eos> He's into you.<eos> And if a guy is still into you, it still means he wants to do you.<eos> And if he still wants to do you, you're solid.<eos> I don't know you as well as everyone else here, but I really need to tell you to stop talking now.<eos> I didn't want to say anything in the first place.<eos> Mer, I lived down the hall from you guys.
Here, talk to Bonnie.<eos> Yeah, hey, listen.<eos> Um...<eos> I'm at the clinic.<eos> I hurt my back. Doctor wants to give me pain pills.<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> Hi.<eos> No, she's not faking.<eos> Hang on.<eos> She wants to talk to you.
And he took my cat dragons!<eos> Blee. Here I am.<eos> Oh, phew. Blee.<eos> - Just kidding.<eos> - No!<eos> My cat dragons are gone. I must go get them.<eos> They are my children.<eos> They've suckled at my teats!<eos> Ew. (crowd murmuring)<eos> At least let our bravest knight go with you to assist Your Grace.
They've suckled at my teats!<eos> Ew. (crowd murmuring)<eos> At least let our bravest knight go with you to assist Your Grace.<eos> Meow.<eos> My Lady Gayle.<eos> Knight Louise, this is my fight. I cannot risk your life.<eos> But I can.<eos> Plus, I really dislike Lindaryen.<eos> She's a tyrant who punishes children unjustly for doing hilarious pranks.<eos> I swear my service and my steel to you.
And what point is that?<eos> If you drop any charges against Donna, we'll drop the lawsuit against you.<eos> Well, that's not a very even trade.<eos> I'm giving your client the chance to get away with murder.<eos> Last I checked, my client wasn't being charged with murder, and I don't need you to drop your suit, because you have no case.<eos> No case?<eos> Your client put a faulty train on those tracks, people died, and they knew it could happen the whole time.<eos> And you have no proof.<eos> And where I come from, you cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking.<eos> Then I guess we come from different places, because I didn't give that video to the district attorney to leverage you into a deal.
And I'm not putting it in your hands.<eos> And it's not your decision to make.<eos> No, it's not. It's Donna's.<eos> And she's sticking with me.<eos> Louis, please, I know that you want to help, but just go.<eos> - Mr. Jaworski.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My name is Mike Ross. I'm with Pearson Specter Litt.<eos> This is Rachel Zane. She's one of our associates.<eos> Sir, we'd like to speak with you about the accident.
We'll talk later.<eos> OK? Thanks.<eos> Finally I cracked and burst into his office to demand an explanation.<eos> I've no idea what you mean.<eos> Really I don't.<eos> Everything is perfectly normal.<eos> I'm doing my job, that's all.<eos> You must realise that I don't have time for your mood swings.<eos> It's true.<eos> What's wrong with you?
And again.<eos> - Turn round, please.<eos> - It hurts here.<eos> Right here.<eos> - Did you keep my last prescription?<eos> - Yes. - Could I see it?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> Here.<eos> Dr Thibault Béranger<eos> Are you OK, madam?
Right here.<eos> - Did you keep my last prescription?<eos> - Yes. - Could I see it?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> Here.<eos> Dr Thibault Béranger<eos> Are you OK, madam?<eos> Do you need help? Oh, dear...<eos> Do you want to get off?<eos> I'll get off with you.
What kind of work can I do in an office with no computer, without having been to any meetings, without having been copied in on any e-mail for over a month?<eos> - You don't know?<eos> - No.<eos> Nor do I. I'm going to ask Jacques Pelletier to come here, because he's my line manager.<eos> I'm going to tell him that you've come down, and I'm going to ask him to join us.<eos> Don't worry, Patricia, he never answers.<eos> But you'll see when you pass his office that he's there, and you'll understand the situation.<eos> Hold on. You never know.<eos> Jacques complained you'd been aggressive to him.<eos> He says it's become difficult to communicate with you, that you show strong signs of resistance, that you're not on-message with the direction of the team or the company.
Audrey, it's Thibault.<eos> I'm leaving Mrs Driesman.<eos> Her condition is worrisome.<eos> I've not been able to reach her son, but I've asked the lab to do a blood test.<eos> Can you tell me when the results are in?<eos> - OK.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> See you later.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> For things to get this out of control, there must have been something between you.
Yes, of course.<eos> When is convenient?<eos> The sooner the better.<eos> Does tomorrow work for you?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Where are you?<eos> In the 14th arrondissement, near Porte de Vanves.<eos> But I was wondering: are you the Mathilde Debord who wrote a series of articles in the group journal?<eos> Yes, that was me.<eos> Then I'm delighted to know you.
The loss of a manager would jeopardise the team.<eos> He refuses to contemplate your departure until a new recruit has been trained.<eos> In his view, no transfer can be considered for four to five months.<eos> Yes...<eos> Sorry, I've got another call.<eos> I'll stop by later. Don't do anything till I see you.<eos> See you later.<eos> Verbal aggression<eos> Intimidation<eos> Jacques, I need to talk to you.
Are we responsible for what happens to us?<eos> Do we always get what we deserve?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Do you think you can be a victim of something like this because you're weak, because deep down that's what you want?<eos> Do some people unwittingly mark themselves out as targets? No.<eos> I don't think so, no.<eos> I think it's your ability to resist that marks you out as a target.<eos> I've worked here for 20 years, Mathilde.<eos> It's not the first time I've encountered this kind of situation.<eos> You're not responsible for what's happening to you.
We in business, girl. I mean...<eos> Do you want the honeymoon or the presidential suite?<eos> I don't care, just as long as it has a tub.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm gonna take a bath!<eos> I'm gonna smell human again!<eos> Yeah, you stinky, girl.<eos> Like a dead alligator.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Hop to it, lady.<eos> He says he wants to talk to you, Father.
! Why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion?<eos> I think he is a sweet, sweet man.<eos> But when I kissed him on the forehead, it was not romantic.<eos> More like when Snow White kissed Dopey.<eos> Oh, no, no, not this comparison again.<eos> I'm sorry, Moe. I don't love you.<eos> But I really like you.<eos> Well, daughter, even though you have done nothing seriously wrong, first I will tear this contract one more time.<eos> And as for you, your punishment will be...<eos> Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?
And what does that get you?<eos> Hopefully, not a you.<eos> ♪ Not gonna make another Bart tonight ♪<eos> ♪ If I do it right, no more Barts tonight ♪<eos> ♪ No more Barts ♪<eos> ♪ Tonight... ♪<eos> ♪ No Barts!<eos> ♪<eos> And... done.<eos> Proud of you boys.
I understand that you're having a tsunami, but we need to talk.<eos> You call me when you get to higher ground.<eos> There's been a double-cross in hospice.<eos> They're coming after me now, my new relationships with Big Pharma, and I'm running the Barbet Anal Horn trials.<eos> It's...<eos> Oh God, I can't even breathe.<eos> I'm having trouble swallowing.<eos> Hi, it's Jenna James, eating crow.<eos> There is some secret settlement afoot.<eos> No, I can't meet you at the hospital.

Seriously?<eos> W-We're here for our patients, first.<eos> Man, I clean 20 behinds a day and wipe another 40.<eos> But just... don't y'all feel a little small in all this?<eos> Can...<eos> Can we just take the high road?<eos> Okay, well, we have a document.<eos> "AHW members have no contractual obligation" to handle any materials containing bodily fluids, such as urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, or semen."<eos> So that just... that seems open and shut to me.<eos> That was between you and the hospital, - that has nothing to do with us.
Hey, I'm not leaving you, okay?<eos> Burgess, you want to die with me, or do you want to live and bring these guys to justice?<eos> 'Cause I vote for plan number two.<eos> Now, go.<eos> He's gonna kill you...<eos> - I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - Roman...<eos> Go.<eos> So that's what you're doing.<eos> You gonna make me chase after you, huh?
In the distance, she heard the town crier.<eos> Hear ye.<eos> Hear ye!<eos> Mr. Franklin!<eos> Mr. Benjamin Franklin!<eos> At your service.<eos> Please. Don't be frightened.<eos> And I know this may sound odd, but I need to tell you that I'm from... from the future.<eos> Now, I'm sure that this scares you to your core, but you need to understand that I'm not here to harm you.<eos> In fact, I'm here to make love to you.
And then just before dinner, she asks you for a drink.<eos> Can I just nip to the loo?<eos> Midnight.<eos> Drink.<eos> You knew right then something was up.<eos> I imagine it wasn't long before she hinted at her true motive - her suspicion that you weren't her son.<eos> I lost the letter unfortunately.<eos> It was the Wellington Clinic, wasn't it?<eos> A ginormous wave of panic washed over you.<eos> All this time, all this work you put in, and she was onto you!
Is there one?<eos> You're forgetting what the largest sex organ on the human body is.<eos> The... penis?<eos> Well, I was gonna say vagina.<eos> I was gonna say Pam's vagina.<eos> Me too.<eos> The brain!<eos> Eww!<eos> Eww!<eos> Not like that-- what is wrong with you people?
Oh, you little-- [bardsley] I say!<eos> Pardon me, madam?<eos> Hello?<eos> Lana, hey.<eos> We were just...<eos> Not talking.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Already was, so--<eos> So, is it possible<eos> You two were followed here by mi-5?
No.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Then why would I?<eos> I should, if the situation arose.<eos> It makes no logical sense, but I wouldn't.<eos> This is getting us nowhere.<eos> The puncture wound to the lateral aspect of the femoral neck suggests the victim was injected.<eos> But the tox screen came back negative.<eos> We should check again because I'm obviously seeing things incorrectly or not seeing them at all.<eos> You mean the situation with me and Jake and Lance and you and your baby and Booth and love and death?
I'm sorry, Gwennie.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> We'll get through it, baby.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I think I know this guy.<eos> He's the personal injury attorney on TV.<eos> You're right that's uh...<eos> The Pitbull.<eos> You been in an accident?
Rowena?<eos> What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did i say "nice girl"?<eos> I meant "evil skank."<eos> [ chuckles ] you say that like it's an insult.<eos> But nice girls, they're pathetic.<eos> Here's to evil skanks.<eos> Whoa, fellas.<eos> What did she do to you?
Hi, sweetie.<eos> I'm Detective Pulaski. This is Detective Bose.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Good talk.<eos> We're coming in.<eos> - Listen up, scrubs...<eos> - Check out the matching footwear.<eos> This house sparkles by initiation, or God help you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We need to speak to you and your fellow UGG enthusiasts.
We think it might be hazing related.<eos> This is tragic news, but hazing is strictly prohibited by the Omegas and had nothing to do with Caroline's death.<eos> We'll make that call, thank you.<eos> - Now, if we can just...<eos> - Not unless you have a warrant, detectives.<eos> Are we gonna have a problem?<eos> Just, I'd hate for whatever Caroline was mixed up in to unfairly hurt the house.<eos> You have a dead pledge, and you're worried about bad publicity?<eos> I'm worried about false allegations.<eos> My girls aren't going to speak to you without an attorney.
Good.<eos> Mary Sibley will not see us coming.<eos> At last.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> And you... a heavenly creature to welcome me.<eos> It's just me... Dollie.<eos> What else but an Angel would risk all in a horrible place like this to sit vigil with a wretch like myself?<eos> Believe me, Isaac, I am not going anywhere.<eos> I will stay by your side.<eos> These past few days, Cotton, it's been such a comfort being with you.
You'd think I have everything... .. but take Henry away...<eos> I don't know, Crom.<eos> You're not without support, you know?<eos> Forgive my scepticism.<eos> I mean, you would have support... .. should you need it, against the Boleyns.<eos> Well, why should I need that?<eos> The Queen and I are perfect friends.<eos> Forgive my scepticism.<eos> This support...?<eos> Sir Nicholas Carew says he thinks... you're an easy fellow to get on with.
'Cause you can't take him to the ground unless you get ahold of him first.<eos> The truth hurts.<eos> And I watched the light go out of his eyes.<eos> Ezekiel:<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> - Is it dead?<eos> - Nope.<eos> But it's gonna wish it was.<eos> How do we know it's the real you?<eos> I didn't stay with you guys after Peru...
Oh, thank God.<eos> - Is it dead?<eos> - Nope.<eos> But it's gonna wish it was.<eos> How do we know it's the real you?<eos> I didn't stay with you guys after Peru...<eos> Because I didn't know if I could get the job done.<eos> And I didn't want you to see me fail.<eos> The truth binds it.<eos> I didn't stay with you after Peru because I wanted to prove that I could do it alone.

Very well, I offer you this treaty.<eos> Return the watch to me and I give you my word, I shall quit this field of battle.<eos> You're Moriarty.<eos> Why should I trust your word?<eos> If you won't trust my word, Duchess, trust my self-interest.<eos> I dare not return to Prospero without Ariel.<eos> His wrath would be fearsome, even for me.<eos> He holds my book and can destroy me if he so wishes.<eos> Give me the watch, and I can return to him freely.<eos> Deny it to me, and I'll have to fight you for it.
Of course I do, Flynn.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> Aah!<eos> Uh, okay, we gotta get you back to the Library.<eos> Come on.<eos> - It's the last one.<eos> - Yes, but... this is moronic.<eos> - You can't all stay.<eos> - I offered to go.<eos> Problem with you lot is...
Go.<eos> And doctors confirmed your son's gonna be okay.<eos> Sorry, you're who again?<eos> We're the Librarians.<eos> We're following up on a story that the paper's doing on your son.<eos> Oh. Librarians are so helpful.<eos> Yeah, Curt never touched drugs a day in his life.<eos> He was completely focused on school and sports.<eos> He was going for a footballer scholarship, he was.<eos> And you're saying he was here in the diner with you all night?
- I haven't worked in years...<eos> - Oh!<eos> There he is.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> - Cassandra!<eos> Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!<eos> - Huh?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hello, I believe the lady would like to speak with you.
Ana?<eos> Ana Marcovic?<eos> You're here for the hostel, right?<eos> We're supposed to pick you up.
Really?<eos> You were waiting for me?<eos> I wasn't bored, you know.<eos> I read, I chatted with some friends...<eos> I drank too.<eos> You seem surprised.<eos> It's true.<eos> I had given myself a week.<eos> - "A week"?<eos> - Yes, to bump into you.
Someone's waiting, didn't you know?<eos> Have you been here long?<eos> I'm going to the countryside tomorrow.<eos> Would you care to join me?<eos> "Tomorrow"?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> We could push it back.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Listen, Marianne.<eos> I'll be alone and I want to see you.
Class should be starting.<eos> Join me, fellow travelers, as we embark on a voyage of self-discovery.<eos> Please welcome your spiritual captain Felix Unger.<eos> (whooping) Where's Dante?<eos> Okay, Dante is at his cousin's commitment ceremony in Paramus.<eos> So I have the privilege of teaching you today.<eos> Okay.<eos> A couple of good spots have opened up, uh...<eos> Now, as some of you may know, I recently went through a pretty painful divorce, but it was yoga that got me through it.<eos> It got me out of my spiral, let me release my anger and become the totally centered man you see before you today.
Come on, somebody's got to have some love for this town.<eos> What about you, kindly gentleman?<eos> Tell us your story. Well, I was born and raised in the Bronx.<eos> Spent 40 years on Wall Street to support my passion.<eos> Which was...?<eos> Flashing.<eos> I... I-I'm sorry?<eos> I was a flasher.<eos> Doesn't anybody remember flashing anymore?<eos> What's wrong with you people?
That means Henry wasn't selling drugs.<eos> He was planting them.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> Is there a connection between Henry and Wadlow?<eos> Not that we could find.<eos> Where's Wadlow now?<eos> Central booking, waiting arraignment for felony distribution charges.<eos> Who the hell is Henry Graham?<eos> Come on, Mr. Wadlow.<eos> I've got detectives digging into your life looking for ties between the two of you.
And I worked with him, so maybe someone was out for revenge.<eos> Word is your testimony is gonna put Barry away.<eos> Maybe he wants to keep you from talking.<eos> Barry wouldn't do that to me.<eos> We had a bond.<eos> Do you want to bond with me, Lieutenant?<eos> I like your tie.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> So I think that lady's taken a shine to you, boss.
Relief?<eos> Well, that means Barry's not after me.<eos> See, I knew he wouldn't betray me.<eos> Oh, you and Madden had a thing.<eos> Mm-mm.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> You don't want to testify.<eos> Where's all the money hidden?<eos> If I knew, would I be hanging out with you two?
Dad!<eos> Looks like you had a rough night.<eos> Wow, you really know how to make a girl feel good.<eos> Thanks, Al.<eos> - Hey, Carrie.<eos> - Hey, Denny.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> You look a little, I don't know, you look a little tired.<eos> Okay, what is it with you two?
It was jazz, you know?<eos> I had to get close to that.<eos> I didn't mean to break his heart.<eos> That's why his plane took off.<eos> He was in love.<eos> I told him we'd never work, but he believed love always wins.<eos> Who killed him?<eos> Stella, if Davis meant anything to you, help us nail his killer.<eos> I can't.<eos> If he finds out I even talked to you...
I bet you are, Denny.<eos> Well, it is very refreshing.<eos> Listen, I want you to have Delina do a skin scrape of his face and his neck.<eos> Your body scrape request is my command.<eos> Step away from the body.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Easy, easy, Drew.<eos> Detective Wells, I'm Sandra Russo, your new captain.<eos> I have heard so much about you, and it is such a pleasure for me to meet you.

And what are your favorite spots?<eos> Well, Musée Rodin and that little carousel at the base of the Eiffel Tower.<eos> I think it's very charming.<eos> Touristy, but charming.<eos> Do you have a favorite restaurant?<eos> La Fontaine de Mars.<eos> - You know Paris very well.<eos> - I love Paris.<eos> Oh, I really should go.<eos> My sister is going to be furious, but I want to meet with you afterwards.
And don't take the nighttime stuff before the interview or you'll be loopy.<eos> I don't have a cold.<eos> We're going now.<eos> Thank you for doing this, Mr. Prady.<eos> Thank you for having me.<eos> I-I, it's a, it's good to finally get down to the substance of this campaign.<eos> Actually, who had a lot to do with my thinking about the, uh, the S.A. office was Alicia Florrick.<eos> That you'll have to explain.<eos> My campaign manager is not gonna be happy.<eos> Uh, I'm supposed to say "opponent," not her name, but, uh, somehow I think you won't be tricked by that.
Marissa, have you been out here the whole time?<eos> It hasn't been the whole time.<eos> Just half an hour.<eos> In case you needed anything.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Out. I need some fresh air.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I need to focus.<eos> I can't focus in there.<eos> - I'll come with you.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a Machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.<eos> Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.<eos> You will never find us.<eos> But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.<eos> Professor Whistler.<eos> Beth Bridges.<eos> Hello!<eos> I- - I've been eager to meet you.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.<eos> Professor Whistler.<eos> Beth Bridges.<eos> Hello!<eos> I- - I've been eager to meet you.<eos> You're sure you installed it in her computer?<eos> Quite sure.<eos> Elizabeth Bridges.<eos> Samaritan is becoming very interested in her algorithms.<eos> We're very eager to meet you.
Oh, I'd like that.<eos> I promise to tease you about precautionary principles all night.<eos> Iris... uh, Dr. Campbell.<eos> Detective Riley.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Sure, you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well-- I just--<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you, actually, about our therapy sessions.
Not bad.<eos> I know.<eos> John!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Ms. Wells!<eos> I'm Mr. Worthy.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Oh, good, you're up!<eos> It's a shame Ray wasn't in that car, Ms. Wells.<eos> Here I was following you all day and you let that girl Athena trick you.
Okay, Frankie.<eos> You want Pratt dead.<eos> And you've got good reason.<eos> But he's gonna go to jail for a long, long time.<eos> So... no killing.<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> To save the girl's life. I know it's not what you want, but it's what I'm asking of you.<eos> All right!<eos> Nice doing business with you.
I'm telling you right now: you did not kill that woman.<eos> Uh, Mrs. Sandoval?<eos> Hi, I'm Joan Watson.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Um, the detectives from the 35th told you about me.<eos> And your partner.<eos> I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> I can imagine how difficult this week has been for you, but<eos> I promise you I am only here because I want to help find the person who killed your sister.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.
What are you saying?<eos> That this was some sort of cover-up?<eos> Well, if there was, it would be a turn up for us.<eos> Conspiracies are fraught.<eos> One secret versus many keepers.<eos> There'd be no shortage of new leads.<eos> You were gonna let him do it, weren't you?<eos> Maria's brother-- you were gonna let him hit you with that wrench.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The councilman will see you now.
I spent a lot of late nights here during the campaign.<eos> I'd see her when she'd come in to clean, and she'd ask how I was holding up.<eos> When...<eos> Maria was reported missing,<eos> I'd hoped that she'd just gone back to her country, but...<eos> I'd been around too many cops for too many years to really believe that.<eos> It's our understanding that one of your reelection team was briefly considered a suspect.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just...<eos> I've been advised not to talk to you.
The inlay on the buttons is rather distinctive.<eos> I've seen it recently.<eos> I believe I know who's behind all of this.<eos> Councilman Barclay, Tommy Gregson.<eos> We met at a fund-raiser a few years ago?<eos> Ah, of course.<eos> It's great to see you again.<eos> This is Detective Bell, and, uh, you know Ms. Watson.<eos> There have been some new developments in Maria's case.<eos> We were hoping we could discuss them with you.
He's almost got him.<eos> PARKER: Cardinal engaged.<eos> Waiting on a clear shot.<eos> Sir, he's not in distress.<eos> He didn't say "Alamo".<eos> Let's see how this plays out.<eos> JEFF: You don't know what you want.<eos> You had us all come out here, and now you just want to open up the gate and let everyone off to damnation?<eos> Jeffrey, we are just talking.<eos> He's turning you.
That may be the truth, but they're never gonna hear it from me.<eos> I'm afraid they just did.<eos> Hi, Charles.<eos> Sean Cahill.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm the guy from the SEC that isn't in your pocket.<eos> I asked Sean to follow Woodall.<eos> Couldn't. No authorization.<eos> But I had no problem getting authorization to follow you.
Yes, but I also have a butt full of...<eos> principles! Oh!<eos> So, yeah, you guys defeat Sheldon, and I'll just work on my upper-body strength, do some pull-ups, and I'll be out of here in no time.<eos> I can't... do even one!<eos> You're incredible, Bob.<eos> Time for the... Sky-sassin.<eos> Luckily, I have my Sky-sassin-assin!<eos> I'll go get it.<eos> Well, I'll wait for you.<eos> What is wrong with you hobbyists?
Is it fair I'm here for a licence? You could have killed people.<eos> 4 grammes, Didier.<eos> Do you realise what that is?<eos> I'll get out early.<eos> I'm getting an early release.<eos> I'll be out at Christmas.<eos> Annette...<eos> It's hard here.<eos> I think only of being out.<eos> I think only of seeing you.
Burpees.<eos> Burpees?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Burpees.<eos> You're joking.<eos> Does this look like my joking face?<eos> Do you even have a joking face?<eos> You want me to do bu...?<eos> So you want me to get down here on the ground right now and do some burpees?<eos> I would never do that to you.
Wow, so much for interagency cooperation.<eos> Well, we gave it the old college try.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Find her.<eos> Get Nell and Eric to help you if you have to.<eos> Don't let her out of your sights until she gives you a full debriefing.<eos> On it.<eos> Got it.<eos> Agent Cornell.<eos> We're not finished with you.
From him, it's a term of affection.<eos> Go.<eos> Eric, we've got Abdul.<eos> Send an ambulance.<eos> Copy that, Callen.<eos> Where are the hostages?<eos> Got a family.<eos> Clear!<eos> We're federal agents.<eos> You're gonna be fine, okay?
I hear the DEA offered you an extension on your visa.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm a lucky man.<eos> It's a great opportunity.<eos> Continue your training, spend a little time in the land of the free, home of the brave.<eos> Yes.<eos> I also heard you turned it down.<eos> I'm grateful for what you and your country have done for me and my people.<eos> But it's time for me to go home.<eos> It was an honor meeting you, Sam.

But why the alarm?<eos> A coincidence, a distraction?<eos> Was it the killer?<eos> All possible, Florence.<eos> ALL possible.<eos> But whichever it is, it still doesn't explain how the killer managed to gain entry to the corridor in the first place.<eos> And you definitely didn't see anyone?<eos> We sat right there.<eos> A clear sightline to the door.<eos> And was Erol with you the whole time?
Please, do sit down.<eos> As you're all aware, Jack Harmer was murdered this morning in his cell.<eos> We believe that he was killed at some point between 9.47 and 9.53am.<eos> There's a six-minute window when courthouse security was breached.<eos> Mrs Harmer, do you remember where you were at this time?<eos> I was outside, I think.<eos> Did you talk to anyone?<eos> See anyone?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Pastor Mason, when I spoke to you this morning, you were out in the main entrance area.
Well done, Dwayne.<eos> ~ 'Thank you, Chief!<eos> ' ~ Have it biked to forensics and see if it matches the bullet that killed Jack.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> An ale.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm not sure tying my shoelaces constitutes a crime, Inspector.<eos> Gosh, one would hope not.<eos> We'd never stop.<eos> No, I'm more interested in what's next to you.
What is it?<eos> I'm not sure tying my shoelaces constitutes a crime, Inspector.<eos> Gosh, one would hope not.<eos> We'd never stop.<eos> No, I'm more interested in what's next to you.<eos> I'm not sure I understand.<eos> My officers recovered something from the courthouse.<eos> It was inside the air-conditioning unit.<eos> It was a gun.<eos> There's no-one else near you.
I mean, it's a complicated case, no doubt, but...<eos> I'm not talking about the case, Inspector.<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> Right, I see.<eos> We're in the midst of a murder enquiry, our reputation's at stake and you want to up and leave?<eos> I don't want to leave.<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> According to your father, ~ .. you're considering your pos...<eos> ~ Sorry, what?<eos> My father's spoken to you?
'And when the alarm sounded... '.. he burst the bag.<eos> 'Simple.<eos> 'Effective.<eos> 'Deceptive.'<eos> He's dead!<eos> 'But he wasn't dead, was he?<eos> 'He was laying in wait for his chance to escape.'<eos> This is just nonsense.<eos> And the plan was for Jack to rise from the dead.<eos> He'd then appear to overpower you and flee to the waiting car, to the marina, to freedom.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a Machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
- He's dead.<eos> - Nowhere to run, right?<eos> Samaritan's cut the security feeds from the entire cell block.<eos> It doesn't want anyone to see what's about to happen.<eos> Where are you, Mr. Reese?<eos> - Whoa! Cool, man.<eos> - Hey, all right.<eos> You've been granted early release.<eos> I got him.<eos> Samaritan is surely coming for you.
So Samaritan found something that the Machine would never detect.<eos> Khan's software.<eos> Installed in every network device.<eos> Means and an access already in place.<eos> It was a brilliant stratagem, really.<eos> This program, running in the background of your computer, checking every file.<eos> But instead of viruses, Samaritan was using it to search for the Machine.<eos> Did it find the Machine's location?<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Khan.
I know it.<eos> You said it yourself: 70% of female murder victims are killed by men they know.<eos> Not this one.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This'll end poorly.<eos> Mr. Ross?<eos> -Who are you?<eos> -My name is kirsten clark.<eos> -Are you a cop?<eos> -I want to talk to you about lilly.
Alright, you two.<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> (stammers) She's interrogating the witness.<eos> She gonna compromise the whole case.<eos> I'm just trying to help you.<eos> You want to help me?<eos> Find the man who killed my wife.<eos> -Scott.<eos> -No!<eos> I am done talking to you without a lawyer.
Totally.<eos> Oh my god, i'm so sorry i didn't see your text sooner.<eos> Oh, it's fine.<eos> It's not like we were held at gunpoint or anything.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Look, it's my fault.<eos> We were hooking up the stereo.<eos> We were totally hooking up...<eos> The stereo.<eos> What's going on with you two?
- I think you're wrong.<eos> This is a picture of Ed and my mother.<eos> Who's been ripped out of the photo?<eos> Impersonating a police officer.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> He's innocent.<eos> I feel it. That's what I'm worried about.<eos> Stitching affects you. It makes you different for a little bit.<eos> It doesn't always last, but sometimes people get hurt.<eos> What's going on with you two?
I'm here meeting my ex-husband.<eos> You should let your Lieutenant know that he can't be making out with the chief's ex, or Pridgen will destroy him.<eos> Help me keep an eye on Lieutenant Casey.<eos> That's not how we do things here.<eos> I'll make it worth your while.<eos> I apologize for keeping you waiting.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> What all have you been told?<eos> Just that it was urgent, and I needed to come in person.<eos> Well... you were contacted because we've suffered a security glitch.
Oh, I knew I heard your voice.<eos> Oh, Meg. Oh.<eos> Oh... Oh, no, I'm not Meg.<eos> My good Lord, you're finally home.<eos> And you look so sharp in your uniform.<eos> And who is this handsome young man?<eos> I'm her partner, Jamie.<eos> Well, hi.<eos> I'm-I'm Meg's aunt, Beth.<eos> Nice to meet you.
I run a small operation here, and I like to keep things simple.<eos> Everything that comes in goes straight out to the families.<eos> What's in the boxes?<eos> Energy-efficient lightbulbs.<eos> We solicit by phone for Local Heroes.<eos> The lightbulbs are all donated.<eos> The 100% profit we make goes directly into the fund for distribution.<eos> Where do you get your manpower?<eos> They're fulfilling their community service requirements for their schools.<eos> Mm-hmm. You know, Commissioner, I've always wanted to meet you.
What'd she say?<eos> She asked me to call Ms. Reagan, but she's in court.<eos> Figured you were the next best thing.<eos> Good call.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Room on the right.<eos> Morgan.<eos> Detective Reagan.<eos> I'm Erin's brother.<eos> I wanted you to know we got the guy who did this to you.
Councilwoman.<eos> Councilwoman-- do you think you could help me get some traction with these people?<eos> Oh, funnily enough, I have a charity event tomorrow with other high-powered L.A. women.<eos> I'll put a word in with Yowtz. Martha Yowtz?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The lioness of Los Angeles education?<eos> The straw that stirs the school board's drink?<eos> That's right.<eos> That is a woman I'd like to get to know.<eos> Is there any way I could come with you to this event?
And we've got about four hours to be "ls."<eos> - Or...?<eos> - We isn't.<eos> All right, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this,<eos> I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.<eos> - How do you know -- - How do you know that --<eos> Whatever your asking me, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go.<eos> Huh, what do you know. It's working.<eos> - Ow, ow, ow! - Oh shit.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two?
Now, as President Grant said, I don't have a long history in government, but what I do have is an abiding passion to solve problems and a fresh outlook on what Americans want from their government today.<eos> As the only single mother in congress,<eos> I have a unique perspective on what it's really like out there for millions of hard-working families.<eos> And as a tenured academic, I have the tools to analyze those challenges... - Nice work, Red...<eos> - And put real solutions in place.<eos> We might actually get through this.<eos> As my daughter, Casey, once told me...<eos> A little odd, isn't it, that I'm gonna tell you a cute, little story about my daughter when really... I-I mean she's a great kid, my Casey.<eos> But we are talking about the entire government of the United States of America, and this is... Real.<eos> And I'm s-standing here talking to you.
So, I must admit I'm a little disappointed by your behavior towards me.<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> Protect me?<eos> That's... that's awful.<eos> I thought you'd be brave.<eos> - Sue.<eos> - I thought you'd be adventurous, fearless, sexy, confident, but instead, you're just this dried-up prude who, instead of celebrating the fact that I fully own my body and use it however I want with whomever I want<eos> as many times in as many kinky ways as I want, you're shaking your finger at me?<eos> You're telling me to be afraid of what name someone's gonna call me just 'cause I had the audacity to have too much great sex, as if picking up a hot stranger in a bar for a dirty screw is a crime.<eos> What happened to you?
What do we know about Sue?<eos> About Sue's life?<eos> Let's get to know Sue.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> Where the hell you been? !<eos> Uh, I had to step out for an hour.<eos> Step out?<eos> How delightful.<eos> Did you indulge in a little spa retreat while I kept my eye on that coup-plotting Amazon Elizabeth North?<eos> I'm sorry to add to your woes, but there's something I need to warn you about.
Don't say that till you've seen it.<eos> Sally Langston... we're gonna need a bargaining chip.<eos> You went around my back to Mellie.<eos> I did.<eos> Nice move.<eos> Mrs. Vice President.<eos> Thank you for seeing me.<eos> No need to be so formal, Ms. Pope.<eos> It's just plain, old "Sally" now.<eos> - I'd like to talk to you about Sunday's guest.
Hyperion is calling about a book deal in five minutes.<eos> You should use this time wisely, Ms. Pope.<eos> You know what I do, so what do you want?<eos> Because this... this can't be it.<eos> You were almost the president of this country, and now you're signing up with the weekly gasbags?<eos> - It doesn't make sense.<eos> - I take offense to that, especially coming from a woman who's nothing but a shill for defilers and fornicators.<eos> During the election, polls had you ahead of Fitz on domestic issues.<eos> Family values... you demolished him.<eos> In fact, the only area he polled ahead of you was foreign policy.
Three.<eos> That's very impressive, Mr. Ambruso.<eos> - You...<eos> - Do they have to do that?<eos> They'll be wrapping up soon.<eos> It's for Cyrus' job.<eos> Yeah, I know what it's for.<eos> Everybody knows what it's for... everybody back home, the whole country.<eos> You two think you're getting away with something, - but we know what this is.<eos> - Okay, Vincent... now, we agreed to come here, Mr. Beene, but they're not paying us enough to have our picture taken with you two like we're okay with this.
- This was my moment.<eos> Maybe we can't use the wedding to launch your senate campaign, but your public support of your broken-hearted gay bestie will endear you to the northern Virginia liberals all the same.<eos> I think there's been a change of plans.<eos> There's been a change of plans, people.<eos> We're not throwing Michael under the bus.<eos> So, how do we stop Sally?<eos> Unless you're here to watch my interview in person, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> Jackie, if it's more than a minute, would you please call security?<eos> If you go ahead with this, try to take down Cyrus, I'll tell the world about another sham marriage... the one between you and Daniel Douglas.
- Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Aah, aah, aah. Okay, Naomi, try to take a nice, deep breath for me, please.<eos> I'm all she has.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, let's get her a chest tube.<eos> Is this baby she speaks of imaginary or real?<eos> Real. Very real.<eos> She's with Charlie.<eos> Naomi, I promise you, I'll stay with you, okay?
No, seriously, what were you thinking, just charging in there?<eos> I was thinking that she was gonna die while you're out there fiddling with your gear.<eos> It's protocol to protect yourself.<eos> Well... it's my job to protect the patient.<eos> He's been here all day.<eos> He's beating himself up for letting her go to Africa on her own.<eos> Maybe he'll make it up to her.<eos> Well, let's hope he gets the chance.<eos> Tom, Tom, listen to me.<eos> You are going to be okay, all right?
- He can't tolerate the E.T. tube.<eos> I'll restrain him.<eos> I'll restrain him.<eos> No, you won't. It's a medical issue.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> - Dr. Curtis?<eos> - On it.<eos> Next. Next.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Come on. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
Really?<eos> That was your first guess?<eos> Yeah, I was giving Andy a juice box.<eos> Mm.<eos> Not to drink -- because I'm a man.<eos> Okay, so, I'm gonna go get a dress and some shoes from Gloria's closet.<eos> What happened to your shoes?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been watching the two of you, and it's pretty obvious.
This is where you girls saw your first movie.<eos> Halfway through "Hare-abian Nights,"<eos> I looked over, and your little heads were pressed together like the cutest teepee ever.<eos> And where was I during all of this family fun?<eos> Buddy, the three of us were having a girls' day.<eos> You get it.<eos> This way.<eos> Over here by the screen.<eos> So...<eos> While I was still building this place, I snuck back here with you guys after work one day, and...
One time my dad said, "nice game, kid."<eos> I had eye black streaming down my cheeks, but all I get is, "okay, then"?<eos> I mean, i-i probably don't say it as much as I should, but I'm proud of you, kid.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Jay?<eos> - Hey, Dan!<eos> Gee, I didn't think you'd show up in person.<eos> Claire, this is the big cheese, Dan Signer.<eos> Hi, Mr. Signer.<eos> Such a pleasure to meet you.
Oh!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause they don't seem like they fit right.<eos> Um...<eos> I think it's a bold step, and I support you in your journey of self-improvement.<eos> No, you're not getting your hair straightened.<eos> You know your dad wishes he could be here.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm right here!<eos> I had Andy set me up so I could be here with you all.
I just had to plug him in.<eos> It was a nice reversal from when I had to pull the plug on my dad in the hospital.<eos> While he was away on a business trip,<eos> Phil got a terrible ear infection, and the doctors said he could burst an eardrum if he flew.<eos> I was devastated to miss Alex's graduation, until I realized I didn't have to.<eos> I got to hold up my phone for two hours so Phil could see the graduation live.<eos> Bet I was the only dad there not wearing pants.<eos> How great is this thing, huh?<eos> It's so convenient.<eos> It's like I'm right there in the room... with you guys.
Emergency!<eos> What is happening?<eos> Power is fluctuating!<eos> No.<eos> This cannot be correct.<eos> How can this be?<eos> Generations of Daleks just woke up very cross, and they're coming up the pipes.<eos> Or to put it another way... bye!<eos> Doctor, you must help me.<eos> Can I just say, it's been an absolute pleasure to finally meet you?
We're not moving.<eos> Yeah, safety feature.<eos> It did this to me after the last earthquake.<eos> The last earthquake?<eos> I did a lot of research about Seattle before I moved out here.<eos> Earthquakes were never mentioned.<eos> They don't happen too often.<eos> Only when you ride in elevators, apparently.<eos> Apparently.<eos> Remind me not to ride in an elevator with you again.
He didn't even want to go.<eos> Okay, why don't you and your mom go wait in the waiting room, please?<eos> - She's not my mom.<eos> - Yet.<eos> We're engaged.<eos> Brian thought we should take a family ski trip.<eos> Of course, we always do what Brian wants to do.<eos> - Shut your face.<eos> - Shut your face.<eos> Why don't we all shut our faces and let us figure out what's wrong with you guys, okay?
- I know.<eos> You... You - You...<eos> You're not mad? Never.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't ever have to apologise to me.<eos> OK?<eos> Come here.<eos> Hello.<eos> You've reached Ida and Arthur - or, should I say, Arthur and Ida.<eos> I'm afraid we can't talk right now, so if you'd like to leave a message, we'll talk to you as soon as we can.
He came home for the weekend.<eos> It was Sarah's birthday.<eos> And you haven't had any contact since then?<eos> - A few texts, maybe. - But nothing more?<eos> You know what they're like at that age.<eos> - Don't touch that! - Sorry.<eos> Sarah, for God's sake.<eos> Do you know any of Josh's friends from university?<eos> He didn't really talk about them.<eos> If you like, Mr. and Mrs. Tate, we can arrange for one of our officers to come and stay with you.
But I quit competitions a while ago.<eos> How come?<eos> At the international competition in London 15 years ago,<eos> I was a disaster on the Fantaisie-Impromptu.<eos> And since then I've been terrified of juries.<eos> I get panic attacks.<eos> Hey, even the greatest get panic attacks.<eos> It's normal.<eos> And you too?<eos> You get them often?
Just one rule: Shhh!<eos> That's very good, Juliette.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> There you are.<eos> The cep risotto's good!<eos> - And with four cheeses?<eos> - Delicious!<eos> That's good, too.<eos> There's a new one: veal sausage!<eos> Same as you.
Sir?<eos> I'm not eating.<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> How much you need?<eos> Have a drink.<eos> I'm not thirsty.<eos> Sit down, I said. Just five minutes.<eos> So Myriam's just set up a company Doing smartphone games for 3-to 6-year-olds.<eos> And Artus has told me so much about you.<eos> I'd love to have you both. We could do great things together.
I mean...<eos> Okay.<eos> So, it's just me who doesn't understand?<eos> I invited you to dinner tonight So you could meet someone who means a lot to me.<eos> Who means a lot to you? Yes.<eos> He was my neighbor. And now he's more than a neighbor.<eos> You mean he's your guy?<eos> You could put it like that.<eos> In any event,<eos> Delighted to meet you.
- I thought it was a boy.<eos> - Cecil, no E. It's also for boys.<eos> Give me the anti-nausea pill.<eos> It'll make him come.<eos> When he gets here, I'll drink my glass and you can join your husband by midnight.<eos> What says I'm married?<eos> You don't choose earrings like that.<eos> Someone gives them to you.<eos> So, I'm saying... What do I know?<eos> In any case, tonight I'm here for you.
- Sorry? As if raising kids isn't selfish.<eos> Offing yourself is also selfish.<eos> You can't do that!<eos> I give the pills.<eos> In order.<eos> And I'm not giving you anything.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's strictly forbidden without a witness, and you know that.<eos> Hello again.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second, please?
Didn't I already tell you guys this kid's a jerkoff?<eos> And I think I said the kid was okay.<eos> Look, Terry, I'm not looking to rock the boat here.<eos> I know you say you had the talk with the kid, - and you think he's okay.<eos> - But you still have some concerns.<eos> No, I'm just saying we're not there yet.<eos> Yeah, there's too much at stake here, Terry.<eos> All right, why don't you take him to Harry Hardware's tonight?<eos> All right?<eos> I'll meet up with you guys afterwards.
Consider it a token of my appreciation.<eos> Hey, Bull.<eos> Good afternoon, Charlie.<eos> Hey, look who's here.<eos> The yankee clipper.<eos> Thought they would have transferred your ass by now.<eos> They must need you for the softball team, no?<eos> Eh, nice to see you, too, Hump.<eos> Captain.<eos> Talk to you now?
What kind of business?<eos> Well, he's been fronting a couple of bars.<eos> Uh... Bars for queers.<eos> And, uh, last night, we got raided by Terry Muldoon.<eos> You said "we."<eos> Are you involved in this, John?<eos> O-only because Rusty wanted me to, but I swear, I told him it was a very bad idea.<eos> Of course, Muldoon was asking who ran the place.<eos> Of course, I... I didn't tell him shit, but he knew it was Rusty, so I figured you'd want to know since they're gonna grab Rusty over this.<eos> But I just want to be clear with you, sir.
Would you care to elaborate on that?<eos> I don't want to hear about this imaginary war.<eos> In addition to everything else he's been up to, he's also got some action he's been hiding from us, and I suspect hiding from you.<eos> We busted a gay bar that he's fronting, and we know of two other spots he's got, and I know there must be some other shit that he's taken off the map.<eos> So before we bring him in, I figured, out of respect for you, I should come and let you know about it.<eos> You're wrong about one thing.<eos> I knew about the gay bars.<eos> I told Rusty that he had to talk to you about getting them on the list.<eos> And that was my mistake, I guess.<eos> I should have dealt with you personally on that.
You were one of those men that crazy serial killer took hostage.<eos> Is he watching us?<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will call the police.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Please stop!<eos> Don't call the police!<eos> - Sir?<eos> - No, please don't do that.<eos> Are you all right?
- No!<eos> On your knees.<eos> Hands behind your head.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is where I was held.<eos> You weren't the only one.<eos> This is where you killed your victims, isn't it?<eos> Apparently, I'll be going back to prison, where you two felons will be joining me.<eos> I'm calling this in.<eos> But first, I need to talk to you two alone.
Mama T.<eos> Terrence Combs was her son.<eos> Keep digging into Heller's case.<eos> See if NOPD missed anything.<eos> I'm heading to the Ninth Ward.<eos> I told that joker, "Step back, or you'll get a earful of Mama T."<eos> They cannot handle you, Mama T., they cannot handle you.<eos> Agent Pride.<eos> To what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> Wondering if I might have a word with you?
Why I can't find the Princess in her room?<eos> Well...<eos> Find her quick.<eos> What is it?<eos> Princess!<eos> Where did you go?<eos> It was hot in the room.<eos> So I went outside for a while.<eos> It is much cooler outside.<eos> What happen to you?
I thought you are heading to Yongman-gwan.<eos> Then?<eos> I want to go.<eos> The wedding convoy is leaving today.<eos> If not now, I may not see her again.<eos> Who do you mean?<eos> You know who.<eos> Sinyeo from the wedding convoy who was in the bird house.<eos> Sinyeo?<eos> Are we going to meet again after you leave?
Have you been paying attention to a word we've been saying?<eos> - Agent Keen will be charged--<eos> - The Major runs a finishing school.<eos> The most reputable of its kind.<eos> He recruits wayward children, orphans, delinquents, outcasts but only boys and girls of superior intelligence who exhibit very specific sociopathic tendencies.<eos> He then cultivates them into charming, well-educated cultured, attractive adults who are capable of dangerous and horrible things.<eos> - All that matters is Agent Keen.<eos> - Which is why we must find the Major.<eos> He and I had a rather significant falling out and I can't locate him which is why you need to put me in a room with the Malaysian deputy minister to the U.N.<eos> You want the FBI to invite a U.N. diplomat to meet with you?
Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must've known how strange all of this was.<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> - And yet you agreed to work with him.<eos> Well, he had intel.<eos> He said a girl was going to be taken, a general's daughter.<eos> We had to act.<eos> He would only talk to me--<eos> - Only you?
He told the deputy director that he had a list of criminals he could help us find.<eos> - That was only the first.<eos> - The first what?<eos> - Name on the list.<eos> - He told us if we cut him a deal that he could help us capture the kinds of criminals the FBI can't find...<eos> - ...because we don't know they exist. - One day, we'll talk about this moment... - ...in front of a senate hearing.<eos> - Were you ordered to work with him?<eos> - No.<eos> - And he couldn't force you?<eos> So I'm curious, if he knew nothing about you if his implications of some shared connection were false why did you continue?
Good to know.<eos> - $200,000.<eos> - Oh, come on, Nancy.<eos> Let me take it to my client.<eos> If he's the good cop, but she's the bad one, what does that make you two?<eos> - Give us time to talk to our client.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Be honest.<eos> The only reason that you're not going after the shooter is because he's broke.<eos> - We'll present the offer and get back to you.
Well, we didn't want to lose the gay vote and... besides, it makes you look weird.<eos> What person in this day and age takes Jesus Christ seriously when he says, "you can't divorce"?<eos> Not someone you want to get a beer with.<eos> You are...<eos> Better than I am.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> Well...<eos> It's been good fighting you.
They wanted to give money to this charity, and...<eos> There's a possibility that this charity...<eos> Might be connected to Hamas.<eos> So I was checking on it for him, that's all.<eos> - Why were you checking?<eos> - Because he asked me to and David Lee wouldn't.<eos> So I did.<eos> Oh, Alicia, you're being set up. - What?<eos> What are you...<eos> - This Canning guy is suing you, right?
- Anesthesia plus tremor meds.<eos> I was in a, in a, in a, in a fugue state!<eos> I can't... where, where, where's my money? !<eos> Right where it belongs.<eos> With David Lee.<eos> - Oh, thank God! - Hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going now.<eos> This was... great.<eos> Always fun talking to you.
Michael Osgood was home the night Katrin died.<eos> The pizza delivery and now Gary McCready give him an alibi.<eos> But Robbie wasn't there.<eos> His father lied about that.<eos> ~ Why?<eos> ~ You mean apart from the obvious?<eos> You know that hair they recovered from Katrin's body...<eos> Get on to the lab.<eos> See how hard it is to get DNA from a burnt corpse.<eos> On the night that Katrin died, you told us that Robbie was at home with you.
Come on.<eos> What's Hexton want with them?<eos> Mrs. Tate?<eos> I have some questions I need to ask you.<eos> - Is that you in the picture?<eos> - Where did you find that?<eos> That was taken in 1993, wasn't it?<eos> When you were a member of a group called Radical Action.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> And this man standing here beside you...
I lead, you listen.<eos> Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> Josh Tate's call records.<eos> He received 23 calls from you in the two weeks leading up to his death.<eos> What was so important?<eos> I wanted to meet up with my son.<eos> So why did it take 23 calls to arrange a meeting?<eos> He refused for the first 22.<eos> What happened with you and Josh at the cafe?
It's over.<eos> - Is my solicitor here yet?<eos> - We'll let you know when he arrives.<eos> This is Spencer Foster.<eos> He's been arrested in connection with the murder of Josh Tate.<eos> Which is ridiculous.<eos> We need to take a DNA sample and your fingerprints.<eos> Why?<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Spencer, on the morning that Josh's body was found DS Cabott and DC Blackstone spoke to you. - Do you remember that?
We have the driver's details.<eos> We can check that for ourselves, thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell us about your mistake earlier?<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I... I absolutely should have done.<eos> - So why didn't you?<eos> - Because I was in shock.<eos> Did you see Josh the night he died?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did he contact you that night?
But you went back to Michael.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't go back for Michael.<eos> I went back for the boys.<eos> I did it for them.<eos> It's funny, if you'd said that back then I... I wouldn't have understood.<eos> But I do now.<eos> You kept Spencer in all night.<eos> When will he be released?<eos> Just as soon as we've spoken to you and your wife, Mr. Foster.
I didn't want to disturb Anaan.<eos> She wasn't expecting me.<eos> It just seemed easier.<eos> - Which hotel did you stay in?<eos> - The Kirkgate Plaza, down by the station.<eos> Yeah, I know it.<eos> All right, just keep calm.<eos> Keep him calm.<eos> Keep him talking.<eos> Just get him to meet you.
Check us out, Patterson.<eos> We've got drama, banter, romance --<eos> It's writing itself.<eos> He's probably just hiding behind that cut-out.<eos> He's good.<eos> James Patterson likes my writing!<eos> Maybe I should prepare an acceptance speech.<eos> You should be more worried about making it to the ceremony at all.<eos> This hotel can be... treacherous.<eos> It would be a shame if something happened to you, since you can only win if you're there.
That doesn't sound right.<eos> You like picking on girls, huh?<eos> Makes you feel like a tough guy?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm talking about "Kung Fu Panda."<eos> Hi-yah!<eos> Wheels, I need help!<eos> I gotcha, partner!<eos> Aah!<eos> What the hell's wrong with you guys?
All magicians are vagabonds.<eos> My dear Emma is to be married to Sir Walter at St George's in ten days' time.<eos> M... many congratulations.<eos> I am often ill myself.<eos> I find some warm lemon and nutmeg...<eos> Mr Norrell, I'm not sure what help you hope to offer us.<eos> I am sorry to say it will not do.<eos> Magic is not respectable, sir.<eos> The government cannot meddle in such things.<eos> Frankly, had I better understood what you were proposing to offer, I would not have agreed to meet you.
This is such an inconvenience.<eos> It's more than an inconvenience.<eos> It's your life.<eos> So two of Pam's neighbors saw a gray challenger in the neighborhood on two different occasions.<eos> There are a lot of gray cars.<eos> What makes you think it was me?<eos> Darren, we're beyond that.<eos> We'll pull the city cameras, we'll place you there.<eos> Why are you stalking your ex-wife?<eos> Pam broke up with you.

Janice: Hi.<eos> We're looking for Rachel or Wanda.<eos> Are you Rachel?<eos> Wanda.<eos> Rachel's not here today.<eos> Detective Larsen, Lawrence.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> See you later.<eos> We need to confirm the whereabouts of Darren Tyler.<eos> He said he was with you last night.
Have you even seen any childhood pictures of him?<eos> You know what?<eos> I told you already.<eos> We've been together for less than a year, And we have a trip planned there in August.<eos> Mrs. Simpson... Are you pregnant?<eos> It's none of your business whether or not I'm pregnant.<eos> Oh, but it is.<eos> If you refuse to help us, You are aiding a fugitive, A known terrorist.<eos> A lot of people are gonna die, And you're gonna end up having that baby behind bars.<eos> You'll have it maybe three days Before it's taken away from you.
Then you know the truth.<eos> The well is dry.<eos> So much for the West Coast influence.<eos> I happen to think you're a genius.<eos> But you've been comfortable for far too long.<eos> You need to burn... so you can rise from the ashes.<eos> Kill Will.<eos> You're giving me dangerous thoughts.<eos> All great ideas are deadly.<eos> I feel the same way with you right now as I did when I kissed my first man.
I-I made him wear a plain old sheet.<eos> Just a plain old sheet.<eos> Why didn't I pay more attention?<eos> ! I'm not really sure.<eos> I feel like I'm living in a walking nightmare.<eos> Would you like a sherry?<eos> I'm okay, thank you.<eos> I'll let you get back...<eos> Will-will you pour me one?<eos> Talking with you is a comfort to my soul.
I have a prenup to protect me from that.<eos> Get the hell out of here.<eos> You're fired.<eos> I was supposed to be married!<eos> I loved him.<eos> But he chose to love her instead.<eos> My father always said to marry a homely woman.<eos> Less trouble.<eos> I disagree.<eos> I adore you.
- Okay.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, did you walk into the wrong house?<eos> - Are you...<eos> - What?<eos> No, I'm Sam.<eos> Oh, good, you're home.<eos> I was hoping I could introduce you before we had to leave.<eos> Sara, this is Sam.<eos> - Nice to officially meet you.
What's that now?<eos> You're trying to muff cuff me.<eos> [laughs] What?<eos> It's a female version of cock block, you idiot.<eos> Muff cuff;. It's a twat swat.<eos> You're trying to steal my boyfriend.<eos> Oh, baby, have you slept with him yet?<eos> No, but I'm gonna...<eos> Then he's not your boyfriend.<eos> How can I be Mrs. Twatinson if nothing is even going on between you two?
- Absolutely wonderful.<eos> - Great, just great.<eos> Oh, my God, you are even more stunning in person.<eos> Jeremy, my soon-to-be-famous granddaughter.<eos> I've been reading all about you online, Gigi, and your voice is simply spectacular.<eos> What an instrument.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm doing good.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Who's got that kind of coin?<eos> - You wouldn't?<eos> - I will.<eos> If you don't find them first, I'll get your shit dealer friend to help us do likewise.<eos> If you want to keep your savings, you'll find Barkiss before tomorrow night.<eos> Please let me stay here with you.<eos> Do you know the trouble I went to on your behalf?<eos> He gave me this for you.<eos> "Dear Mr Marlott, the girl lost her child and would not be persuaded to stay."<eos> "She asks to lodge with you."
Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me.<eos> For such is the kingdom of heaven.<eos> Our earthly realm is less benign, however.<eos> Whatever her prospects, they would have been bleaker still with a bastard.<eos> - Harsh words.<eos> - Unbecoming in mixed company.<eos> Maybe so but true nonetheless.<eos> - You're leaving us, Mr Marlott.<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> My Lord, may I talk to you in private for a moment?
Didn't he?<eos> What's it to you?<eos> That child's fate could have been yours or mine.<eos> Better if it hadn't been.<eos> Our boss wants to see you.<eos> What does Mr Marlott want?<eos> Look, I don't like it but here it is.<eos> He is out to catch someone and you're his bait.<eos> He is to pick you out from a crowd at Smithfield like you was fancy.<eos> Whoever comes to take you away, I am to follow and make an arrest.
Murder, yes, but not of children.<eos> The Runners are still searching the site.<eos> The Bishops are in cells, awaiting questioning.<eos> Along with a kidnapper, who I believe was in league with them.<eos> Tried to kill my last night.<eos> Then why are you here and not there?<eos> I felt I should let you know immediately, sir.<eos> If word gets out murder was committed on behalf of the surgery school...<eos> My instruction was to find a culprit and inform me only.<eos> We now have a potential scandal on our hands which will do what that monstrous object you found was designed to bring about, create outrage among the population, directed towards surgeryschools.
The gentleman inside said you might help me.<eos> Boz.<eos> I write for The Chronicle.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Mr Marlott said that you worked on a case together.<eos> We worked on many.<eos> Frankenstein case?<eos> What's Frankenstein?<eos> Story about a madman who pieces together the bodies of the dead.<eos> He said I should speak to you and you'd tell me more.
Are you guys researching the Twilight books?<eos> We heard back from our friends at Everyone.<eos> Apparently, there's some kind of convention in town, and they want me to read my essay out loud in the lobby.<eos> Everyone never gets tired of embarrassing you, do they?<eos> Humiliation is the favorite currency of the hacker.<eos> Sherlock Holmes? Do I know you?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We've talked. No, we haven't.<eos> No, not like in person.<eos> Uh, can I tell you about it inside?
You forgot socially awkward and vaguely creepy.<eos> Dietz studied information technology at Binghamton Polytechnic until he was expelled for hacking their computer system and altering his friend's grades.<eos> One of a handful of infractions, all involving computers, none of which has stopped him finding steady work as a freelance programmer.<eos> He fits the profile.<eos> Mm, to a T.<eos> He also works from his home, in Brooklyn.<eos> WATSON: Excuse me, Brady.<eos> You're the lunchbox lady.<eos> Who's he?<eos> Oh, you and I are old friends.
Crew.<eos> Hello, sailors!<eos> Right, I did not expect that.<eos> Hands up who expected that.<eos> Wait, wait - - I don't think they're going to hurt us.<eos> I think that they're just curious.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Well, I mean, define "sure".<eos> Look at you lovely chaps.<eos> What's happened to you, then?
Cass says, close the internal flood doors.<eos> That'll contain the water in the central corridor.<eos> - Where's the Tardis?<eos> - On the other side.<eos> We need to get there. It's our only way out.<eos> OK. We've got 30 seconds before the flood doors close.<eos> Come on!<eos> Doctor!<eos> I'll get you and the others out.<eos> Sit tight, I'll come back for you.
I haven't saved her yet.<eos> Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.<eos> I've got no choice now, I have to face the Fisher King.<eos> You, back to the TARDIS.<eos> Look, he'll be fine, I promise.<eos> OK.<eos> Didn't need anyone to translate that.<eos> Now I'm ready.<eos> I've come from the future.<eos> I've seen the chaos you cause, the bloodshed.
All beamed from the sonic glasses.<eos> As soon as you brought me and the chamber on board, it connected with the base's Wi-Fi and Bob's your uncle, you've got a ghost Doctor.<eos> Why did they only come out at night?<eos> They're electromagnetic projections that were out of phase with the base's day mode.<eos> Right.<eos> That's it.<eos> I've erased the memory of the writing.<eos> Though you might find you've lost a couple of other memories too.<eos> People you went to school with, previous addresses or how to drink liquids.<eos> That's you two done.
You hear that, Cooper?<eos> She doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> So buh-bye now.<eos> Don't buh-bye me.<eos> Buh-bye you.<eos> (Gabi Gasps)<eos> - Hey, back off.<eos> - You back off.<eos> Hey!<eos> What is wrong with you two?
Oh, my God, we're gonna have to sell our hair to pay rent!<eos> - (Phone rings) - (Both) It's ringing!<eos> - It's them.<eos> - Put it on speaker.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> (Man) Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'Arby.<eos> Chef D'Arby, this is Miss Diamond.<eos> You have been chosen to audition for my apprenticeship.<eos> We'll expect to see you tomorrow at 9:00 A.M. sharp.
(Laughs) You know, I'm really happy about the way this all turned out.<eos> I think it's really true, when God closes a door, he opens a window.<eos> (Phone rings)<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'Arby.<eos> Chef D'Arby?<eos> Oh, hello, what can I do for you?<eos> It has come to my attention that the winner of the competition cheated.<eos> She found out the audition dish in advance.<eos> Normally, I'd offer the position to the first runner-up, but I was so impressed by you, I've decided to offer you the apprenticeship.
I heard you're the go-to guy.<eos> Well, the go-to guy is the guy to go to, if you've got to go to the go-to guy.<eos> Flawless logic.<eos> And great hair, do you mousse?<eos> You're the investigator, right?<eos> Journalist.<eos> Was.<eos> Retired.<eos> Sorry, love, not interested.<eos> Well, my husband's decided he wants to talk to you.
I'm dying here.<eos> Keep a lookout for a sec.<eos> You probably want to switch that off.<eos> You're having a laugh! Took me a month to learn how to switch it on.<eos> OK. Play dead for a few more minutes, I'm going for a snoop.<eos> Excuse me, I've been informed by Nicola Tickler that her husband, Bud Tickler, would like to say a few words about his deceased father.<eos> Thanks, Nicola.<eos> Thanks a bunch.<eos> To be honest,<eos> I didn't think for a second I'd be standing here in front of you all, talking about my...
That seems optimistic.<eos> But look, if you want to make real money, I could try to get you a job at the airport.<eos> They always need new TSA screeners.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow, that'd be great!<eos> Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.<eos> And thanks for taking the time.<eos> Most people aren't usually that nice to me.<eos> Ugh, gross.<eos> Mayor West, after working with you for some time now, I believe you are affecting your weird behaviors.
Someone he hasn't called in years... his ex-wife, Elise Resner.<eos> He said he was in trouble and needed my help.<eos> What kind of trouble, exactly?<eos> Detective, you have to understand...<eos> I hadn't spoken to him in years.<eos> And then he just calls out of the blue.<eos> You never asked.<eos> I didn't want to know.<eos> After everything that happened between us, I knew I couldn't get involved again.<eos> What happened between the two of you?
Not everything.<eos> You didn't tell us that you were lead counsel for Modesto Motors, and you didn't tell us about the airbags.<eos> You know, those airbags with the habit of putting holes in people, like Jody Evans.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Ms. Resner, why did Richie really call you the other day?<eos> Was it to give you a little heads-up?<eos> You know... for old times' sake?<eos> Because that defect he helped cover up back then, you were in on that, too.<eos> He was going public with it, and he didn't want you to be blindsided.<eos> But you couldn't let that happen... not to Modesto and certainly not to you.
But "If the police want to talk to me, "I'm just going to talk to them.<eos> Is that all right?" And, like, that was the conversation.<eos> "Do whatever you want."<eos> My name is Sareb Kaufman.<eos> Um, Susan Berman was my mother.<eos> There's just one request that I would like to make, which is that we keep the best in mind, and try not to dwell too much on the sadness of these events.<eos> People were flying in for the memorial, and it was expected Bobby was going to be there.<eos> I believe he was in L.A. at the time, but he didn't come to the funeral...<eos> To the memorial service.<eos> But, Bob reached out to you, right?
"had set out to humanize him in some way "after he'd dismembered Morris Black, murdered him, "and ran with his I.D. and did everything he had done, they were looking like they were being successful at it."<eos> You're now living in this apartment in Galveston.<eos> Did you meet Morris Black?<eos> I was going out, dressed as a mute woman, and a man came out of the door to the apartment across the hall.<eos> He said that I should not leave the hall light on, because the hall light was on his electric meter.<eos> I guess I had nodded and I left.<eos> No one knew a great deal about Morris because he was, uh, a loner.<eos> Every time I say the word "cantankerous" and "grumpy," I see Morris' face.<eos> There was a guy that lived in the house next door that used to sit on the porch and smoke his cigarette, and Morris Black would walk down the street and yell at him for smoking on his porch.<eos> In the days and weeks to come, what sort of relationship developed between you and Morris?
The way you had it was... Was what happened.<eos> The gun turns, and it's just like this?<eos> Is this your testimony, that it goes...<eos> Oh, I can't say that's my testimony.<eos> The two of you look like spaghetti, is the truth of the matter.<eos> Mr. Black kind of looked like bloody spaghetti, didn't he?<eos> No. He didn't look like bloody spaghetti.<eos> You just don't remember how you were standing?<eos> I remember a whole lot better than this demonstration is doing it.<eos> The man sitting before you cannot tell the truth.
Now, Morris had tools.<eos> He had saws and... And, um, axes, a giant ax.<eos> Uh, I don't think he had a... I don't think he had a bow saw.<eos> Anyway, I went and bought a bow saw and then a bunch of garbage bags and stuff like that and went back to...<eos> To the house, and I'm sure I got more stoned and more drunk, and I dismembered the corpse primarily with the ax but some with the bow saw and, I think, another saw that Morris Black had.<eos> What did you do with the parts of the body?<eos> I put them in garbage bags.<eos> You put the garbage bags in your car?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Ultimately, later that night, did you take those bags to the location on Channelview Drive you described here?
So, Mr. Namazi, I have to ask, uh, now that you know more about your son, do you still disapprove of the life he was living?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because in the eyes of Allah,<eos> Darius was not a good Muslim.<eos> I still mourn his loss because I loved my son.<eos> I know this trip was... difficult, to say the least, but... if you allow me, I would like a chance to apologize and show you my gratitude.<eos> That's, uh... really very kind of you, but you see, we have a plane to catch.<eos> And I'm sure you understand that we-we don't want to miss that, so...<eos> Hooshmand should be here soon, so...<eos> Actually, uh, we'll meet you at the airport.
- Come on!<eos> - We've got our pills.<eos> - Do you all really fancy it?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Why not?<eos> Whack some music on and that.<eos> Fuck it, we'll stay here then.<eos> If you want, mate, I'll take you back to your car and you can piss off and all.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't mind hanging with you guys... and your party in the woods.
Home now!<eos> Home now!<eos> Lol!<eos> I'd first of all just like to say,<eos> I really think I am ready for the outside world.<eos> I know this might sound a bit daft, but I've never once considered prison as an opportunity.<eos> You know, a chance to completely rehabilitate myself.<eos> Prison was just another part of the fight for me.<eos> You know, I blamed my crimes on the system.<eos> A system I felt created me, to be brutally honest with you.
Trev, why would she lie about that?<eos> Why would I-why would I be putting any of you through this?<eos> Kel, I fucking love you, you're my sister.<eos> I wanna protect you from everything.<eos> Everything!<eos> I never want you to be through any kind of pain, I never wanna hurt ya.<eos> But I have to be honest with you, Kel.<eos> I have to be honest with all of ya.<eos> And I want you to know that this is fucking...<eos> This is horrible for me, it's horrible for you and I will be there for you every step of the fucking way.
She is. No, she's not.<eos> To us, she is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But she's not.<eos> I mean, I've started planning the hen party,<eos> I've got a few ideas for you there.<eos> Some good ideas.<eos> You are very...<eos> I want to put this really nicely, and just be really direct, Barbara.<eos> Richard, just be really honest with you all, because this is the first wedding meeting. And it's going great.
I just want you to know... ..from the bottom of my heart... ..I'm so sorry.<eos> What this?<eos> Fucking hell.<eos> There's promises, Combo, that were made.<eos> All my family sat around my bed, didn't know if I was going to make it.<eos> You did that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I just hope one day you'll be able to forgive me.<eos> So I'm with you boys, then, yeah?
Not big enough-- we need more.<eos> We got more.<eos> Any, uh, places I should avoid in the next few days?<eos> Los Angeles.<eos> Right.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, amigos.
Federal agent!<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> It's okay, I'm a cop.<eos> Identify yourself.<eos> Detective Jacqueline Rivera.<eos> LAPD Internal Affairs.<eos> Federal agents aren't in your purview, Detective.<eos> You got that right.<eos> Could you maybe lower your gun?<eos> I thought Detective Deeks was with you.
Detective Jacqueline Rivera.<eos> LAPD Internal Affairs.<eos> Federal agents aren't in your purview, Detective.<eos> You got that right.<eos> Could you maybe lower your gun?<eos> I thought Detective Deeks was with you.<eos> Seems I was mistaken.<eos> No, Detective Deeks is not with me.<eos> What do you want with him?<eos> Well, I'm afraid I can't discuss ongoing investigations with you, Agent Blye.
You're not gonna complete your mission.<eos> There are agents up ahead-- they're gonna shoot you and your brother before you make it.<eos> On my command, you take them out.<eos> You do realize they're just teenagers, right?<eos> With a car full of explosives.<eos> I'm just saying, give Sam time to do his job.<eos> Detective Deeks, if that truck reaches our driveway, I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> The man who put you up to this-- this is for his own personal vendetta.<eos> This has nothing to do with your beliefs.<eos> He's taken advantage of you.
Oh, my God, complete and total freak.<eos> Josh was the T.A. in my CS class.<eos> Computer science?<eos> Yeah. I'm a theater major, but they make us take Coding for Poets.<eos> Josh helped me with my homework a few times.<eos> What makes him a freak?<eos> A) He never bathed, and B) he took my phone when I wasn't looking.<eos> Took selfies for me to discover.<eos> He texted himself and acted like I started it.<eos> Huh, well, maybe that's his way of flirting with you.
Members of<eos> Jemaah Islamiyah.<eos> The group that bombed the stock exchange, embassies, hotels.<eos> She tried to steal the military hack off Josh's computer.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't there.<eos> Which is why she ditched you and jumped in bed with Wyatt.<eos> Blaze did pretty good.<eos> No, Blaze did great.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Isn't she with you?
That vault requires a key and an iris scan.<eos> The head teller has the key.<eos> The manager has the eyeball.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Who's the head teller?<eos> Good.<eos> You have the key?<eos> Yes.<eos> And who's the manager?<eos> He left just before you came in.
Your objections are noted.<eos> What?<eos> Very impressive, Mr. Callen.<eos> Very impressive, indeed.<eos> You're really short.<eos> You taking me back to Social Services?<eos> No.<eos> You're never going there again.<eos> You can stay with me... for as long as you like.<eos> I've been watching you... for quite a while.
The minute I hand over your Grace, I'm dead.<eos> You have made your bed, Metatron, and nothing is going to get you out of it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I think I need to use the little boys' room.<eos> Little help.<eos> Quick. Oh.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Hey.<eos> Were you followed?
♪ Yeah, they have ♪<eos> Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying', sweetheart.<eos> I need your help, Ronnie.<eos> I'm trying to track somebody down.<eos> ♪ And if you're not one of them ♪<eos> ♪<eos> ♪<eos> I ain't never seen her before in my life.<eos> Her name's Amelia.<eos> She's been missing for a few years, but according to her diary, she was supposed to meet up with you.
And I rated top of my class in marksmanship.<eos> Your class?<eos> You don't even have your stripes yet.<eos> Soon.<eos> Been on the job seven months, sir.<eos> Are you aware of what happened to my previous partner?<eos> Detective Thawne, yes.<eos> I know that he died and the one before him,<eos> Fred Chyre, died, too, but the one before that's not dead, just transferred.<eos> I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.
Looks like a bullet.<eos> It's your bullet.<eos> A forensics team pried it from the floorboards of the Phoenix.<eos> Ballistics matched it to your FBI-issued 9mm.<eos> There's more.<eos> The crime lab found trace amounts of blood belonging to Samuel Aleko.<eos> Here's the report.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Why are you showing me this?<eos> Because it contradicts every word that's come out of your mouth since you walked in here.
I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I never wanted--<eos> That is exactly what you wanted!<eos> Damn it, Keen!<eos> Grow up!<eos> You want to play the angles?<eos> You want to leverage your friends and colleagues, at least have the decency to admit it.<eos> I'm not sorry for what I did, but I am sorry that it had to be done.<eos> I wanted Berlin dead.<eos> I wanted him to pay for what he did to Meera, to you, to all of us.
Denied.<eos> Look at my face, Ms. Wright.<eos> Get as close as you feel is necessary to understand what I'm saying.<eos> Denied.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> What is it?<eos> We have a situation in the corridor.<eos> "A situation"?<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> There's someone out there demanding that he speak with you.
She saved me.<eos> She held you captive on the boat the Phoenix to squeeze you for intelligence about your employer.<eos> Yeah, look. None of that matters.<eos> All right, the only thing that matters is that I killed that man.<eos> The guy walked on the wrong ship at the wrong time.<eos> So you snapped his neck, just like that.<eos> No.<eos> It took a few seconds.<eos> Why are you telling me all this?<eos> You do realize what's going to happen to you as a result of your confession today.
Pretty good.<eos> How are you?<eos> I mean with the research, Renee.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Oh. Uh, it's... it's going pretty well.<eos> A few bumps in the road, but all things considered...<eos> The synaptic timing discoveries you made will help us here immensely.<eos> I want to see what you're doing.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> I look forward to working with you.
Nah, but I mean, I could ask my mum.<eos> She did take in a few lodgers when I went to poly.<eos> - Yeah, when was that?<eos> - 'That would've been '75 to '78.'<eos> - Well, that would sort of fit.<eos> - I mean, I can't promise anything.<eos> She's in a home now, not in the best of health,<eos> - but I could try.<eos> - I would really appreciate that, Mr Leeming.<eos> - 'All right, I'll get back to you.'
Bishop Street nick.<eos> I wondered if you could spare five minutes?<eos> Need to pick your brains about a case we're working on.<eos> Well, I was gonna slit my wrists in front of Cook Me The Money but...<eos> - seeing as you're so pretty... - (CHUCKLES) .. come in and pick away, love.<eos> Some of these lads, you know, not much older than Jimmy was before he died.<eos> And I've seen them over the years on the telly.<eos> And I think of the things they've done and... .. and the life.<eos> It's not just the obvious things, you know, the... birthdays, the christenings, the weddings.<eos> It's the little things your friends tell you about their kids.
I think we are done.<eos> I don't know his lad or anything about what happened to him but I do know how much you lot love a celebrity fish wriggling on your hooks.<eos> Doesn't matter if they've done nothing,<eos> - just makes you look like you're doing your job a bit better than you frequently are. - (BLEEP)<eos> You wanna talk more, fine, but I want my lawyers present if we're dragging up ancient history like the Fenwicks.<eos> Cara.<eos> Can you show DI Khan, DCI Stuart to the lifts, please?<eos> Thank you so much for your time, Sir Phillip.<eos> No problem.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Just before Christmas.<eos> November, I think.<eos> I mean, it was just a few weeks.<eos> So Father Robert said to us that he thought you were erm... 19 or 20 when he met you.<eos> And so we checked your date of birth before we came here today.<eos> And actually, if your affair was in November '75... .. actually, that would've made you 15.<eos> When the 28-year-old priest had sex with you.<eos> You weren't 16 till February 1976.<eos> Maybe it was Jimmy first and then Robert.<eos> Except we have a diary, given to Jimmy... by you.
♪ And jubilations<eos> ♪ I want the world to know I'm happy as can be...<eos> - (MUSIC CONTINUES)<eos> - WOMAN: How are you feeling?<eos> (LAUGHTER AND CHATTER)<eos> - Mum!<eos> - (THUNDER)<eos> Mum!<eos> Mum...<eos> Maybe felt I'd... I'd already put so much in to our new life here, with you boys and finding this lovely house and making all our new friends.
Er... a cashpoint withdrawal.<eos> £10.<eos> And that number by the entry corresponds to a specific machine.<eos> Do you know which one it is?<eos> Well, we rang the bank and we asked them.<eos> It's for a cashpoint on Haverstock Hill.<eos> Number 364. Right next to the pub.<eos> So, we can now place you within 20 yards of the last known whereabouts of Nicholas Whitmore.<eos> So we now have a connection between his murder and Jimmy's.<eos> On top of the numerous connections to you and Jimmy.
And, you know... she's always wanted me to tell you about her.<eos> Erm... How involved in... in her life were you?<eos> How often did you... do you see her?<eos> Once a week.<eos> Sometimes twice.<eos> For nearly four decades, you've seen this woman twice a week?<eos> My daughter, yes.<eos> That's more than you saw us.<eos> Yes.<eos> I wasn't as present for you as I should have been.
How is it I feel sorry for her?<eos> Hi, Maureen.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Hi.<eos> So, what I wanted to tell you, Grace, was that actually Dad... .. Robert... .. he very much wanted to tell you about me.<eos> In fact, from the moment he found out, when I was about 18 months old, he desperately wanted to admit his mistake to you.<eos> But my mother, she...<eos> Well, she was scared she would lose me, somehow.<eos> So she told him that if he ever did tell you... .. he would never see me again.<eos> So, he chose to live this terrible lie... .. so he could be there for you and for me.
And next week.<eos> How are you feeling about the trial?<eos> The next week's just a bit of theatre, isn't it?<eos> It's the last two months that have really mattered.<eos> Thinking time.<eos> All I ever wanted... .. was for my children to be better than me.<eos> The start I had, the things I was taught, things I did... back then.<eos> Everything I've ever achieved since, beneath the ambition and the money and the vanity, was all really to buy you your escape... from me.<eos> What I was.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
You did the right thing at dinner.<eos> If you go to prom with him, you'll relapse and start mainlining Matty.<eos> Okay, don't you think you're being a tad dramatic?<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> Not a big deal?<eos> Let me paint a prom portrait for you, Jenna.<eos> You and Matty go as "just friends" and then the first Adele ballad in, you start spilling your feelings, you make out, and then you start dating.<eos> Ooh, hooray!<eos> No, not hooray.<eos> All summer long, the dark cloud of long distance will loom over you and you'll be stressing so you'll get in tons of fights.
I slipped...<eos> Now we can't hear what they're saying again.<eos> Ingrid, this is crucial evidence. It better be recording.<eos> Where's the manual?<eos> It is recording.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think it might still be recording, we just can't hear it out of these stupid speakers.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Red light, red light, red light.<eos> What did you think you and the Professor were going to talk about?
What?<eos> What?<eos> Somebody or something assaulted your husband in your home.<eos> At any rate, while they were searching the premises, it turns out your husband was still alive, unbeknownst to them.<eos> He was left?<eos> Yes.<eos> For how long?<eos> And as soon as they found out, they called an ambulance, they got him to the hospital, but it was too late.<eos> And he died.<eos> Dan's here to talk to you about it now.
It's OK, everyone, choppers are here!<eos> No...<eos> No, it was just that whining noise again, it's gone.<eos> Right<eos> - I'm going down.<eos> You can't use a vallon, your hearing's all over the place.<eos> They do vibrate as well, you know.<eos> I am as steady as a rock.<eos> Enough twatting about now, Boss.<eos> I'm coming down there with you.
Okay, if anybody here could maybe give me scissors or a knife or something.<eos> Something to help.<eos> God, I gotta beg for it.<eos> Be careful, that's razor-sharp.<eos> Ow! Son of a... Oh!<eos> You're listening to The Morning Drive Time with Big Stain and Willie.<eos> (car horn oogahs) It's ten minutes after the hour, and we're back with Molly Flynn, talking about her sexy new book, Within Her Walls.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Welcome, Molly.<eos> Thank you, Big Stain.
It's as soft as a catcher's mitt.<eos> She's magnificent!<eos> Right?<eos> I mean... can you imagine the story that turned that sweet little girl into this?<eos> (Xander clears throat) I have to admit, I am rather intrigued by the story.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad, but... just so you know, so is Simon Schuster.<eos> What?<eos> Y-You went to them first?<eos> After the book launch I gave you? !<eos> Well, I mean, we really want to work with you, but... you're gonna have to be willing to work with us.
I'm just gonna say my piece and then get the hell out of here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please, just sit down.<eos> I thought I was.<eos> I'm through with this book business.<eos> You can go suck somebody else dry.<eos> I just remembered another part of the Woodstock story.<eos> Really?<eos> !<eos> Okay, Peggy, what has gotten into you?
- No.<eos> I need you two to trap a wolf.<eos> - So...<eos> What... Sorry?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I expect studying a wolf will provide answers as to what may have caused the pack...<eos> No.<eos> But I don't know the first thing - about trapping a wolf.<eos> - Which is why<eos> Abraham will be going with you.
Looks like we've got a manhunt on our hands, thanks to you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Which begs the question.<eos> - What were you doing out in the woods?<eos> - Members of my team were engaged in a separate investigation when they saw Evan Lee Hartley.<eos> I thought it was prudent to report the sighting.<eos> We at the Bureau appreciate that.<eos> Uh, if you catch Hartley, perhaps we could have a word with him?<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you.
So, Will is looking after Roland.<eos> Perhaps I could take you for a walk in the moonlight?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> I didn't mean to kill you.<eos> Though, to be fair, I didn't have a heart.<eos> So it's my fault?<eos> What I think he means to say is...<eos> We are sorry.<eos> Eh, you don't need to be sorry.<eos> Although I do intend to hold it over your heads for a very long time. I think we both know what happened in that world was not real. Although, seeing you guys as real villains made me sorry for holding a grudge against you for so long.
Well, perhaps it's too soon for that particular guest.<eos> Dr Watson and Mr Holmes might have more luck raising your spirits.<eos> ~ They're declined the invitation. ~ Huh.<eos> How ungrateful of them.<eos> ~ They don't want to fraternise with an adulterer either.<eos> ~ Oh, Arthur.<eos> You need to sink your teeth into something.<eos> If not a book then some other pursuit.<eos> That was my intention.<eos> Anyway, it's been very nice talking to you ladies.
a horse's belly without being trampled to death in the process?<eos> Jean, your eyes.<eos> ~ Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> ~ No, no.<eos> ~ It's an affecting story.<eos> ~ It is, and...<eos> I feel wretched for saying this ~ after all I've heard of poor Mr Edalji, but - ~ But? They are not tears of sadness.<eos> Ah. Woodie observed that I am enlivened.<eos> Woodie is no fool where you're concerned.<eos> I wish that I was coming with you.
~ Yes.<eos> Right.<eos> Two exits, one front, one back.<eos> Two of us, Woodie.<eos> He will not escape.<eos> Why don't you go and stand in front of the window?<eos> What if he's armed?<eos> Fight fire with fire.<eos> ~ Good.<eos> You take the back. ~ Right.
~ Careful.<eos> ~ Brookes received letters from the same vile entity that persecuted the Edalji family.<eos> Thank you, Sir Arthur.<eos> If we need any more amateur speculation, we will be in touch.<eos> Good day.<eos> Those speculations will soon take the form of a report in the Telegraph.<eos> ~ I'll look forward to reading it.<eos> ~ I doubt it. This case has reeked of race prejudice from the start.<eos> Your professional future might not be as you imagined it<eos> ~ when I've finished with you.
I would like to ask for your hand in marriage.<eos> ~ What is your answer?<eos> ~ I didn't hear you ask me a question, Arthur. ~ Ah.<eos> Nor did I.<eos> Will you marry me, Jean?<eos> No. ~ No?<eos> ~ You've been to see your sister seeking an apology.<eos> And judging by the look on your face, you didn't get it.<eos> You're not asking for my hand in marriage, you're saying,<eos> "To hell with you all." You're flouncing, Arthur.
~ So?<eos> ~ The absence of evidence is as telling as its presence.<eos> We found this in his cottage.<eos> He got rid of Brookes and he must have known we were near him.<eos> We've found our man.<eos> Royden Sharp?<eos> I didn't know him.<eos> ~ Why would he wish to harm me?<eos> ~ That's what prejudice is, George.<eos> It means I don't have to know you to dislike you.
That was when it started, the watching and the lurking.<eos> Yes.<eos> There were constables outside the vicarage at all hours. In the woods, the lane... the old barn across the way.<eos> ~ Harry...<eos> ~ Hello, George.<eos> ~ Reverend Shapurji.<eos> ~ Harry.<eos> I told him, Sir Arthur, I did.<eos> I said to wait until you'd taken your pictures.<eos> Sir Arthur. I should like to accompany you.
Where is he?<eos> Here he is.<eos> George, I'm so sorry. We were detained.<eos> This is Miss Jean Leckie.<eos> ~ We've been shopping.<eos> ~ No, Arthur, you were talking.<eos> Well, I was talking to a shopkeeper.<eos> He served in South Africa and it seemed only civil to ask -<eos> That is still talking, not shopping.<eos> I'm very happy to meet you, George.
- So what now?<eos> - We go back to the evidence.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a scarf found on Mr. Brooks' body.<eos> No doubt he used it to staunch the blood.<eos> What else have we got?<eos> - Not much, I'm afraid. - (Phone ringing)<eos> Detective Murdoch.<eos> I don't have much.<eos> I've confirmed the blade you found was the murder weapon.
- We believe so.<eos> A man named Carter got the most bets, but that was expected due to his thuggish reputation.<eos> The trick was to measure the deviation between the expected and the empirical results.<eos> - There was an anomaly.<eos> - Pearson.<eos> Everyone who bet on him was in the yard at the time of the murder.<eos> And none of those men could be persuaded to change their bets.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Pearson!<eos> I don't have to talk to you.
- Why me?<eos> - Why not you?<eos> Because everybody and their mother knows they're going bankrupt in two weeks and I'm not a bankruptcy expert.<eos> Aren't you listening to me?<eos> He doesn't want to declare bankruptcy.<eos> He wants you to fight for him.<eos> Then he's come to me on the right day.<eos> Kevin, I hear you're looking for a fight and I understand we don't have much time.<eos> We don't, and I just wasted half an hour waiting for you.<eos> So, before we get to anything, you're gonna convince me why I should go with you in the first place.
And that's when it happened, isn't it?<eos> You had another one.<eos> I don't--I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Step one to making them stop is talking about it.<eos> I couldn't think, I couldn't see, I c-- I couldn't breath.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> No, I know. I need you to say it.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause the more you say it, the less power it has over you.
Everyone knows Cocoa Puffs is code for porn.<eos> Also, you sent us some pictures taken by someone very experienced in erotica.<eos> We can't let him do this.<eos> I have a movie that starts shooting tomorrow that pays $1,000 a day.<eos> Can we?<eos> Maybe we can't.<eos> It's the lead in Sorest Rump.<eos> Maybe we can.<eos> I think we need a little sidebar, Delores.<eos> - [clears throat] - Should I come with you?
I'm talking major flagship.<eos> Honey, I get that you're happy, but enough with the eye contact.<eos> No one can look me in the eye.<eos> I'm the Medusa in Chanel.<eos> Max doesn't let me look her in the eyes during sex either.<eos> I told you, eye contact's extra.<eos> Max, did you hear that?<eos> Major flagship!<eos> Uh, did someone just call me a major flag?<eos> I think you did, and if I don't get to go to the new place with you two, I'm telling HR.
Uh, come on in.<eos> You said you had to work.<eos> Uh, emergency surgery at the oscars?<eos> I thought i told you i had a meeting.<eos> Yeah. No, it's just, uh...<eos> Wow.<eos> Um, soph and i had a fight.<eos> Right. The party. I heard.<eos> And i was driving home, feeling guilty So i thought i would stop by and make peace.<eos> With the both of you.
Do you agree with her politics?<eos> I love her politics.<eos> I'm also crazy about her husband's.<eos> He used to be a Republican, but that's not her fault.<eos> What else?<eos> Uh, when was the last time you went to church?<eos> You are down South, honey.<eos> You are in church right now.<eos> I think that's everything I need.<eos> Harmony, it has been a pleasure chatting with you.
There was no air-conditioning in Lisa Hoffman's basement, and there's no rust on this gun.<eos> Those ballistics shouldn't have been a perfect match, but they were, which means the gun wasn't sitting in that basement for 15 years.<eos> Someone kept it.<eos> Someone took care of it.<eos> And someone planted it in Lisa Hoffman's house for my people to find.<eos> I don't... I don't know what you think.<eos> I think Lisa died two weeks ago of natural causes, a normal life.<eos> So it wouldn't affect her any to be framed for the murder of her husband after her death.<eos> I think you've been waiting for something like that to happen.<eos> And I don't think you want to see your father die for something that you did.
I will not allow you to waste one more second.<eos> We need this bill now.<eos> To elevate the standard of police conduct in this country, and to make sure that what happened to Brandon Parker never happens to anyone ever again.<eos> Do you have a problem with that, Susan?<eos> - No, sir, I don't, but...<eos> - Good. Then get up to The Hill and vote the way you're supposed to.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> I understand what my role is supposed to be.<eos> But I was clear with you on the person you were getting when you asked me to take this job.
- What? Susan was right.<eos> It's 1,200 pages of nothing.<eos> We're making it better, Mr. Beene.<eos> We're gonna get it right this time.<eos> You're gonna get killed in the press, is what you're gonna get.<eos> Not if we give them something else to write about.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you, Mr. President!<eos> And thank you, people of the great state of Virginia!<eos> It is with great humility that I stand before you, asking to represent you in the senate today.
The countdown begins.<eos> No one is going to kill you, Russell.<eos> I know that sounds comforting, but, trust me, it's not.<eos> You don't get off so easily.<eos> You don't get to die.<eos> So if I were you, I'd start talking about Foxtail, because what these two are going to do to you... Is much worse than death.<eos> Madam Vice President, this is Admiral Hawley, the commander of the U.S. Fleet Forces, and Captain Weaver, his chief of staff.<eos> Thank you both so much for your service.<eos> It is an honor and a pleasure, Madam Vice President.<eos> Now, I know some Sailors who would very much like to meet you.
Is that correct, sir?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you deny having sex with her?<eos> Admiral, I asked you a question.<eos> You might want to remind your guest, counselor, that this is a military proceeding and she has no standing here.<eos> Did you or did you not have sexual intercourse with my client on the night in question?<eos> - Sir?<eos> - This country has a lot of enemies.<eos> Most of them are overseas, but some of them are right here on our own shores.<eos> And that woman sitting next to you, counselor, she's one of them... a barnacle on the ass of every loser with a mouth big enough to say "boo-hoo."
Mellie!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Mellie!<eos> Thank you!<eos> What's next?<eos> Well, we've got a spaghetti feed at the 4th street firehouse.<eos> But first, there's someone at the Maguire hotel I'd like you to meet.
Mr. Bainbridge!<eos> Please. I am not Mr. Bainbridge.<eos> Not to you. Call me...<eos> Damascus.<eos> Damascus, it's so lovely of you to take time out of your busy schedule - to sit down with me. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's lovely of you to sit with me.<eos> I am so happy to be here with you in person.
You can't threaten me like that.<eos> Actually, I can.<eos> You see, when you know someone's pressure point, you can make them do just about anything.<eos> David?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Did you see Liv?<eos> And is she okay?<eos> David, who sent you?<eos> What's this, Rosen?<eos> The affidavit before you hereby formally withdraws and effectively repudiates the statements regarding B613 you provided this afternoon.
This is such a time.<eos> Tonight, we are honored to have Amanda Clarke.<eos> Thank you for finding the time to squeeze me in.<eos> Of course.<eos> The whole world is dying to hear your story...<eos> Save Victoria Grayson.<eos> She didn't seem too thrilled to see you here.<eos> Nothing's off-limits, right?<eos> Your words.<eos> Now what I saw between you backstage was nothing short of animosity.
We're fine.<eos> Listen, Tom isn't adapting well to daycare.<eos> He isn't interested in activities, he always needs someone.<eos> We can't watch him nonstop.<eos> I can't leave this way!<eos> Yes, but Tom disrupts the other children's lives.<eos> It'll be difficult to keep him.<eos> I can't have a child endangering other children.<eos> I waited months for this slot.<eos> He should stay home with you.
You're leaving me?<eos> No at all.<eos> Why? Are you crazy?<eos> I'll never leave you.<eos> I love you too much.<eos> If you love me, stop drinking.<eos> You choose.<eos> No. The salad stays here.<eos> Here!<eos> Could I talk to you, please?
Just someone.<eos> Not the whole town.<eos> Just save someone.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I know where I got this face, and I know what it's for.<eos> OK, what's it for?<eos> To remind me.<eos> To hold me to the mark.<eos> I'm the Doctor, and I save people.<eos> And if anyone happens to be listening, and you've got any kind of a problem with that, to hell with you!
And Weston?<eos> There's no sign of him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yeah, Max.<eos> Go.<eos> Go with Campbell.<eos> I'm gonna put some clothes on, and I'll meet you at command.<eos> I'm right behind you.
Let's go.<eos> Yeah, Max.<eos> Go.<eos> Go with Campbell.<eos> I'm gonna put some clothes on, and I'll meet you at command.<eos> I'm right behind you.<eos> Ok.<eos> Come on.<eos> You guys go ahead.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
UNIX.<eos> You couldn't do it.<eos> Oh, it's not that we couldn't do it, we just thought it was a waste of time.<eos> But you did have time to animate the games, gut the box, fake the data.<eos> How are you streaming it?<eos> - Joe?<eos> - What? What do you want?<eos> You want to insult me again, say I'm a bad guy, a bait and switch artist?<eos> I put you on the network.<eos> I handed you a deal my boss didn't want you to have.
I'm returning his call.<eos> I did call Douglas Durst.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> You called him.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm returning that call on his behalf.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Yeah, I wanted to talk to him about the film that I'm making.<eos> Okay, Douglas has no interest in speaking with you.
Can I interrupt you?<eos> - First I want to congratulate you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Then I want to tell you I'm Andrew Jarecki.<eos> Oh, you are.<eos> I mean you no harm.<eos> I'm, I'm interested in, you know, at some point, us getting a chance to talk.<eos> Well, you're not successful.<eos> Well, I've tried. It's not my fault.<eos> You know, I'd be happy to come sit down and talk at some point if you're, you know, so motivated.
- How many employees?<eos> - A thousand.<eos> - All doing research on immortality?<eos> - Sounds like science fiction, I know but it's all grounded work.<eos> to solve the death riddle.<eos> To do that, we target the issue from every angle.<eos> We support unproven advanced genetic technologies the mainstream establishment won't touch.<eos> Simply, we are trying to extend the life of the body as long as possible.<eos> Let's talk about the three bodies, all with craniotomies smuggled in the back of a truck?<eos> What are the chances we connect those dead bodies back to you and your experiment?

I have enough lawyers on speed dial to fill a stadium.<eos> I'm here talking to you because this project means everything to me.
No, this is what it takes.<eos> Pasteur, he wasn't even a physician.<eos> The day that he injected that small boy with the rabies vaccine he was risking criminal prosecution.<eos> Jonas Salk injected the flu virus into men in an insane asylum in Michigan.<eos> Decade later, he's being hailed as the genius who cured polio.<eos> I know of a doctor who agreed with you. A relatively young man also fascinated by genetics. A man who didn't concern himself with morality, humanity.<eos> That was Josef Mengele.<eos> I don't need you to agree with what I've already done, Red.<eos> But I would like to know if you're willing to help me now.<eos> Sir, there are two agents from the FBI at the front door. - They insist on seeing you right away.
We don't see a lot of billionaires suspected of murder.<eos> You'd be wise to remember that my client hasn't been charged with anything.<eos> Earlier today, we raided a clinic used to conduct experimental transgenic research on human test subjects.<eos> That research was being conducted by a Dr. Julian Powell. You failed to mention your connection with him the last time we spoke.<eos> - What connection?<eos> He worked for you at a biotech company called Sadovo Solutions.<eos> And now he surfaces, abducting disabled patients doing illegal experiments, killing people.<eos> Have you any idea how many people I've employed over the last 20 years?<eos> This is one hell of a coincidence, Mr. Hobbs.<eos> We come around asking about human experiments and when we find the man responsible he has a direct connection to you.
They can never know the truth, and John is beyond their reach now.<eos> Beyond the sea?<eos> Beyond all seas.<eos> Gone.<eos> Dead?<eos> I am sorry for that.<eos> I entertained a hope that someday I might tell him how sorry I was.<eos> Now he'll never know.<eos> We all have such thoughts.<eos> Can I tell you something I've never spoken out loud before?
His tongue was not cut out.<eos> He bit it off himself.<eos> They're calling it "autopsy," a postmortem examination.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> The act of seeing with one's own eyes.<eos> Would you mind taking me outside for some fresh air?<eos> Even I have my limits to what my eyes see and my hands feel.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You do not feel weak at all. I can tell.<eos> Then why am I out here with you?
If there is one thing you should take away from this conversation, child, it's this... you are in my hive.<eos> I'm your Samhain, and you are an Essex witch.<eos> You cannot hide anything from me.<eos> Please, do not make me betray my promise.<eos> I fear what she will do if I speak of her.<eos> Fear what I will do or won't do if you do not.<eos> She calls herself the Countess Ingrid Palatine Von Marburg.<eos> Shh. Shh.<eos> Her heart is so filled with hate.<eos> You let her pour her vitriol on me, not you.
What has love to do with marriage in such a world?<eos> I... I'm sorry. This is all very sudden, and the... the moment is very ill-timed.<eos> I fear I have no advice for you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As am I.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Surely God does not intend his flock to perish at the hands of devil worshipers and plague.<eos> Instead, I believe these are omens sent from the almighty to tell us we must all leave Salem continue our exodus south to the Carolinas, to a land which was settled and owned by my family for two generations,<eos> where the soil is fertile, where a puritan man may plant his seed and watch his family grow. Our promised land awaits.<eos> And so, humbly, I stand before you, divinely called to be your Moses and lead you there!
We seem always to be running into each other, don't we?<eos> Are you with the Herald?<eos> I think you know very well who I am.<eos> I do.<eos> Try me.<eos> You're a government agent.<eos> Close enough.<eos> I write with that hand.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I've been watching you.
But he says it was either me or her.<eos> You or her for what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honest.<eos> So, where is she now?<eos> With the others.<eos> Where?<eos> They just... go.<eos> Tomorrow we'll find you somewhere better to stay.<eos> I'd feel safer with you.
With Nick, that line's almost invisible.<eos> That's what he'd like you to believe.<eos> So you're getting ready for the big race?<eos> I don't race anymore.<eos> I just run.<eos> Offset of caffeine... and the stress of being a single parent.<eos> What?<eos> The whole town is talking about you.<eos> Okay...<eos> But if you were at the race, the whole town could talk to you.
- Well, he has his moments.<eos> God willing, I can string enough of them together to get him out of high school and into a college.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Hey, Abigail is great, by the way.<eos> Yeah. She's working for you at your office.<eos> She said it was your idea.<eos> Abigail can be a handful.<eos> I can handle her.<eos> Just make sure she's not handling you.
- Yeah.<eos> Bye, sweetheart.<eos> Bye.<eos> Seat belt.<eos> _<eos> Holy shit.<eos> How long?<eos> Were you dead?<eos> Eight hours.<eos> Is she still with you?

Why?<eos> I don't need a psychologist.<eos> I'm talking to you.
Yeah.<eos> Sort of breaks your heart to see him before all the bad choices.<eos> - I don't see what the big deal is.<eos> - He's the president's son, Ali!<eos> That kind of makes it a big deal.<eos> Plus, he really needs privacy right now.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Don't worry about what it means.<eos> Just take the picture down.<eos> Wait, are you freaking out because there actually is something going on between you and Harrison?
Indeed, that is the purpose of these wonderful meetings between our militaries.<eos> To keep the air clear.<eos> Especially in a time of such... unfortunate misunderstandings.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> It's an honor to be here.<eos> I'm gonna speak with you today about a subject that is of great importance to our two countries and our common civilization, and that is the roots of the two notions of righteous religious warfare or struggle.<eos> Namely, jihad in classical Islam, and in both Eastern and Western Christianity, the concept of crusade.<eos> Professor McCord, may I introduce the president of the Russian Federation and our supreme commander-in-chief,<eos> Pavel Ostrov.<eos> Professor McCord, it is an honor to meet you.
Hey, excuse me.<eos> Ah, was ist...?<eos> Er, you're in our bed.<eos> Huh? Er...you are in my wife's bed.<eos> Ja?<eos> Ja.<eos> Is that OK?<eos> Ja, warum nicht?<eos> Komm...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, not with you.
Yes.<eos> A pleasure to see you again, Madam Secretary.<eos> Especially under more pleasant circumstances.<eos> For some of us.<eos> Yes, well, thank God the coup is behind us, and, uh, we can focus on the future.<eos> Yes.<eos> Allow me to introduce Foreign Minister Rahimi.<eos> - Welcome, Minister Rahimi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's very nice to meet you.
Take this.<eos> - Sir, please hold still.<eos> - My wife.<eos> Your wife is fine, Sir.<eos> Just hold still.<eos> Here.<eos> Okay. Please lie back down.<eos> We need to check out this cut.<eos> My wife!<eos> Were you and your husband in an accident?
How much do nobodies make?<eos> I can top it.<eos> To make it worth my while?<eos> How about 50,000 livre?<eos> (chuckles)<eos> Is that all?<eos> Why not take my diamond earrings?<eos> They're worth 60.<eos> Seriously, what will it take?<eos> My lady, I would love to stay chatting with you all day, but I have other duties.
They're trying to tumble her from the throne.<eos> She needs to secure her position.<eos> Then why is she still interested in wedding a mere prince?<eos> She's not.<eos> No more dukes and princes for her.<eos> She's determined to wed a king.<eos> I see.<eos> Someone who can join his kingdom and power to hers, the perfect strategy.<eos> Yes.<eos> So I've been sent to inform you that Her Majesty still rejoices in the idea of marrying you, and she's ready to give you her backing, if you take the throne of France.
I can't.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Lady Kenna.<eos> I know what I want.<eos> ♪<eos> I think we'd be good together, perhaps have a future.<eos> This is sudden.<eos> Not really.<eos> You've been flirting with me since the day we met.<eos> You should know that if I choose to be with you, there are things in my past that I can't change.
If you prefer a demure flower or a virginal maid, you're free to sign a marriage contract to wed a noble's daughter whom you've never met.<eos> Kenna, I agree.<eos> We may have a promising future.<eos> Then let's see if we're good together.<eos> Is this a test?<eos> Impress me.<eos> ♪<eos> I spoke with Francis.<eos> I'm sorry, for what you're both going through.<eos> Now that things are over between you and Condé, you and Francis might...
You knew about this?<eos> That Condé was courting England?<eos> Because he felt he had no other choice.<eos> I abandoned him.<eos> Do you realize that by helping Condé escape,<eos> Elizabeth could have a foothold in France?<eos> Condé's army is loyal to him.<eos> If he becomes king consort of England, we will essentially have an enemy army on our soil.<eos> Mary, this is the most dangerous thing you have ever done.<eos> Her Majesty Elizabeth still rejoices in the idea of marrying you.
- Bertraud.<eos> - Father!<eos> My son.<eos> It's impossible... he was captured at the battle of Calais by the English.<eos> You have the backing of England.<eos> I hate to use a man's son as a bargaining chip, but Queen Elizabeth insisted.<eos> Help me take down King Francis and Elizabeth will release your son.<eos> And you could become general to all France's armies under the new order.<eos> The new king.<eos> You.
God willing, we'll be home soon.<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> Before you go, I want John to have something.<eos> This was mine when I was a babe.<eos> My mother says that it should be passed on to my royal heir.<eos> I know that John will never be king, but he should know who his father was, and that I claimed him to the world as my own.<eos> If anything were to happen, tell him every day how much his father loved him.<eos> I will, I promise.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I won't be needing a teary farewell, as I'm staying in the castle as long as you are.
She has my son, Kenna.<eos> Queen Elizabeth holds Bertraud captive.<eos> I saw him with my own eyes.<eos> She blackmailed me, through Condé.<eos> Betraying the crown against my will was the only chance I had of saving his life.<eos> And now that you've failed...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Truly.<eos> I meant everything I said.<eos> I wanted a life with you.

In the cocoons, we were back with our families and now we are stuck here, again, because of you, because of Melanie.<eos> You gonna do something about it?<eos> Look, I-I promise you, I'll find Melanie.<eos> All right?<eos> I'll get us all the answers that we need.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I lost my home, too.<eos> If you have a house, open your doors.<eos> Let's share what we have.<eos> The last time I stood in front of you, I urged you to find strength in community.
No need for that mask.<eos> Malick?<eos> Aktaion's inside the dome.<eos> I wanted to thank you for yesterday.<eos> If you hadn't shown up, Melanie would've killed me.<eos> Thank God that you were looking for food in exactly the right spot.<eos> Yeah, it was a lucky coincidence.<eos> Hunter, Norrie.<eos> Where's Joe?<eos> I thought that he was with you.
Drop it!<eos> Put it down!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Tell them to drop the weapons.<eos> Weapons down.<eos> We're all friends here.<eos> You will lead the team to Christine Price while Mr. Rennie and I continue our conversation on the whereabouts of the egg.<eos> The hell I am.<eos> Very sorry, Mr. Rennie, but you made a promise to me.<eos> Share information with me, and I share information with you.
Wealth, power, status.<eos> She simply wanted to die in the place she cherished most.<eos> And to take back what I had taken from her.<eos> I'm here because I have one question.<eos> How did she bypass your security?<eos> I've seen behind the curtain, remember?<eos> So has she.<eos> She managed to steal some information from us.<eos> Nolan's specs on my alarm must have been among the things she got.<eos> Well, at least this war's over between you two.
Oh.<eos> There is one caveat, though.<eos> I'm more of a Tequila guy.<eos> But I'm confident we can work past our differences.<eos> You worried about your dad?<eos> - Of course I'm not.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because we need to focus on you for the moment.<eos> Do you really think I blew up my house to kill Victoria?<eos> Well, there was certainly no love lost between the two of you, and it's pretty clear that someone overpowered her in her penthouse.
Give me your keys.<eos> If what you're saying is true, then you should have no problem with me checking your car for Mason's fingerprints.<eos> Fine.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> You can leave the room.<eos> Just don't leave town.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was called back for questioning.<eos> Apparently when you leave town the night someone you openly hate is killed, it looks a little suspicious.<eos> They already talk to you?
How are you doing?<eos> Thanks for coming over and doing it here.<eos> That's how I always did it with my old guy.<eos> You know, I always thought it was easier to write a big check to the government over a glass of scotch and a nice cigar.<eos> Speaking of which,<eos> I just received this fine box from the Dominican Republic.<eos> Is your wife around?<eos> Kathryn, no.<eos> She lets me do the honors as far as taxes are concerned.<eos> I'd really like to talk with both of you.
- Nothing.<eos> Then go.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, go!<eos> Okay, you may feel a little sting here, but we are almost done, okay?<eos> No, I could tell right away there was a problem.<eos> The pitch, the... the air speed, and I'm wondering, where does this pilot think he's gonna land this bird?<eos> But then it's too late.<eos> The thing just roars right over my head and crashed in the street right behind me.<eos> Right behind you?

Today's Thursday-- he volunteers at the Gay and Lesbian Center.<eos> Oh, he's just getting in a few hate crimes before dinner?<eos> Well, you know what they say:<eos> one man's hate crime is another man's justice.<eos> Is that what they say?<eos> You think that badge puts a white hat on your heads?<eos> You're as much the enemy as Al Qaeda, far as we're concerned.<eos> Your "enemy" is trying to save a decorated war veteran.<eos> Or do you consider a Marine who tries to save your sorry ass the enemy, too?<eos> It's been real nice chattin' with you.
I don't give a... what?<eos> Too much.<eos> I mean, that would be great.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Captain.<eos> Detective Diaz.<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> I see.<eos> I just wanted to say thank you.<eos> Talking to you was really helpful.
Detective David Majors is already on the case.<eos> Whoa, Dave Majors?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Who's that?<eos> He's The best detective in the NYPD, myself included.<eos> His arrest numbers are staggering.<eos> His conviction rate is magnificent.<eos> He is blotter dynamite.<eos> I mean, I'm cool.<eos> I'm just hanging out with you guys.
Interesting.<eos> Barrel Proof bourbon, neat orange stood a chaser.<eos> Well, to the first of many hangs.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> Listen, the reason I brought you here is, I want to ask you, what's the deal with Santiago?<eos> Amy?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Did she do something weird?<eos> No, no, she's great.<eos> I just want to know if there's something going on with you two.
Guys, I just got off the phone with the hospital.<eos> Marta Rodriguez woke up and checked herself out almost a week ago.<eos> Damn it.<eos> So it was Marta I saw give Justin the envelope.<eos> - You're positive it was that tattoo?<eos> - I am.<eos> It has to be Marta.<eos> She's the only person beside us that has access.<eos> Then find her... from inside the lab, people.<eos> If she took a shot at me, who's to say she won't go after one of you?
Excuse me.<eos> Now I want to ask you about a bunch of photographs and stuff.<eos> Some of it's all stuff... Some of it's stuff you've seen before, because some of it I got from you.<eos> Um, but for us to... That's me and my yellow horse.<eos> We're in Central Park.<eos> This one is you and Kathie.<eos> Could this be at her mother's house?<eos> Might be in Vermont.<eos> I still have the long bangs type... What was it, Viking something or other hair.<eos> This is an interesting picture of you and Susan.
We talked to all the neighbors.<eos> Nobody saw anyone entering or leaving the house.<eos> We just got word that Christine Harper recently filed a TRO against her ex-husband Brian Mitchell.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Unit's picking him up.<eos> Agent Gregg, uh, your serial killer theory, we're gonna start digging into that.<eos> I would never hurt Christine!<eos> I loved her!<eos> She was my wife!<eos> Who divorced you and filed a restraining order against you.
I loved her!<eos> She was my wife!<eos> Who divorced you and filed a restraining order against you.<eos> OK.<eos> I admit I was a little aggressive in my effort to get her back.<eos> You left threatening messages on her phone, you followed her to her work, you sat outside her house, you terrified the woman you claim to love.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> I... I... I would take it back if I could.<eos> I... I... I was upset!<eos> Why did she divorce you?
Tell me about Brian.<eos> He's a mess.<eos> The guy can't keep it in his pants.<eos> He is a total sex addict.<eos> He means well, but if he's not having sex, he doesn't know who he is.<eos> Polyamory isn't just about sex.<eos> It's about living your life with multiple loving partners.<eos> Were you aware that he was going to sex addiction meetings?<eos> Yeah, what good it did.<eos> Was there anyone in his meetings that took an interest in Brian or his relationship with you and Christine, anyone that stuck out as odd?
As soon as Stan's verdict is overturned and the case is reopened, you will be the first suspect they go to.<eos> I didn't kill Sharon, and I am done defending myself to you.<eos> Where were you two nights ago?<eos> Oh. What are you talking about?<eos> It's just a question.<eos> At the office, working late.<eos> And why is it any of your damn business?<eos> You've lost your mind.<eos> I'm sorry I even came.<eos> Janice: We wanted to talk to you about Jamie Toliver.
Well, it depends on how you define "relationship."<eos> As in relating to other people.<eos> - This is about<eos> Petra Moritz?<eos> Seriously?<eos> - No, it's not about Petra per se.<eos> It's about a journalistic culture that increasingly kicks sand over ethical boundaries...<eos> Of course, Petra wants to go with this story tomorrow, so if you wanted to scoop her, you'd have to get something out tonight.<eos> Yes.<eos> So... if there was nothing going on between you and your boss, how do you explain these e-mails?
I may have bribed a certain crick waitress to give me the phone number for Rosemary Ritter, your sister, and that's her house!<eos> You talked to my sister?<eos> Yes, I did, and she's waiting right in there for you!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess this had to happen sometime.<eos> Go tell her I'm coming in.<eos> I need a minute to collect myself.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Well, why didn't you say so, honey?<eos> Come on in!<eos> Oh, it's always good seeing family.<eos> I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> I don't know what I thought would happen.<eos> I don't mean to be judgmental, but you don't seem to think too hard before you jump into things.<eos> Well, not when it comes to healing family.<eos> I got to admit, I never thought I'd see the day when Peggy would come back to Mudlick.<eos> I figured the next time we'd meet, there'd be six feet of dirt between us and one of us would be dancing.<eos> What in the world happened between you two?
Next week, if we could get box seats to a Nationals game, they'd be over the moon.<eos> We never go full bore on the perks.<eos> We should absolutely get box seats to the Nationals.<eos> Well, I-I've been saying since day one.<eos> How nice was it to hear Stevie be supportive of her mother?<eos> Whom she no longer hates, apparently.<eos> As predicted by someone on Team McCord.<eos> Okay, reel it in, Captain.<eos> You were right.<eos> She also seems to like you okay, so, we both win.
Figured Boyd found them, someone else might be coming, too?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Or perhaps the fact that Ruby has not been cut signals a much greater threat.<eos> The Internet is designed with redundancies.<eos> Cutting a single cable would no doubt cause some problems, but a coordinated attack, that could be crippling.<eos> You think there might be other guys digging up other cables, waiting for a signal to cut them all at once?<eos> I think it's a possibility that we should consider.<eos> I'll reach out to DHS.<eos> Let them know what's going on.<eos> I'll check back with you.
There's lots of people out there that need us tonight so just sensible, please, don't go mad.<eos> Would you open that for us?<eos> I know you won't, but if you ever feel like ringing me, this is me number.<eos> Oh, thanks, Liz.<eos> I'll have to give you mine.<eos> Oh, that's all right, Andy.<eos> I know where you are.<eos> Oh, thank you, Valerie.<eos> Oh, that's kind.<eos> What about you two?
Indeed, Countess.<eos> Wendell Hathorne.<eos> I... I'm most pleased to make your acquaintance.<eos> Wendell Hathorne.<eos> The same Wendell Hathorne whose name is spoken of in the most respected halls in Boston?<eos> Even in London, in the court of King William and his wife, Mary.<eos> I... I do not know that I...<eos> But I will shield the king's court from your drunken revelry...<eos> And the scandalous rumors that you intend to uproot the good people of Salem and plant them in a less holy land, the Carolinas, seeing as the humble man I see before me cannot be capable of such treason.<eos> I... I am most indebted to you, Countess.
Would it not be prudent to allow such feelings to settle, to fully blossom, before, uh, asserting such declarations so freely?<eos> I have raised fist against another man out of the robust feelings I have.<eos> I have... I have spent a night in the dank jail.<eos> I... I fear it is all my fault.<eos> There is no fault to be had.<eos> I've never felt so alive as I do right now.<eos> I mean, why... why delay saying what I know in my heart?<eos> I must ask if you have enjoyed an excess of spirits again.<eos> No.<eos> If I am drunk, it's on a much rarer spirit... you.
Rights.<eos> Da?<eos> Well, what about the rights of that girl you murdered?<eos> No talk!<eos> No talk!<eos> NOPD's on the way.<eos> You tell 'em to bring a translator?<eos> 'Cause I can't understand a word Baryshnikov here is saying.<eos> I was gonna take a semester in Moscow, but it's too cold.<eos> Why I should talk to you?
And on the end...<eos> "Because you won't release the truth about Nate, I'm releasing everything I've gotten my hands on"?<eos> Well, is there any proof he's really got something?<eos> There it is.<eos> Is that a flash drive?<eos> What's on that?<eos> Payback.<eos> What is this?<eos> Captain Dawson.<eos> You're a hard man to get ahold of.
I thought you said no-one ever comes here!<eos> They don't, that's why we bought the place.<eos> No, it's OK. It's OK.<eos> It's OK. Um...<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> You must be Rhonda.<eos> You must be Arnold.<eos> Scotty, a word.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> - It's nice to finally meet you.
A little more on my forehead.<eos> It looks shiny.<eos> Seven salty sailors sailed the seven seas.<eos> Seven salty sailors sailed the seven seas.<eos> Seventy-seven salty sailors sailed the seven seas.<eos> Are you comfortable with the speech, sir?<eos> Sure!<eos> I've done this a million times!<eos> Five, four...<eos> My fellow citizens, I am proud to be speaking to you from Operation Saviour mission control.
Uh, to whom do we have the pleasure?<eos> Good morning, Ducky.<eos> Well... all we have is Lolita for the female victim.<eos> And the male is Petty Officer 2nd Class<eos> Daniel Harvey.<eos> Notify his commanding officer.<eos> On it.<eos> The gunfire appears to have been concentrated on the female.<eos> But I'll have an accurate idea when you're done with Agent McGee.<eos> Huh? He's lurking behind you.
Yeah, what's it say?<eos> The admiral needs to see you right now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's already on his way.<eos> Okay, what do we have?<eos> The identity of our petty officer.<eos> I've brought in our ambassador to Colombia.<eos> She has news, as well.<eos> Ambassador Edmunds.<eos> Agent Gibbs, nice to finally meet you in person, as it were.
So...<eos> You win.<eos> Just like that.<eos> I was retiring anyway.<eos> I was announcing it at that meeting you tried to crash.<eos> And I can see that you don't trust me.<eos> The beauty is... you don't need to.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> I didn't make that bomb.<eos> Whoever did found out that you're after him and he is playing you.

You had access to Orlando's computer for weeks, and you neglected to tell us?<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say?<eos> The connection's getting fuzzy.<eos> Get me the Secretary of State.<eos> Tell him it's an emergency.<eos> I need to speak with him as soon as possible.<eos> Call Diplomatic Security at Foggy Bottom, tell him that we have a situation with Ambassador Edmunds.<eos> MPs caught up with her in the parking lot.<eos> Turned herself in.<eos> Says she wants to talk to you.
Says she wants to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, well, feeling's mutual.<eos> I want to make a deal.<eos> Oh, I'll bet you do.<eos> We don't have much time, you know that.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> Not without a deal.<eos> You're protecting a terrorist.<eos> Talk, and I will see if I can help.<eos> They will never give you a deal.
Because now it's your time, you know.<eos> The universe gives us many gifts.<eos> It's whether or not we receive them.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Receive the gift.<eos> - This job is always surprising me.<eos> - I'm so alone.<eos> - Okay, Bill...<eos> - You know... - We're with you...<eos> You know, you and I... we're not in the same business.
- A standoff? - Uh-huh.<eos> If that escalates, it'll be catnip for the Yao-guai.<eos> Go.<eos> We'll follow close behind with a plan of attack.<eos> You keep me posted?<eos> Miss Jenny?<eos> Guns, knives, things that go boom.<eos> We're back in the demon-fighting business, we're gonna need 'em.<eos> We got the place surrounded, but he has four hostages.<eos> And he wants to talk to you.
That's the only way we're gonna find out who ordered the rape.<eos> What about the book?<eos> Gene said a book was stolen.<eos> Maybe we should look into that piece.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry, did I say something wrong?<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> It's just who I got to ask.<eos> Jocelyn, hang on a second.<eos> I need to ask you about something.

I'm not talking to you.
You believe I'm anointed, right?<eos> I'm your Solomon.<eos> You believe that?<eos> - I do, but...<eos> - Well, then fucking trust me.<eos> This is what God wants.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> He needs to be in a hospital.<eos> Uh, we... we can't.<eos> I... I'm sure Mayor Boston talked to you.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
You look more hipster than homeless.<eos> Did the Machine have any instructions for me?<eos> She said just be honest.<eos> Hello, Doctor?<eos> I need to admit this man on a TDO.<eos> 72-hour involuntary hold.<eos> He's an increasingly dangerous paranoid schizophrenic.<eos> Unless he'd care to disagree?<eos> It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you.<eos> Who exactly is after you?
Read the literature.<eos> What was all that about?<eos> If we can't change the way we farm within two months, the WAEC will take over the farm and we'll be evicted.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Seems I can't stop anyone doing anything they want round here any more.<eos> Now we have to grow what they want, how they want. With records and charts, and God knows what.<eos> What's he asked you to do?<eos> Farmers farm.<eos> They don't need to be wasting time on paperwork.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more.
Love is not something you run out of.<eos> What we do doesn't have to get in the way of how you feel about Crystal.<eos> We just need to find a way to make it fit.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> All right, little closer, here we go, and...<eos> All right, yeah, we'll post that with a shout-out.<eos> And you can re-gram it.<eos> You are on social, right?<eos> Oh, you bet.<eos> Instagram, Twitter, Vine, Facebook, it's really helped fuel our recent growth, but this, having you here is the biggest thing that's ever happened for Hand of God Chapel.
Hearing what?<eos> A joke?<eos> That's not a joke and you know it.<eos> PJ's not here to testify to state-of-mind.<eos> The guy who shot the video can.<eos> That's what Mr. Miller is doing here.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Is that why you're here, Josh?<eos> Why do we have to drag this out?<eos> Your son is talking to you.
Shut your fucking mouth.<eos> You know, you're pissing me off now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think it's time for you to leave.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not asking.<eos> Fine, I'll... I'll go.<eos> Be gone when I get back.<eos> I can't let you leave.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
This is all too much to deal with at once.<eos> No, we've pissed off enough people this year.<eos> I can do this.<eos> Look at me.<eos> He's not there.<eos> Oh, he's there.<eos> He's just not real.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I need to talk to you.
For a small gift of $12, you can receive your own DVD copy of Reverend Paul's series<eos> "One True Freedom," four hours that will knock your empty life and point you to the prosperity and peace of mind that comes with true freedom.<eos> Praise God.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was wondering if you knew where I could find Keith.<eos> No.<eos> I'm actually on my way out, so...<eos> Well, if you did know, would you tell me?<eos> Probably not.<eos> I guess I deserve that... after the way I talked to you.
You've been with me in hundreds of interrogations.<eos> Yeah, just never when my life depended on it, along with everyone else's.<eos> Hey, guys, I have more bad news.<eos> According to the airline, Haddad has a checked bag on the flight.<eos> F.B.I. needs you to locate and search it.<eos> Great.<eos> And if we find something?<eos> In the event there's an explosive device, the bomb squad will talk you through it.<eos> We need to find his luggage.<eos> - I'll go with you.
Oh, I think I've said enough, don't you?<eos> I've done enough damage, talking.<eos> I'm just gonna stick to the visuals from now on.<eos> The police talked to us after they brought you out of that place.<eos> They told us what it was like.<eos> Not in detail.<eos> So you didn't see?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> 'We all want the person who did that to you' 'caught and punished.'
If it weren't for my big mouth, he might've had a reprieve.<eos> That's not what Miss Baxter says.<eos> She wasn't there.<eos> Have you finished your order list?<eos> I'll send them out this afternoon.<eos> I'll take them up to Mr Bakewell.<eos> I'm going into the village later.<eos> That's kind.<eos> I think I'll walk down to the Home Farm myself.<eos> I'll join you.
Goodness, this is a job for a one-man band.<eos> You're a delicate-looking fella, aren't you?<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> Are you married?<eos> No. Why would that be?<eos> Did the right girl never come along?<eos> I think you know that not many footmen or butlers are married.<eos> Well, they didn't used to be.<eos> All right, Mr Barrow, I've got enough.<eos> We'll let you know.
I see I'm not needed to lend you strength.<eos> You're fully in command of the argument.<eos> Have you no pride in what we have achieved with our hospital?<eos> I don't think pride comes into it.<eos> Well, I warn you, Dr Clarkson and I will fight to the last ditch.<eos> I just want what's best for the village.<eos> Well, at least we have that in common.<eos> I must go.<eos> Mama, Isobel...<eos> I'll come with you.
Don't worry, she's just wandered off. She's fine.<eos> She'll be perfectly fine, you'll see.<eos> What is it?<eos> Marigold's gone.<eos> I was talking to your wife and Marigold was just in front of us.<eos> How could I possibly have lost sight of her?<eos> Stay with your mother.<eos> Everyone spread out.<eos> Carson!<eos> I'm coming with you.
I made you a promise back then and it still holds.<eos> As long as I am breathing, you will be safe.<eos> We'll, we'll make our way to Key Diego.<eos> We'll buy a boat and anchor up along the coast line.<eos> I hear it's rich with sea otter.<eos> A simple life.<eos> I find the notion very attractive.<eos> Yes. I married well.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I am very proud of all of you.
No. I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I want to hear what he has to say.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> See, here's my dilemma.<eos> Everything you say sounds perfectly reasonable.<eos> You were prisoners, forced to collude with the enemy to keep your son alive.<eos> A plausible story that, taken on face value,<eos> I can understand. Hell, I can even sympathize with you.<eos> Well, that's very decent of you.<eos> It does not, however, explain the fact that you committed acts of terror and treason against the people of Defiance.
Would you tell Dr Timoney?<eos> Dr Timoney.<eos> Oh. You're very young.<eos> - Have you been fighting?<eos> - Of course I haven't.<eos> Well, you are here.<eos> Eventually.<eos> So I suppose you might be serious.<eos> Come through.<eos> I only have time to arrange a schedule with you today now.
I am.<eos> You're doing the right thing, Mills.<eos> We got your back no matter what, brother.<eos> We just had to make sure you were sure.<eos> You were a born firefighter.<eos> You've been an asset to this house on every level.<eos> I knew leaving here would be hard, but...<eos> You are not leaving.<eos> You are gonna carry 51 with you wherever you go.<eos> I'm so proud of you guys.
No, no... Oh, oh.<eos> Oh, you look good.<eos> Hey, Casey, get in here, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's here! [Cheers and applause]<eos> Buddy!<eos> (Cruz) Speech, speech, speech!<eos> Man, I suck at these kind of things.<eos> I just wanted to say thank you.<eos> Working side by side with all of you, it... I have learned a hell of a lot more than just how to do the job.
I'm sorry.<eos> This is kind of part of the no... no filter thing.<eos> Well, can you tell me how you've coped with your condition?<eos> I have had excellent doctors and therapists, and Ed devised tricks to help me function as an independent person.<eos> I mean, I still have trouble comprehending emotional and social cues, but I...<eos> I think I'm getting better at it.<eos> You know, I owe Ed so much.<eos> I loved him like a father.<eos> Well, it's important for people like you to have a good support system of friends.<eos> And tell me about the young man who was with you here yesterday.
You know, I owe Ed so much.<eos> I loved him like a father.<eos> Well, it's important for people like you to have a good support system of friends.<eos> And tell me about the young man who was with you here yesterday.<eos> Oh, Cameron?<eos> Is he your boyfriend?<eos> Oh, no. No.<eos> He... he's nobody.<eos> Well, you're a very interesting case, Ms. Clark.<eos> Now if... if you're up for it, I'd like to begin some initial treatments with you today.
What?<eos> Come on!<eos> You're a genius.<eos> George, you don't have to do this.<eos> If you hadn't lied to us, we wouldn't have to.<eos> We?<eos> You brought this upon yourself.<eos> - You are a fraud.<eos> - Well, it takes one to know one.<eos> The treatment doesn't work yet, at least not with the instant results like the ones you faked.
- Yes.<eos> Tad O'Malley.<eos> And you must be former agent Dana Scully.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's... quite an entrance you make there.<eos> She shot men with less provocation.<eos> Funny.<eos> I heard you were funny.<eos> Join me for a little ride?<eos> I'd be happy to talk to you, Mr. O'Malley, but right here is fine.
Our son Aleem.<eos> He left a note apologizing for not being honest with us, that he was going to the ER to finish his quest.<eos> His quest?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Is he alive?<eos> Oh. Oh, no.<eos> [crying] - Ma'am?<eos> - It's all right, officers.<eos> (Goodwin) Come in. Come in, please.<eos> I think the police may want to speak with you.
And that you are very sorry for what you did because you knew it was wrong.<eos> - Jesus, John...<eos> - That's the truth.<eos> Right?<eos> Yes.<eos> She never woke up.<eos> She never woke up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, let's get you home.<eos> What happened to you?
Yes.<eos> She never woke up.<eos> She never woke up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, let's get you home.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I know your daughter is missing and that's terrible, I'm sorry, but you were like this before that.<eos> You're angry at this place.<eos> What happened to you?
- Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Is this the home of Evangeline Murphy?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Gracias.<eos> - [beeps] - Hey!<eos> - Nora Durst?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hello, my name is Dr. Joaquin Cuarto.<eos> May I speak to you for a few minutes?
You slept through it?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you think this is about?<eos> What do you think this is about?<eos> Wait, babe, where you going?<eos> To get a broom and dustpan.<eos> - Erika: Who is it?<eos> - It's him again.<eos> Mr. Murphy, can I speak to you for one moment?
Oh, is there a good place to get breakfast?<eos> The tourist stuff is getting old.<eos> Try Smitty's.<eos> There's no sign outside.<eos> There's a green awning across from the guy on the pillar.<eos> - Smitty's. Thanks.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs. Murphy.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Can you make a fist?<eos> I want a copy of your report.<eos> The rangers want a list of my injuries when I go in to describe my attackers.<eos> One of them black, 40, clean-cut?<eos> He's the one that hit you the hardest?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's john Murphy.<eos> Maybe you let him slide just this once.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because I have plans tonight and I don't want to miss them Because I'm back in here fixing you up again.
Who is this?<eos> It's Laurie Garvey.<eos> Nora, are you there?<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> On the internet.<eos> It's really easy to unlist if you want.<eos> I'm sorry to call you. I know it's not fair, But I just need to know, is Tom there?<eos> - Tom?<eos> - My son, Tommy.<eos> Is he there with you in Texas?
And if not for an act of divine intervention, you'd be gone.<eos> Why are we losing?<eos> Because they're giving them something.<eos> We can strip it away, but once it's gone, we have nothing to put back in its place.<eos> Well, let's give them something.<eos> Who wants a hug?<eos> I know you go out there to pray with him.<eos> Do you know what your father would do if he found out?<eos> Shoot him again?<eos> My son, Tommy, is he there with you?
We can't do it because I don't want to do it.<eos> What?<eos> Listen, I think you're amazing.<eos> But we barely know each other and...<eos> I don't know if I love you yet.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks for the talk, Reverend.<eos> All right, I know this one.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Hey, I'll be with you in just a sec.
What the fuck is she doing here?<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, nothing, nothing.<eos> Michael was...<eos> Michael was just leaving.<eos> God be with you.
I smoke to remember.<eos> Remember what?<eos> That the world ended.<eos> Uncuff him.<eos> Mm, my manners.<eos> Thirsty?<eos> No.<eos> The senator is arriving imminently.<eos> Why don't you go freshen up?<eos> We'll come get you when she's ready.
Whoa. Whoa. Don't fucking put it out.<eos> I'm still talking to him.<eos> You've got to take her to the well.<eos> What well?<eos> Son, you have to be strong.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Senator Levin's ready to see you now.
And we all know who tricks are for.<eos> Kids.<eos> I'm gonna use the restroom.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Standing by.<eos> She's here.<eos> Hello, hello, hello.<eos> Senator, this is Kevin Garvey.<eos> Kevin?<eos> So nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you, too.<eos> Would you like some water, Senator?<eos> Never touch the stuff.<eos> Kevin, I'm sorry about all the security.<eos> I don't know if Gladys told you, but we received credible intelligence that someone may be trying to assassinate me.<eos> Now why do you think someone would want to do that?<eos> Murder me?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> It's because I stick to you, Kevin.
That's better. Hey, now that is some pretty nifty singing.<eos> Give yourselves a hand.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, folks, thanks for coming out to visit us.<eos> Please forgive us as we're a little rough around the edges right now.<eos> We've only been up and running for a couple of months.<eos> On your left as you get off, there'll be golf carts and audio tours.<eos> And please make sure we see those wristbands at all times.<eos> Now, the park closes at sundown.<eos> So if you ain't on that last bus, we're gonna come hunt you down.
- Guards!<eos> - Lady Riesen, are you okay?<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> On your knees.<eos> Up.<eos> Let's go, move.<eos> We'll double your security tonight, ma'am.<eos> New Delphi base, this is security vehicle 259 requesting entry into northeast tunnel.<eos> New Delphi convoy, we have a visual on you.
Please don't hold back.<eos> What happened?<eos> They got a lead.<eos> A real lead.<eos> I know what you're going through, Paige.<eos> You're scared.<eos> You feel hopeless.<eos> You don't even know who to trust.<eos> Alex took you a very long time ago.<eos> He did horrible, horrible things to you.
Alex took you a very long time ago.<eos> He did horrible, horrible things to you.<eos> He raped you, tortured you.<eos> Then all of a sudden, he'd be nice.<eos> Shut up, you don't know him.<eos> Your life was literally dependent on him.<eos> So you eventually did whatever he asked you to do.<eos> Cleaned, cooked, helped with his abductions.<eos> In your mind, your past life was lost.<eos> But you had the one person you loved most with you.
- I forgive you anyway.<eos> - I can't have a drink.<eos> I'd love to, but I can't.<eos> My editor has walked out.<eos> I have to get the magazine to the printers by four in the morning.<eos> So it's sandwiches and coffee and work until dawn.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You're a darling. Thank you.<eos> Do telephone me if and when you're up in London again.<eos> No, I meant all right, I'll come with you.
I knew I couldn't fool these people for long, so I figured I'd empty Barlow's bank account, and get out of here as fast as I could.<eos> But first I had to crack his password.<eos> Jonathan, my friend, looks like you had a good life.<eos> Sorry it had to end.<eos> Now how the hell do I get your money?<eos> Come on, Rusty.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Hi-ya.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Marla Simmons, a congregant, is here to see you.
- Bonnie.<eos> It's freaking "Lord of the Flies" out there.<eos> - They're scared.<eos> - But is it true?<eos> The puppy went attack dog on you today?<eos> Acting out in class doesn't make him a killer, Frank.<eos> Where you going?<eos> To get us a murder case that didn't happen in this house.<eos> The worst part of a murder charge in Pennsylvania... The death penalty is still legal.<eos> So if I were a hardworking, low-income parent, like most of the people on a Philadelphia jury, I'd relish giving you the needle.
I don't know.<eos> Mr. Bishop is very interested in her whereabouts.<eos> Do you happen to have any idea where that might be?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, you didn't need to bring me the whole bottle.<eos> I always think these things are such a waste, just ending up in a landfill somewhere.<eos> I recycle.<eos> So, Kalinda's gone from her apartment, her cell phone's off.<eos> No one seems to know where she is.<eos> And yet in court two days ago, you said Kalinda talked to you about your case.
Yes, you do. Louis Canning.<eos> I used my maiden name in the interview because I wanted to get this job on my own.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, just to be clear, we're often in competition with your husband.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I am completely discreet.<eos> Completely.<eos> You can totally trust me.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
Really?<eos> I thought he was in jail.<eos> He is, yes.<eos> Uh, thus the disappointment in his current representation.<eos> So, uh, where's that great little investigator - you have around here? - Kalinda doesn't work here<eos> - anymore. - Where does she work?<eos> We don't know.<eos> She left.<eos> Well, let me, uh, - leave you my number. - Certainly.<eos> Oh, and if, uh, Kalinda gets in touch with you, you can reach me at this number, - day or night.
Oh, and if, uh, Kalinda gets in touch with you, you can reach me at this number, - day or night.<eos> - Talk to you soon.<eos> He's after Kalinda?<eos> Yes.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Are we in trouble?<eos> - Are we moving?<eos> No, your mom and I just wanted to run something by you.
In Mr. Bishop's line of work, those are very suspicious acts.<eos> I read the writing on the wall.<eos> Really?<eos> What writing was that?<eos> Dexter was blaming me for Bishop's arrest.<eos> Well, I will admit, my suspicions fall between him and you.<eos> But Dexter has the advantage because he's actually here, talking to Mr. Bishop.<eos> You're not.<eos> Hey! Pizza in the Wall it is.<eos> I'll make a deal with you, Mr. Lester.
I just was knocking on your door.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Do you have a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you want me to wait here?<eos> No, come on in.<eos> I hate to return to old subjects, but, uh, Kalinda promised to meet with Mr. Bishop yesterday, and she never showed up.<eos> Do you know what happened?<eos> No.<eos> Well, has Kalinda been in touch with you?
I have no objection.<eos> All right, I will sign an exhumation order.<eos> But I don't want to see any of you in my chambers again until you have concrete evidence.<eos> Angela's particle scanner uses similar technology to what was used to read through the layers of the Herculaneum charred scrolls.<eos> Yeah, think of it as a high-pressure X-ray.<eos> It should be able to determine the force applied to these fractures, and hopefully prove Brennan's theory.<eos> I can't believe your country still executes prisoners.<eos> I believe it's your country now, too.<eos> Yeah, and if you want to prevent the death of an innocent man, I suggest you familiarize yourself with these case files.<eos> And the 824 bones before you, because Mr. Rockwell will be dead in 36 hours and 16 minutes.
- I'm Finn Polmar. I'm here on behalf of Kalinda Sharma, of Mr. Agos' law firm.<eos> And I'm here on behalf of Diane Lockhart, senior partner.<eos> Before this committee decides on this matter, we'd like to be heard.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but you haven't been subpoenaed or called by anyone connected with this case...<eos> Yes, and I know how valuable your time must be.<eos> We have information that will serve to clear Detective Prima.<eos> What information?<eos> Members of the Board.<eos> And, uh, yes, it is true.<eos> I submitted false evidence to the court, for which I apologize to you and to Detective Prima.
- If Tilden lost his seat, we would have lost our supermajority in the state senate.<eos> The Republicans would've been able to filibuster.<eos> You see now why we need you to withdraw?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> If the recount goes through, it draws attention to Tilden's win.<eos> So, the hacking device was for Tilden?<eos> - I can't comment on that.<eos> - I'm not withdrawing.<eos> I understand your position, Mrs. Florrick, but your sacrifice will not go unnoticed.<eos> The party will make it up to you in the next round.
This is happening right now.<eos> Liza!<eos> Enough.<eos> - Okay, we gotta go.<eos> - This is important.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You're important, okay?<eos> Christopher, listen to your father.<eos> Christopher, now!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Liza!<eos> Enough.<eos> - Okay, we gotta go.<eos> - This is important.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You're important, okay?<eos> Christopher, listen to your father.<eos> Christopher, now!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
That wasn't his wife anymore.<eos> Is it contagious, the blood?<eos> Is that how it happens?<eos> Have you or anyone in this house been exposed?<eos> No.<eos> What's that?<eos> Our dog died.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> Folks, get back inside.<eos> We will come to you.
Cease your hostile action and return to your home.<eos> Tell me where she is, you asshole!<eos> Come out here, you coward.<eos> I'm gonna show you hostile.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> You know they're not here to protect us.<eos> You've seen what they do.<eos> When are you gonna step up?<eos> Huh? When they come for you?
She's just been a little moody lately.<eos> I think she's having some mean-girl issues at school.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> Good, 'cause she won't talk to me about it, or anything, really. It's not like with...<eos> I mean, I was always able to...<eos> I know.<eos> Me too.<eos> Dr. Tyler?<eos> Dr. Richmond would like to see you right away.
That's just...<eos> - Wrong. - Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Garcia.<eos> Mr. Garcia, Dr. Tyler.<eos> Glad to see you're doing better.<eos> You ever seen this guy?<eos> We're chatting with Peter Van Owen, world-renowned author, psychic, and medium.<eos> Hello.<eos> So, these spirits, they actually speak to you?
If there's a photo, she might be wearing a green scarf. Does this have anything to do with our investigation?<eos> I'm not sure yet.<eos> It depends on what you find.<eos> Should I go now?<eos> Please.<eos> Luke, what are you doing here?<eos> What happened?<eos> Uh, nothing. Uh, I<eos> - I-I fell.<eos> Yeah, the steps get slippery when it rains. My... my intern's been trying to reach you. You didn't return his call.
Please.<eos> Luke, what are you doing here?<eos> What happened?<eos> Uh, nothing. Uh, I<eos> - I-I fell.<eos> Yeah, the steps get slippery when it rains. My... my intern's been trying to reach you. You didn't return his call.<eos> - I've been busy. I should go.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Look, I love her, Dr. Tyler, but when she's feeling jealous, I-I just...<eos> Wait, are you saying that Elena did this to you?
No ghosts this time."<eos> It was a man with a serious medical issue who believed that his wife came back to be with him. So, it's a ghost story?<eos> Mm, it's more of a love story, I think.<eos> - Yes, I need to speak with you. - Can it wait?<eos> We're just in the middle of...<eos> You spoke of my reasons for coming to this country.<eos> I did come here to learn to be a doctor... Just like you, a good doctor. What, I'm just a good doctor?<eos> I think I'm a lot...<eos> During my time already, I have worked with you to save the life of a man who had been shot through the heart. I have helped repair the lungs of a fetus still in her mother's womb. I have done things that I- I<eos> - I never thought possible, and I want to continue to do these things to grow as a doctor, but I can only do that and explore this mystery of what comes after life with you.
I should get in.<eos> I mustn't keep Mr Branson waiting.<eos> - Before her Ladyship?<eos> - Here she is now.<eos> Good evening, Bates.<eos> Don't worry, we'll be back before you know it.<eos> What's Lady Mary's emergency?<eos> - It's none of our business.<eos> - Very true, Miss Baxter.<eos> For once I agree with you.
It'd be better if it's a fait accompli.<eos> We don't have to do everything Mary says.<eos> Not when we're all agreed.<eos> Maybe it's underhand to go behind her back. But it's much too important to me to let scruples get in the way.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> - Your Ladyship.<eos> - Daisy?<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> And I have to speak to you.
- I'm sorry to hear it, but I don't understand what you're doing here.<eos> Daisy, there you are.<eos> That was quick.<eos> Will you tell Mr Mason the news or should we?<eos> Tell him what?<eos> He's got the farm if he still wants it.<eos> Isn't that why you're here?<eos> What wonderful news. Daisy...<eos> Wonderful.<eos> She's going downstairs now, m'lady, and I'll see you in your room.
Yes. That's it.<eos> Thank you. Uh, now, uh, 1/16th scale.<eos> I'm Dr. Caroline Tyler.<eos> I wanted to thank you all for coming.<eos> I realize this is an extremely difficult time for all of you.<eos> You all lost someone close to you.<eos> Well, we've agreed, if there's any way we can help that poor girl...<eos> I explained that Jane doesn't have any memory of who she is.<eos> But Jane did remember Joe here from his visits to his nephew, despite her coma.<eos> We hope meeting all of you will prompt Jane to recall other memories.
You always say that, too.<eos> Look, I know that Ethan's death is hard on you, but the project lost its leader.<eos> We can't afford to waste any more resources on this.<eos> It's not a waste.<eos> Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.<eos> What I understand is the bottom line.<eos> It's my job to answer to the shareholders.<eos> Without me, you wouldn't have this job.<eos> Without me, you wouldn't have a company.<eos> You let your employees talk to you like that?
Tell her!<eos> Help her understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Whatever evidence you think there is, he is not your child.<eos> Your son is gone.<eos> And you need to let go and move on.<eos> And don't come back here anymore.<eos> Ivan, I'm so sorry I'm late.<eos> I know you asked to see me, but I had to take a look at these e-mails.<eos> Actually, I asked to see you.
Nothing good can come from continuing your investigation.<eos> Leave it alone... for you own good and those you care about.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> I'm helping you, just as you helped me.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Who are you?<eos> And why did I see you with my son?<eos> That's all I can tell you now.<eos> I shouldn't have even said this much.<eos> They told me not to talk to you.
We'll keep looking.<eos> You're still at the top of the list.<eos> We've been at the top of the list for a long time.<eos> There's really nothing else you can do to fight this?<eos> I've tried. I am so, so sorry.<eos> But I will do everything I can to make sure that you make it to that graduation.<eos> Well, you've kept me going longer than anyone else could've.<eos> Don't turn off your phone.<eos> I'll talk to you soon, Dr. Tyler.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, I'd like to talk to you...
I just wanted to make sure that the surgery went well.<eos> The heart was okay?<eos> No complications?<eos> The heart was perfect.<eos> It did everything it was supposed to.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> And the recipient? He's okay?<eos> Actually, why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> If you're up for it, they'd like to meet you.
It did everything it was supposed to.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> And the recipient? He's okay?<eos> Actually, why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> If you're up for it, they'd like to meet you.<eos> Lindsey, this is Samantha Glenn.<eos> Thank you... So much.<eos> I can't possibly...<eos> There's someone who'd really like to meet you.
Yeah.<eos> Another expedition, right?<eos> Everest, Africa, Antarctica, brain surgery.<eos> Come here.<eos> Flatline machine.<eos> Ivan.<eos> As soon as I'm better, I am going to beta test death, Dr. Tyler.<eos> And you're going to be there to hear about it.<eos> This is Dr. Tyler.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Oh.<eos> And just so you know,<eos> Ladner really was a sleepy little town before you got here.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> [church bells] He's a hard one to figure out,<eos> - that Buddy Barlow. - [sighs] I'll say.<eos> Great kisser, though.<eos> I imagine.<eos> Me too.<eos> Can I speak to you just for a moment?
Yeah, hot girls on Instagram, gold pass for Kyle. Sounds like Grey was on the down-low.<eos> Probably wouldn't want his fans knowing he was into guys like Kyle. Sharon: If Grey was being blackmailed, maybe he tried to fix the problem at the parking garage.<eos> Buzz: Blackmail. Might be why Kyle told his mother he was getting rich.<eos> Provenza: With what we have on him now, we couldn't even get a command performance, much less a search warrant.<eos> Oh, I think there's a way to get Grey to cooperate, Lieutenant.<eos> I wonder if he has a lawyer on his payroll.<eos> [Elevator dings] It's better to see what they want than to have them show up in public.<eos> Hello, my name is Peaches Williams, and this is my client, Grey.<eos> I'm Captain Sharon Raydor, Lieutenant Provenza, Detective Amy Sykes. Yo, nice to meet y'all.<eos> Always glad to be running into police officers on their own turf, especially you.
Mr. Anthony Sellers of 345 Rosalind Road?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Next time you surveil someone, wear plainer clothes.<eos> They recognized you at the municipal golf course, whose logo you flaunted.<eos> You're a private detective and you've been following me, no?<eos> No.<eos> The truth, "Lloyd."<eos> Or your son and his friends will witness the very loud end of our tragic love affair.<eos> Very well.<eos> I wasn't following you.
As it turns out...<eos> Alicia florrick is returning to the fold.<eos> Dear god, you all need to get your stories straight. I have alicia right now on the other line,<eos> And she says she's starting her own firm And she wants me to come with her.<eos> Uh, jim, Can you give me a moment?<eos> I'll check in with them. Oh.<eos> Uh, david, Do you know reese dipple?<eos> Only by reputation.<eos> David lee, family law.<eos> Very nice to meet you, sir.
Weren't you? I was.<eos> And lemon bishop's lawyer, too.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, this is it.<eos> Louise nolfi.<eos> Uh... Possession with intent.<eos> 26 tablets of mdma.<eos> Yes. Unfortunately for this client, That's typical.<eos> She's has Quite a high tolerance.<eos> Oh? That why I'm talking to you and not her?
Fall back now!<eos> Fall back!<eos> I cannot begin to fathom the hatred of someone willing to hurt children.<eos> And their hatred only incites more.<eos> Not just against the radicals, but against all Protestants.<eos> And Louis; the timing for his return couldn't be worse.<eos> What about the timing for you and Francis?<eos> Francis and I?<eos> Condé left so abruptly.<eos> And you said yourself you weren't sure where you stood with him, now that you're not going to Scotland.
I'd commend you on your unprecedented rise to the Queen's detail, however, I feel a warning might be more prudent than a compliment.<eos> A warning, sir?<eos> The Queen asked for you personally.<eos> She also has MI5 and MI6 vetting your security clearance.<eos> Eventually, she'll discover you're not the person you claim to be.<eos> You think I didn't know?<eos> I'm the King's head of security, we know a few things.<eos> I'll speak to Princess Eleanor about the conditions of your transfer.<eos> If she refutes your claims, you'll be tried for treason.<eos> Until then, you're being watched closely, Mr. Frost.
Sir.<eos> We've been summoned back to the Palace.<eos> We'll go when Ophelia's done.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but it was an order.<eos> The Dragon King doesn't appreciate that his sacred bow and arrow was aimed at a petrol tycoon who's threatened an oil embargo, among other things.<eos> The guy I almost shot?<eos> Oh, my God, Liam, go.<eos> An international incident is slightly more important.<eos> - Marcus please, stay with her.<eos> - Sir, I need to stay with you.
And there I was thinking it was my hooves.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> Liam, come.<eos> Well?<eos> It's iffy at best.<eos> I think I found Dad.<eos> People of Great Britain and the Commonwealth, when crowned King, I took a solemn oath to serve you all, to put the welfare of this nation first.<eos> I do so today... by formally calling for a referendum for the abolishment of the Monarchy.<eos> I have no speech written today. I just want to talk to you from the heart, directly to you, the people... in the hope that you understand my reasoning.
- Pryce, silence the only bitch you have left or I'll do it myself.<eos> Dad.<eos> Like I said, it's important we all remain calm.<eos> Chekhov's gun, Mr. Pryce?<eos> If the gun isn't going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.<eos> Chekhov was making a point.<eos> Remove everything that has no relevance to the story.<eos> I have no doubt you'll vet everyone's alibis and whereabouts, Mr. Pryce.<eos> And once the King recovers, we will quickly and summarily dismiss you as our Head of Security.<eos> Because if we stick to the facts and dismiss the emotional accusations, the hard truth is, nobody's spouse is safe around you, are they?
- If I do this...<eos> - Anything.<eos> James.<eos> Care to use your safe words in the safe room?<eos> You're reprehensible, do you know that?<eos> You saying no?<eos> Dad, wake up.<eos> I'll do better...<eos> I'll do better.<eos> I'm speaking to you today as a wife, a mother, a servant of the people, and as your Queen.
You're reprehensible, do you know that?<eos> You saying no?<eos> Dad, wake up.<eos> I'll do better...<eos> I'll do better.<eos> I'm speaking to you today as a wife, a mother, a servant of the people, and as your Queen.<eos> Following this address you will hear the palace bells ring five times.<eos> For centuries it was a distress call warning the people that their kingdom was under attack.<eos> And today, we are once again under attack.<eos> Yesterday your King spoke to you from the heart.
I'll do better.<eos> I'm speaking to you today as a wife, a mother, a servant of the people, and as your Queen.<eos> Following this address you will hear the palace bells ring five times.<eos> For centuries it was a distress call warning the people that their kingdom was under attack.<eos> And today, we are once again under attack.<eos> Yesterday your King spoke to you from the heart.<eos> 'He spoke of his love of country, and his love of family.<eos> Some time later, the King was attacked outside the gates of the palace.'<eos> He was assaulted, stabbed, and left for dead, the victim of a brutal attack by an unknown assailant.<eos> Today, as your King fights for his life, I once again speak to you about love of family and country.
Go on.<eos> Cry wolf.<eos> But when the real wolf is at your door, who's going to save you then?<eos> Jasper has been arrested.<eos> For what?<eos> Attacking the King?<eos> No.<eos> For screwing the Queen.<eos> Consider it a favor.<eos> There was something going on between you.
Terrible.<eos> But no more terrible than life itself.<eos> The world is as it is.<eos> On this, at least, we agree.<eos> Are you both so certain that things cannot somehow be made fairer?<eos> Life was not designed to be fair.<eos> If it was designed at all.<eos> Hush, now, or the magistrate here will have to bring you up on charges of atheism, and it does so go against all rules of decorum to have to testify against one's dinner guest.<eos> Very well, then.<eos> If the good doctor will not perform for you, I am more than happy to play his role.
Paul was such a gump.<eos> Get this-- he told me the definition of love is putting someone else's needs above yours.<eos> - Ew.<eos> - I know.<eos> Meanwhile, Edgar's being so nice.<eos> He knows I'm hurting so he keeps doing stuff for me.<eos> Just be careful with him, okay?<eos> Edgar, let's hit the wing place before the game starts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll ride with you.
You're not going to assist me like this during surgery, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Unless it's necessary.<eos> Well, I'm excited.<eos> Oh! I'd like Dr. Tyler to be a part of my surgical team.<eos> I'm sure she'd say that she can do my job as well as everybody else's, but this actually is brain surgery.<eos> Not for medical assistance... For conversation.<eos> I think we'd enjoy discussing the surgery while it's happening.<eos> Today's her day off, but I'll give her a call.<eos> The two of you in there, backseat driving... Now... I'm excited.
Am I really on the other side?<eos> Not quite yet.<eos> That's where you need to go.<eos> The answers to all your questions, everything you've been searching for...<eos> It's right there.<eos> Come.<eos> I'll take you to your son.<eos> Wait.<eos> I need to know something.<eos> I've seen you. I've talked to you before... Back there.
No, uh, the last time I saw her was that morning.<eos> She gave me this.<eos> She made a set.<eos> The earrings for her and the necklace for me.<eos> - Now I see...<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Councilman Danvers?<eos> Councilman?<eos> Fancy.<eos> I'd love a word with you.
Common pre-prom cocktail.<eos> So, KC was wrong about Raquel using drugs, but I was right.<eos> Prom Murder.<eos> Says right on the case an hour and 31 minutes.<eos> Hmm, a full two minutes longer.<eos> Nice work.<eos> So, now all we have to do is just sync them up and find the two minutes we haven't seen.<eos> Show time.<eos> Ethan Skinner, excuse me.<eos> Can I speak to you about the murder of your high school girlfriend?
Oh, that is a funny story.<eos> - It gets better.<eos> - Oh.<eos> We're still two weeks from my birthday.<eos> You should have seen the look on his face when he walks in and I'm wearing them.<eos> - I bet.<eos> - Poor guy!<eos> I mean, I know I shouldn't have ruined the surprise, but I just loved them so much.<eos> Now, unfortunately I have to make you go through each page and sign these forms to register a claim to have the property returned to you.<eos> I'll just, uh, have our assistant, Mr. Carnegie, stay with you while you fill all these out, okay?
I met her at a bookstore.<eos> We both shared a thing for military history.<eos> Started talking, got a drink, and... one thing led to another.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Marlon, was this an affair?<eos> Before Josh, I was... I was living on the DL.<eos> Josh, he... he helped me come out.<eos> And then there was Lou-Lou in the picture, and... one day, I woke up... and suddenly I was a gay father trying to live life out and proud.<eos> Chen, she was just a... she was just a mistake I-I made because I just felt...<eos> I felt overwhelmed. Did Chen Han ever talk to you about your work?
What?<eos> 'My wife and I are only in a small slump.'<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I know exactly who you want.<eos> And who's that?<eos> We love the same woman.<eos> Bloody hell Simon.<eos> You are twelve.<eos> Rebecca is double your age.<eos> What do you think will happen between you two?
Do you want to go to the cinema?<eos> You are going through a lot.<eos> Everything is spinning.<eos> It can be a film about love or something like that.<eos> Or a different one,Action?<eos> May I Sit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Better not.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was back there and observing you two.
What are you doing here?<eos> I was back there and observing you two.<eos> What?<eos> I couldn't help myself.<eos> I'm sorry<eos> And you two talked?<eos> Yes, we just finished.<eos> I'd like to take the chance and apologize.<eos> It's a little my fault.<eos> I don't know what's up with you.
What the hell are you?<eos> What" am I?<eos> That's rude.<eos> We are the true earthlings.<eos> We?<eos> I believe you call us "Subterraneans.<eos> We suffer from overpopulation. we must now claim the world aboveground.<eos> I understand that there are many people on the surface too.<eos> you are in our way.<eos> That is why we have decided to eradicate you all.
Are you the doorman?<eos> I don't tip people over 30.<eos> I'm nobody, I was just leaving.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're not nobody.<eos> Mother, this is Alan.<eos> The man I'm going to marry.<eos> You're marrying a doorman?<eos> He's not the doorman, he's the man I love.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Park.
I held a sword. You, a sadist's grin.<eos> Oh, please. If I am to die, I'd prefer not to hear Julian pontificate about how events didn't favor him.<eos> Right you are, Gabriel.<eos> Why banter when it will soon be over anyway?<eos> So, this torture is beautifully simple and given that electricity is one of an archangel's few weaknesses besides Empyrean steel, it is perfect for my purposes.<eos> You know, ironically, it was first used in Stalin's Russia to force traitors to confess as they sat across from a loved one.<eos> Above each of you are two live wires<eos> I've connected to the power grid of this facility.<eos> Each has enough volts of electricity to destroy even your powerful bodies.<eos> That metal pipe between you controls whether or not the live wires descend or stay in place.
I just need to know the basics, then I'm out of here.<eos> Warming up is important to don't hurt yourself.<eos> Okay, one by one, ski down into my arms.<eos> Good! Good work.<eos> Instructor: Here...<eos> Ehh, take your skis like this, Yeah...<eos> - down and out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Up with you again I'll get it,
Hey, Gibbs.<eos> Want a drink?<eos> Kind of looks like my Scotch.<eos> It is. No.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Did you eat dinner?<eos> No.<eos> I wasn't hungry.<eos> You have anything to eat today?<eos> Uh-uh. You want to talk about what's going on between you and Tony?
You guys tell Gibbs where you're going?<eos> Well, I'm a senior agent, you're McNot.<eos> I can take the initiative.<eos> Initiative's good.<eos> Still like to know where you're going.<eos> That's amazing, 'cause I was just calling you.<eos> Uh, Bishop and I are going back to the alley where - Emma Vickers' body was found.<eos> - Yeah, thought we might find something in daylight that we missed last night.<eos> Possible witness, video.<eos> Boss, Abby talk to you yet?
Pakistan and Afghanistan.<eos> How long?<eos> 18 months as an NSA analyst.<eos> Computer nerd.<eos> Not much of a threat to anyone.<eos> But you've seen it up close.<eos> Who did you lose, exactly?<eos> A coworker.<eos> A few years ago.<eos> It stays with you, doesn't it?
In fact, his DNA was on the handle.<eos> I'm a patriot.<eos> Okay?<eos> You should be thanking me.<eos> Landis was protecting a terrorist.<eos> Qasim's not a terrorist, but the guy you're working for is.<eos> Rasheed Naasir.<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> McGEE: Really?<eos> Well, the e-mails between you two suggest otherwise.
Dwayne I really have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You are making a mistake.<eos> We already have Baitfish, Sasha.<eos> We got him, we got you.<eos> Do you?<eos> Time's up, Special Agents.<eos> Jenks is in my custody now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Meet you back at the Federal Building.<eos> We're coming with you.
Oh, like you weren't thinking it.<eos> Of course I was!<eos> But unlike you, I don't vomit out the first words that pop into my drug-addled brain!<eos> Hey!<eos> Clean and sober six days.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> I made the dean's list.<eos> And I hate you both.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> 20 years of therapy, and all it took was an hour and a half with you two to make me love my mother.
- She's seen it coming.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> He doesn't want to support her ladyship any more.<eos> What cheek!<eos> Don't go working yourself up.<eos> Who does he think he is?<eos> Jumped up little saw-bones!<eos> I should steer clear.<eos> No doubt.<eos> But you and I don't think alike, do we, Mr Spratt?
I think we see that now.<eos> The family, I mean.<eos> Not at first, you're right.<eos> But now.<eos> - Good day to you.<eos> - Good day?<eos> A wonder you've got the nerve to speak to me.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Throwing over my lady, when she's been running this village since you were eating porridge in the glen with your mummy.<eos> I don't believe I am required to justify my actions to you.
- What was the operation?<eos> - They performed a gastrectomy.<eos> What's that?<eos> No business of ours.<eos> Will he be all right?<eos> It sounds as if he has a good chance.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I'll find out if there's anything he needs in the morning.<eos> I'll walk down there now with some things for her ladyship.<eos> I'll come with you.
No, no, no, no. The thingy's going too fast.<eos> You know what?<eos> Who needs a teleprompter?<eos> I'm just here to tell you about the Skwerkel Monocle.<eos> (all) Ooh. I'll admit it.<eos> At first, I thought this was a dumb idea.<eos> Really dumb.<eos> But I've always dreamed of having a computer strapped to my face.<eos> And guess what. It is awesome.<eos> I'm checking my email right now while I talk to you.
Yes, I have some questions about all this myself, Stanley.<eos> - Stanley?<eos> - But your name is Stanford.<eos> Wait, you took my name?<eos> What have you been doing all these years, you knucklehead?<eos> Yeah, Grunkle Stan, no more lies.<eos> You owe us some answers.<eos> What's the deal with this portal?<eos> Why did you keep this a secret?<eos> And what happened between you and your brother?
- Hugapalooza 2000!<eos> - Kid, will you knock that off?<eos> I'm trying to tell my life story here.<eos> I had decided I wasn't gonna show my face at home till I proved I could make something of myself.<eos> Unfortunately, the treasure hunting business was slow going.<eos> Apparently, gold is some kind of rare metal.<eos> Luckily, I struck another kind of gold.<eos> In sales.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Are you sick of this always happening to you?
We know who it is.<eos> We have a name.<eos> It's Andrew, babe.<eos> Hey, there's another girl down here.<eos> I'm Sara Harvey.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - We don't?<eos> They'll know Andrew is Charles when they find him.<eos> What happened to you?
- Just let me explain...<eos> - 'Don't.'<eos> Just don't.<eos> We graduate in three weeks all you have to do is stay out of my way.<eos> You'll graduate.. ...that doesn't mean we will.<eos> Oh, you'll graduate.<eos> The school wants you gone as much as the rest of us.<eos> 'You'll graduate with honors.'<eos> Andrew, you need a lift?<eos> Like I'm getting in a car with you two.
Maybe she's not ready to talk yet.<eos> She needs to speak to someone about what she's been through.<eos> You can't force her to go.<eos> Well, maybe not, but you were shooting your dad's gun a couple of days ago so, you're going.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> Ah, I notice you've been taking pictures the last couple of days.<eos> Yeah, just... feels good to focus on something other than myself.<eos> Tanner called.<eos> Now, that Andrew has been released she's eager to meet with you girls.
Listen, um.. ...how are you doing?<eos> It's strange to be back.<eos> Everywhere I go, everybody stares at me but nobody says anything.<eos> Well, it can be kinda hard to know what to say.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Man, I thought it was finally over.<eos> Now that Andrew's been released...<eos> We're right back to where we started.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Everybody's lookin' out for you guys.
Spencer?<eos> Spencer.<eos> Yes, I'm a friend of Ezra's.<eos> So you want to place a pastry order?<eos> Um, not exactly.<eos> I, um..<eos> Sorry. Um..<eos> I don't know if you know my story.<eos> I do.<eos> I'm really sorry about what happened to you.
You were down here the whole time?<eos> 'Was that you?<eos> ' - Answer us!<eos> - Just let me go.<eos> Please, I'll explain later.<eos> No, you're gonna explain right now.<eos> Why were you following us?<eos> She didn't want us to find this.<eos> Just give it back to me, okay?<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with you guys.
Okay, well, I have to go.<eos> My mom made an appointment for me and her with Dr. Sullivan, I can't be late.<eos> Where's Aria?<eos> She's up at Hollis, she's sneaking Clark's negatives back into that cubby.<eos> Okay, so what's the plan?<eos> Are we gonna track down Lesli Stone?<eos> Are we gonna go to Philly?<eos> - I have to get my head shrunk.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Wait, what is wrong with you people?
Why-why do I know that name?<eos> I-I feel like Emily had a teacher.<eos> Yes, that would be me.<eos> I had bit of a career change.<eos> - I'm Nicole Gordon.<eos> I worked with Emily in Haiti.<eos> We did that housing program.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> That's right.<eos> She had an amazing summer with you guys.
Ali, I need to tell you something.<eos> Charles is alive.<eos> He threatened my dad.<eos> He said he's coming home for his birthday.<eos> - His birthday?<eos> - Today, Spencer.<eos> My dad called Jason and begged him to leave the house.<eos> But he's determined to see Charles no matter how dangerous it is.<eos> Okay, and your dad didn't think to tell any of us?<eos> Charles isn't after you.
What were you doing there?<eos> Who were you meeting?<eos> I don't think you wanna be photographing her.<eos> Get one of the ice sculpture before it melts.<eos> And I suggest you and your pals find the exit.<eos> Voluntarily.<eos> ♪ The sky will fall ♪<eos> ♪ When the moon rise ♪<eos> ♪ The sky will fall ♪<eos> ♪ And I'm not going down with the rest of you ♪ [cell phone beeping]

Your chief asset is fine for now, but we're all at risk.<eos> You need to reach out to Barmal's associates.<eos> See what they know about her work.<eos> And tell them what?<eos> While stitching a live consciousness into a dead woman's memory, we may have triggered an epidemic in our secret lab?<eos> Barmal's last serum... the one she thought worked... is in her lab,<eos> Date-stamped June 1, 18:03 hours.<eos> Maybe there is something in there that we can build on.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> In the meantime, no matter what happens to you all, Kirsten needs to survive.
Lots and lots of blood.<eos> Well, I was waiting at home for you at home.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> We came straight from my place.<eos> Which is very clean.<eos> I promise.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> -Hey, Sara, have you talked to my parents?<eos> No, why?<eos> They just want to talk to you about some wedding plans And an engagement party they wanna host this week.
Hi.<eos> - Everyone, say hi to April.<eos> - We wish you were here, kiddo.<eos> Hi, honey, we're gonna save you a piece of cake.<eos> Who wants some champers?<eos> You see how I cut to Natalie in the scene?<eos> This is so cool.<eos> And I'm glad she was there.<eos> And that she didn't get you drunk.<eos> Yeah, I know things have been weird between you guys lately Because of the whole Dominic thing, but she was awesome.
I don't want to be disrespectful.<eos> Barkeep!<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> There they are.<eos> -April, this is Leo's... no, no.<eos> No. -Sorry.<eos> I'll go.<eos> April, I'm Leo's cousin Tripp.<eos> - This is my father Malcolm.<eos> - So nice to meet you both.
And he sent over a situation brief.<eos> Ressler.<eos> Keen.<eos> We appreciate you guys extending yourself--<eos> You want to tell us where you got your information?<eos> A high-level informant. One who's proven very reliable.<eos> Karakurt.<eos> You sure that's what he said?<eos> 'Cause you're talking to people who run Russian counterintelligence, and we don't have one shred of credible information that he's in-country.<eos> Well, that's why we're here-- to share our credible information with you.
We asked for your help.<eos> If he's here, where does he go?<eos> Who does he meet with?<eos> He needs a place to stay, a vehicle.<eos> - We'll ask around.<eos> - You'll ask around?<eos> That's it?<eos> There are stars carved in the marble at Langley that represent colleagues of ours who died drawing intel on Karakurt.<eos> Nobody wants him more than we do.<eos> We'll look into your lead and let you know.
This is for you, liz.<eos> Not for him.<eos> The protective detail is at the warehouse.<eos> There's no sign of keen or reddington.<eos> The shooter at the first crime scene. The emts who were taking him to the me, they never showed.<eos> There were three bodies found in the warehouse.<eos> Two men posing as fbi. And dr. Mark child, the chief of surgery at georgetown.<eos> Agent keen.<eos> Are you safe?<eos> Who's with you?
I'm not leaving you, raymond.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Find a way out.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> And if I'm not, you know what to do,<eos> But you won't be able to do it unless you leave.<eos> President approved it as well.<eos> Yes, I understand.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry, but there's an agent here to see you.
Call Vice.<eos> I want the location of all known safe houses.<eos> Roll all units.<eos> This ends now.<eos> - FBI!<eos> - FBI!<eos> Hey! Hey! Against the wall!<eos> I got your girl.<eos> I swear I'll kill her.<eos> I'm not playing with you.
You got it.<eos> Well, the method is consistent with the way the oil tanker crew was killed.<eos> This is the second time somebody's tried to kill her.<eos> This time?<eos> Not so lucky.<eos> What about the hit man from the Arkady sting a few weeks ago?<eos> Nicolai Brantov.<eos> Yeah, Callen thought he was working for the Russians.<eos> Well, whoever he was working for, they obviously haven't packed up and gone home.<eos> Kensi, what's happening with you guys?
Ah, screw it.<eos> You idiot!<eos> Classic road rage.<eos> You see that, Sam?<eos> You know, if I didn't know any better, I would think he wasn't happy to see us.<eos> Always happy to see my guys, but something tells me this meeting is not by chance.<eos> And by "something," I mean my home surveillance system.<eos> Nice truck.<eos> Is it new?<eos> Since I last saw you and your boss, I seem to have "bug" infestation.
You don't let anything get past you, do you, Arkady?<eos> Can I ask you why you keep an apartment in Moscow?<eos> I won it in a poker game, in 1992.<eos> It has been remodeled since.<eos> It was purposely rebuilt and stocked with weapons for times like this.<eos> Furniture is dated.<eos> You begged to come to Moscow to look for your daughter Anna.<eos> And now, you're here, you want to talk about interior design?<eos> It is conversation.<eos> I don't want conversation from you.
- Okay.<eos> I heard your song.<eos> Yeah, that was real low, telling the world about my fake nut.<eos> I should have said you have no nuts, recording tracks behind my back!<eos> Treating me like you Salt-N-Pepa and I'm Spinderella and shit!<eos> Spinderella would never hack a brother's Netflix queue!<eos> I had, like, 500 things I wanted to watch.<eos> Now the only thing I can remember is Peaky Blinders.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> What happened to you guys?
As much as I hate mice and everything they represent, this one put up a good fight.<eos> It deserves to die as humanely as possible.<eos> Do you want to improvise a eulogy?<eos> I'm afraid, even though this speech is a little cheesy, I Muenster continue.<eos> Gouda day, little guy.<eos> Goddamn it, she's good.<eos> So... yeah.<eos> I have a confession to make:<eos> I have been drinking all day.<eos> But this is me apologizing to you all...
But first...<eos> That feels so nice and automatic.<eos> - Which is good?<eos> - It is for me.<eos> I hope you don't mind my taking a chance, but I got your letter and I wanted to discuss it.<eos> This is Miss Cruikshank.<eos> She's engaged to Larry.<eos> - Yes. I saw it in the papers.<eos> - I know I've rather pushed in,<eos> - but I did so want to meet you.
He gives a marvellous impression of it.<eos> Please tell Mrs Crawley when you see her that I am her friend.<eos> I would never want to stand in her way.<eos> And nor will Larry.<eos> I promise. Not while I'm around.<eos> - Oh, yes, very interesting.<eos> - Oh, interesting and encouraging.<eos> Yes, I'll leave it at interesting for now.<eos> Good day to you both.<eos> Mama, can I speak to you?
It'll be out in the morning.<eos> - So, now you just have to be patient.<eos> - What's this?<eos> Mrs Patmore is ready for her first visitors to the guest house.<eos> - That was quick.<eos> - Yeah, just what I said.<eos> - I've got butterflies.<eos> - Oh, don't be silly.<eos> I'll go over to check it all when they're in London.<eos> Oh, I'll come with you if you like.
Yes, Mr Carson.<eos> Well! If that doesn't just take the biscuit.<eos> Are you going to tell me or not?<eos> She's only decided to up sticks and set sail for the South of France.<eos> - When?<eos> - The family are in London next week for the racing, so she wants to leave while they're away.<eos> - She can't do that!<eos> - No? Well, perhaps you'll pop up and tell her.<eos> - Save me packing.<eos> - What happens to you?
Today? I'll spend tonight in London, then I'll sail on the SS Paris from Southampton tomorrow.<eos> We'll cruise around the Mediterranean, then I'm staying with the Broughams in Cannes.<eos> - They keep asking me.<eos> - Surrounded by foreigners.<eos> My reason for travelling is to make myself eager to come home.<eos> A month among the French should manage it.<eos> - Won't Robert be hurt? - Oh.<eos> Not as hurt as he would be if he knew why I was going.<eos> Now, can you give this to him when they get home?<eos> What if they want to contact you while you're away?
- It's a good car.<eos> - Clearly, we need you on the team.<eos> Don't tempt me, Henry.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Laura Edmunds, my editor.<eos> Laura, this is Tom Branson, my brother-in-law, and the man of the hour, Mr Henry Talbot.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - My sister, Mary.<eos> These are my parents. You can sort them out in your own time.<eos> - Nice to meet you at last.
- I think if you expect a lot, you get a lot.<eos> - No, thank you, Mrs Patmore.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - I'm still shaken.<eos> I can't deny it.<eos> - Is your poor niece managing?<eos> - I'm going over to see her tomorrow.<eos> I'll come with you.
But I'm an ordinary bloke.<eos> I've spent my life in service, fetching and carrying.<eos> - You were a servant?<eos> - I was. I am.<eos> And I was glad to get the work.<eos> My mum's in service. She works for Mr Travis at the vicarage.<eos> Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.<eos> But I never gave up on learning, do you see?<eos> I read as much as I could and I taught myself, and I hope to be able to teach you.<eos> Maybe give you the shortcut that I never had...
Or did he just choose to believe it because it suited him?<eos> - You mean the King was a liar? - Er.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Kings are like anyone else.<eos> Anna says Edith's gone to London and I suppose we all know why.<eos> - Do we have to do this now?<eos> - Yes, I really think --<eos> Carson, what's happened?<eos> Where are the footmen?<eos> That is something I need to discuss with you, My Lord.
I was going to my own funeral.<eos> - Well, speak of the devil.<eos> - Please, not around a minister.<eos> Didn't I say he was charming?<eos> Buddy, I would like you to meet Sean and Jeffrey, two of the members of our church.<eos> Russell's told us all about you.<eos> We're very excited to have one of our own as the new pastor.<eos> He's mentioned that...<eos> a few times.<eos> - Nice to meet you both.
We're sitting on top of 100 feet of steel, Jim.<eos> It's frontier medicine.<eos> You learn to work with what you've got.<eos> Will you toss me a wrench?<eos> Shit.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Somehow this thing looked better on paper.<eos> What time is it?<eos> There's a call at the switchboard.<eos> Your husband wants to speak with you.
~ Wow, fuck me!<eos> I think I win.<eos> In fact, I'm in charge, so I say I win.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You're abusing your position for personal gain.<eos> You are one of the guys.<eos> What, really?<eos> I admire your balls.<eos> If you ever need them X-rayed, stop off at Ballbags.<eos> Well... because I'm part of such a great team, I don't need this... .. because I've the memory of working with all of you.
What are you gonna do?<eos> Squad, if I could have your attention please?<eos> I am being transferred to the public relations office.<eos> I'm leaving the Nine-Nine effective immediately.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> What the hell?<eos> I want to say it has been a pleasure to have worked alongside all of you for the past 21 1/2 months.
These have been the... these have been the best years of my career.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This is new.<eos> And I know that everyone of you gave me everything you had, and I will never forget it.<eos> Go back to being robot captain.<eos> Meep-morp.<eos> Zeet.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Sir!<eos> I'm coming with you.
~ I think we're being lied to.<eos> I'm not Joe's mother.<eos> Gemma was. ~ This is all your fault.<eos> ~ Please, Michael!<eos> (I signed my name wrong. At the sailing place.)<eos> I put 'Joe Blackwell' instead of 'Joe Watkins'.<eos> Did you ever meet Eddie Reynolds?<eos> I need to talk to him. Can you help me with that?<eos> I know a couple of people who might be able to fix it.<eos> It'll count for nothing if Eddie Reynolds doesn't want to meet you.
You lot must be shitting bricks.<eos> Whole lot of you.<eos> ~ I'm not here on behalf of the police.<eos> ~ I know.<eos> Left under a bit of a cloud, didn't you?<eos> We've got a lot in common, you and me. We both want to know who was responsible for Susan's death.<eos> You tried to save her life, so I know it wasn't you.<eos> But you know it wasn't me.<eos> How did Jimmy Metcalfe know we were there?<eos> I've never met Jimmy Metcalfe, so either someone tipped him off or he followed you.
Ma'am!<eos> Just...<eos> What?<eos> You been drinking tonight?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> I just saw you blow through a red light.<eos> Fine, maybe I had a glass of wine.<eos> Ma'am, please turn off the ignition, step out of the vehicle.<eos> Officer, is this really necessary?<eos> Sir, I'm not talking to you.
Well, then you're gonna talk to Choinski.<eos> They never learn.<eos> Okay, you walk up to a bad situation.<eos> What are the words you really don't want to hear?<eos> "Not likely to survive." Not a shooting.<eos> If someone involved turns and says, "You owe me a favor""<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> "Your kid did it""<eos> Danny.<eos> That would never happen to you guys.
Jamal Al Fayeed did this.<eos> Because of Ihab.<eos> Because we were foolish enough to support you.<eos> It's over.<eos> So pack your things and leave.<eos> May, uh... may Allah allow your wives and children into paradise.<eos> We are currently investigating the source of the terrorist weapons cache containing chemical agents.<eos> We will, of course, make results public once the inquiry is complete.<eos> Until then, we will continue to provide emergency medical care in Ma'an.<eos> Finally, to the victims of this terrible tragedy and to their families, our hearts and prayers are with you during this dark time of our nation.
It's the law that's on Sammy's side.<eos> Can I make him stay?<eos> Yes, you can kidnap him.<eos> He's gonna be 18, and as soon as he is, he can pretty much do whatever he wants.<eos> At least for now, you got the wolf by the ear.<eos> So there's no way I can keep my son safe?<eos> You can go with him.<eos> I promised Barry we would never go back there.<eos> Sammy didn't make that promise, and from what I'm getting, sooner or later, he's going, with or without you.<eos> If it makes a difference, I'll be there with you.
I only got one more year eligibility.<eos> Being able to start for my team, making it to the tournament.<eos> Lightning like that don't strike twice.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I told the NCAA and I'm gonna tell you.<eos> I've done nothing more with Marco but try to help a neighborhood kid succeed.<eos> Mr. Hooks, we're actually here about another kid from your neighborhood.<eos> Triva Forster.<eos> She was advising your number one investment,<eos> Marco Williams, to cut ties with you.
He can build anything.<eos> I'm always breaking my glasses.<eos> So, he makes this for me himself.<eos> No breaking.<eos> Only reason he's not in college is any money we make has to go to the bank for the loan.<eos> Respectfully, ma'am, if there are money problems, maybe Joseph got involved with some illegal activity trying to help.<eos> Are there are any friends or girlfriend that we should be speaking to?<eos> No girlfriend.<eos> No anything.<eos> Joseph lives with you?
~ Don't know, about this big?<eos> ~ That doesn't look like a bullet!<eos> ~ From a.22 rifle.<eos> ~ I was protecting someone.<eos> ~ And you got in the way?<eos> (CHUCKLES) I tried to.<eos> Do you think Michael Collersdale has a gun?<eos> Doesn't matter if he's got a tank, doesn't know where you are.<eos> You're absolutely safe here.<eos> Nothing will happen to you or your family.
But you?<eos> Yours is insane.<eos> You're getting published again.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I feel pretty lucky.<eos> I'm sure it was nice to get some good news after what happened with Natalie.<eos> I heard.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess it just wasn't meant to be.<eos> You don't have to answer this if it's weird, but what happened with you two?
- Let's just say, feel lucky you didn't share a boyfriend with her.<eos> Whatever happened with you and Dominic anyway?<eos> It ended so quickly.<eos> Um, well, long story short, he didn't want me as much as I wanted him, so I had to get out.<eos> I'm over feeling unwanted.<eos> Thanks, daddy issues.<eos> Sorry. I shouldn't have said that to you.<eos> No, it's okay. I'm glad that you tell me these things.<eos> Um, I assumed that you were staying here tonight since we are dress shopping tomorrow, right?<eos> Oh. I'll just meet you all there.
Better be the hot janitor.<eos> Oh, my God. We did it!<eos> I told you it would work out.<eos> Yeah, thanks to Natalie.<eos> You were so fast back there.<eos> I just imagined Beckham on the other side of that door.<eos> Didn't know it was a favorite-sister contest.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just feel out of the loop with you two sometimes.
Can he say the same about you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Were you with him when the stitch chime went off?<eos> What excuses did you make?<eos> The fact of the matter is you're the dishonest one in the relationship.<eos> You lie and you keep secrets from him.<eos> And Liam is gonna start to sense your deception.<eos> He already has.<eos> The closest to us always do.<eos> And let me tell you, once that seed of suspicion is planted, it grows until it drives a wedge between you.
- That's for the jury to decide.<eos> Nice work, kid.<eos> Nailed it.<eos> Not me. Vanessa.<eos> Getti, thank you for tonight.<eos> You are welcome.<eos> You're always welcome.<eos> What's wrong, dear?<eos> I just never had anything like this.<eos> I kind of grew up on my own, so being here tonight with you and Samir, you're both just so warm and wonderful, and I've definitely never worn anything this beautiful.
- [Toilet flushing]<eos> And you may be right that your father found out about the affair.<eos> He made an appointment with his lawyer to change his will the day before he died.<eos> I told you.<eos> Now, I am starving.<eos> Can we get some food?<eos> What did I say?<eos> - Stop whining?<eos> - Stop whining.<eos> Fine, I'm grateful to be trapped in a cheap motel room that smells like urine and insecticide with you two, while I starve, headed back to face a murder charge for a crime I did not commit.
So...<eos> let's do this.<eos> Now... if the answer is, "Yes, you've seen this man", just say yes.<eos> Or better still, don't say anything.<eos> I'll know what you mean.<eos> That way, no one can accuse you of lying.<eos> And no one can accuse you of giving up your friend.<eos> So... have you ever seen this man around here?<eos> You are a brave young woman.<eos> Your country is very proud of you.
D-Do you maybe have room for one more?<eos> Are you good at talking about how busy you are?<eos> Because that's a lot of what this is.<eos> Ugh, yeah, but don't talk to me about anything until I've had my morning coffee, 'cause it's like I can't even deal.<eos> Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd love to have you in our group of girlfriends.<eos> Oh, my God, that's awesome!<eos> Hey, can I be the one who laugh-screams really loud at restaurants?<eos> As long as you're picking up the check.<eos> Oh, we're gonna ruin so many people's evenings!<eos> Oh, boy, I'm blending right in with you gals.
Well, we got those bitches good, huh, Peter?<eos> Yeah, thanks, Lois.<eos> And you were right.<eos> Being friends with women is way too complicated and way too intense for me.<eos> Now let me just pay the busboy and we can get out of here.<eos> Ah! I knew he didn't understand the plan!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Oh, hey, Peter.<eos> Look, I-I'm real sorry I got so worked up at my roast.<eos> And if you're willing, I'd like to be friends with you guys again.
Are you the guy who's been looking for Liam Neeson?<eos> I am.<eos> Do you mind if we ask what for?<eos> Yeah, I was hopin' to inflict violence upon him.<eos> All right, you're coming with us.<eos> Don't worry, Peter!<eos> We'll raise your bail money as soon as we can!<eos> Uh, excuse me, sir.<eos> My phone's not working.<eos> Do you mind if I follow you home and use yours?
- They've been there for years.<eos> My God.<eos> (Halstead) Hey, Sarge.<eos> We got her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No...<eos> Cover her up.<eos> - (Barba) Nadia Decotis.<eos> - (Voight) Yeah.<eos> She's the one you worked with?
I don't even believe you that those are real bands.<eos> Anyway, all I know is that if we were at a hip-hop show right now, they'd be way more anal about checking IDs.<eos> Yeah, 'cause everyone here is over 40.<eos> Oh! Oh, my god!<eos> - Ford, Brenna?<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> - This is ginger beer.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I'm not gonna bust you guys.<eos> I was you not that long ago.
Which means I got to get you out of this car.<eos> - Ohh! Okay. - Down on the ground, and then pop it back in the socket.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. It's gonna be horrible.<eos> What happened?<eos> There was an accident.<eos> What happened?<eos> There was a car accident, Charlie. Ow!<eos> Are you okay?
You've been making a lot of jokes and comments about...<eos> My dead brother?<eos> Yeah, which...<eos> No judgment... it just makes me very uncomfortable.<eos> Why?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> He's my brother...<eos> And he's dead.<eos> Y... There are some...<eos> I checked, and there are some grief groups that meet, and I just thought, look, I can go with you.
Richard wants to propose by drowning me in flowers and chocolate-covered rose petals.<eos> You'd think a man would be grateful for a woman who allows him to avoid that kind of nonsense.<eos> Or maybe it's just not about you.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sorry, none of my business.<eos> Well, you seem to have made it your business, so elaborate.<eos> Please.<eos> Maybe it just makes him feel good.<eos> Maybe it's easier just to accept a bunch of dumb roses than to ask a man to fundamentally change who he is or do what makes him feel good, when what makes him feel good is telling you how good you make him feel.
Well, then why... _<eos> This is Shakir Khan.<eos> In case you don't know who I am... _<eos> But this is a life-and-death emergency.<eos> Can I at least speak to his lieutenant, Karim, please?<eos> _<eos> Karim?<eos> Yes, I know, but...<eos> I will ask.<eos> He will not speak to you directly.
That man is a social deviant.<eos> But you, Mr. Frink, you are a loyal subject of the empire.<eos> You can live a long and a prosperous life.<eos> Think it over, but don't think too long.<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Yep. And the turkey pot pie.<eos> You got it.<eos> Oh, and I bought that Bible, by the way.<eos> Did you?<eos> I'd like to discuss it with you.
When I almost hit you with the car, what were you thinking about?<eos> Was there anything else in your world or just the car?<eos> Just the car.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You need to focus.<eos> Ea<eos> I did it!<eos> Yeah, terrific.<eos> Good morning, Haven.<eos> This is Dave Teagues here, coming at you from the principal's office.
I had to drop the rope to get the glow stick out in time.<eos> With all our supplies?<eos> And our light sources.<eos> This glow stick is all we have.<eos> Thanks, folks. Thanks.<eos> It's not a happy day.<eos> The trial isn't over yet.<eos> But no beard.<eos> Rather than be a disembodied voice over the PA,<eos> Nathan has asked to make his appeal to you in person.
I should really go.<eos> Um, my pen.<eos> It was nice to meet you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi, it's Barbara.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Barbara. It's me, Lucy.<eos> You need to get out of town... now.<eos> Barbara Colton?<eos> I need to talk to you.
You remember Audrey, too?<eos> I do.<eos> I know how much you really care about her.<eos> How much she means to you.<eos> Shouldn't you be more concerned with how she feels about me?<eos> We both know that sometimes<eos> Audrey likes the bad boys.<eos> And now that I have found my true self, well... we may go all the way this time.<eos> Well, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> What happened between you two in Colorado... it meant something.
I'm going to go out with Travis and some of the kids from the deaf program tomorrow.<eos> I got so caught up in all of the Emmett drama I sort of forgot about my friends.<eos> See?<eos> Being on your own has its perks.<eos> - Embrace it. - (Sighs)<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Gracias.<eos> Already killing it.<eos> Is that gonna do it?<eos> I'll be straight with you.
She's seizing.<eos> Okay. Protect her airway.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Grab that arm.<eos> - Keep her from pulling out that I.V.<eos> - Let's get some high-flow O2 in here!<eos> Okay, protect her airway.<eos> Let's move this bed!<eos> Natalie you had a seizure, okay?<eos> - But we've got you. - ***
- Here we go. Here we go.<eos> - Almost there.<eos> Okay. You're okay. You're okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Please get me out of here.<eos> I can't be here anymore.<eos> We're gonna get you better, okay?<eos> We're gonna get you better.<eos> - Dr. Levine? - Hmm?<eos> I just wanted to say that I shouldn't have questioned you that way in the O.R.
Will you close Patrick?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm going to explain to Dawn, but don't worry.<eos> Whatever happens, I'll make sure it only happens to me.<eos> Easy, Spartacus.<eos> I've got your back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Alex did you operate on Dr. Levine's patient without her knowledge?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I tried to reach you.
- When you're breathing in?<eos> Pain in the right upper quadrant increases when breathing.<eos> Gallstones.<eos> - Ohh! - Okay, he's febrile, tachycardic.<eos> Could be a gallbladder rupture.<eos> I need 10cc of ketorolac.<eos> I don't know where that is.<eos> The nurse's station.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Ralph, you're gonna be okay, all right?
- Ohh! - Okay, he's febrile, tachycardic.<eos> Could be a gallbladder rupture.<eos> I need 10cc of ketorolac.<eos> I don't know where that is.<eos> The nurse's station.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Ralph, you're gonna be okay, all right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just try to breathe.<eos> You're gonna be okay.
I take it you're feeling better?<eos> Well, a little tender, but compared to before, it's a breeze.<eos> You know, they say gallstones are the closest pain to childbirth.<eos> I should get my wife some flowers.<eos> So you have kids?<eos> Three.<eos> All girls.<eos> Loves of my life.<eos> You seem less wired than before.<eos> Um... Mr. Lively, I owe you an apology.
Ana needs some space.<eos> Well, I'll see that she gets it.<eos> But...<eos> I hope you're still coming for Father's Day.<eos> It would mean the world to Victor.<eos> And your uncles and cousins will be here, and everybody is so excited to meet you.<eos> Look.<eos> - Is Ana coming?<eos> - Of course.<eos> She says her brothers are upset that she's back and living with you.
By the way, why are you suddenly calling me just 'Senior'?<eos> What happened to the 'nim' at the end? (Honorific)<eos> Yes, Senior... Yes, Senior. Yes, Senior.<eos> Come on, Senior. Don't be like that.<eos> I think she might hit me if I say that. What is it? Why aren't you answering me?<eos> Why did you suddenly stop calling me senior with honorifics?<eos> My peer Chang Shik doesn't use honorifics with you.<eos> And Lee Seung Gi and I are only a year apart.<eos> He calls you 'noona' (older sister).<eos> He even drops honorifics completely when he speaks to you.
How did you know where I lived?<eos> Don't you remember PD Ra?<eos> I came here once five years ago.<eos> Ah... you did.<eos> You heard about my Cindy, right?<eos> Yes, a little.<eos> By any chance, is there anything you know about this incident?<eos> Of course... I don't know anything.<eos> Since you are the PD of the program Cindy is currently on...<eos> I'm going to be completely open with you.
- Why did you make pollack soup?<eos> - Did I know it was her birthday today?<eos> Cindy, what do you want to eat?<eos> Joon Mo, let's throw a birthday party for Cindy tonight. Huh?<eos> I can't tonight. I have to finish up the inspection from last time.<eos> - The amusement park.<eos> - The amusement park?<eos> - Where?<eos> - Yongin.<eos> Can't you take me with you?
She's not okay. Yeah, it's me.<eos> I'm the Team O PD, okay?<eos> - Isn't that PD Ye Jin?<eos> - I'm fine!<eos> I'm really fine!<eos> My car got damaged a bit, that's all!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Senior.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Are you okay?
It's not your fault.<eos> Your parents won't think of it that way as well.<eos> I'm sure they want you to stop thinking about what could've been.<eos> If anything... this whole time... you did so well on your own... and you worked hard.<eos> That's what they'll think.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> I want to get up. I thought... there would never be a reason for me to come here again.<eos> But I think I made the right decision to come here today.<eos> I'm glad I came here with you. From now on, whenever I hear the word amusement park...' I'm going to think about you.
I didn't lay a hand on him.<eos> Um, where did you meet him?<eos> - Was it at the nightclub?<eos> - No, it was, uh, it was earlier than that.<eos> Dakota had a bachelor party at the Sheraton. 12 guests.<eos> - Jeff Garrix was there?<eos> - Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, he thought that they had paid for topless and bottomless, - so I had to explain to him the rules.<eos> - And he got angry?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Silly college kid. - So then he followed you back to the Pink Sapphire?
That's how we improve.<eos> Okay? Is there anything either of you want to say?<eos> No.<eos> - All good.<eos> - Same here.<eos> You take the other bouncer...<eos> Yeah, I'll take Jeff Garrix, too.<eos> He won't talk to the defense.<eos> He might... if it's the right defense.<eos> My lawyer told me not to talk to you.
8:00 p.m., 1219 Berkoff.<eos> Let go!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, the bachelor party started out fine, but it got kind of touch-and-go.<eos> And did you see the victim, - Jeff Garrix, in the bedroom?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Was there a TV...<eos> - Was he watching a TV there? No, 'cause there wasn't a TV.<eos> Okay, good, great.<eos> And when the bachelor party followed you back here, there was a fight in the parking lot, right?
- Not pink.<eos> What is she, a wedding cake?<eos> - You're doing very well.<eos> - Yeah. Saved up my money from those two years dancing.<eos> By the way, no one here knows that I used to do that, so let's keep it quiet?<eos> What do you need?<eos> You know Brett's being prosecuted again?<eos> I heard.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Has the prosecution approached you about that night?
What I have is some advice for you.<eos> You go to trial, you'll lose.<eos> That's first-degree murder, 20 years minimum, serving every single day.<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> I am such a fan.<eos> I'm so glad you'll be joining me.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'm glad, too.<eos> I told my mom I'd be working with you.
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> I am such a fan.<eos> I'm so glad you'll be joining me.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'm glad, too.<eos> I told my mom I'd be working with you.<eos> She wanted me to get a picture.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> She loved how you stood by your husband.<eos> She wants to meet you.
My dear Mather, we'd both had a fair bit to drink the night before, and in the light of day, I can't really say what I saw.<eos> You saw what I saw, and now I need you to tell the magistrate about it.<eos> Be reasonable, friend.<eos> We saw nothing that can't be explained by the condition of those who saw it.<eos> Gentlemen, this pox may nearly be over, but I still have much work to do.<eos> What say you about this discrepancy, Mather?<eos> He's lying!<eos> For all we know, he is under some witch's control!<eos> Mather, I like you, truly, but you go too far, and I've had enough.<eos> You have the word of a royally certified physician or a failed divine known for his drunken rages who attacked even you, so believe who you will.
I told you already.<eos> We need you.<eos> This is not my fight.<eos> Kindzi?<eos> Nefkitso.<eos> This is our family.<eos> I wanted you to see them.<eos> Once we have re-powered our ship, we will wake them up.<eos> Do you want to know what will happen after that?<eos> We will conquer the Earth and enslave you all, do with you what we wish, feed upon your delicate flesh on a glorious Dread Harvest.
It is with great regret that I must now discharge my final duty and inform you... that Operation Saviour did, in fact, fail.<eos> Contrary to what you were told, the comet was not sufficiently diverted from its course and will strike the Earth tomorrow at 3.49am Eastern.<eos> That's 8.49am Greenwich Mean Time...<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Although this will come as little comfort, I want you to know that plans are in place to ensure the survival of the human race.<eos> No-one involved in this cover-up has used it to ensure their own survival.<eos> The President of the United States is dead.<eos> I, too, will perish with you.
I feel like a whore.<eos> Do you like the rolling-up- the-window idea or not?<eos> No, but I like that thing about the zombies.<eos> Okay...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> If we can't think of anything better, we'll figure it out as soon as I give Jim a bath.<eos> Come on, Jim.<eos> (clicks tongue) Take a tub with Mommy.<eos> Fine, but we have to finish this!<eos> If you're not down here in ten minutes, I am climbing in with you!
Well, look who's afraid of doing a little work.<eos> All I do is work while you balance your checkbook, or change your sweater, or have an anxiety attack because you found some old key and you don't know what lock it goes to.<eos> A key without a lock opens the devil's door.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Nobody knows that.<eos> 'Cause you're a crazy old woman, and you're turning me into one, too.<eos> I didn't realize working with me was such a hardship for you.<eos> Well, it is.<eos> You know, I'm losing my hair, and my gums are bleeding.<eos> Working with you is literally killing me.
Boy, you've been typing for two hours nonstop.<eos> You probably want to take a break and...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Uh... Oh! How about that fire in the barn in chapter five?<eos> You wanted to take a look at that.<eos> Let it burn.<eos> All right, listen, I am not proud how I acted upstairs.<eos> I got into a fight with Mike this morning, and I brought it here.<eos> And it had nothing to do with you.<eos> I mean, tech... technically it was about you, but... really about Mike trying to solve my problems.
Wait till you get to the paraffin wax.<eos> I have no idea what the hell that is, but I want it.<eos> Oh, I hope you don't mind me crashing your party, but I just had to get out of there.<eos> We get it.<eos> Yeah, men can be such pigs.<eos> Right?<eos> You think I'll go back to being like those animals?<eos> There's a good chance you won't even remember this.<eos> Just enjoy the time we have left.<eos> I got to say it was fun hanging out with you girls today.
Anything else you can tell me before I return to the Planet of the Apes?<eos> Well, there's the classics:<eos> uh, dirty socks in the hamper, flowers for no reason...<eos> And take it easy down there.<eos> You're not a bear trying to get honey from a tree stump.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> - Poor Molly. - Mmm.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> Well...<eos> I was gonna split this bottle of champagne with you, but then I started reading what you wrote, and I got so into it, I ended up splitting that bottle of champagne with me. (Chuckles)
I have a better idea.<eos> - Lord Hervey.<eos> - What about him?<eos> He runs a hospital of some kind. In the East End.<eos> I've already looked into him. And I intend to do so further.<eos> - Lady Hervey?<eos> - Mr Marlott.<eos> How kind of you to call.<eos> Unfortunately you find me on my way out.<eos> May I walk with you?
Throw it at Bob!<eos> Huh!<eos> Uh-oh, we're losing him.<eos> Throw it at Bob! - Sal, no...!<eos> - Throw it at Bob!<eos> I'm sorry, Bob and Linda!<eos> Linda, are you okay?<eos> You blocked that with your face.<eos> Yeah. My whole face flashed before my eyes.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
You brought everyone together, looked out for 'em, stood up for what's right.<eos> Oh, I see what you're doing.<eos> Go ahead, destroy everything this family's worked for.<eos> Oh, goodie!<eos> I'm just in time.<eos> Looks like Bob is about to be ballooned.<eos> Direct hits only, people.<eos> No splash, no cash.<eos> Horrible aim.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
Landlords have problems.<eos> So long.<eos> See?<eos> My golf cart loses its charge just like yours.<eos> Oh. Mr. Fischoeder,<eos> I-I just realized something.<eos> Is... is it okay if I sit?<eos> Mm.<eos> People are staring.<eos> Mr. Fischoeder, before I got all these people together, maybe I should have come to you first and talked to you one-on-one.
Her name is Charlotte Melville.<eos> Yeah, Charlotte.<eos> That's right.<eos> She has quite a tight cunt, as I recall.<eos> Believe me, I understand.<eos> At your age, straightforward, biological reason supervenes.<eos> But some of the people who live here, haven't you've seen them?<eos> The vanguard of the well-to-do.<eos> They've fitted themselves so tightly into their slots that they no longer have room to escape themselves.<eos> Slots designed by you.
There's another.<eos> Helen!<eos> Helen!<eos> Helen!<eos> It's you.<eos> - The architect.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You see you've made a mistake there.<eos> If you'd have confessed to your sins on camera when our paths crossed in the foyer, I'd have probably edited this bit out.<eos> I'm not accountable to you, Mr. Wilder.
What'll you have?<eos> I'll, uh, have what he's having.<eos> Finally grabbing that beer together, buddy.<eos> You want another?<eos> I'm good.<eos> - What do you see?<eos> - You with Fisher in the restaurant.<eos> You see the shooter?<eos> No, her back's turned.<eos> She's focused on you guys.
The year before that the death ray.<eos> Germany's a nation of liars.<eos> Says the man who lies about his own name.<eos> You don't look too good, Houdini. Huh?<eos> Heatstroke?<eos> Or are you hearing your phantom music again?<eos> You know, I've been to Germany.<eos> Their wonder weapon is propaganda.<eos> They could convince a parent to eat their own child.<eos> Oh, my God, what did she do to you?
Get me this reporter's individual census record, his last income tax return, and his current home address.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Colonel.<eos> _<eos> I trust you informed them of their mistake.<eos> I have.<eos> Why not bring Frank back and we can clear up this confusion?<eos> There's some confusion I'd like to clear up right here concerning the source of this story.<eos> I'm not permitted to leave the Hill.<eos> And all my correspondence is monitored by you, yes?
Imagine my surprise.<eos> Yet it wasn't just a campus you shared with Mr. Lorentzen was it?<eos> I wonder how your husband would feel about your recent visit with an old flame.<eos> Let's call him and ask.<eos> Then again, I'm old-fashioned when it comes to the sanctity of marriage.<eos> Your husband, on the other hand, holds a more progressive view.<eos> Where's Frank?<eos> He lied to you, medicated you with barbiturates after philandering with a woman half his age and half your intelligence, and yet you persist in agitating for his return.<eos> You have a wife, don't you, Colonel?<eos> She didn't choose to join you on the Hill?
Look, one thing I know about Frank, he always manages to find a chair when the music stops.<eos> This one might be electrified.<eos> Helping your husband is what landed me back here in purgatory.<eos> There are things that you don't know, Liza.<eos> I know that Frank dragged me across that desert so that you two could build an atomic bomb.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> A long time ago, I was stuck in a place that I didn't belong.<eos> I almost forgot who I was and then Frank remembered.<eos> Whatever happened between you two, whatever he did, that is not him.
I mean, maybe if Frank was still here, you would have a case,<eos> - but otherwise...<eos> - This stays between us.<eos> I need to speak with Dr. Oppenheimer now.<eos> Can you get him on the phone, please?<eos> No. But I can get you a map.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were back?<eos> Is Kitty asking for me?<eos> Everyone's asking for you.<eos> The two divisions insist on meeting with you before they split, and the Munitions Board won't raise urgency standings without your sign-off.
Do you know where Pennsylvania is, Mrs. Ortiz?<eos> Near New York.<eos> So you know that it's very far away and you may not see your son again for a very long time.<eos> But I can assure you he will have a better life.<eos> A new American name, new clothes.<eos> By the time he graduates, you won't even recognize him.<eos> That is, if he identifies a suspect.<eos> But if my son can't remember the man that he saw...<eos> Well, in that case, I'm afraid that we'd have no reason to send him to the academy.<eos> He'd stay here with you.
Hello.<eos> I'm Abby and this is your grandson Joey.<eos> Oh, boy, that is a lady-slayer in training right there.<eos> Dead ringer for his Uncle Mort.<eos> Just like him.<eos> You watch this one, Mom.<eos> Charlie always did have good taste.<eos> Is he in the car or something?<eos> He's actually very busy.<eos> I wanted a chance to finally meet you myself and Joey, too, right?
After all this is over.<eos> Where do you go after the Hill?<eos> Wherever my wife goes.<eos> Thought you two were done.<eos> Yeah, I'm the flaw in that system.<eos> Call it human error.<eos> I'm still working on fixing it.<eos> I haven't been husband of the year.<eos> At least you didn't trap Abby here twice.<eos> At least your kid is still with you.
He was a guy who wanted to be baptized by me that day in the lake.<eos> Right by the bridge where the body was found.<eos> Interesting, huh?<eos> Seems like something you'd want to share with the police.<eos> Yes, it does, and I plan to, uh, but I got this darn Reformation Day thing.<eos> Uh-huh. Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah, well, I trust you'll go as soon as that's over.<eos> Yes.<eos> I promise I will tell them everything I know.<eos> Good, and I'll go with you and tell 'em everything I know.
It's just nice to know I haven't been killing myself for no reason, that there's somebody who really appreciates everything that I've been do...<eos> where are you going?<eos> Hey, I have a plan to take care of our Schmidt problem.<eos> I'm gonna need your help.<eos> ♪ ♪ After I dumped Kenny's body in the lake, I'd kept a little souvenir.<eos> [knock at door] (Alden) Uh, Pastor Barlow?<eos> I just didn't think I'd have to use it so soon.<eos> Come in.<eos> Are you ready to go to the police?<eos> Before we do, I want to talk to you for a second.
But that includes a free hummer, right?<eos> Only if you can bend down that far.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I have it on good authority that the Fenwicks took a tour of Pineville Lutheran yesterday.<eos> Oh, that's discouraging.<eos> Did I give you the impression I was finished?<eos> Even worse, apparently they really hit it off with P-ville's lady pastor.<eos> [scoffs] Mind-boggling.<eos> [sighs] Guess we've got our work cut out for us.<eos> That's why I've decided to step up and come with you.
- Hey.<eos> Yeah, it's a... just a pleasure to... to see you... again.<eos> Uh, won't you have a seat?<eos> You'll have to... excuse me.<eos> I'm... [breathing excitedly] I am a bit nervous!<eos> [laughing] Oh, don't be.<eos> So... what do you want to do?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I just know that I... I just had to see you again.<eos> After I bumped into you that day... you had such a glow.
Awesome.<eos> (Buddy) I was dead meat.<eos> How could I possibly meet the Fenwicks and not get busted?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> How would you like to make 40 bucks?<eos> I got to take any clothes off?<eos> - Well, yes...<eos> - I'm in.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Pastor Barlow would like to meet you at the church... - Oh.
Well, I have to see about the people in the other floors... but I can check on you later if you want.<eos> Yeah, I want. Ah...<eos> I, ah, work in the penthouse.<eos> Swing by anytime.<eos> All right. Well, I'll see you guys later.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> He is so brave.<eos> I shimmied out of the elevator... climbed up the cable... pried the doors open above us with my bare hands... and I found you help, but yeah... he's superman.<eos> And this is not our floor...<eos> Oh, look, Madame Paulette, I usually talk to my girl Scarlet over on Liberty Street... But both my friends said they met guys after seeing you.
- It doesn't work.<eos> - Well, you're supposed to allow a week.<eos> OK, but if it's going to have an effect in a week, I should see some improvement by now and there's nothing.<eos> I've also stopped using the washing powder, as you advised, but there's no evidence so far from that...<eos> You'll have to leave.<eos> I'm afraid I'm not feeling very well.<eos> But you're a doctor.<eos> Ironic.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?<eos> I'm running a temperature and I feel quite sick and ...<eos> To be honest, I've got a suspicion that, whatever it is, it's probably contagious.<eos> I've got to head off.<eos> Problem with Tom at school.<eos> I'll catch up on paperwork at home.<eos> Can you call the last few and reallocate or put them off?<eos> No problem.<eos> Oh, are you leaving?<eos> I wanted to see you.
Is he going to die?<eos> No. The rider's male, conscious, possible fractured arm.<eos> Can you try and stay still for me.<eos> I'm just lifting up your visor, OK?<eos> Er, no...<eos> I'm a doctor, I just happened to be passing.<eos> He's breathing, alert.<eos> Yes, yes, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You seem fine, but I need you to stay absolutely still.
He's breathing, alert.<eos> Yes, yes, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You seem fine, but I need you to stay absolutely still.<eos> Partly because of the risk of nerve damage, also I don't want blood on my shirt because I've got a really important meeting, is that all right?<eos> Sorry?<eos> What?<eos> Hi.<eos> Jesus!<eos> What happened to you?
Hard at the moment, isn't it?<eos> We were watching a thing.<eos> It's... it's funny.<eos> I'll be over in a minute.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Have the police spoken to you? No.
Carly!<eos> Carly Rae...<eos> Carly Rae Jepsen!<eos> I'm Rick.<eos> I'm Rick.<eos> I'm... uh, this is Kate.<eos> We're huge fans.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> That means a lot to me.<eos> So nice to meet you.
He's unhinged.<eos> He knows that the best move would be to run, but that would mean giving up revenge.<eos> He's trapped, he's desperate.<eos> We turn up the pressure.<eos> We make sure everybody in this city is looking for him.<eos> I like it.<eos> The FBI is tracking Theo Noble.<eos> He is currently traveling with fellow serial killer Daisy Locke.<eos> Now through our investigations, we have been able to uncover several aliases, and there could be countless others.<eos> He could be your neighbor, he could be the guy that you just passed on the street or the man standing behind you at the checkout line.
Is Ryan ok?<eos> He's missing.<eos> What do you mean missing?<eos> I don't have any details to give you, but just know that the entire bureau is looking for him, and we are gonna find him.<eos> Mr. Weston is out of surgery.<eos> He's critical but stable.<eos> How's his fever?<eos> His temperature's still high, but we'll continue to monitor him, see how he does on the antibiotics.<eos> Can I see him?<eos> Once we've cleaned him up, moved him to a room, I'll come get you.
Let's go.<eos> Wait, Rhonda.<eos> Rhonda!<eos> Good luck in there.<eos> What?<eos> You're not coming in?<eos> No.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You came all this way just to give up?<eos> We're not following you inside, right?
- Well, you can't.<eos> You have to teach them how to paddle their stupid feet and stay above the water.<eos> They're going to screw up.<eos> And it will never be their fault.<eos> It will always be your fault.<eos> But how you teach them will determine how they treat patients for years to come.<eos> They're your web-footed legacy, and they're brilliant students.<eos> Hand-selected for this program by doctors wiser than you, and they're your responsibility.<eos> Raise your ducklings.<eos> What is the matter with you two?
Adele is dead.<eos> And you...<eos> I don't know who's dead for you.<eos> But the both of you are very, very much alive and breathing and driving each other crazy.<eos> And you yell and argue and fight, and you both should be thrilled to be able to do those things.<eos> I would give anything to be able to do those things.<eos> And none of those things are reason enough to not be with the person that you love, especially when there just isn't enough.<eos> There will never be enough time.<eos> And you both know that.<eos> So whatever it is that that's coming between you two, will you just please figure it out?
How safe do you feel?<eos> Obviously not nice comments.<eos> Obviously not nice comments - something about bananas.<eos> If these signs are anything to go by, it's all to do with Asian men and women, and Islam.<eos> Because they've basically got a three-headed monster made up of what looks like Islamic men.<eos> It's just ridiculous!<eos> Fucking hell...<eos> So there's another column here, and those flags actually really... really look like swastikas.<eos> - Do you mind being on camera?<eos> - .. Talk to you?
OK. All right.<eos> Well, um... shall we go back in and see if we can catch the fight?<eos> Do you know what? I'm going to pop outside, all right?<eos> I'm going to shoot off.<eos> I don't think I could stay in there for much longer, if I'm totally honest.<eos> That... ignorance was just making me...<eos> struggle with continuing to communicate with someone so backwards.<eos> They're fighting for a Russia that they deem to be pure, and that isn't about lifestyle.<eos> It's about colour.<eos> Being in Russia is... to be really honest with you, tough, because... this is a place that isn't used to people that look like me.
Please, do as he tells you.<eos> For me.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> There he is!<eos> The tunnels, the tunnels, the tunnels, there he is!<eos> General's uniform suits you.<eos> This palace is your home now.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> (clears throat) Rami... my wife Nusrat.<eos> Very nice to meet you.
Ben, get it all up, love.<eos> Get it all up.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get it all up, Ben!<eos> Get it all up!<eos> Come on, darling.<eos> Come on, sweetheart...<eos> That's it.<eos> How did you know?<eos> He's so lucky to have you.
He seems sensitive about money lately.<eos> He hasn't said anything to me.<eos> You know, I am probably wrong.<eos> Just forget I even said anything.<eos> Hi.<eos> You must be Travis.<eos> I'm Skye.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> Em has told me so much about you.<eos> I can't wait to hang out with you guys this weekend.
Please welcome to the Ed stage, Josh Kaminski.<eos> Dude, you're on.<eos> I said podium down!<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Josh Kaminski.<eos> And, uh...<eos> Today, I'd like to... talk to you about... (Inhales deeply) about...<eos> It worked.<eos> Today, I would like to talk to you about alternate paths to success.
Well, if you expedite our trial, that takes care of their motion to dismiss.<eos> Your Honor, they just got this case two days ago.<eos> They're using the timing of our client's contract expiration to try to shake us down.<eos> I have to say, Mr. Zane, I find it hard to believe that in two days you've found out enough to know you need an expedited trial, let alone care about these people at all.<eos> Your Honor, four years ago, a mail carrier named Stanley Powell felt tightness in his chest.<eos> He thought it was nothing, but his wife insisted he go to the hospital.<eos> When he got there, doctors couldn't find anything wrong, but they wanted to keep him for one extra day.<eos> Now unfortunately, Kelton Insurance refused to pay.<eos> So Mr. Powell went home, crawled into bed, and one day later, he was dead.<eos> In front of you, you have a complaint that's over 5,000 pages long, which tells the stories of another 189 victims.
[suspenseful music]<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> And I am excited about this prospect.<eos> Chicago PD.<eos> Please stay calm.<eos> Everyone stay in your seats.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Sorry, but this is not the time.<eos> Five people were murdered today in retaliation for actions you took on behalf of this company.<eos> Now they're coming after you.
You remained immortal.<eos> Not me.<eos> They tell me I was only in there three months, but to me, it was an eternity.<eos> I became an old man.<eos> And I was left behind.<eos> In the darkness.<eos> For an eternity.<eos> I lost everything, over and over again... until I agreed to give them what they demanded... submission.<eos> Soldier no more.<eos> I stand before you.
No!<eos> I only meant to say, little master, your memories are your own, as is your destiny.<eos> It's best you keep both to yourself for now.<eos> You can come out now.<eos> Well, just because you cannot see the world that lies beyond the horizon does not mean it's invisible.<eos> Eventually, we will see it.<eos> You would look into the face of God?<eos> Well, some would suggest that God and nature are one and the same.<eos> Now you blaspheme, sir.<eos> Though I could almost agree with you, seeing these angels of nature.
As you suggested... like the other Mary,<eos> I accept that my son must be sacrificed for a higher end.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You know, I saw her once.<eos> Mousy little thing.<eos> I don't know why their lord chose her.<eos> Nor why ours picked me.<eos> ... Forever and forever.<eos> Amen.<eos> And as you go about your day... Peace be with you.
And if you don't stop seeing her, your wife will know everything along with the police.<eos> The police?<eos> Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.<eos> That 15 part I made up, but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.<eos> But I'm not gonna do any of that as long as you break up with Krista.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Done.<eos> You're also gonna tell her the truth.<eos> That you're married, cheat on your wife, you hire hookers.<eos> That you never had any intention of being serious with her.
One.<eos> The pictures aren't very good.<eos> Can you zoom in on the prisoner?<eos> It's her.<eos> Get into her files.<eos> We have to assume they've been compromised.<eos> Too late.<eos> The encryption system's already been hacked.<eos> And they've sent through another video.<eos> Look, I admire you, OK?
Are you ready to play the game?<eos> Who's gonna be quickest? Who's gonna be luckiest?<eos> This is not a game!<eos> No, it's not a game, sweetheart. And I mean that most sincerely.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Yes, I'd quite like to know that too.<eos> You set this up, why?<eos> Because it's not a game, Kate.<eos> This is a scale model of war.<eos> Every war ever fought, right there in front of you.
- Yes, I'm looking for Tyrell Wellick.<eos> He's not here.<eos> He doesn't work here anymore.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> What do you need to see him for?<eos> And, yes, confirmation coming in.<eos> This is fsociety claiming responsibility for the hack.<eos> We are cutting live to the video right now.<eos> Evil Corp, we have delivered on our promise as expected.<eos> The people of the world who have been enslaved by you have been freed.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Your boss does have an e-mail address, right?<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> My employer and I have a weekly conference call.<eos> I will alert him to your change of heart the next time we speak.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's the best I can do.<eos> Daphne, I'll need to see the current holdings report.<eos> It was a pleasure meeting you both.
Everybody's favorite.<eos> Is that why you killed him?<eos> He wanted me to let her go.<eos> Kelli?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He liked her.<eos> I had to get her away from him.<eos> Push it up! - Kirsten, we're coming!<eos> - Camille!<eos> You know, when I'm through with you, your boyfriend's next.
That was his show.<eos> He loved it.<eos> The rest of us thought it was a little bit too traditional, so we won't be moving forward with it.<eos> Oh, that sucks.<eos> Well, if you didn't want to meet with me about Three Buddies, what did you want to chat about?<eos> I'm a huge fan of you and Ravi both.<eos> I saw Jerry's emails, and I started thinking,<eos> "You know, why can't there be two Indian actors on one network show?"<eos> I mean, that's ridiculous and offensive.<eos> I want to do a show with you and Ravi both.
Excuse me.<eos> We need to speak with Dr. Holtzman, please.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Listen, if after seven years of your crazy theories, you haven't already been committed, then I think you're pretty safe.<eos> Hi.

Okay, but what about me?<eos> You seem pretty fine of accusing me of just about anything.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to accuse you...<eos> Save it for the son you wish you had.<eos> You guys can talk about it at like a Padres game or whatever.<eos> You know, you've been here to see him more in the last few weeks than you've ever come to see me in the last few years.<eos> I was... just...<eos> Look, Brandon, I'm sorry.<eos> I screwed up. I'm new to this.<eos> I don't know how to parent you kids.
Don't stop.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I appreciate you making time to see me, Reverend Collingborne.<eos> I think...<eos> I've had more parishioners asking to see me in the two months since war was declared than in the last five years.<eos> Farming is a reserved occupation, so... you won't have to fight.<eos> No.<eos> But you want to, don't you?<eos> A lot of people would swap places with you in an instant.
There was I wrapped in my naivete, assuming you'd struggle to delegate as President.<eos> How wrong you were.<eos> Thank you, Mrs Goody.<eos> Most informative.<eos> Next... we have a speaker from the Women's Institute at Great Paxford.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I've been told...<eos> Well, not "told" exactly.<eos> .. asked to... talk to the meeting.<eos> To you.
Oh, no.<eos> I couldn't do what you do.<eos> It's easy enough. - Uh-uh.<eos> Just stick the right letters in the right boxes.<eos> No, I'm too nosy.<eos> I'd want to read what's inside them.<eos> - That's against the law.<eos> Mm. Wouldn't make any difference.<eos> I'd be overwhelmed by the urge.<eos> This is a side of you I don't see at Mrs Barden's doorstep.
- Ten.<eos> - One.<eos> Ten.<eos> One.<eos> Five.<eos> Five.<eos> Hey, I just made black coffee in an old tin pan.<eos> Who wants some?<eos> No one?<eos> What's wrong with you people?
Oh, watch it, ladies, it's the po-po.<eos> And what can I do for you, Officers?<eos> We have reason to believe you vandalized your brother-in-law's car a couple of weeks ago, and then threatened him.<eos> Am I a suspect now?<eos> Ladies, they think I might've killed Wendell.<eos> But you were with us.<eos> Damn right, I was.<eos> We all heard the scream.<eos> We couldn't figure out what it was.<eos> - You all can vouch that Clara was with you?
You just plug it in.<eos> That's all you need to do now.<eos> They're already tuned.<eos> You've got your... guide.<eos> Welcome to the 21st century.<eos> You could download all this lot onto your phone.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> More wall space.<eos> For what?<eos> River, I don't want you to take this the wrong way but... - are you all right? - Of course I am.
Yes, and now she's pushing around an empty buggy, for Christ's sake.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Come on. She's got nothing, that kid.<eos> Just give me my buggy!<eos> I need it, please!<eos> Let her have the buggy!<eos> Tia...<eos> You can take the buggy.<eos> If I think that she's a danger to herself, or to you...<eos> Rosa sits in with you.
With difficulty.<eos> I used to think that the people I talk to were more truthful than those actually alive, those actually in existence.<eos> So, you trust them?<eos> Not all of them... and I don't trust what they can make me do.<eos> What would happen if you stopped trusting them and started trusting me?<eos> So you can tell me how to be like everyone else?<eos> Act like everyone else?<eos> No.<eos> So I can help you to be yourself.<eos> But it's up to you if you say yes.
Previously onswitchedatbirth...<eos> There's nothing left for me to liquidate.<eos> That pretty much taps me out.<eos> Why didn't you talk to me?<eos> Kathryn, I am trying to find a way to make this all work.<eos> I can't wait to hang out with you guys this weekend.
Doesn't seem like it.<eos> Look, don't stress.<eos> It's happening, but it's not like it's happening today.<eos> Right.<eos> I have to go.<eos> -Found ya!<eos> -Hey!<eos> Oh, this is my boyfriend, mingo.<eos> Mingo, this is melody.<eos> Nice to meet you!
Upstairs.<eos> We're not French.<eos> Hello, miss!<eos> - Hi, miss!<eos> Hello, Timothy.<eos> Julia.<eos> - Miss Fenchurch.<eos> Miss Fenchurch?<eos> - Miss Fenchurch?<eos> Are you all right?
We all have secrets.<eos> Then... and now.<eos> You've become a friend.<eos> And I haven't had many of those over the years.<eos> I enjoy your companionship.<eos> As does Boris.<eos> I'd like you to stay.<eos> If you can keep your secret as well as I've kept mine, then... .. we need never speak of this again.<eos> Come here.<eos> How long have you been like this?
Haven't been appointed yet.<eos> Um, do you know her?<eos> Uh, that's Dr. Tracy McConnell.<eos> Chief cardio at Hopkins, Yale grad, Yale meds.<eos> SAGES Award recipient.<eos> She's Catherine's candidate for chief.<eos> - Dr. Webber.<eos> - Ah. Hey.<eos> It is such an honor.<eos> I have been wanting to meet you for years.
You have a house.<eos> Had a house.<eos> Callie and I sold it.<eos> Now it turns out I need a little help in the rent department.<eos> You'd be surprised how many patients can't afford my fees.<eos> I mean, what am I gonna do?<eos> Gonna look parents in the eye and tell them I can't treat their teeny, tiny, little sickly babies?<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you need a place to live?<eos> Me live with you?
I don't even want to go in there. I may lose it.<eos> Not even kidding.<eos> I may...<eos> What's happening?<eos> You.<eos> Come here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sit.<eos> Good.<eos> I want you to stop and take a closer look at the body in front of you.
In the same city, maybe half the time.<eos> God, this is terrible.<eos> When they were away from each other, did Christa see another guy?<eos> What?<eos> You think she's just gonna walk up to him and say,<eos> "hey, while you're out, I was messing around with some pretty boy I was posing with or some photographer?"<eos> All right, look, you know what?<eos> I gotta go take of my brother.<eos> - Anything else, guys?<eos> - Okay, you're his trainer and his brother, and we're supposed to just take your word that Felix was with you?
Touch each other, damn it.<eos> There.<eos> Now, that's it.<eos> Handheld. A couple here.<eos> Um, excuse me, can I help you?<eos> I'm Lieutenant Andy Flynn.<eos> This is Detective Amy Sykes, L.A.P.D.<eos> If we need your help, we'll let you know.<eos> - Meanwhile, stand aside.<eos> - Malcolm Rich. From L.A.P.D.'s Major Crimes Division - and we need to talk to you.
Christa did not send him a text.<eos> Tell us where Felix is.<eos> He's working out.<eos> Getting ready for the fight that was supposed to change our lives.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He already had it.<eos> Felix Koster, you're under arrest for the murder of Christa Cook.<eos> Spread your legs and put your hands behind your head.<eos> All right, man, be cool, all right?<eos> I ain't fighting you guys.
Sent to provoke Felix into attacking his ex.<eos> Well, that's a very interesting conjecture, but we have a deal, and you can't use the webcam against Malcolm, so why are we here?<eos> Because Mr. Rich lied in his statement of facts. And as you know, a lie invalidates the deal, but not the evidence.<eos> I did not lie.<eos> I gave you the names of every girl on that list.<eos> I'm not a girl... sir.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My computer was infected as well with Malcolm's spyware.<eos> What?<eos> I never meant to spy on you.
I'm afraid I'm not taking on any more work.<eos> I'm not here to ask you to do my books, Mrs Scotlock.<eos> My name is Detective Sergeant Brooks and I'm here to arrest you on suspicion of fraudulent accounting and aiding and abetting tax evasion under the 1939 Prices of Goods Act.<eos> You are not obliged to say anything, unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given against you.<eos> Alison!<eos> Alison!<eos> How do we explain to the county that we've raised so much?<eos> I think all we can say is what Pat suggests.<eos> That an anonymous donor made a very gen...<eos> I was wondering if I could have a word with you.
Oh, Christine, you know Daddy doesn't work for the FBI anymore.<eos> But he goes to the FBI.<eos> Well, it's a whole new part of the FBI.<eos> See, what I do now is, I train agents.<eos> Daddy is a freelance instructor.<eos> - What does "freelance" mean?<eos> - It means that I can do whatever I want.<eos> I can... I can go whenever I want.<eos> I'm the boss, right?<eos> It means I can spend more time with you, right?
It's okay.<eos> Dr. Brennan needs to do this.<eos> You think it's him, don't you?<eos> We left all this behind.<eos> It can't be him.<eos> It just can't.<eos> And, uh, I just feel like, um... this is going somewhere.<eos> Why did you feel that this is going somewhere?<eos> No, I just... I feel like I'm gonna kiss you.<eos> Whoa-whoa, listen, Bones, everything is gonna be okay between you and Angela, all right?
What you got, Cher?<eos> I put out an APB on Booth's car.<eos> It's at long-term parking at Reagan.<eos> But he never got on a flight.<eos> What?<eos> Her.<eos> Hello, Caroline.<eos> Agent Miller, this is Agent Aubrey.<eos> Oh, I've heard a lot about you.<eos> I'm looking forward to collaborating with you on this case.
Her.<eos> Hello, Caroline.<eos> Agent Miller, this is Agent Aubrey.<eos> Oh, I've heard a lot about you.<eos> I'm looking forward to collaborating with you on this case.<eos> Uh, no one told me I'd be collaborating.<eos> She's from internal investigations.<eos> There won't be much of a collaboration.<eos> They've sicced her on Booth.<eos> I will work with you to the extent that I can, but when a former agent is a suspect, it...
We were getting worried about you.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's just a scratch, right?<eos> You don't look fine.<eos> Hey, this man's gut-shot.<eos> He needs a doctor.<eos> No doctors.<eos> You still with us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm still with you.
But I get up.<eos> I go over, I turn the light on, pick him up... and at one point, he looks up at me, and he just smiles and starts laughing at me.<eos> And then we both just start laughing.<eos> I'm laughing with this person I created, right, with my kid, this person I'm gonna watch grow up and do great things one day-- hopefully.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I just can't think of one night of partying or drinking that made me feel even one millionth of that feeling.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Highlight of my year was when I crashed Zachary Quinto's Halloween party.<eos> Remember, your education is the key to a prosperous future.<eos> I'm really proud of both of you.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Hmm, summer ale.<eos> Hey, where's Grant?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Grant?<eos> Grant.<eos> Grant!<eos> Hey, Grant!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Excuse me. Is he with you, sir?
I don't know, Arnold.<eos> It might be a little big.<eos> Maybe we should shop around a little bit?<eos> Oh, no, you make room for a piece this nice.<eos> It's so soft.<eos> Why is it only $300?<eos> What's the catch?<eos> No catch, I'm moving out of the country, so I just need to get rid of it.<eos> These pillows feel like they're filled with angel feathers.<eos> Can I actually talk to you over here for a minute?
Wrap 'em up.<eos> It's no use.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There's Vicodin in there.<eos> Tonight, rinse the burn with sterile water.<eos> Here's my card.<eos> Hap insists you call me if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'd have been better off, you hadn't been looking after me.
What the hell would we do without them?<eos> - Cheers. - Cheers.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Billy, did you tell Cody about our new venture?<eos> Mm, he did.<eos> Sounds like a wonderful opportunity.<eos> Oh, it's a good one.<eos> It has was we call "an asymmetrical upside."<eos> Okay. And that's a good thing.<eos> Actually, Hap, uh, I don't think I'm gonna be able to go in with you after all.
Yeah?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. Christen her later.<eos> Come on, partners.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> You serious?<eos> Can't be too careful.<eos> I got to be honest with you, son.<eos> That little bottleneck play of yours reminded me of myself back in the old days.<eos> Yeah, well, I got to be honest with you, too, sir.

How's my dad?<eos> Is he gonna be all right?<eos> Oh, he'll be all right.<eos> I'm gonna let you in.<eos> A share of this deal's gonna cost you 500k.<eos> What do you mean, you bought it?<eos> I committed to something with Hap today, okay?<eos> Why can't we do both?<eos> Because there's not enough money to do both.<eos> I don't think I'm gonna be able to go in with you after all.
Meet Finn Wyler, your new partner.<eos> Finn was a chef in Chicago.<eos> But he got a bit cocky and ended up trading his restaurant in for this.<eos> Your recipes, me behind the grill.<eos> In a year, we could have a fleet of these.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Partners?<eos> Partners.<eos> Yes!<eos> Hey, Mr. Briggs, I need to talk to you.
You, too, sweetheart.<eos> - Who's this asshole?<eos> - The thorn in our side.<eos> - I just wanna talk.<eos> - Shoot him, Richard.<eos> - I want in on Jacknife Jed's.<eos> - You know about that?<eos> How the fuck did you find us?<eos> -I knew about your uncle from your file.<eos> Been following you guys
What happened to Danny, that was... Well, that was just me running out of options.<eos> When I showed up in the room, not only was he not out cold, but the jackass was still singing that terrible song.<eos> I have no memory of... of picking up a hair dryer... or throwing it in the tub, or holding his head underwater till he went... Glub glub glub.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we've heard enough.<eos> Andrea, what do you think?<eos> If he agrees to eventually write all that down, Mr. Sloan may participate in the marriage ceremony and stay through the first dance with his daughter, provided the police escort him every moment and he doesn't try to get away.<eos> Mr. Sloan, do agree to the very generous terms offered to you in front of your family by the State and witnessed by the L.A.P.D.?<eos> I do.<eos> Then by the power vested in me by the State of California, I will allow you to attend your daughter's wedding, and we will go with you.
Lieutenant, may I ask what rating you gave me for my first day on the job?<eos> 93.<eos> That'll be higher than any other reserve officer in your class, but still leaves room for improvement, like knowing when to keep your mouth shut.<eos> But we did end up solving a murder. And that's great.<eos> Look, I love my job.<eos> And you...<eos> Why... why, I don't mind you at all.<eos> What a compliment, Lieutenant.<eos> I don't mind you at all, either.<eos> In fact, some days, I even admire you.
The bypass will be jammed.<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> - Any idea?<eos> - No.<eos> - I'll go north.<eos> - OK, go north.<eos> - Where shall I drop you?<eos> - In the north.<eos> OK.<eos> At least you're not complicated.
- Any idea?<eos> - No.<eos> - I'll go north.<eos> - OK, go north.<eos> - Where shall I drop you?<eos> - In the north.<eos> OK.<eos> At least you're not complicated.<eos> There.<eos> It was nice talking to you.
I didn't expect to see you here.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Fine.<eos> So, are you back?<eos> What's up? Are you getting married?<eos> Er...<eos> Sonia, Jeanne, Sonia.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - And you.<eos> I'll join you.
Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to get, and Evil Corp is...<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> There's a twist.<eos> You're usually the one a step ahead of me.<eos> They hit the mother lode during the breach.<eos> Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.<eos> They're threatening to dump everything unless the FBI frees Colby.<eos> They released the video this morning.<eos> Hello, Evil Corp. We are Fsociety.<eos> Over the years, we have been watching you.
Any idea who the father might be?<eos> Actually, I'm glad you asked... Because if I ever saw the man who left my daughter in a vulnerable situation,<eos> I would break all his bones.<eos> Yes! He deserves a stern talking to that ends in forgiveness.<eos> ♪ Strangers in the night ♪<eos> Hello. I'm Sonu Lahiri.<eos> Welcome.<eos> ♪ Exchanging glances ♪<eos> Sonu, please. This is Mindy's coworker, Danny.<eos> Wonderful to meet you, Danny.
Let me out!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Please!<eos> Let me out!<eos> I will not stand by and let it all just happen.<eos> I will do anything to stop it, even violate my Essex oath.<eos> Hear me, old ones.<eos> I swear I will not let you ignore me.<eos> I will cross the forbidden threshold.<eos> I am coming to see you.
If you have daddy issues, Agent Aubrey, perhaps a visit to a shrink is going to be more advantageous than talking to me.<eos> My father is Philip Aubrey.<eos> Maybe you've heard of him.<eos> He stole billions from his clients, so I know how this works.<eos> So you say that you don't have an account worth 4.6, because today the value might be<eos> 4.63 or 4.8.<eos> So, in your twisted little mind, you've told the truth.<eos> And if the account's in the name of some holding company, then you can honestly report that you don't have anything that belongs to Christopher Pelant and Associates.<eos> Now, you should know that I actually helped bring down my own father, Mr. Dunlop.<eos> So bringing you down will be a piece of cake.

Yeah, I-I got to get right back out.<eos> But nate said that you were upset.<eos> Your dad and I signed the divorce papers today.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Yeah, jay.<eos> We got a divorce.<eos> I want to go to nate's fight tonight.<eos> I thought that you had work.<eos> I'll call in sick.<eos> I want to be with you guys.
You need major psychological help.<eos> Hi, it's Laura.<eos> Leave a message and I'll call you back.<eos> Hi, it's Laura. Leave a mess...<eos> Christina: Hi!<eos> Hey, are you with Laura?<eos> No. She dropped me off a couple of hours ago.<eos> How long?<eos> Well, I don't know. Like, a couple of hours.<eos> Did something happen between the two of you that I should know about?
♪ NCIS:<eos> LA 7x01 ♪ Active Measures Original Air Date on September 21, 2014<eos> This guy had no I.D., no keys.<eos> Prints didn't turn up anywhere.<eos> You sure you don't know who he is?<eos> Then why was he following you?<eos> Maybe he was following you.<eos> He wasn't following me.<eos> He was following you.<eos> I know, because I was following both of you.
Well, it's ultimately for the experts to decide, but the original painting was stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.<eos> It's crazy how art has become a favorite currency of drug dealers and terrorists.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No wonder.<eos> If this painting is original, it's worth over $200 million.<eos> Wow.<eos> So...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just... be careful.<eos> Looks like I owe you an apology.
You have every right to be angry.<eos> I... take full responsibility for what I did and any disciplinary action you see fit.<eos> I put you in a difficult position, and I'm not certain that I wouldn't have done the same thing.<eos> So what do we do about Callen?<eos> Protect him as best we can... even if it's from himself.<eos> And you and me?<eos> I think this is where we kiss and make up.<eos> "Kiss and make up"?<eos> It is a privilege to have a man with your honor on this team, Mr. Hanna.<eos> It's an honor to have the privilege of working with you, Hetty.
Oh, that looks so good there.<eos> - Right?<eos> - ‭I just love all the colors.<eos> It makes me feel so happy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I call it "Rape Of The Immigrant."<eos> I think we left ‭the brownies in the car.<eos> - Oh, I'll get those.<eos> - Well, way to go, pal.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you people?
I'm betting whatever you two are up to, innocent people are gonna get hurt.<eos> Don't worry, I remember our deal.<eos> You leave me alone, I make sure no one dies.<eos> All right.<eos> You're a criminal, Snart, but you live by a code.<eos> It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't, like he won't care if people die.<eos> That's why I can't leave this alone.<eos> Then everyone will know who The Flash is under that mask.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I will take you down anyway.
Oh, when I can.<eos> Go ahead, you...<eos> No.<eos> Tonight...<eos> What I said... particularly about children...<eos> Oh. I did have a child.<eos> She died at six weeks.<eos> So...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And you should note that I've shared coffee with you... what?
Assistant Director!<eos> Agent Jimenez is waiting for you outside.<eos> Controlled explosions, seconds apart.<eos> Multiple levels beneath the tracks.<eos> If you believe the CIA, it's tied to Ukrainian nationalists.<eos> Homeland security says ISIS.<eos> How about our girl?<eos> She's starting to piece it together.<eos> Maybe I should step in.<eos> You really think that's such a good idea after what happened between you two at the Academy?
I'll help you move the Gudea then I'm out, we're done, okay?<eos> We're here to make money.<eos> As we did in Iraq.<eos> As you did.<eos> We were once a successful team.<eos> - We could do it again.<eos> - Pass.<eos> Why does that make you so uncomfortable?<eos> Because I've moved on.<eos> And getting involved with you is count...
They will ruin your life in ways you cannot imagine.<eos> Do yourself a favor...<eos> Drop the Sherlock Holmes routine.<eos> Mr. Swift?<eos> I'm Roxanna Whitman. Ash Whitman's daughter.<eos> Oh. Oh, of course.<eos> We spoke a few months ago about your family's collection.<eos> Such a shame so few have seen it.<eos> Those who have speak about it almost reverentially.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more.
- You do kind of resemble her.<eos> - The same blue eyes. - The Romanov eyes. - Nicholas' smile.<eos> - Alexandra's chin. - Oh, look.<eos> She even has the grandmother's hands.<eos> She's the same age, the same physical type.<eos> Are you trying to tell me you think that I am Anastasia?<eos> I've seen thousands of girls all over the country.<eos> Not one of them looks as much like the Grand Duchess as you.<eos> - Look at the portrait. - I knew you were crazy. - But now I think you are both mad.<eos> - Why? - You don't remember what happened to you.
So how are you?<eos> -I am good.<eos> I finished my book.<eos> -What's it about?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Do you want to take a walk?<eos> "Dear Mary Angela:<eos> Hi, how's it going?<eos> This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write."<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
It's great fun.<eos> Oh, I don't want it to be any fun at all, Father.<eos> I want a good miserable time.<eos> k eep me on the straight and narrow.<eos> I met a couple there last year, it did them the world of good.<eos> They were a bit obsessed with the old s-e-x.<eos> God, I'm glad I never think of that type of thing, that whole sexual world.<eos> God, when you think of it, it's a dirty, filthy thing, isn't it?<eos> Can you imagine, Father?<eos> Looking up at your husband and him standing over you with his lead in his hand, wanting you to degrade yourself.
-You son of a bitch.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Watch my arm.<eos> It might be broke.<eos> What's with you?<eos> You have no right to be pushing me around like that.<eos> I was just watching the parade.<eos> I wasn't pranking on nobody.<eos> What are you getting so upset about?<eos> You're lucky I don't sue you.
I got thinking.<eos> We four go hiking.<eos> And where?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Anywhere.<eos> Until tomorrow, Yeye.<eos> Lord, I've looked into the eyes.<eos> Smiling, you say my name.<eos> And in the sand I left my boat.<eos> Together with you, seek other seas.
Cure him immediately or I'll kill you all.<eos> One minute, kill him.<eos> Another, cure him.<eos> You should listen carefully to what the Chief says<eos> Once he's dead, nothing can be done. She will blame you all your life.<eos> You can safely breach the Sect's rules from now on.<eos> "Thunder over the hills.<eos> Undying through the centuries"<eos> The Hills!<eos> The Heavens are upon you.
It feels all are coming at me.<eos> If you walk in these clothes, this is what happens.<eos> - Even your people adopted to Istanbul.<eos> - Who?<eos> Villagers from Haraptar, they opened a cafe.<eos> How can Istanbul not be so crowded?<eos> Damn them.<eos> What are we going to do, Behram?<eos> What?<eos> I brought some money, I'd like to start some business with you.
That's why, Vseslav, we can't go on living like that, relying only on our strength.<eos> So, harden it.<eos> You are right, father.<eos> It's time to unite the tribes, to defend ourselves against the steppe, to build an army out of all clans.<eos> We can't resist on our own.<eos> But how to achieve that?<eos> The Ilvichi and Vyatichi look at us like enemies.<eos> And I can't find an agreement with the others as well.<eos> Don't get mad, son.<eos> Work with other Slavs together, the ones who agree with you.
Not a day's coldness or mistrust or disappointment.<eos> Never that.<eos> Let's go and change.<eos> How many more do you think?<eos> Another hundred?<eos> A lifetime.<eos> I want to marry you, Charles.<eos> One day, why now?<eos> War, this year, next year, sometime soon.<eos> I want a year or two with you of real peace.

But there is no hope of overtaking Sinbad?<eos> No matter, Achmed.<eos> I expected such a possibility.<eos> I am prepared for it.<eos> Mandrake root and a few chemicals is all that is needed.<eos> No!<eos> Don't throw stones in the well that you drink from.<eos> Do you dare defy the demons of darkness?<eos> I've watched them drain your strength.<eos> Look! See what they have done to you already.
You are nothing to me.<eos> Why my mind is in turmoil?<eos> My sense tells me to be quiet.<eos> Go away you both now. Let my heart speak.<eos> I come to paint.<eos> It is Sunday.<eos> We are not going anywhere today.<eos> The first look of your eye, with shine that matches the sun Impounded my heart.<eos> That I love you, ah most darling, To the whole world I'll tell.<eos> But from you, ah most darling, my secret I will hide.
Sorcerer ...They said about him:<eos> I commit you, clouds and thunders!<eos> I'm sending you to woods and to waters!<eos> You have no power here!<eos> No power! No power!<eos> I charge you, go away!<eos> Away!<eos> Away! Go to forests and precipices, where no horse neighs and no crow flies.<eos> Away!<eos> Something happened to you, Yurochko?
Gallant soldier, let me through, to the wives of Emir.<eos> -No! If you wish to know the cause of your misfortune, come here and I'll tell you what threatens your happiness.<eos> (Sings a song in Uzbek).<eos> If you know where Nasreddin is hiding, tell me.<eos> I have to consult with him about your case.<eos> All right, I'll try to find Nasreddin.<eos> Have you seen Nasreddin?<eos> - No, I haven't seen him.<eos> Oh, woman... Woe to you!<eos> Black hand of an evil spirit is upon you.
Especially on a day like this.<eos> But, uh...<eos> Been an honor working with you all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - To the blue.<eos> - To the blue.<eos> When you say you have an emergency, I really hope you mean it.<eos> Your dad is in town.<eos> And he wants to see you.

But she passed away, and, uh, I really need to speak with you.<eos> But you did take the hamster from the store without paying for it.<eos> Dad?<eos> You home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Quite a haul, huh?<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Did you go picking berries?<eos> Denise, honey, you've got to tell me next time you're gonna go pick berries.<eos> You understand there's nothing more in the world I want to do than go pick berries with you.
You doing something about it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mainly pills.<eos> A lot of fucking pills.<eos> Doctor says I gotta get it replaced.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that, bro.<eos> Yeah, I know, man, but it's all good.<eos> Hey, listen, I didn't come over for a medical consultation, Rick. I came over to tell you that, um... I left ASM and I'm branching out on my own.<eos> Oh, congratulations, man. I'm with you all the way, baby.
It's just so bloody dark in here.<eos> I know.<eos> I made the mistake of looking right into the flame, and then, you know, the rest of the world went dark.<eos> Oh, that's funny to you?<eos> It's just your accent. Mm.<eos> It's hilarious. I l-love listening to it. I could listen to it all day.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Do you... hey, um... Would you, actually, think about ever having dinner with me, maybe?<eos> With you?
You know what this place is, you know what happens here.<eos> No, it's different this time.<eos> There are more of us, and Sidney's got... cameras all over the house.<eos> Nobody's gonna let us get hurt.<eos> You're smarter than that, Shelby.<eos> It will happen again.<eos> I don't know if we'll survive this time.<eos> I wouldn't have guessed you and I had anything in common.<eos> Gotta say, I never did see the resemblance.<eos> I ain't got nothing in common with you.
There's so much out there waiting for us.<eos> I'm gonna get my spin-off.<eos> You're gonna get your yoga studio.<eos> But we, but we have to stick together.<eos> And we can do it.<eos> I know we can.<eos> You're a really good actor.<eos> You think so?<eos> All right, come on, come on.<eos> I got you.
Lee?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You evil bitch!<eos> Oh, my God, Lee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank God for you. ‭Shh.<eos> Thank God for you. Thank God for you.<eos> Shh. ‭Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lee, my God. What did they do to you? Monet?
Absolutely.<eos> I'm here if you need me.<eos> Mr. McGregor get his antipsychotics yet?<eos> Yes. 2 milligrams of Risperidone.<eos> Little over three hours ago.<eos> You'd think it'd be making a dent in his symptoms by now.<eos> Not really happening.<eos> Give me a shout when the CT results come in.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay, something's different.<eos> You look happy.<eos> I'm just glad to have a weekend shift.<eos> Looking forward to a quiet day.<eos> - Hey, Nat.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Will has the day off.<eos> Thought Jeff could follow you.
You're sleeping though, right?<eos> Are you sleeping?<eos> - Dad, come on.<eos> - Hey, new job, new city, I'm sorry, you know, could be a little stressful.<eos> I'm fine, Dad.<eos> And really, you're not my therapist.<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> Proud of you.
You let him make that call.<eos> All right.<eos> You keep me posted.<eos> How goes the battle?<eos> Ugh, it's supposed to hit 105 today, so we've got a generator on standby just in case our grid goes dark.<eos> Sharon, listen.<eos> Bert called me.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He wants to get together for drinks, and I just... I wanted to check in with you before I responded to him.
- Yes!<eos> - We did that.<eos> Man, you really stepped up today.<eos> You impressed me out there.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Is... is that a compliment?<eos> 'Cause as I remember it, you were like,<eos> "Don't you even think about putting in that chest tube."<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I was proud of you, and now you're just being a dick.
No, really.<eos> It's not the first time my mouth's gotten me into trouble.<eos> I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> I was just trying to protect you.<eos> I've had so long to think about this, and what Tate and I have is real.<eos> Well, okay. In that case, if you need anyone to go dress shopping with, I'm available.<eos> Danny wants to stay at your place.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, I mean, makes perfect sense, right?<eos> I mean, now that he's free of the traffickers, there's this big void in his life, which he wants to fill with you.
- Not yet.<eos> - Hang in there.<eos> The kid's a survivor.<eos> PD will find him.<eos> I'm not just gonna sit around and do nothing.<eos> Well you're gonna go out looking for him?<eos> Come on, Sarah, it's a big city.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> I'll come with you.
- Treatment 6.<eos> - Got it.<eos> You and Dr. Shore better be the real deal.<eos> I am bringing a ChÃ¢teau Pichon 2005.<eos> Great, wine spritzers.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> Treatment 1.<eos> Hey, did you get those lab results yet?<eos> They just came in.<eos> Want me to come with you?
- What's going on?<eos> - Charge to 200.<eos> He's in cardiac arrest.<eos> Clear. Still in v-tach.<eos> Come on.<eos> Charge to 300.<eos> Sinus rhythm. Jim, can you hear me?<eos> He's stable for now.<eos> Jim?<eos> I need to talk to you.
- They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.<eos> - It's not just the Watchdogs now.<eos> Local gangs have been working for them.<eos> I was tracing the sale of a weapon.<eos> A breath of fresh air.<eos> And I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.<eos> Everyone's attached to something.<eos> You actually trust this guy?<eos> I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me.<eos> The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
Well, I've known him since Crandall Elementary.<eos> He was always quiet, like he was hiding something.<eos> The two of us used to hit up the Moonraker Arcade down in Little Tokyo.<eos> Isn't that right, Robbie?<eos> Yes, it is, so I've seen a side of him that most people haven't.<eos> We used to hang there every day till your uncle would pick you up.<eos> How's he doing these days?<eos> You get lost...<eos> or I'll get angry.<eos> So angry, I may not remember what I do to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> That's classified.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Aah! Get away from me!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Get away!<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Your friends with you? - No.
No, I'm not taking that bait.<eos> We're here to protect you.<eos> Inhumans are attacking our cities, and we have to fight back.<eos> We have reliable information there's an Inhuman here in this hotel right now.<eos> If anyone knows who it is, it's your duty to turn it in.<eos> If one of those freaks of nature was here, we'd know.<eos> They're people, too.<eos> They deserve to be here as much as we do.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Is this what LA. Did to you?
Think that's true?<eos> No idea.<eos> I've never met one.<eos> Just know that people don't like them 'cause they're different.<eos> I've been there.<eos> That doesn't look so great.<eos> I don't know why you're not at the E.R.<eos> It won't do any good.<eos> There's no power.<eos> Looks like someone's watching out for you.
Same thing you do...<eos> Answers.<eos> And your Uncle Eli has them.<eos> That's why you were going to see him.<eos> See, I think we're on the same side, but I need you to prove it to me.<eos> Prove you're not the demon the stories say you are.<eos> You saved a friend of mine from a guy my bullets went straight through.<eos> You're the only one we know that can hurt those things.<eos> So let's help each other.<eos> Eli won't talk to us, but he'll talk to you.
Figure some explosives might come in handy.<eos> It's a start.<eos> I could use a different type of firepower right now.<eos> I've got you covered.<eos> Remember, I was lighting fuses long before I was the fuse.<eos> Maybe doing some good will make you feel better.<eos> I think it might. Yeah.<eos> This is your plan?<eos> Explosives?<eos> What is wrong with you?
May, want to go to prison?<eos> Could be Taco Tuesday.<eos> I'll call the warden and find out.<eos> Lucy leaves a lot of crazy in her wake.<eos> If we're gonna track her down, we're gonna need that antidote.<eos> Fitz said that they were close.<eos> I don't want it close.<eos> I want it here.<eos> Wait.<eos> If we're going to get my uncle, I'm going with you.
[Growls]<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Mack:<eos> The exit's just ahead. [Alarm blaring]<eos> [Coughing]<eos> Man:<eos> Hey.<eos> A little help here.<eos> All right, get Eli out of here!<eos> I'll be right behind you.
- That's the deal I made.<eos> I swore to go after those who spilled innocent blood.<eos> And then I was reborn.<eos> You killed all those Locos.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> The thing inside me.<eos> It craves vengeance.<eos> Those gangsters got what they deserved for what they did to you.
- This is not finished yet.<eos> - Look, I'm part of this team.<eos> And I refuse to be kept in the dark.<eos> I want to see the book.<eos> Well, I don't have it. Joseph does, and he's not here.<eos> And you will never get it.<eos> Where is Frederick?<eos> Where are the others?<eos> What have you done with them?<eos> Same thing that I'm gonna do to you.
Everything's gonna be all right.<eos> We're gonna make sure of that.<eos> All right, well, I need you in this fight, 'cause I got to get back to her.<eos> I'm in this fight.<eos> I hope I've done the right thing.<eos> The pages are blank.<eos> Not to her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Jemma...
They thought I was cheating.<eos> They thought I wasn't capable!<eos> Shut me out.<eos> Well, guess what ...<eos> guess what I'm capable of now.<eos> I can create a city out of nothing, or I can cover it in volcanic rock.<eos> Robbie...<eos> I am becoming a god.<eos> You better be.<eos> Because the devil is coming for you.
Then you know matter can't be created or destroyed.<eos> Except I've proven it's not true.<eos> I'm rewriting the laws of nature.<eos> Yeah, but you're drunk on power or drinking your own Kool-Aid or drunk on Powerade ...<eos> I don't know.<eos> The point is, you're not creating energy, Eli ... you're stealing it.<eos> Stealing it?<eos> From where?<eos> Remember when you thought I was dead?<eos> I was actually right in front of you, trapped between dimensions.
Okay.<eos> It was the damnedest thing.<eos> Like a nightmare, but so real.<eos> Is it hot in here to you?<eos> It's just me.<eos> Feels like it's getting hot in here.<eos> It's hard to breathe.<eos> I need to get some air.<eos> That ought to teach you.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
Take off that hat.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's done is done, right?<eos> I mean, you know, can't we just... Move on?<eos> Brian... speak.<eos> You're contractually bound to the show for another two years.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, and if I refuse?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, Kevin.<eos> The network owns you.
You don't need to worry.<eos> I won't harm Belle.<eos> You see, there's one final twist.<eos> I am not the monster you need to worry about.<eos> Mary?<eos> Henry!<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> Where's Hyde?<eos> Wh-What's going on?<eos> I sent him last night to talk to you.
What do you think?<eos> All right.<eos> I hope I can remember how to do this tomorrow.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Why do I have to go live with someone else?<eos> Oh, sweetie, they're not just someone else, they're family.<eos> You belong with them.<eos> So are you, right?<eos> You're family.<eos> I want to live with you, Uncle Chin.
One of the victims was your wife, wasn't it?<eos> Joanna Wallace.<eos> Revenge.<eos> This thing is all about revenge?<eos> You're gonna, you're gonna walk in there where certain death and potentially give up the Greystone, just so you can settle the score with El Hamadi?<eos> Sorry, Harry.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> We have a kill or capture order on El Hamadi.<eos> He's a high-value target to our government, too.<eos> Which is why we're coming with you.
Harrison Street.<eos> Downtown Chicago.<eos> So... fresh.<eos> Casey?<eos> So wonderfully supple.<eos> Casey?<eos> Baby?<eos> She's watching you, you know.<eos> Your lying, sneaking mother.<eos> She's right beside you.
What you want?<eos> Roxy Barnes.<eos> Look at you, the first woman to break the glass ceiling and run the Splitz.<eos> Didn't just break it, Five-O-- straight-up blasted it. That's impressive.<eos> You're a real inspiration to women.<eos> You're a regular Susan B. Anthony.<eos> Who?<eos> Never mind.<eos> My name's Detective Reagan.<eos> I need to talk to you.
What are you doing here?<eos> Hoping I wasn't gonna find you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Come on, Anthony, we both know we're on Frankie's block.<eos> We are?<eos> You're as good a liar as you are a linguist.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> Don't worry about this.<eos> I know how you feel, Anthony.<eos> And I'm 100% behind you, but if you do what we both know you're here to do, then your mother's gonna lose you, too.
- Inside.<eos> - We were all hurrying out, - I'm sure she was right behind me.<eos> - Inside?<eos> Where's the bloody fire department?<eos> Murdoch, wait here!<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> We need as much water as we can get!<eos> Off your bloody arses!<eos> Julia!<eos> I'm just trying to look out for you, Nina.
Shake a leg, ladies!<eos> - Samuel!<eos> You can't go back in there.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - It's everything I've got.<eos> - No!<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - You can't, it's too dangerous.<eos> George, stop!<eos> Are you all right?
- Goodbye, Julia.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> I can breathe.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Julia...<eos> When Miss James was attending to you, you told her that you saw Eva Pearce in the fire.
- And now you're gonna steal from your sister.<eos> - She's loaning me money.<eos> - And loaning you money - that you're then going to lose!<eos> - Now hold on.<eos> - If I find out you harm her in any way...<eos> - George, what is going on?<eos> He wants me to give you your money back.<eos> You'll do no such thing.<eos> George, what makes you think that this has anything to do with you?<eos> I'm just trying to look out for you.
I'll show you the attitude of a champion.<eos> John Brackenreid!<eos> - Me?<eos> - Get in the barricade.<eos> Right, lads.<eos> Flank him either side.<eos> - But Father...<eos> - Tom!<eos> Ready?<eos> Good lord, are you all right?
Now, but how is Mr. Newsome going to present?<eos> He remains, after all, a corpse.<eos> Perhaps I'll present for him, sir.<eos> I'll wheel the sitting duck out there and then explain to the audience that Newsome can't speak due to a broken rib.<eos> - I'll be his voice.<eos> - Very good, George.<eos> I suppose you had better brush up on your ornithology before then.<eos> Uh, I rather look forward to it.<eos> I do hope Mr. Newsome's hair is satisfactory after my little trim.<eos> Yes, Julia, I've been meaning to speak to you about something.
- After a kiss.<eos> See?<eos> It's not so bad, is it?<eos> - Something's moving. - Just the earth.<eos> Please, I would like you to stop.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Don't!<eos> You there!<eos> - Get away from her! - Aaaaaah!<eos> - Are you alright? - Yes.
Hmm. You ever think about who the other woman was?<eos> Of course I think about it.<eos> Ken was sleeping with Taylor.<eos> What?<eos> Mary!<eos> You were my friend.<eos> - How could you?<eos> - Ken? I would never!<eos> My God, stop lying!<eos> What's wrong with you?
In the newspapers.<eos> - Emily.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Ms. Reagan, I can't do this.<eos> If you think of anything else, please give us a call.<eos> Spoke to the super.<eos> There's nothing on the security cameras.<eos> - Well, it was worth a try, Danny.<eos> - Hey, if you say so.<eos> What's going on with you?
But our job is to pursue justice for victims who have nowhere else to turn.<eos> You know who taught me that?<eos> You did.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Hmm? I mean, you do realize that I was just investigated for shooting a serial killer, right?<eos> I mean, a serial killer, Erin.<eos> I didn't get a thank you or a "whew, thank goodness he's off the street."<eos> I almost lost my gun and my shield!<eos> Who's to say it's gonna be any different now?<eos> What happened to you, Danny, wasn't fair.
You want a drink before we sit down?<eos> What are you having?<eos> Bloody Mary without the vodka.<eos> Isn't it just easier to say Virgin Mary?<eos> Not if you had Jesuit teachers in high school.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I've always kind of felt that ordering a drink named after Jesus' mom in a bar was a sin.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Makes sense if you think about it.<eos> Jamie talk to you?
Okay.<eos> So now you know who I am.<eos> It also says you were number two in a gang called Los Pozoleros.<eos> Under one Eduardo "Pozolero" Soto.<eos> Who was charged and acquitted for shooting you in the back when you tried to make a move and start your own operation.<eos> It be's that way sometime.<eos> Hate the game, not the player.<eos> So you're okay, being paralyzed from the waist down while he takes over the drug market at the Bitter End?<eos> My mother used to tell me, "Fausto, life's good, but it ain't always fair."<eos> Well, it certainly hasn't been fair to you, huh?
If two such powerful sources of knowledge are united, they will grant a clarity of vision beyond your kind.<eos> KANAN: What does that mean?<eos> When joined, any secret, wisdom or destiny can be seen through the Force.<eos> One could bring much chaos with such hidden truths.<eos> I have seen it before.<eos> Well, we can't control what Maul will do.<eos> That's his point, Ezra.<eos> Well, we still need it to save our friends, Kanan.<eos> So, are you gonna give it back, or not?<eos> Hmm. The object you seek is a source of imbalance between you and your teacher.
I need you and your men to kill the power from the dam.<eos> Sweetheart, if you need something broken, we're gonna break it.<eos> We are professionals.<eos> So this is the canal.<eos> This is the perimeter.<eos> This is the zombie moat.<eos> This is the front gate.<eos> I want all of the attention right here.<eos> A grisly distraction, perhaps?<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
Hey, we're just doing our part to bring order to the chaos.<eos> Really?<eos> Well if you ever get tired of being a nihilistic, murdering, pungent human, come take the cure.<eos> Know what, I think I'll stick to my murdering nihilistic ways.<eos> But man, I do appreciate the invite.<eos> And where is Hector?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Too soon?<eos> Should've guessed.<eos> Death, just follows you everywhere, doesn't it?
Bowden?<eos> It's Bowden.<eos> Open the gate.<eos> Open the gate!<eos> ‭Are you sure?<eos> I'll cover you.<eos> You get her.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> Okay, we got you.
Murphy!<eos> Come on! Let's rock and roll!<eos> Come on! ‭<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Warren.<eos> You might want to take a look.<eos> Your lost boys are bleeding out.<eos> They knew what they were in for.<eos> Besides, they served their purpose.<eos> I'm here alone with you.
Screech is going to stab someone on Christmas.<eos> Oh, Chris, you look so handsome in your tux.<eos> This must be how Meat Loaf looked when he went to the prom.<eos> Oh, that must be her!<eos> Hi.<eos> You must be Chris.<eos> I'm Taylor.<eos> What's up?<eos> !<eos> It's so nice to finally meet you.
Wow!<eos> It's like your dance tells a whole story.<eos> Right?<eos> You are the only one who's ever gotten that.<eos> Usually people just shove a wallet in my mouth and call 911.<eos> You know, Chris, I'm having a great time.<eos> You're so cool and down-to-earth.<eos> I like you, too, Taylor.<eos> I was scared meeting a celebrity, but you're so nice and normal.<eos> I feel totally comfortable around you.
What if we change "lox" to "boys"<eos> and "bagels" to "problems"?<eos> Oh, that's perfect.<eos> Like when you changed "pickle it good"<eos> to "shake it off."<eos> All right, we got our homework.<eos> Hi, Taylor.<eos> Chris?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
♪ I've met the guy that I've been dreaming of ♪<eos> ♪ Me Taylor... ♪<eos> Wow, they hate it.<eos> This stinks!<eos> We like you when you're miserable!<eos> You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a door-open dook in the bathroom!<eos> Why were they being so mean to you?<eos> Well, I guess they're just used to me being sad and hurt by men.<eos> But I don't care if they like it, Chris.<eos> I'm happy with you.

Game of Thrones is on, just a reminder.<eos> Yeah, we made this mistake before.<eos> We got the other kids vaccinated, but Meg still got chicken pox.<eos> Dad, this is acne.<eos> Girl, you nasty.<eos> You realize the vast majority of people think you're wrong.<eos> Well, maybe that's the problem.<eos> We just got to change their minds.<eos> We're gettin' this town to change its mind about vaccinations. Yeah.<eos> I'm with you.
I'm pretty much done trying to convince you people.<eos> We made a deal.<eos> You going to keep it or not?<eos> A message from a friend back in San Francisco.<eos> Karen Vecchione.<eos> Damn it!<eos> You stay back.<eos> Hey, p-put the gun down.<eos> It's a disguise.<eos> What the hell did they do to you?
- Why are you protecting them?<eos> - Just stop it.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Because I was bad.<eos> They tried to fix me, but they couldn't.<eos> You're not bad, buddy.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Then why did they do it?<eos> Because they were hurting, and they were in pain, and no one helped them.<eos> And I'm not gonna let the same thing happen to you.
You said something about hitting a surveillance cam with light.<eos> I said if you were going at night, you'd do that.<eos> But an op like this is better during the day.<eos> It's less suspicious, fewer people around.<eos> I say we go right now. No.<eos> I can't do it right now. I got to...<eos> I got to talk to my daughter, and I got a deposition after.<eos> I can go without you. No, no.<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming with you this time.
Didn't want to get her in trouble.<eos> You're probably thinking that I've been distracted with Neil and everything.<eos> And, obviously, I have been.<eos> But right now, I wish I thought that would've made a difference.<eos> That would actually make me feel better.<eos> 'Cause this isn't just about me being selfish.<eos> The fact that she could completely hide herself from me like that.<eos> And if I don't know her... what do I know?<eos> Maybe she'll talk to you.<eos> Nic, I'm sorry this is happening to you.
Really?<eos> So you got an actual NCPD source to speak on the record?<eos> Did you talk to the victim's family?<eos> Set up an interview with the D.A.'s office to see if and when charges will be filed?<eos> Where's the medical examiner's report?<eos> Did you research economic and demographic indicators to provide some context for human-alien race relations?<eos> All very good questions, uh...<eos> You didn't give me a story.<eos> You gave me a half-baked idea.<eos> Go bake it fully, then I'll talk to you.
Some sort of biological defense mechanism.<eos> So, yeah, that's new and terrifying.<eos> Any ideas where we can find him?<eos> Ah, as it so happens, exactly one Brevakk registered in National City for the President's Alien Amnesty Act.<eos> I got an address.<eos> Shall I get a strike team to gear up?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Sawyer?<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?
Was I...<eos> Was I doing something?<eos> "Oh, me, was I..."<eos> You think that if you appeal to my vanity and let me make your costume and name you, that I'm just going to let you out of the DEO.<eos> That hadn't even crossed my mind.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Us just sneaking out for a little bit, you know, just two new friends, right, running a...<eos> Running a couple of field tests, living out our dreams, not getting in trouble.<eos> Hmm. Not bad.<eos> Damn you, Mon-El of Daxam.
No!<eos> Tonight, that changes.<eos> Our gladiators will fight for the privilege of being the last Green Martian.<eos> Tonight, they fight to the death.<eos> I don't fight to the death.<eos> Tonight you do.<eos> Why won't you show yourself?<eos> My true form is mine to reveal.<eos> You will not take that from me.<eos> And I will not fight you.
- Any of these look familiar?<eos> - That one.<eos> That's the gun he was carrying.<eos> Okay.<eos> That is an Anndrannian Photon Cannon.<eos> How'd these guys get their hands on alien technology?<eos> Are you sure they weren't Anndrannian?<eos> Well, they weren't purple with fins, so yeah, I'm sure.<eos> Oh, you are lucky this thing hit you before it was fully charged.<eos> There's no telling what this might've done to you.
Wherever you're going with that, just don't.<eos> We are not on Daxam.<eos> Thank Rao.<eos> Look, it...<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's still gonna be great.<eos> Kara.<eos> Lena.<eos> - Surprise visit to Catco?<eos> - No, I'm here to see you, actually.
Bye.<eos> We are going to a party!<eos> Yes!<eos> Okay, because the photon cannon is powered by electromagnetism, it left a radiation signature on Supergirl's suit after the blast, so we might be able to put a tracking algorithm...<eos> Hello?<eos> Earth to Agent Danvers.<eos> - Sorry, I'm listening.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> What's...<eos> What's going on with you?
Okay, so if the Black Body is at equilibrium with the alien weapons, then it will absorb the electromagnetic radiation and shut them down.<eos> This is genius.<eos> I know, but the frequency and the wavelength, they're a match. So...<eos> The induction coil.<eos> Lights out, Supergirl.<eos> Punch it.<eos> Oh, we weren't under there, so...<eos> We stopped it!<eos> I want to talk to the DA.<eos> I'm sure he's looking forward to talking to you too.
My dad isn't exactly known for his open-mindedness, but he was pretty good.<eos> And, so was my mom.<eos> Maybe it's just a phase.<eos> You know, maybe it isn't real.<eos> No, it's real.<eos> You're real.<eos> And you deserve to have a real, full, happy life.<eos> Okay?<eos> Tell your family.<eos> This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to you, and you shouldn't have to do it alone.
Ha, ha.<eos> This is serious.<eos> You have to learn how to defend yourself.<eos> How often are you planning on attacking me?<eos> I'm training you.<eos> So that, one day, if you are so inclined, you can make a difference.<eos> - And what if that's not me?<eos> - Sure it is.<eos> Kara, hey...<eos> Can I talk to you?
The second he touched me, he got more powerful.<eos> The more he absorbs, the more dangerous he is.<eos> Kara, you all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Agent Schott, start looking into the other victims Dr. Jones' might be targeting.<eos> Supergirl, go home and rest.<eos> You'll need your strength for the next fight.<eos> - I want to help.<eos> - James, we got this.<eos> I should come with you.
Fighting rampaging creatures isn't on my resume.<eos> Oh, that's right. Kara told me.<eos> Uh, beating people up for money is though, right?<eos> Hey, here's an idea.<eos> Why don't you go believe in ‭somebody else, Alex?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't believe in you, Mon-El.<eos> I suspect you're a coward, and that you would run at the first sign of danger.<eos> My sister, she's the one who believes in you.<eos> That's why she's so upset with you all the time.
You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But something's wrong.<eos> Well, we're at really different places.<eos> And everything is changing for you.<eos> And everything is going to feel really heightened and shiny.<eos> And, um, you should experience that for yourself.<eos> Not just to be with me.<eos> And I shouldn't get involved with someone who's just fresh off the boat.<eos> Those relationships never really work out.<eos> I'm here for you, but as a friend.
Okay, I was wrong.<eos> And I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> I should have just kept my mouth shut.<eos> What happened?<eos> She doesn't like me.<eos> Like that.<eos> Come here.<eos> - ‭lt's so humiliating.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'm proud of you.
You need to believe me.<eos> It was me at the internment camp near the Galle Crater, the one I told you about.<eos> I was that White Martian.<eos> I was the one who couldn't bear to watch another innocent die.<eos> I refused the kill order.<eos> I tried to free as many Green Martians as I could.<eos> I wanted to get them all to safety but the other guards, they came after us.<eos> I barely escaped.<eos> Show yourself!<eos> What did they do to you?
And nowadays, you pretty much choose your own mate.<eos> Has Kara chosen?<eos> No, she has not.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Just studying Earthly customs.<eos> I got it.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you, um...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I really need to talk to you.
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> My blood is turning you into a White Martian.<eos> You're Hank Henshaw.<eos> The real Hank Henshaw.<eos> Hank Henshaw is dead.<eos> I'm Cyborg Superman.<eos> - What did they do to you?
And the more I'm ashamed to be their daughter.<eos> Kara, your parents tried to protect a planet.<eos> They tried to save lives.<eos> I'm sure Lex and Lillian Luthor thought their intentions were good, too.<eos> Is this their legacy?<eos> Death and destruction across the universe?<eos> Your parents' legacy is not death and destruction, Kara Zor-El.<eos> It's you.<eos> J'onn! J'onn!<eos> What's... What is happening to you?
Come in, please.<eos> Ignore the pajamas.<eos> Oh, no, they're cute.<eos> You, uh...<eos> It's late.<eos> You got a case or something?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I could really use a good old-fashioned murder right now.<eos> You know, I didn't come here for work.<eos> I just... I really needed to see you and talk to you.
This was not.<eos> What was it then?<eos> Were you paid for your silence, Ms. Boyle?<eos> What if I told you there were more?<eos> Women?<eos> Ask me anything you want.<eos> You know me.<eos> I'm all about gut instincts.<eos> You know, hunches.<eos> Right up to the point where I find my ass right here with you in Jersey.
Rhymes with bess, kess, guess, bess.<eos> Please don't kill her, please.<eos> Do you want to save the sweet nurse, Casey?<eos> All you have to do is say "yes."<eos> Okay, okay, whatever you want.<eos> All I ever wanted.<eos> Casey. Casey, I'm here.<eos> I'm here, baby, you're okay.<eos> I'm here, I'm right here.<eos> I've got you, honey.
All you have to do is say "yes."<eos> Okay, okay, whatever you want.<eos> All I ever wanted.<eos> Casey. Casey, I'm here.<eos> I'm here, baby, you're okay.<eos> I'm here, I'm right here.<eos> I've got you, honey.<eos> Okay? I'm going to get you out of here.<eos> Okay, I've got you, okay, okay.<eos> I got you.
Oh, good, you're here.<eos> What a day.<eos> Thanks for watching him.<eos> Yeah, thanks for asking.<eos> You know, I could've called Regina and turned him over.<eos> Yes, you could have, but you didn't.<eos> You know what, Sis?<eos> I know exactly what you need.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come with you?
Have you?<eos> God, no.<eos> No.<eos> But I did try once.<eos> Back in my wicked days.<eos> You know those days don't have to be over.<eos> So, what's holding you back now, hmm?<eos> I mean, isn't this what you've always wanted?<eos> A family who gets you, who chooses you?<eos> Regina and the others only tolerate you.
Aladdin didn't trust the people he loved.<eos> That's why he failed.<eos> But I believe in us to find a third way.<eos> It's kind of what we do.<eos> But if we don't and my magic does come with a price, I will pay it.<eos> The Savior is what I am, but I am also part of a family.<eos> - Well, I choose to believe in us, too.<eos> - We all do.<eos> We can protect you, and we can protect this town.<eos> If that's what you want, I'm with you, Swan.
Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom.<eos> Everybody wants a memorial for her.<eos> They want to mourn her.<eos> And I am the freak who is saying no because... because we're going to get her back.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to your mother, okay?<eos> In fact, I'm, uh... I'm seeing her tomorrow.<eos> She still talking to you after all that crazy last night?<eos> Yeah, trust me, it's not her choice.<eos> She's doing two-a-days 'cause of her classes.<eos> I get to babysit you.
Gordo, my mom has been with me every day for the last 20 years.<eos> I don't need to say good-bye.<eos> Wait.<eos> Your face, it needs a drink, and you promised me pizza.<eos> The last time I got tanked here, this was a Polish dive. That's pre-baby.<eos> Of course, everything is pre-baby.<eos> So why did you choose this place?<eos> - It's comforting.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - I do go out without you.
(cork pops) CABLE: Enemy alert.<eos> Say the word, I hit the burn button. We lose it all.<eos> It's all right, Cable.<eos> She called ahead.<eos> We picked up Rob for questioning.<eos> He crumbled pretty quickly.<eos> Turns out Mike was about to blow the whistle on the team using steroids, so the coach had motive to kill Mike and Ellen.<eos> You were right.<eos> Mm. You came all the way here to tell us this?<eos> Actually, I came to talk to you.
My tires got slashed.<eos> When?<eos> W-When did that happen?<eos> Last night in front of my house.<eos> In front of my home, Eldon!<eos> Where I live!<eos> I can't go to the cops with anything, right?<eos> Because we... we both know what this is, right?<eos> I have been your friend for 20 years, and you didn't give a shit? ! You put me right in his path, and now he's after me?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Well, you know where we are if you want it back.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Jaclyn. I don't know why I remember it.<eos> But I do.<eos> Which part?<eos> She's nice.<eos> That lady you were talking to?<eos> What's her deal? Patient.<eos> Former patient.<eos> A patient can live where you live?
Not just about being hard to follow, it's about being dangerous to follow.<eos> - Make sense?<eos> - Sure.<eos> So we leave the car at Lake Merritt so we can lose people over ground and get back to it if we need to.<eos> "We" don't do any of that.<eos> You'll be in the car.<eos> I'm going to be sitting in the park?<eos> Why, because you're a ninja now?<eos> Well, no, but...<eos> Look, if shit pops off, I can't be worrying about you.
There's a lot of sides to that square.<eos> So...<eos> I've been thinking about your airport outfit.<eos> You're not gonna like this, but I think it may be time for you got a third shirt.<eos> You're not gonna like this. I think it's time for you to get a second friend.<eos> You haven't seen Randy in six months.<eos> I mean, you've seen parts of him on your phone, but you haven't seen the whole.<eos> Oh, I've seen the hole.<eos> He fell getting out of the shower.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Just how much do these little things measure?<eos> Well, they didn't say anything about late-night wrist movements, so I think you're in the clear.<eos> I like stress.<eos> I feed off it.<eos> Researchers at UC San Diego invited elite Marines, Olympians, and me to undergo stress tests in 2011, and I beat all of them.<eos> Malcolm Gladwell used me for his latest book.<eos> Okay, now you are stressing me out.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> This feels like Big Brother to me.<eos> If you're feeling paranoid, Alex, you should be, because I am after you.
I'll find him.<eos> I promise.<eos> The terrorists...<eos> They haven't killed us.<eos> They threaten to, but don't.<eos> I know.<eos> What about the people left in Federal Hall?<eos> - Are they still alive?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But the terrorists don't seem to be interested in anyone else but you and the 100 people with you.
You're one of them?<eos> Consider me a representative.<eos> You knew what you were supposed to do, and you didn't do it.<eos> And so now I'm going to have to turn you over to them, which we both know is going to be far worse.<eos> If you do, it's suicide.<eos> Not for me.<eos> He agreed.<eos> Babysit him.<eos> I'm phoning it in.<eos> Since I might be dead in a couple hours, I'd like to take this moment to apologize to you.
That little envelope you got from the estate of Liam O'Connor?<eos> Every piece of mail that comes into The Farm is subject to...<eos> Do I really need to finish?<eos> It's just a key to a P.O. box.<eos> - Where?<eos> - A couple miles away.<eos> The world's most infamous terrorist.<eos> Wonder what he left you.<eos> As if all the drama weren't enough.<eos> If you need someone to go with you...
I'm not getting anywhere with Owen.<eos> You have to take over.<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> It was your idea.<eos> You can't leave.<eos> We're supposed to be working this together.<eos> I did what you asked.<eos> I prodded everyone.<eos> - I'm done here.<eos> - What is going on with you today?
So, it's true.<eos> You really are harboring the Evil Queen out here.<eos> She's my sister, and she cares about me.<eos> I'm willing to bet you're not here to see how I'm getting on.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have a message.<eos> Your little masquerade as the Cricket therapist didn't work because airing Emma's dirty laundry only made us stronger.<eos> Well, then why are you out here delivering this message all by your lonesome?<eos> Hmm?<eos> We're right behind you.
Why?<eos> What's he ever done for you?<eos> When I was a child, my family was taken from me.<eos> I grew up next to the docks, fending for myself, desperate to make the people who took them pay.<eos> It was only a matter of time before I got myself killed.<eos> And then what?<eos> Nemo kidnapped you?<eos> That man saved my life.<eos> Let me ask you one question.<eos> Your quest for vengeance... did you ever find those who wronged you?
Hey, girls.<eos> Raise your hand if you're super depressed today.<eos> Don't engage.<eos> Just ignore him like he ignores the word "no."<eos> Did someone just say, "Yes"?<eos> Randy, I have to call you back.<eos> There's a sexual predator that needs my attention.<eos> Hey, Oleg.<eos> What's up, R-Dog?<eos> Can I talk to you man-to-man about a pretty serious...
No, no.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> I'll just...<eos> Ha.<eos> Laurel Healy.<eos> Miss Healy, this is Senator Red Wheatus.<eos> Do you recognize my voice?<eos> I do.<eos> Would you like to speak to my brother, Senator?<eos> Mm, no, no, I want to speak to you.
Yeah, probably.<eos> You want to go out?<eos> What?<eos> Would you like to go somewhere amusing?<eos> You live in a basement apartment, Gustav.<eos> So it's about money?<eos> No, I... we are just very different.<eos> And I have a boyfriend.<eos> I haven't seen him.<eos> I don't share everything with you.
I want him back.<eos> Julia, I got to run.<eos> Thanks again for putting Abby on.<eos> When Oscar Keaton is ready, I want his first interview.<eos> How could I say no to you?<eos> Jake.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> You know... never better.<eos> Julia. We need to pick up line 3.<eos> It's a guy who used to date Abby and he wants to talk to you.
But I did spend a glorious month submitting to the healing hands of an utterly divine lighthouse keeper on Bramble Cay... a low-lying island that's rapidly being submerged by rise in the sea levels due to climate change.<eos> Climate change?<eos> Our next blacklister is devoted to protecting the Earth from the greatest threat to its existence as we know it... us.<eos> He's a stealth eco-terrorist known only as Gaia...<eos> Earth Mother in Greek mythology.<eos> Okay, so, the connection between this Earth Mother and Agnes is what?<eos> What is not relevant.<eos> Only where.<eos> We must find this man... unless you have a better lead on Kirk.<eos> Has he reached out to you?
I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> You did your job.<eos> And then I did mine.<eos> Hello, Maya.<eos> You're a difficult woman to find.<eos> Who are you?<eos> And you must be Skyler.<eos> My name is Raymond.<eos> I've been looking forward to meeting you, Skyler.
Sienna, your daughter.<eos> You send her to Quantico, speak at her graduation, get her a job as a profiler, and she ends up dead at the hands of a serial killer.<eos> No! No!<eos> You think you're safe behind there!<eos> You think you're safe!<eos> You are not safe from me!<eos> I am gonna get you!<eos> You are not safe behind there!<eos> You're not safe from me!<eos> I am gonna come for you!
Give them the kiss.<eos> Give them a little... mwah... lips.<eos> Give it to them, man.<eos> Yeah!<eos> All right.<eos> Now we can just watch the game, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> 10:00!<eos> 2:00!<eos> - I love killing people with you.
She could be a witness.<eos> I haven't assigned you guys the case yet.<eos> We got the shooter.<eos> Well, I mean, we barbecued the shooter, but we were the first responders.<eos> And you're forgetting the most important part.<eos> We stopped the noise complaint.<eos> Find the girl.<eos> Hey, Doc, how's it going with Riggs?<eos> Are you making any progress?<eos> I can't discuss a patient with you, Murtaugh.
My only request... you wait another seven months.<eos> What do you know about me?<eos> I know you're taking care of yourself because you already love that child.<eos> Most important thing in the world to you is protecting that baby.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You can't protect us.<eos> Look, I know we just met, but it's probably the only thing I can do.<eos> Riggs!<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
You want to come have dinner with us?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Not a "No, thank you."<eos> Just flat-out rejection.<eos> Come on, Rog.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> - All right?<eos> I'm not a charity case.<eos> - You know, personally, I'd like to spend as little time with you as possible.
Where you coming from?<eos> Psyche evaluation.<eos> And?<eos> Are you crazy, Riggs?<eos> Seems to be the consensus.<eos> Not to me.<eos> - Have a good night, Trish.<eos> - You, too.<eos> Martin.<eos> No matter what I say to Roger, he's gonna follow you down any rabbit hole you go.
No, that breakfast of yours is disturbing.<eos> This is just not right, man.<eos> - You don't want in on this?<eos> - No.<eos> You know, I saw some decaps in Texas.<eos> All cartel-related.<eos> And they always outsourced their wet work to local gangs.<eos> You may be onto something.<eos> You know, I-I can't do this.<eos> I can't... I can't talk to you while you're eating like that.
Plan? That's funny.<eos> In the middle of his charmingly psychopathic rant about how he was going to order a hit on Cruz and yours truly, he mentioned there's still $17 million on the street.<eos> Looks like that truck is still out there.<eos> Saddle up,<eos> - big guy. We got work to do.<eos> - First, Riggs, go see the city attorney.<eos> He left you six messages.<eos> - Why does he want to talk to Riggs?<eos> - Wild guess, the astronomical rise in lawsuits filed against our fair city since Riggs joined the force.<eos> If you're gonna get reamed out, least I can do is come with you.
It's about us.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's about us.<eos> Okay. So, now...<eos> You don't get a chance to say the things that I want to say, so I-I - jotted some stuff down. - Oh!<eos> It's a rough draft, and I'm... still working<eos> Okay!<eos> but... . Okay. Here it is.<eos> - Trish. - Mm.<eos> Going through life with you has been the greatest journey...
You're not gonna throw your careers away for me.<eos> Well, to be honest, Ned, I don't have much of a career anyway.<eos> Look...<eos> I wouldn't have made it a day on the streets without you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> You don't owe me.<eos> It's the job.<eos> Do your job.<eos> We're gonna take that money in.<eos> We're coming back for you tomorrow.
Because you have nothing to love in this world, but yourself.<eos> Nice.<eos> And you wonder why your kids won't talk to you.<eos> Don't ever get involved with my family again.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Crystal.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Get back to work.<eos> What's wrong with you, boy?
What?<eos> I never said that I was easy.<eos> He's crazier than a sack of cats.<eos> Did you say I was crazier than a sack of cats?<eos> Funky, feral and confused... that's you.<eos> I think what Roger is trying to say is that your behavior since you two started working together has been erratic - and impulsive.<eos> - Yes.<eos> How about this? He punched me in the face and cracked two teeth.<eos> How's that for erratic and impulsive?<eos> And what Martin is trying to say is that he was genuinely... hurt... by you.
You see that guy up there in the dark glasses?<eos> That's Sam Giancana. He's the biggest mobster in the country.<eos> He worked with both the CIA and JFK to try and assassinate Fidel Castro.<eos> Let's just find Flynn.<eos> Anthony. I can't believe I found you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go. We can get you home.<eos> Rufus. You can't be here.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Not without you.
A lot has changed recently at work, and I need to get my head straight, and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that while I'm living here.<eos> Is this about the wedding? We can elope, for God's sake.<eos> - It's not that.<eos> I'm gonna go stay with my mom for a few days or weeks.<eos> I'm not really sure how long.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Lucy, I love you.<eos> I want to spend the rest of my life with you, so if you need to spend some time, figure things out first...
Read it to me.<eos> Hey, Janet, you got time for a sketch?<eos> You have the witness here?<eos> More or less.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's almost identical.<eos> You think this will work?<eos> Hey, Eva.<eos> Are you looking for my dad?<eos> He should be here soon. No, actually I was kinda hoping I could talk to you for a second, is that okay?
I love you so much.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> Are you?<eos> A little.<eos> I want it to be good for you.<eos> It's gonna be perfect because it's you.
_<eos> _<eos> You know what?<eos> I just... I don't think it's happening.<eos> I'm too much in my head now.<eos> Boo!<eos> And speaking of a buzz kill...<eos> Don't boo me, Rogelio.<eos> But you're going to love The CW.<eos> I don't even know what channel that is, and I own 50% of the show, and I don't want to do business with you again.
I've changed.<eos> I'm done with crime.<eos> You have to trust that.<eos> And if you can't...<eos> If you're going to jump whenever I enter a room, then I'll drop you off at Port Kembla, you can fly home and never hear from me again.<eos> So?<eos> What's it going to be?<eos> So, what's the word?<eos> What?<eos> Everything good with you and Jane?
I know I'm not ruined.<eos> But you feel like you lost something, and you didn't.<eos> You just gained something.<eos> A whole new dimension of your life, your relationship.<eos> What if we're not compatible?<eos> It hasn't been great?<eos> We're not really talking about it with other people.<eos> Ah.<eos> Got it.<eos> Okay, so you know, this has nothing to do with you.
No!<eos> _<eos> I'm out.<eos> Santos is a no-go.<eos> What happened?<eos> I know you spent your Estefavor on Xiomara, not on our Santos remake!<eos> And I am done being dumped for Xo.<eos> I thought you said it wasn't about that.<eos> Look...<eos> I didn't want to date you.
I'm it.<eos> You're what?<eos> I'm the new principal of Weld District High School.<eos> I got the job.<eos> No! (CHEERING)<eos> I got the job, Woody!<eos> You beauty!<eos> MAN: Go. Woody!<eos> Woody!<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Another two, thanks.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Big Mac and Rai?<eos> Am I missing something again?<eos> Big Mac and Rai have a bet on the cricket every year.<eos> Loser pays for the hotel.<eos> Yep. Even Big Mac deserves a bit of harmless fun every now and then.<eos> Nice work today.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I was really proud of you.
Previously on Z Nation.<eos> They're my friends.<eos> What kind of game you wanna play You wanna play patty cakes?<eos> Hide and seek.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Lucy!<eos> We'll find you!<eos> Don't be afraid darling!<eos> What the hell happened to you?
What are you gonna do with that?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Stop!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Stop, you're going to break her!<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You should have walked away!<eos> Don't kill her!<eos> Please, I'll go with you.
Yeah, man.<eos> That's the whole point!<eos> Right on.<eos> 1.21 gigawatts.<eos> Man, I sure miss the 80's.<eos> Did you find it yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I need chocolate.<eos> Why can't you find it?<eos> What's wrong with you?
You!<eos> Lucy!<eos> She could've inherited his immunity.<eos> We got to get to Lucy before Murphy does.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
You were five years old this morning!<eos> Give him the booster shot of the original vaccine.<eos> He's been pumped full of so many different vaccines.<eos> I'll do it myself!<eos> I need you to help me save my daughter.<eos> Whatever it is in your blood that makes you go and never stop, I need that now.<eos> Help me, Warren.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Addy!<eos> No one's coming for you, Lucy.
But if I want to have any kind of future with Charlotte,<eos> I need to prove to her that I'm mature.<eos> So I'm going to spend Halloween with the most mature guy I know.<eos> Well, thank you, Oscar.<eos> And when I say mature, I mean boring.<eos> Oh, you might be surprised.<eos> This tour is going to be "spook-tacular."<eos> "Abso-boo-tly" frightening.<eos> For all the... ghouls.<eos> It's exhausting being you, isn't it?
Teddy, what's with the suitcase?<eos> Oh, it's Andre's.<eos> His second costume is in there.<eos> I hit all the apartments in this costume, then I change for round two.<eos> Very clever.<eos> It's not my first Halloween.<eos> If he was this focused on sports or education, he'd be unstoppable.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> Well, I'm off. See ya, Dad.<eos> You sure you don't want me to go with you?
So, I guess it's official.<eos> He's not coming back. He's not, right?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Anyway, I'm grateful to be sober.<eos> And, sorry Soledad wrote that really mean comment about the baby's melon head.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, who else would like to share?<eos> Mom?<eos> Yes, Christy?<eos> I thought maybe you'd like to share what's going on with you.
I know I don't have to.<eos> I just want show my smoking hot girlfriend that I don't need mind-altering chemicals to bang her sweet ass into next Wednesday.<eos> Oh, swoon.<eos> Damn right, swoon.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It usually works.<eos> Well, it's certainly not working now.<eos> All right, that tone is not helping.<eos> Yeah, well, I tried being nice to it.<eos> I hope you know that this has nothing to do with you.
- and I don't say stupid things.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> Wait, we're on the same side.<eos> Oh, so now there are sides?<eos> Everyone against me?<eos> We're not against you, it's just that you're trying to raise your kid like he's the boy in the plastic bubble.<eos> Good movie.<eos> John Travolta.<eos> People didn't really respect his acting chops coming off of Kotter, but he showed some serious range in that.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Not long.<eos> Two years.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> 'Cause I'm going to an Al-Anon meeting.<eos> You want to come?<eos> - No, I would not.<eos> - Fine.<eos> You're not gonna try to talk me into it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm leaving that up to you.
We can't just waltz in there and buy whatever we want.<eos> They'll do a federal background check on Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert, and that will set off alarms in the marshal's office.<eos> No, we'll have to bribe the gun store owner so he doesn't run our names.<eos> But we don't have any money.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm the bribe, aren't I?<eos> You're not the bribe.<eos> Why, what's wrong with my body?<eos> Actually I borrowed $3,000 from my walking group friend Ruth.<eos> Ruth, I'm going to be straight with you.
You are different than what I remember.<eos> You seem to have found a purpose here.<eos> Meaning.<eos> You are free.<eos> Why, yes, I am.<eos> Nori and I are very happy, and I'm glad you're warming to that.<eos> Was I that disapproving?<eos> Look, that-- that night,<eos> Nori didn't actually think you'd go through with it.<eos> But I ran after you, and I lost you in the fog by the bridge.
And then the Resistance came back, and they drugged me again, and they locked me in the trunk of a car, and you know the rest.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I'd like you to go about your day, Miss Mills.<eos> No one need know about this visit. It'll stay between us.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> He knows everything.<eos> He's probably watching us right now.<eos> Well, if he knew everything, he wouldn't need to talk to you.
She can take care of herself.<eos> She's stronger than both of us, Ed.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Josef, what are you still doing here?<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> Josef, you must understand that-- That I could get myself killed by staying here.<eos> I know.<eos> The girl I lost died for me because, for some crazy reason, she believed that my life mattered.<eos> And I think, being here with you, maybe it can.
I need to wash my hands.<eos> Where's the restroom?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You're gonna want to go down that hallway, push through the big double doors.<eos> You're gonna see some air vents on the way there.<eos> It's just past that cold-air system.<eos> Bring a sweater.<eos> It tends to get a little chilly in that neck of the woods.<eos> - Wow. - Wow.<eos> Nice shooting the breeze with you, Phil.
Pumpkin.<eos> What is it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why is the tea in the sink?<eos> I don't know, it fell.<eos> Wind or something.<eos> Pumpkin, where are you going?<eos> Let's go outside.<eos> I want to take a walk.<eos> What's the matter with you?
That son of a bitch.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> How old is that foolish girlfriend of yours?<eos> Well...<eos> How old is she?<eos> When was she born?<eos> Seventy... — Nine, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> They know each other.<eos> Are you alright?
Where will we run to?<eos> Wherever.<eos> Wherever you want. — Where?<eos> Do you really think that I will live among this Soviet-style furniture?<eos> We will buy new furniture.<eos> With your pulmonologist's salary.<eos> Ilze!<eos> — Yes.<eos> But I saw it in your eyes. — In my eyes?<eos> Then you should have also seen that I only slept with you because of foolish nostalgia.
We're leaving.<eos> No!<eos> Bill too crinkly!<eos> Try again!<eos> Bill too crinkly!<eos> You dollar funny!<eos> This must be so difficult for you.<eos> It is.<eos> There's a lot of choices here.<eos> But I ain't talking to you.
So am I. This is corporate.<eos> A little too much so, if you ask me.<eos> I... I try to have fun, right?<eos> I-I mean, we're not, we're not landing planes here.<eos> Our company manufactures aircraft landing gear systems.<eos> Yep, uh-huh.<eos> Well, I am going to fly us over a few more drinks.<eos> Stewie?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I followed you.
Catherine, Lynn.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> I'm sorry to barge in like this, but it couldn't wait. Okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> It's about your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She's in trouble.<eos> Okay, look, I know I have a lot to explain with my leaving the CIA, all of it.<eos> And-and that is a conversation that I want to have with you.
All right, all right!<eos> How many are with you?<eos> I came alone.<eos> Put him in the chair.<eos> I take it you're familiar with this process.<eos> I've never been on the receiving end of it myself, but it always looks quite unpleasant.<eos> No, it's not too bad.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> I'll ask you again.<eos> How many are with you?
Of course it's safe.<eos> - Ask my why I'm late.<eos> - Why are you late?<eos> Because I don't have a car.<eos> Ask my why I don't have a car.<eos> Because I am too scared to get in mine because your Rittenhouse guys hacked me while I was going 50 miles an hour!<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Do I look all right?<eos> Right, well, I'm sorry.<eos> They, um, shouldn't be contacting you directly.
It's not our job to protect them.<eos> So, everyone you've killed has been an enemy to the cause.<eos> If a few innocents have to die to save this country from tyranny, I'd say that's a price worth paying.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Lead the way.<eos> He'll want to see your face first.<eos> Jeffrey!<eos> He has a panic room?<eos> He was a paranoid guy long before we got to him.<eos> Jeffrey, we just want to talk to you.
Then we do the same.<eos> We go into this event undercover.<eos> If the heist crew shows up, we're there to stop them.<eos> I'll recover what I can from the mod, see if I can get a clearer picture of what they're after.<eos> Good.<eos> Reade.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> The guy clocked me in the face.<eos> I was defending myself.<eos> Forget it... is there something else going on with you that I should know about?
There's also some gaps there, big ones... where I don't remember much of anything.<eos> Well, childhood trauma can affect the way the brain stores memories.<eos> Young victims of abuse often cope by disassociating from the event.<eos> Which means that the memories of the abuse are forgotten and often only recalled much later in life.<eos> But I don't recall them.<eos> But you do recall the gaps.<eos> Now, I can't help but think that the fear and frustration of not knowing is precisely what's causing these sudden, uncontrollable bouts of anger.<eos> I... I just want answers.<eos> And hopefully, I can help you get them.<eos> But I need you to know there is always a chance that you will never know for certain what did or didn't happen to you.
Put the case down, step away.<eos> Hands in the air.<eos> Oh, Patrick?<eos> Hang on, Allie.<eos> We have to keep going.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> We're fine.<eos> I know.<eos> The baby's fine, Kurt.<eos> If something happened to you...
As if we needed reminding.<eos> David, how much did you see?<eos> There was something I couldn't quite...<eos> This is really sweet, but can we please go and defeat someone?<eos> We don't have long.<eos> So true.<eos> Time flies.<eos> You've won nothing.<eos> That sapling is made of pure love.<eos> It won't work for you.
I need to get beautiful.<eos> Hola, Jackie. ¿Cómo estás?<eos> Me voy, Lina.<eos> Venga, pues, pásele.<eos> Cuídate, Jackie.<eos> It's all here.<eos> How much he makes, how he cleans it, where it goes.<eos> Your cop friend will understand it, even if you don't.<eos> She said you weren't coming back.<eos> She just wanted to be the one with you.
He's probably saved more lives than any doctor you know.<eos> That's why he had you on animal tranquilizers when we first met, hmm?<eos> I busted my ankle.<eos> It hurt like a bastard.<eos> The label even read,<eos> "Not for human consumption."<eos> Listen, if I go under before we get there, you just keep driving, okay?<eos> It's an hour away.<eos> You've made yourself into a fort, son, impenetrable, lethal, and I understand that.<eos> But the one person left who can bring you down is right there, inside those walls with you.
Hello?<eos> You bring his wife back to him, or he gives your daughter to me.<eos> Is he here?<eos> D left the hospital.<eos> He's safe.<eos> There was someplace he needed to be.<eos> What place?<eos> Blackstone has my daughter.<eos> He took her.<eos> Were you followed?
Do you understand how that feels?<eos> Feel better yelling at her?<eos> No, 'cause she couldn't care less.<eos> Come on, you're a parent, Randall.<eos> You know that these things aren't that simple.<eos> Maybe you're looking at this<eos> - all the wrong way.<eos> - What other way could there possibly be?<eos> Relax your eyes and look through it.<eos> It's there right in front of you.
Why is a Malaysian banker interested in rare earth metals?<eos> Money.<eos> And power.<eos> Even if the deposits are played out.<eos> Who have you been talking to?<eos> I've seen the geo-report.<eos> It says the Belgian's holdings are worthless.<eos> Ah...<eos> White Sand.<eos> H. Robert must be desperate and angry if he told you.
Who is he?<eos> Tell me something. How did you get your mother to join us in the woods?<eos> That was you. Not us.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about?<eos> Lies are pointless and a waste of time.<eos> You look like whale vomit.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Song's looking for his girl.<eos> She hasn't come back?<eos> I thought she was out with you.
- Why are you barking at me?<eos> We're being maneuvered like puppets.<eos> Well, that's the job. That's the world.<eos> A week ago, White Sand was bidding nine figures.<eos> Today, H. Robert gave me that report.<eos> The deal's a sham.<eos> We don't even know what we're selling.<eos> - Rare-earth metals.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I don't know what's going on with you or when you last slept, but you don't get to barge in here, rave like a lunatic, and piss all over the carpet, so knock it off.
- Rare-earth metals.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I don't know what's going on with you or when you last slept, but you don't get to barge in here, rave like a lunatic, and piss all over the carpet, so knock it off.<eos> Mr. Song's on the box breathing fire.<eos> He can't get Isla on the phone and he's threatening to pull his bid.<eos> Go check her hotel. Find her. Before we all drown.<eos> _<eos> I thought you could find me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Spying on you, dear.
Well, I can't take it back; it happened.<eos> The trial's over?<eos> Quinn's lost?<eos> No, but...<eos> Then it's libel.<eos> They're innocent until proven guilty.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why you taking a stand on this, Pop?<eos> It's not a stand.<eos> Okay, what do you call it?
Lock the door.<eos> Use the dead bolt.<eos> It's Nicky.<eos> She's in my apartment.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Come on, Doc.<eos> What are you gonna do, walk?<eos> We need to get Carl and his keys.<eos> "We"?<eos> I'm with you, Big Dog.
I got money.<eos> - I'm good. - I'm not being condescending.<eos> You need to go straight to Tahoe. Don't stop.<eos> You need food or gas, use cash, no credit cards.<eos> You need to make a call, use a pay phone.<eos> Okay. Got it.<eos> Thanks, Neil.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Is Jaclyn with you?
You've already packed four trunks.<eos> Mr. Frink will help us with the load, won't you, Mr. Frink?<eos> Frank.<eos> You didn't tell them, did you?<eos> They would have killed you.<eos> But by not telling them, I'm risking their lives.<eos> Damn it, Frank, how many times do I have to tell you?<eos> I didn't say anything about them to the kempeitai.<eos> Yeah, I believe you.<eos> How did you know the kempeitai didn't follow you?
She'll be Onoda's niece.<eos> That sounds pretty flimsy.<eos> "Niece" is Pon code for mistress.<eos> The guy at the gate won't make a fuss.<eos> The general's calling for a girl on the brink of war?<eos> It's not a perfect plan, Frank.<eos> - It's our best shot. - No. No.<eos> We never talked about her coming.<eos> It's not your decision.<eos> I've already been an asshole to you.
The guy attacked you.<eos> - He should be put away.<eos> - Well, it's not that simple.<eos> I mean, at least not to me, I...<eos> Look, Kelly, I appreciate your concern<eos> - but it's not your problem.<eos> - It's not my problem?<eos> - It's not your problem.<eos> - It's not my problem?<eos> I... I'm the one that had to get between you and his knife.
No doubt about it.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Jo Jo, this guy always gets in.<eos> - No problem, right this way. - Thanks.<eos> Ladies, you wanna meet a real life action hero?<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, you are not gonna believe this, but Connie's sister was amazing.<eos> - Really? - Yeah, I know.<eos> I had the same reaction, but she was so sweet with Louie and she got got him giggling, and we all know that kid is a tough laugh.<eos> I wanted her to stay so she could meet you, - but it got too late.
Right?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> - I'll be back in a sec.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Yikes...not exactly the A-team at this hour.<eos> - "A-Team," are you guys talking "A-Team"?<eos> I love that show-- I could download it.<eos> We should binge it.<eos> This is gonna be fun.<eos> - Yep, totally excited to watch five full seasons of television with you, but could you actually run the DNA for us first?
(electric tools whirring)<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Special Agents Bishop and Quinn, NCIS.<eos> Looking for a Mr. Carbone.<eos> Nestor Carbone?<eos> Hey, NCIS!<eos> Stop!<eos> (woman screams)<eos> (man yelling) Hold your fire!<eos> What's wrong with you!
You think I like helping these bastards?<eos> You think I sleep at night?<eos> One day, you'll understand. - I'm a patriot.<eos> - You keep telling yourself that.<eos> And, by the way, you're not getting Von Braun.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> Well, for one, the man behind your back.<eos> You found your way to the British spy.<eos> - Love your movies.<eos> - Movies? You didn't think everywhere you went we wouldn't come after you?
We have two targets-- Elizabeth Keen and Agnes Keen-- traveling separate paths to an unknown location.<eos> Constantin Rostov, also know as Alexander Kirk, fled with Elizabeth in a private seaplane that departed from Playa Larga... mm, less than an hour ago, due west.<eos> - What about Agnes?<eos> - I have a lead on Agnes.<eos> She was abducted by one of<eos> Kirk's private contractors, a high-priced tracker known only as Mato.<eos> He missed the flight off the island.<eos> Then he's trapped in Cuba.<eos> There's no way he'll make it past the PNR after the international incident you just caused there.<eos> Ordinarily I would agree with you, Agent Navabi, but Mato isn't your garden-variety mercenary.
I shot my father.<eos> I remember.<eos> What's the memory of a small child?<eos> You didn't remember me or your mother or this room.<eos> Reddington lied to you, Masha.<eos> He told you your father was dead, but thanks to you-- what you did on the water--<eos> I'm very much alive.<eos> All the stories Reddington's told you about who he is and his connection to you-- he knew you were looking for answers and he took advantage of that to re-enter your life.<eos> But the answers you've been looking for are here.<eos> Reddington, he was in love with your mother and he's obsessed with you.
Liz.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mark Savino's office, please.<eos> Savino.<eos> Mark, hi.<eos> This is Diane up in Gerald Walker's office.<eos> Listen, Gerry just got a surprise visit from Tom and Elizabeth Keen, and, well, they're very interested to know where we are with the whole case.<eos> I'm kind of in the weeds here.<eos> Look, it can't wait.<eos> They're very upset, and she asked to speak with you directly.
Three are dead, five are in prison so...<eos> Our guy's one of the remaining six.<eos> You ever play Call Of Duty?<eos> You should.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I assume you didn't come all the way here with good news.<eos> Well, it depends.<eos> Would you consider two Scotland Yard detectives watching my hotel in London to be good news?<eos> Well, two dead detectives now.<eos> - They were watching you?
The paralytic you've just consumed is proprietary, as well.<eos> It was discovered accidentally during development of an ADD medication.<eos> Paralysis was an unwanted side effect.<eos> Must feel amazing-- Dying, knowing you've invented something that will change the world.<eos> Honest to God, third time this month?<eos> My fifth grader's more punctual than you.<eos> And don't think it'll go unnoticed by HR.<eos> This is gonna be reflected in your performance review.<eos> 1 to 10, please.<eos> Nobody's ever gotten a minus before, but they broke the mold with you.
Why?<eos> Who are they?<eos> A group that corporations pay to suppress inventions that would undercut them if brought to market.<eos> Companies do that all the time-- buy up patents just to shelve them.<eos> Big oil did it to the NiMH battery in the '90s.<eos> Well, when they can't kill the invention, they have the Lindquist Concern kill the inventor.<eos> Like Omar Najjar.<eos> He was working on revolutionary technology with the potential to save millions of lives.<eos> Now that it's in the hands of the Lindquist Concern, it will save none.<eos> I'll call it in, but if you have a line on Kirk, I'm staying with you.
Is that why you're calling me?<eos> For dating advice?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you're his best friend.<eos> And after nearly destroying his place today, I... want to give him a night he'll never forget.<eos> How would you do that?<eos> He admires Kirk, says he's a good man.<eos> He shouldn't.<eos> And he's not.<eos> I'm in the middle.<eos> Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk.
Got her!<eos> The car.<eos> I need an ambulance, 310 North View Drive.<eos> During World War II, the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants smuggled Jewish children out of France to Switzerland.<eos> This was one of their staging areas.<eos> Now it's mine.<eos> Are you planning an extraction or a land war in Asia?<eos> My plan is to make contact with you as soon as Alexander Kirk is in my possession.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm going with you.
If I felt like spending the day looking, it probably is.<eos> Let's just go down to the source.<eos> Where are they holding her?<eos> They're not.<eos> They released her R.O.R.<eos> After the arraignment, she fled to St. Mary of the Woods before Homeland could detain her.<eos> Well, why don't they just go in and take her?<eos> I think it's called "optics."<eos> There's a crowd out front, it looks like the original Rainbow Coalition.<eos> Eddie, when I said I'd take a walk with you, I didn't say a jog.
Abuela, I'm hungry.<eos> Is that the way you ask?<eos> This is Coryna's daughter Nadia.<eos> Nadia, say hello to Ms. Reagan.<eos> Hello.<eos> And Mr....<eos> What's your name?<eos> Anthony's fine.<eos> Uh, Mr. Anthony.<eos> Why don't I go to the kitchen with you?
Not for the rebels, not for the Empire. For Mandalore.<eos> Sorry to interrupt playtime, but Hera wants you in the war room for a briefing.<eos> Both of you.<eos> We've lost communications with the Mandalorian base on Concord Dawn.<eos> Rebel leaders are concerned your Protectors are setting a trap for us.<eos> Impossible. My men are loyal to my word.<eos> Your safe passage through our system is secure.<eos> If you've lost communication, something's happened.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> I should go with you.
Whoa! Too low, too low!<eos> Cut them off.<eos> Nice work back there.<eos> I know it was an accident!<eos> Tell me we're close. Chopper?<eos> It's just up ahead.<eos> Finish the boy.<eos> Wren is mine.<eos> Those kids are under my protection.<eos> Go. I'm right behind you.
What's a Kalikori?<eos> A totem passed down the line of a Twi'lek family.<eos> It honors all who have come before.<eos> Each parent adds to the artwork to include themselves in the legacy.<eos> Hmm. Family history as living art.<eos> Hera would have inherited our family's Kalikori.<eos> And I still will.<eos> That heirloom was important to my mother.<eos> And I'm not ready to give it up yet.<eos> Gobi, Numa and I are coming with you.
It's lit in parts.<eos> I'm not sure about CCTV.<eos> Well, find out.<eos> Right, well, I'll get the uniforms knocking on doors.<eos> The rest of you, get out there, find me the weapon.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for you.<eos> - Oh, pff. - In our new happy home.<eos> And I got school tomorrow.<eos> Your granddad is supposed to be looking after you.
So let's just steer clear of each other.<eos> - What?<eos> - Do I have to be explicit, Jane?<eos> I don't like you.<eos> I never have liked you.<eos> Our babies share a father.<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Fine with me.<eos> I'm done trying with you.
- What?<eos> - And I... I know it seems sudden.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course it's sudden.<eos> You've been driving up all these big changes<eos> - and now you want to sell?<eos> Why?<eos> - Because of Scott, actually.<eos> It's not good for our relationship for me to be<eos> - working so closely with you.
Well, I'm not.<eos> Your loss.<eos> I'm sorry, I just have to ask.<eos> You and Scott, is it... a Milos situation?<eos> To be clear, Anezka did know all about Milos.<eos> You think I'm with Scott because he's blackmailing me?<eos> No, I just meant, um...<eos> I got nothing.<eos> That's exactly what she meant.<eos> This is why I don't want to spend any time with you.
and then you'll repeat it, but with "I".<eos> ""I'm an alcoholic""<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> You're an alcoholic.<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> One more, yes, please.<eos> Actually, I really should be turning in.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, it's only 9:00.<eos> I hardly got to talk to you at the event.
I... I don't...<eos> Where do I go?<eos> My mother's?<eos> What about Liz?<eos> You're always talking about going to visit her.<eos> Liz is in Tahoe.<eos> Why can't I just go to my mother?<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> What happens to you?
Boxes?<eos> It's dark in there.<eos> Give me one second.<eos> I just wouldn't have pegged him for claustrophobia.<eos> Six months of solitary can do that to you.<eos> Solitary?<eos> How would you know that?<eos> León likes to talk.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Maybe not to you.
Oh, unless you've got your sights set on someone else.<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm all yours.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - All right, baby.<eos> Sure.<eos> Seems like everyone else already has a dance partner except us.<eos> Are you sure you want to be saddled with someone who's at the bottom of the Murder Board?<eos> I think I can handle you.
I think I can handle you.<eos> Okay.<eos> No phones, no run throughs, no blueprints, no maps.<eos> You'll be going in blind.<eos> But if you've remembered anything from today, you should see everything.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I should've told you about this sooner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If your white paper can save lives, you won't have to apologize.<eos> I'm proud of you, Shelby.
You know what?<eos> I'm not.<eos> And, yes, on top of it all, I am lost.<eos> We're lost.<eos> You're not my partner, and I don't want your help.<eos> I'm going to figure this out on my own, even if it means I must get over being afraid of heights and... climb a tree like freakin' Tarzan.<eos> Then fine.<eos> So...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Following you.
Stop it, both of you!<eos> Watch it!<eos> Watch it!<eos> Ryan, don't!<eos> Ryan.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is everything okay out there?<eos> No one's dead... yet.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't talk about work with you.
Where is this coming from?<eos> Suddenly, you're doubting my judgment?<eos> Most of the big decisions that I've made, you've been standing right next to me.<eos> So Harry's my pick.<eos> And he's Ryan's.<eos> You should support us.<eos> Ryan says it's León.<eos> I agree.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Who else is with you?
Thanks, Liz.<eos> Buenos dias.<eos> Juicer working again?<eos> We got it fixed just for you.<eos> I think you forgot this.<eos> Anyone up this early must need their fix, right?<eos> That'll be $5.25.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ¡Hasta mañana!<eos> He talked to you?
Juicer working again?<eos> We got it fixed just for you.<eos> I think you forgot this.<eos> Anyone up this early must need their fix, right?<eos> That'll be $5.25.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ¡Hasta mañana!<eos> He talked to you?<eos> I don't think he recognized me.<eos> And you don't think he maybe followed you?
Where's Grandma?<eos> Can I say hi?<eos> She's... she's not here right now.<eos> She says hi, though.<eos> Thank you for your help today.<eos> The work you did was very impressive.<eos> You've clearly staged photos before, but I already knew that.<eos> As promised, no one else will know now.<eos> Yeah, thanks, Owen.<eos> Pleasure working with you.
I'm calling to remind you to vote for a better America and a vote for a better America is a vote for Hubbedy Bubbedy.<eos> Hillary Clinton.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Hibiddy Bibbidy.<eos> It's Hillary.<eos> - Yes, I know. - Hillary Clinton!<eos> And I keep saying that.<eos> Okay? Hubbedy Barry.<eos> Maria Conchita Alonso.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- These signatures!<eos> - Oh, my God. - That's what I'm talking about!<eos> - Oh, my God. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> - Those! Plus all these.<eos> Schmidt, we beat you!<eos> Bye! Yeah. Yeah, we beat him!<eos> And you know what else?<eos> I'm coming with you to college 'cause sorority girls love me.
No, you don't.<eos> You are the son of Ragnar Lothbrok, just like us.<eos> I have a feeling if you don't come with me... I will never see you again.<eos> I wouldn't be too sure about that, Ragnar.<eos> And, after all, whatever the fates have in store for us, we're sure to meet again in Valhalla.<eos> Imagine the joy we'll have.<eos> And all the old friends, we shall meet again, and fight with again in true fellowship.<eos> Torstein,<eos> Arne, and all the others.<eos> And you and I, we shall sit among the gods and sup with them, and get drunk with them, and tell our stories.
You're just a slave.<eos> Nobody will blame me for killing a slave.<eos> That is right.<eos> That is right.<eos> Nobody...<eos> Only the gods.<eos> The gods?<eos> What does it matter to them?<eos> They know the truth.<eos> And they will laugh at you for being such a coward.
I might be away a few days.<eos> Please help my dad and fill in as sheriff, okay?<eos> Keep everybody safe.<eos> See you soon.<eos> So, you really did it?<eos> You got rid of that monster?<eos> Oh, well, I'm not sure she was a monster.<eos> Oh, yes, she was, Regina.<eos> I know she was once a part of you, but she was the worst part, and I am so happy that you ripped her out and threw her away.<eos> I am so proud of you.
I'm not hiding.<eos> You may not see it, but I'm strong, because my moms taught me that family makes you stronger than you'll ever be by yourself.<eos> And that's something you'll never have, because you'll always be alone.<eos> I wanted to give you a choice.<eos> But it appears you weren't ready yet.<eos> I suggest... unless you like the feeling of hook piercing flesh, you shove off, Your Majesty.<eos> I'm your mother, Henry.<eos> And I only want what's best for you.<eos> Ah, the break-in was nothing.<eos> I'm proud of you, Aladdin.
I am, actually.<eos> I think you are too.<eos> So why aren't we hanging out?<eos> 'Cause it's a little more complicated than that.<eos> I've got an ex-wife who's certifiable, a mess of a custody situation, I-I spend my days getting shot at.<eos> And I barely have enough energy to microwave a pizza when I get home.<eos> I like microwave pizza.<eos> We're in different places right now.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm just looking out for you.
- Hold it up. - Yeah.<eos> All right, okay, she's okay.<eos> We're taking her to a hospital; I'm calling 911.<eos> We're a couple blocks from Chicago Med.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> It's quicker than waiting for the ambulance.<eos> - Great, let's go.<eos> - Just me.<eos> You stay here.<eos> - No, I'm coming with you.
I need to talk to you.<eos> Can I... Can I talk to you for a second now?<eos> Sure.<eos> Where we going?<eos> Bed-and-breakfast.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Keeping it weird.<eos> Super.<eos> Don't move! Ah!<eos> What happened to you? I-I thought...
I mean, maybe we've grown apart.<eos> Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.<eos> I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.<eos> - I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.<eos> And... guess what?<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm done.<eos> I've sewn myself up.<eos> - You did great, buddy.<eos> I'm proud of you.
You got to pee, I got it!<eos> - No, brake lights! - Oh, crap.<eos> - Everyone hang on!<eos> There's no side-impact airbags!<eos> - Did you get breakfast?<eos> - I tried, but I got recognized.<eos> - Do I know you from somewhere?<eos> - Do you watch a lot of pornography?<eos> 'Cause I'm in most of it. - Oh, boy.<eos> What if you were followed?
I joined a singles group.<eos> You're meeting new people.<eos> - I think that's great.<eos> - Oh, my. It's actually... a group of all singles dedicated - to keeping each other single.<eos> - Wow. I think they could probably come on the trip. Emotionally, they may not be available, but socially, they're available as hell.<eos> Just talk to her really quickly.<eos> They're probably not... - They're in!<eos> - Oh! All of them! Honestly, they would have gone to the DMV with you, if you had asked.<eos> How long have you been standing there?<eos> What happened to you?
- I know what you mean.<eos> - No, actually, you are right, cos I think it's the moment where you go into a big department store, and you go into the kitchenware section, and you see a tea cosy, but you don't put it on your head.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Not putting things on your head is a sign it's time.<eos> And the time you don't want to put gloves on your ears and pretend to be a reindeer.<eos> -I think that's just you, Hammond.<eos> -It's just me, isn't it?<eos> Here's the moment I think you know.<eos> You're driving up a motorway.<eos> There's a train track next to you.
- Would you wear a Stetson?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> "It's cold out, I'll wear a Stetson."<eos> No!<eos> You wear a bobble hat.<eos> That's a bobble hat. Oh!<eos> No, hang on.<eos> - I've just realised.<eos> - What?<eos> Erm... I-I don't want to talk to you any more.
Various of our slogans have been used.<eos> I'm going to put mine on this er... disappointingly small carrot.<eos> Erm...<eos> And it bears one of my expressions.<eos> - See, I can't...<eos> - Don't bite it!<eos> Well, I can't open the thing, can I?<eos> No, there's one of those little tear things.<eos> - Hold on, love.<eos> - I'll be with you in a minute.
- No, you're right.<eos> - I couldn't possibly...<eos> Really, I don't understand that.<eos> Freezing cold, sandpapered on the face...<eos> - You've got a coat on.<eos> - It's thin.<eos> Have you felt it?<eos> I haven't even got a thin coat.<eos> I've only got a T-shirt.<eos> Anyway, I'm not going to be competitive with you about who's the coldest.
I got 'em. I got 'em!<eos> I didn't get them.<eos> His engines are hit. Power's fried from that coupling.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - We have to go.<eos> No, we have to save him.<eos> Hera gave you a direct order and you said you would follow it.<eos> Mart, do you read?<eos> Ezra, go. Get my friends out of here.<eos> We'll come back for you.
That's a little extreme. this may be his last Thanksgiving, Beth.<eos> Yeah, so that's why you need to get your ass on the road.<eos> - Hurry up.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Daddy, is it time to start the movie? - Yep.<eos> You guys watch it without me.<eos> Uh, Daddy's got to run a quick errand.<eos> Oh, but you, uh, you love Police Academy III. I know.<eos> That Steve Guttenberg gets me every time.<eos> Why don't I come with you and keep you company? And miss the movie?
That's right.<eos> Why are you pretending not to know this stuff, huh?<eos> Getting b's in math?<eos> Not letting people see how smart you are?<eos> I don't want to be different from them.<eos> Different from who?<eos> Who, the kids at school?<eos> If... if I get an a, I'll get ice cream, and Kate and Kevin won't.<eos> And then they'll hate me.<eos> Can I be honest with you?
What? !<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Who's saying that?<eos> Like, everyone.<eos> Dax, talk to me, please.<eos> The kids on that stupid app don't know that you and Jason were friends.<eos> There's no way the police will take them seriously.<eos> I'm just going for a drive, okay?<eos> I need to clear my head.<eos> I'll go with you.
Uh, that was a felony, and I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Why are you really here?<eos> Louise sent me to get her favorite Chardonnay from some vineyard in Montesito.<eos> Turns out they have it at the convenience store right around the corner.<eos> Anyway, I was wondering if we could get together again sometime.<eos> Are you asking me out?<eos> I was thinking we could... hang.<eos> I'm free tomorrow, as long as you stick to misdemeanors.<eos> Deal.<eos> I'll pick you up.
I'm so nervous.<eos> Call me Jake.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> It's just two people having a conversation.<eos> Chloe, we're two minutes to air.<eos> Are you good?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> You know your brother better than anyone in the world.<eos> It's the reason why Louise is talking to you.
What?<eos> ! Of course not!<eos> Go to commercial. Please.<eos> She's an adult. Let her answer the question.<eos> Why is your brother threatening the victim to stay away from you?<eos> I'm sorry. I-I can't do this.<eos> You know how they say crazy runs in the family.<eos> With these people, it's running a 4-minute mile.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you today?
What do you mean?<eos> Well, it would've been our one-year anniversary.<eos> We were supposed to go to Medora for dinner.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You know, I don't think I canceled that reservation.<eos> We could still go.<eos> We're not getting back together.<eos> Oh, Julia.<eos> Look, I know that what I did was unforgivable.<eos> I'm in therapy now, and I know that it's gonna be a while before I'm healthy enough to be with you or anyone else.
The hell it is!<eos> Look.<eos> Okay, new game.<eos> You have to hit it dead center, and every time you don't, you have to answer a highly personal, deeply embarrassing question.<eos> Preferably both.<eos> - No. - Nah. Well, let's just mainline pints and play 1 to 20 like total wankers, then.<eos> Come on.<eos> The SAS says "Who dares wins," so who dares?<eos> I want to win.<eos> So impressed with you right now.
Look, there are many other non-violent methods we can use.<eos> We've tried everything.<eos> No, that's not true, not true.<eos> How about a few milligrams of sodium thiopental and a nice, clean needle?<eos> You want to drug him?<eos> Yeah, it won't hurt him, shame him, or torture him.<eos> Yeah, that's right. It's just a light hangover and an alias later, and then we can all go home with our consciences intact.<eos> That's coming from you?<eos> A guy who'd sell my kidney on the black market if it gave him half off a pint at the Gold Leaf?<eos> What has happened to you?
I was embarrassed so I didn't say anything.<eos> Why wouldn't he tell us?<eos> Are we bad friends?<eos> He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.<eos> Yeah, he deserves to be alone.<eos> So you're back out on the dating scene now?<eos> Yeah, yeah, a little.<eos> Oh, that must be fun.<eos> How's that going?<eos> I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.
I mean, the first one's traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.<eos> Well, what happened with your dad?<eos> We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.<eos> You poor thing.<eos> Since Amy and I have been living together, we've been bickering like my parents used to.<eos> And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?<eos> Yes.<eos> I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.<eos> Down the road?<eos> Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!
Since Amy and I have been living together, we've been bickering like my parents used to.<eos> And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?<eos> Yes.<eos> I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.<eos> Down the road?<eos> Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!<eos> Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.<eos> Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you're causing her right now?<eos> I'm sure you're right.<eos> I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.
Hey!<eos> You have an hour left.<eos> Report.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have the Doc. Come pick her up.<eos> And that's all the time we have.<eos> Lucy called the payphone.<eos> What did she say?<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> Okay, there is this scary guy, Garcia Flynn, - and he is after you.
Okay.<eos> Let's say the bosses find out that you took this girl in after meeting her on the job. After we tossed her for trespassing, you don't think that they'd question your judgment?<eos> No one's gonna find out, Eddie.<eos> What if something happened to Tara?<eos> It's possible, given the crazy risks she takes.<eos> If it came out she was staying with you, you could get jammed up.<eos> That's a chance I'm willing to take.<eos> What?<eos> Isn't Jamie awesome?<eos> You know, what is with you?
Cards on the table?<eos> I have feelings for you, too.<eos> I think you know that.<eos> But we've been down that road before.<eos> And it's a bad idea, for a... a lot of reasons.<eos> I know.<eos> It can really cloud your judgment, and... totally screw up a partnership.<eos> Yeah. Totally.<eos> I just...<eos> You know, I just wanted to be honest.
When's the last time she actually sat down in the kitchen?<eos> - Never.<eos> - Yeah, I'm worried about her.<eos> Morning, boss.<eos> You had quite night.<eos> Do you need to talk?<eos> Because we can talk.<eos> Or I can give you happy pills.<eos> Your call.<eos> We're here for you.
Levi was not trying to take over the company.<eos> He was not trying to commit corporate sabotage.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Shut the door.<eos> Levi was in love with Oscar.<eos> He pretended to be SweetVicki so that he could feel closer to Oscar.<eos> If you go public with the wedding video,<eos> I will go public with what I know, and that will not be good for your client.<eos> He's been telling everyone that Levi wanted to destroy him, and that was not the case.<eos> If I were you, I would bury that video and pray that I keep my mouth shut.

I've taken up enough of your time. I'll see myself out.<eos> Hi, Jake.<eos> Jake?<eos> Did you tell the D.A. about me and Sarah?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He came to my office, looked me in the eye, and told me he knew she was having an affair.<eos> And since you met with him earlier today...<eos> You thought I told him you were sleeping with Sarah?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
He didn't.<eos> So I debrief you after the suicide.<eos> You don't tell me about the video, then you play it live on air.<eos> - Why would you do that?<eos> - It's part of the story, and I wanted your honest reaction.<eos> You realize I could charge you with obstruction of justice for hiding that video.<eos> That's a stretch, and we both know it.<eos> So let me get this straight.<eos> Your show accused a man of murder, then you saw that man take his own life, and your first instinct is to make a spectacle out of his suicide.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
We... We brought our contract with us.<eos> Okay, if that's true,<eos> Maggie brokered an adoption with the surrogate and pocketed $150,000 in the process.<eos> She's running a scam.<eos> We don't care about that right now.<eos> We just...<eos> We want to see the baby.<eos> Our baby.<eos> Oh.<eos> We begged Maggie to let us talk to you.

What are you doing here?<eos> I can let you in on a secret.<eos> I'm going to raid england again.<eos> And I'm looking for warriors, like you and like you, to join me.<eos> Why do you want to raid england again?<eos> I've heard your son bjorn has other plans.<eos> Yes, he does, but I have my own plans.<eos> To exact revenge on the destruction of the settlement.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My brother and his family went with you.
But it seems you knew all along<eos> and didn't tell us.<eos> And now you want us to go and revenge, not for my brother and his wife and their children, because you didn't care for them...<eos> No...<eos> For your own guilt.<eos> And do you know what, ragnar lothbrok?<eos> Do you know what?<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> And if I had the mind to raid...<eos> I would raid with your son, and not with you!
And he will know where you are.<eos> He would find out anyway.<eos> I wish you were coming with me.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You said yourself, this is your destiny, not mine.<eos> Your mistakes are yours...<eos> And so are your successes.<eos> So, are you going to england?<eos> That is the plan.<eos> And who will sail with you?
As a king's son, you can have as many woman as you like...<eos> Yeah!<eos> But you need one to breed with.<eos> So then you don't believe in love?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> So you loved ragnar when you married him?<eos> And he loved you?<eos> Of course I loved him!<eos> Some say that you bewitched him.<eos> What is wrong with you?
- That you captured rogaland and overthrew king arnarson and Earl eyjolf.<eos> Yes.<eos> And also king svein.<eos> Then you are nearer to your ultimate ambition.<eos> Of being king of Norway.<eos> I think it is impossible, bjorn.<eos> How can I ever overthrow king ragnar?<eos> As for you, bjorn, I want to say we believe in you.<eos> We believe in this journey.<eos> And we believe that the gods are with you.
But you will never be queen in kattegat.<eos> What are you digging your horde up for?<eos> Everything you saved to spend after your death.<eos> I have no choice!<eos> I have to bribe people to sail with me.<eos> You're a loser.<eos> Why don't you come and help me lift, cripple boy?<eos> Good boy.<eos> Halfdan, king Harald, go with the gods.<eos> We will. And you.
Here you go.<eos> - You give me that.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't care.<eos> What if we care, father?<eos> Go on.<eos> Friend.<eos> - Have you changed your mind?<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> For that I will sail with you.
You told them.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I swear.<eos> I do not believe you.<eos> It's true!<eos> I swear it, ivar!<eos> I swear it!<eos> Shh. Hush.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Just let me lie here beside you...
I mean, have we just been wasting sunscreen all of these years?<eos> That I have no answer for.<eos> Chair.<eos> Chair!<eos> Careful!<eos> Kevin: She'shisex-wife,Kate.<eos> All right?<eos> The operative word being "ex."<eos> They're not together anymore.<eos> He's with you now.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay?<eos> I should have been watching.<eos> Okay?<eos> You should have.<eos> And I said I was and I should have been watching you, pal.
State, the White House.<eos> If we were to do this, I'd have to clear it with Panabaker.<eos> Samar, reach out to your contact at the embassy.<eos> Review the Jaipur incident top to bottom.<eos> Aram, go to the Post Office.<eos> Call the NSA and tear our system apart.<eos> Discreetly.<eos> We don't want them to think that we're onto them, but put every line of code under a microscope.<eos> We have to find these hackers now.<eos> You know, that little act of yours between you and Reddington had me going.
Then you know Reddington lied to you from the beginning.<eos> Yes.<eos> There's no reason why we shouldn't be together.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> A meeting.<eos> Just the two of us and Agnes.<eos> That won't be easy.<eos> Reddington has his goons guarding me 24/7.<eos> Because he doesn't trust you.<eos> I'll work something out, contact you.
I just had a bout of morning sickness.<eos> Oh, don't say morning sickness.<eos> Oh, now I've got it.<eos> Obviously, we need to do a better job at figuring out who is setting off our singing wall fishes.<eos> Tap shoes?<eos> And there's whistles in there, too.<eos> So, I propose that when we walk around, we wear these tappers and we blow these whistles.<eos> That way, when we hear our singing wall fish, but we don't hear this... we'll know it's someone that needs to be terminated.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm with you in theory.
Tandy, this is no way to live, man!<eos> Guys, come on!<eos> There's nothing to fear but fear itself!<eos> Did we learn nothing from Tony Robbins?<eos> All right!<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow!<eos> Anyone who wants is welcome to join me.<eos> Count me in.<eos> - Me, too!<eos> - I'll go with you!
You know that story where a child gets trapped under a car and their parent finds the superhuman strength to lift the car and save the child's life?<eos> I always wondered if that was real.<eos> I mean, are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
You know that story where a child gets trapped under a car and their parent finds the superhuman strength to lift the car and save the child's life?<eos> I always wondered if that was real.<eos> I mean, are you sure you don't want me to go with you?<eos> I could go with you.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I'll just need a second.<eos> I could go with you.
And you're safe now, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> Robbie?<eos> - I just want...<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Hurts...<eos> - Robbie?<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Can you squeeze my hands?<eos> Okay, I'm right here with you, and I'm gonna help you.

- I'm an event planner.<eos> - I'm an interpreter.<eos> That's one theory down.<eos> Let's keep going.<eos> León Velez.<eos> I'm a photographer covering the G20 because the President of the World Bank was gonna speak.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Simon.<eos> - We're all still here.<eos> - I'm always with you.
Sometimes you make the right decision. Other times, you don't.<eos> Either way, you have to live with it and its consequences.<eos> The question is, can you?<eos> It's not always our actions, but their aftermath that haunt us.<eos> So today we're gonna find out who among you is strong enough to face themselves.<eos> Where did you get that sat phone, Alex?<eos> Until you answer my questions,<eos> I'm not answering any of yours.<eos> Trust has always been a foreign concept to you, hasn't it, Alex?<eos> Like truth with you.
Hey, I'd back down if you don't want the spotlight on you next.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, he's right.<eos> Apart from me and him, you have whole areas of your life unaccounted for.<eos> Oh, they're accounted for.<eos> Just maybe not accurately.<eos> This coming from a man who spent a decade as a voluntary witness for murder.<eos> I record history, I don't make it.<eos> You think that clicking the shutter is any less of a crime than pulling the trigger?<eos> You let people die in front of you, and you did nothing to stop it.
Does the target live or die?<eos> Hey, I think I found something to create a cover story.<eos> It's from the Williamsburg Gazette.<eos> Three years ago, there was an apparent suicide at Camp Peary.<eos> They don't say if it was an employee, recruit, or a soldier.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We can use it.<eos> Caleb again.<eos> Good timing.<eos> I just got clearance to talk to you.
You think just because you teach everyone what to do you'd survive a day out there?<eos> What's your cover?<eos> A tenured professor?<eos> A widowed judge?<eos> Where's that going to get you in Bangladesh, in Egypt, in Syria?<eos> No matter what information I give you, the answer will be the same.<eos> Your field career is over, and everyone at the CIA knows it but you.<eos> All this time away from the field,<eos> I thought you'd have learned perspective.<eos> And I'm right here in front of you, and all you can focus on are the dreams that didn't come true.
Raina, I was in Surabaya.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I promise to stay with you.<eos> Where are you taking us?<eos> Harry!<eos> Help me!<eos> Harry!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm with you.
Look at me.<eos> We've been doing the same thing for two years.<eos> It ain't working.<eos> Time for something completely different.<eos> You will see the wisdom of my actions.<eos> And thank me.<eos> Relax.<eos> They won't hurt you.<eos> You're with me now.<eos> I'm not with you.

Hello, Mother.<eos> My son.<eos> It's really you again.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've come to warn you.<eos> The glowing thread you followed is the strand of my fate.<eos> It's what my father plans to cut with these shears as soon as I'm born.<eos> I-I'm trying to stop him, but I don't know how.<eos> You know the answer to saving me is already inside you.<eos> It's right here in front of you.
Look, I have one last case pending trial, and unlike this useless pantomime, someone's life is actually at stake.<eos> Keep your focus where it needs to be and multitask on your own time.<eos> But never mind though, 'cause we lost her.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Jason Bourne, how's spy school?<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna rat you out.<eos> But you need to pay closer attention.<eos> That guy's been following you for the last two blocks.
But a shot at this... This... It isn't just once-in-a-lifetime, it's one-in-a-million.<eos> They see something in you.<eos> You need to find out if you can see it in you, too.<eos> You did well today.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I failed.<eos> I didn't I.D. Harry as my fifth eye. Four out of five is better than I did in week one.<eos> Most first-weekers don't even notice they're being watched.<eos> I thought you only reserve your flattery for the other recruits.<eos> You want to know why I'm hard on you?
A Petite Sirah?<eos> You've got a lot to learn.<eos> Nimah?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm your new handler.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> Your rendezvous can.<eos> I have new intelligence from Miranda, and we need to debrief now.<eos> I'll talk to you later.
You turned into Dad!<eos> That is a thing anyone would say.<eos> You've got his nose and his chin and his unreasonably high expectations - of everyone around you... - You know what?<eos> ...that no one could possibly live up to.<eos> But not his beard...<eos> His beard was good.<eos> Yours is just sad.<eos> My beard is fine.<eos> Actually, I shaved this morn...<eos> Why am I even explaining this to you?
Bounty hunter?<eos> Yeah, it's cool.<eos> All right, so, we're agreed.<eos> We can't let her choose from four insane majors.<eos> [Gasps]<eos> I thought I heard keys.<eos> Okay, I'll handle it.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> - ["Jammin'" plays] - ♪ We're drivin' ♪<eos> ♪ I want to drive it with you ♪
I'm sorry, son.<eos> But that license is just gonna have to wait.<eos> ["Jammin'" plays]<eos> ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪<eos> Every week, huh?<eos> Every week.<eos> A year will go fast.<eos> ♪ We're jammin' ♪<eos> ♪ Jammin', jammin', jammin' ♪<eos> ♪ I want to jam it with you ♪
Whatever.<eos> You do realize I already have a partner, and I don't need this bozo slowing me down?<eos> I heard that, too.<eos> No one wants to see you get hurt.<eos> Everyone wants to make sure you're safe.<eos> I-I want to talk to Jennifer first.<eos> We can try to arrange for you to talk to her, but you got to come back on this side, okay?<eos> No, no. I want to talk to her first.<eos> We can't make that happen until you come back on this side and you're safe, okay?<eos> You never told me why your, uh, fiancée broke it off with you.
Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We got played, all right.<eos> I never should've suggested lunch.<eos> Everybody's got to eat.<eos> Well, then alone. I should've been there.<eos> Well, that would've defeated the purpose of me and him having an open conversation.<eos> Purpose got defeated anyway.<eos> What I said was we're not perfect, but in police work, perfect is the enemy of good.<eos> Once in a while, I should just let you be you.
Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You guys gonna be this much fun all night?<eos> You know, I-I don't get it.<eos> Me neither.<eos> What?<eos> You got this tough-as-nails A.D.A. here, and she's insisting that we break bread together.<eos> As if that's gonna change anything.<eos> What is it with you?
Need to find you a crown.<eos> * *<eos> we're pretty good together.<eos> Kevin: TheseL.A.actors, they come out here, right? They do their little stint in theater just to feel better about themselves.<eos> I'm here for the right reasons.<eos> Let's get this over with, shall we?<eos> You got the part.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry. What?<eos> They think the nanny will sell tickets.<eos> I did everything wrong by you, and you've done everything right.
I was thinking miniature golf.<eos> Last time, I was like, 20 under going into the 18th, but that little windmill owns my ass.<eos> I can't.<eos> Steelers.<eos> Sundaynightfootball. Hmm.<eos> (Quietly): Saturday night football.<eos> With who?<eos> Oh, no one.<eos> Just me.<eos> All right. I'll watch with you.
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke, and then I start spinning.<eos> I don't even know what the play's about anymore.<eos> Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?<eos> You know, it doesn't ma-- it doesn't matter, it's...<eos> You're just gonna think it's stupid.<eos> Said the dopey labrador.<eos> (Car horns honking, people whooping)<eos> Man: We did it!<eos> (Cheering, whooping)<eos> If it's between you and having kids, you win.
And I'm so scared of changing it.<eos> I don't want to change it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.<eos> Okay?<eos> What we have together, you and me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.<eos> I just...<eos> I just want you.
All right, yeah.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> You wanna go for a walk?<eos> All right, man.<eos> What a week, Gats.<eos> Now you wanna go on a walk?<eos> You're a wack-a-doodle.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, I thought we were going for a walk?<eos> What's going on with you?
Come on.<eos> Really?<eos> You're coming outside.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, you got to take a leak sometime, man.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're not leaking in the house.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What's going on with you, man?
God.<eos> What the hell do you think they're talking about, anyway?<eos> I don't know, honey.<eos> He found me.<eos> He brought me here.<eos> But you stayed. Yes, I stayed.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I won't tell him, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> Oh, God. All those... It will break him.<eos> It will. Knowing that he could've known you and that I kept him from that.
- I-I'm on a stakeout.<eos> - Stakeout. Yeah.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> "... The woods and was poisonous?"<eos> Amen, brother.<eos> Jell-o.<eos> Hey, Stan!<eos> Listen, I-I blew a tyre and, uh, you know, no spare.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> What's with you?
Previously on The Last Man on Earth...<eos> I put Gordon away.<eos> I don't need him anymore.<eos> She murdered someone, and I don't think she's processing it.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> This place is a nightmare.<eos> I can't live like this anymore!<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow!<eos> - Me, too!<eos> - I'll go with you!
Jenn?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Are we at war?<eos> Mom, we're off the East Coast of the United States.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Well, then what are you doing?<eos> Reporting for duty.<eos> In the middle of the night?<eos> Ships don't sleep.<eos> In that case, I'll come with you.
Far from it.<eos> Not withstanding our respective vomit, Mr. Palmer, we continue to do our jobs.<eos> That's all anyone can ask of us.<eos> Well, thank you, Doctor.<eos> With that in mind, I'm going to go take the victim's personal effects up to Abby.<eos> Yes, I'd take them up myself, but she still thinks I'm sick, despite the fact that I have kept dry toast down for 24 hours.<eos> Did we miss something?<eos> The victim's necklace.<eos> I didn't notice it when I removed it, but... there's an inscription on the back.<eos> "Time with you is never wasted""
We're having a raising Helvetica party.<eos> I thought we were gonna discuss Garamond.<eos> I'm saving that for Monday.<eos> Gara-Monday?<eos> Ah, cool.<eos> Coach:<eos> Hey, you.<eos> You ever thought about trying out for football?<eos> Who, me?<eos> No, the wall of man behind you.
I know we're supposed to let her cry herself to sleep, but talk about cruel and unusual.<eos> She missed you tonight. We both did.<eos> I thought you'd be home earlier.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't call.<eos> Kirk collapsed in the Post Office.<eos> Oh, well, that's good.<eos> His only hope is for a blood relative to donate stem cells.<eos> Are you thinking about it?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you about it.
Nice.<eos> Hey, yeah, Toby, do you mind if we take a victory pic?<eos> - Oh, no, no, that's not necessary.<eos> - No, of course it is.<eos> - No, it's no biggie.<eos> - You hit your goal.<eos> - It's no biggie.<eos> - No. You are no biggie... anymore.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm proud of you, Toby.
- like, right now.<eos> - Here's the thing.<eos> Depriving myself, uh... makes me absolutely nuts.<eos> So, I think I'm gonna need to loosen the reins a little bit.<eos> What does that mean, loosen the reins?<eos> That means... I'm done dieting, Kate.<eos> But I still support you 100%.<eos> Um... how?<eos> Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight
We will eat sensibly, hmm?<eos> We will talk as always.<eos> We will laugh as always, all right?<eos> We'll still be us, I promise.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, congrats.<eos> Heard you got your own room.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up with you?
I'll be darned.<eos> They can't cancel our play on Christmas Eve.<eos> Who does that?<eos> What did you think would happen?<eos> Our lead actress vanished a month ago, off the face of the planet, rode away from your cabin, so thank you very much.<eos> "Thank you very much"?<eos> What did I do?<eos> You got involved with her.<eos> You slept with the Tony-nominated star of my play and ruined everything.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too.
And now, because of you, I have to go to Hanukkah dinner at my parents' house and tell them and my perfect sister that the play isn't happening-- years of hearing that I'd never be a playwright, and then finally I was, but now I'm not.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Really, I'm sorry.<eos> - What can I do? - Come to dinner with me.<eos> Oh, thanks, yeah, but I have this Christmas Eve tradition thing I do at my brother's.<eos> No, I'm not really asking you. You owe me.<eos> Why do you want me to come to your family dinner?<eos> 'Cause I told Mom I'm dating the Manny.<eos> That seems weird.<eos> Well, I'd just made the huge mistake of sleeping with you. And then I was on the phone with my mom, and she was going on and on about how I'd never make a living as a playwright, and because our only other topic of conversation is my love life,
Thank you.<eos> We can run in and change, and go right to Randall's.<eos> I already texted him. I don't feel like going.<eos> There's usually Christmas music on 101.7.<eos> Did I do this?<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> With the food.<eos> I didn't know if I brought up the food too much or I wasn't bringing it up enough.<eos> I never knew what to say, Kate.<eos> Did I do this to you?
So the two votes against Reagan moving in must be Schmidt and Winston.<eos> Thank God you had these magnets.<eos> Yeah, well they're a backup housewarming gift for Schmidt and Cece in case my quilt guy screws me again.<eos> Thank God you found this mysteriously sticky wall.<eos> Let's go get Schmidt and Winston and change their votes.<eos> - I can't believe those two.<eos> - You stay here and wait.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm going too crazy.<eos> I'm coming with you.
- What did you know at 17?<eos> That I wanted to be a firefighter.<eos> You?<eos> Same damn thing.<eos> Friends like your father here... You're damn right I'm going to call him your father... One in a million.<eos> But with the CFD, there's a million of us.<eos> Best damn stock there is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess I never had anything like that.<eos> Well, it's right here in front of you, kid.
We moved in together.<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - He's great.<eos> Treats me like a human being.<eos> Listen.<eos> About Jimmy.<eos> He's saying that he wants to finish out his senior year under our roof.<eos> Well, to be honest with you, he's barely at home these days, barely talks to me, so... Maybe some time with you is what he needs.
[Pencil snaps]<eos> It's huge!<eos> It's a normal-sized pill.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Ready?<eos> Go.<eos> [Whimpers]<eos> [Crunches]<eos> [Groans]<eos> What's the matter with you?
Ow!<eos> Br... [Sighs]<eos> [Spits]<eos> [Door opens]<eos> Mom!<eos> Dad!<eos> Help!<eos> Sue!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Are you okay?
Good.<eos> Freeze out.<eos> Secret bonus freeze in.<eos> And your hair's not as great as you think it is.<eos> - Freeze back out.<eos> - Freeze in.<eos> [Gasps]<eos> Freeze back out.<eos> I got two hours to see April.<eos> I'm not gonna waste it having a childish argument with you!
What about Grace?<eos> Sorry, kiddo.<eos> She's not coming.<eos> But we're still gonna have a great time.<eos> Boys' night?<eos> That's right.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> I'm starting to think trouble follows you around, Mrs. Noshimuri.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm just saying, you know, nothing like this ever happened to me before I met you.
I couldn't sleep after I read it.<eos> Ha! Try living through it.<eos> For those just tuning in, we're with actress Chris MacNeil, talking about Ms. MacNeil's new book,<eos> The Devil in My Daughter, which she says is the true story of a time several years ago when young Regan was possessed by a demon.<eos> Now, Regan, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may.<eos> Although your mother has warned me that you're a little shy.<eos> I'm quiet.<eos> Not shy.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?
But now I fear the bloom is off the rose.<eos> Please, don't hurt my daughter.<eos> I could give her back to you, if you really want.<eos> Are you sure you still want her?<eos> I do.<eos> Please.<eos> All right.<eos> What if I just told you where she is?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Right behind you.
I don't see Father Tomas here.<eos> He'll be a tough nut - to crack, Your Eminence.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We have our ways.<eos> You came.<eos> Yes.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Keys in the bowl, cell phone, your watch.<eos> No time here.<eos> I-I cannot sleep with you.
About five minutes.<eos> Thanks for having my back last night.<eos> Yeah, thanks for starting it.<eos> I didn't start it.<eos> You kind of did.<eos> More than kind of.<eos> He started it with the NYPD cracks.<eos> So now you got thin skin about the police department?<eos> It was insulting.<eos> I've been on the street with you when people have said way worse to you about your own father, and you just laugh it off.
Yeah, well, the Easter Bunny didn't kill Boston Arliss Crab.<eos> - You're bleeding.<eos> - And you're beautiful.<eos> Crab's dead?<eos> We were hiding out in England when he found us.<eos> But Boston managed to drop a chandelier on his head, buying me enough time to escape, but not enough time to avoid having a knife plunged into his chest.<eos> He died in my arms.<eos> On the beach.<eos> Last thing he said to me was...<eos> "Such a beautiful place to die with you."
No, we've got to focus on getting Zapata back.<eos> I'm in the C1 administrator's office.<eos> The Akkadian has injected me with a neuro-toxin that will slowly kill... that will slowly kill me.<eos> He's leaving three vials.<eos> One is an antidote.<eos> The others will kill me instantly.<eos> Leave Rich alone, and he'll tell you which one to use.<eos> Make the trade.<eos> Zapata's life is worth twice as much as Rich's.<eos> I can't say I entirely disagree with you.
I thought she had a concussion.<eos> She good?<eos> Let's get back to the team.<eos> I've got a better idea.<eos> I never went to the infirmary.<eos> I went on a crab hunt.<eos> How did you know I was still alive?<eos> It was your death story.<eos> He died in my arms, on the beach.<eos> "Such a beautiful place to die with you."
Exactly.<eos> So what if normal people, what if citizens want to protect themselves and their families from the bad guys?<eos> Shouldn't they have a right to do that?<eos> How about if we just don't let the bad guys have any guns?<eos> Then the good guys won't need any guns, and nobody needs any guns, how about that?<eos> And you know what else? While we're at it, we can eliminate discrimination, war, hatred, violence, all that kind of stuff.<eos> We'll all live happily ever after, and we can, uh, you know, ride our unicorns to work every day.<eos> And you'd probably commandeer my unicorn, and drive it to work every day.<eos> If you had a gun, you could stop me.<eos> You sure you don't want me to come with you?
Yeah, I asked Larissa's mom, but she didn't know who she was.<eos> I'll see what I can find out.<eos> Ugh, this game freaking cheats!<eos> - Gordo?<eos> - Uh-huh?<eos> You mind turning that down?<eos> How 'bout a little "ready player two"?<eos> In a minute, I just have some more work to do.<eos> Raim, it's Sunday fun day!<eos> It's our time-honored tradition, and I've been dying all week to play this game with you.
I am un-sober, yeah.<eos> Which, you know, is your fault, by the way.<eos> What?<eos> Well...<eos> No, you...<eos> I can't get you out of my head.<eos> Do you always do this?<eos> Just... drive home strangers that show up your doorstep, wasted?<eos> You're not a stranger.<eos> I'm stalking you, remember?
Actually what am I talking about?<eos> That watan's made out of stone.<eos> Look it up, Frank.<eos> It was one of her fellow players.<eos> She's making a big push to be the new Little Jay.<eos> Jumped over a lot of guys.<eos> We've been building a case against her for weeks.<eos> Even Satch tried to warn you, and she gets you to jam us up?<eos> You got your head so far up it you can't even see daylight anymore.<eos> What happened to you, man?
I guess when it comes down to it, I'm just a company man.<eos> And you... you going off rogue.<eos> Looking like you're in too deep with a bunch of drug dealers.<eos> - I can't be a part of that.<eos> - Are you for real right now? Huh?<eos> Are you telling me that...<eos> that you have more loyalty to Stan than you do for me?<eos> It's not about Stan.<eos> You're set on blowing up your career.<eos> I can't go down with you.
I want your knighting ceremony to be perfect.<eos> You're going to be the noblest knight the kingdom has ever seen.<eos> Is that for me?<eos> For tomorrow?<eos> My name is Sir Henry, Knight of the Realm.<eos> And I shall defend all of you.<eos> Your father would be very proud of you.<eos> I wish.<eos> I wish I'd known him.<eos> He's watching over you.

Where?<eos> That will cost you.<eos> At last!<eos> It smells just as dank outside.<eos> I think I need some fresh air.<eos> Uh, the bean.<eos> Yes, yes, right, right.<eos> Meet me tomorrow at noon down by the lake.<eos> Tomorrow at noon it is.<eos> I don't know what happened to you, but you don't exactly inspire fear anymore.
You made your point last night, okay?<eos> We would both continue doing our jobs to the very end.<eos> The work we do is important.<eos> I think I could have done a better job explaining why it's important.<eos> At least explaining why it's important... to me.<eos> When you and I first started...<eos> I quickly recognized your merits, both as a detective in your own right... and in that you facilitated my own process.<eos> I'm better at the work I do because of you.<eos> But over the years... the relative importance of those two values has flipped.<eos> I now value the work that we do, first and foremost, because I do it with you.
You sent me there.<eos> I've been working for you.<eos> Roman, tell her!<eos> Stop.<eos> You're only gonna make it worse.<eos> I don't know what you think you know, but...<eos> We don't think anything.<eos> You're not the only one that can infiltrate the FBI.<eos> Do you really think Oscar was your only handler?<eos> That we didn't ensure other means of keeping tabs on you?
You can do it.<eos> You're not funny.<eos> So I see my wife's gotten to you too.<eos> And what's this?<eos> In an unprecedented move...<eos> Well, this is what I like to call graduation day.<eos> Graduation?<eos> I'm not sure I like the sound of that.<eos> I can't thank you and Chris enough for everything that you've done for me, but it's time for me to go.<eos> Well, I don't suppose you can tell us what happened to you, now?
Reade, don't do this to me!<eos> Come on!<eos> It's gonna blow!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> No!<eos> No, no! Hey, hey!<eos> Hey...<eos> I've got you.
I should have let go of you... years ago, but you were my child.<eos> I'm gonna be dead soon, and my biggest regret is that... you will remember me like this and not the young father who cradled you in his arms.<eos> A lifetime in front of us.<eos> You want me to remember you that way?<eos> Let Reddington go.<eos> Hold her for an hour.<eos> Take her somewhere remote.<eos> Leave her safe.<eos> Safe, Odette.<eos> I'll come for you.

What good is killing me gonna do?<eos> It won't bring him back.<eos> He's gonna die.<eos> He can't be saved.<eos> Well, he wouldn't need to be saved if it wasn't for you.<eos> Come on. Up, up.<eos> He's dying because he's sick.<eos> I'm not talking about his death.<eos> That was inevitable.<eos> I'm talking about who he's become because of his obsession with you.
Can I see it?<eos> No, you cannot see it.<eos> Has something died in there?<eos> No, Tandy.<eos> Just funny.<eos> Most people take care of their restroom stuff before they go to bed.<eos> Or if they got to go in the middle of the night and the restroom's far away, they just do their business, number one or number two, in a cup by the bed and deal with the cup in the morning.<eos> Well, then you and I have very different processes.<eos> Now, what is it you want?<eos> For you to know that I'm... watching you.
I burned them all.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, so I have some really exciting news.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What... what's that?<eos> Well, I know we talked about it a long time ago, but I decided I'm finally ready.<eos> You're... ready?<eos> For... what?<eos> Ready to have a baby with you!
Leave everything else outside.<eos> You're so special.<eos> Let me touch you.<eos> - Let me touch you... - Come on.<eos> Your Eminence, and Father Bennet.<eos> So happy to have you.<eos> Tattersal Landscaping.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to explain to me how a defunct landscaping company funnels nearly $3 million into a papal planning committee.<eos> The Devil in my Daughter.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?
What do you mean?<eos> I think...<eos> I think I might have perjured myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can see you now.<eos> Apologies.<eos> I've, uh, taken to covering all the lenses in here.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, let's just say the NSA doesn't like me as much as you do.<eos> You think a government agency is spying on you?
Could you not regurgitate that happy report on your own?<eos> The A.D.A. wants to be sure our wires aren't crossed anymore.<eos> This is about putting a murderer away.<eos> It'll take 30 minutes.<eos> You got Mr. Cruz's signature under an affidavit?<eos> Figure that way, he can't get squirrelly again.<eos> He swore out the real story, picked our guy out of a photo array.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> I'm gonna take this to Judge Williams right now.<eos> You know, we can go with you if you think it'll help.
Are you going to tell me I have a tumor?<eos> No.<eos> I was just thinking about what you said about Fiona last night.<eos> I mean, she's smart, compassionate, beautiful.<eos> Yet you still think she might not be right for me.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just know that you've never been through a breakup before.<eos> Fake deaths don't count.<eos> And besides, Moriarty did that to you; you did not do that to her.
And besides, Moriarty did that to you; you did not do that to her.<eos> Listen, breakups are never easy, but they don't have to be that bad.<eos> So just try and remember:<eos> "Give to a gracious message a host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt."<eos> Lights up on three devious travelers of the Silk Road.<eos> Silent Wolf, Hungrybox and Doctor Bumrush.<eos> They are buyers and purveyors of stolen goods all, and they are commiserating about a great fraud perpetrated by their much loathed nemesis Tha PoPo.<eos> "Tha PoPo's lying, man.<eos> The art on the news is fugazi."<eos> "I'm with you.
We were just in bed one minute. Then the whole world caved in.<eos> I don't know why I was okay and he was hurt so badly.<eos> Look, I'll update you as soon as we know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, I updated Charlie's wife.<eos> Charlie's wife?<eos> Yep.<eos> Charlie's married?<eos> Our patient Charlie?<eos> What's the matter with you?
She's in V-fib.<eos> Get a crash cart.<eos> Charge to 200.<eos> Charge again!<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm married.<eos> What?<eos> I'm married.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Since before I met you.
You've been there once.<eos> Now you know better.<eos> Hey!<eos> How's the kid?<eos> The hyperventilating kid.<eos> Fine.<eos> I like girls.<eos> What?<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> I mean, I feel like you can't tell or something, that I like women, that I'm flirting with you.
You walk around like you own the place.<eos> It's annoying.<eos> Mm. It's charming.<eos> Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See? That.<eos> That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.<eos> Shut up. Fine.<eos> I'll have a drink with you.
Yeah.<eos> They don't get to make this decision.<eos> There is nothing wrong with this program, - and it is totally disrespectful to you.<eos> - Maggie...<eos> And if they want a fight, they can have it.<eos> I am not scared.<eos> Maggie!<eos> Look, I appreciate it.<eos> But, um... I'm not sure this is a fight I can win.<eos> I'll fight with you.
He's an Army vet that was deported in 2004.<eos> He started a support house for other deported veterans in Tijuana.<eos> Yeah, called the Bunker.<eos> You know about it?<eos> Yeah, I know about it.<eos> Gibbs, some of these deportable crimes, they're so minor.<eos> And these guys are not even offered an immigration attorney.<eos> And they have lives and families<eos> - Abbs, - and children here...<eos> I'm agreeing with you.
Let me feed you before you go.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Actually, Mrs. Medina, we have to...<eos> We're starving.<eos> Nice house.<eos> Ooh. Yeah.<eos> A palace of a luxury realtor.<eos> Quinn.<eos> Hmm?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
_<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No need to yell at anybody.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You took a hit.<eos> Just like...<eos> I took a hit.<eos> But if I can recover from a gunshot, you can recover from this.<eos> You are right.<eos> I'm coming for you... and your murse.
No.<eos> It's a useful way to convey the passage of time as you inspire Emma Lazarus to write her poem for the base of the Statue of Liberty.<eos> Who wants useful?<eos> I want inspired.<eos> I want transcendent.<eos> I want a vegan smoothie...<eos> Someone please.<eos> You.<eos> In a mason jar.<eos> Ay. Hey, Rogelio, what is going on with you today?
- Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> 'Cause right now would be a good time to convince me to get a new job<eos> And as tempting as that sounded,<eos> - Jane said...<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> You love your job, and you want to go back, remember?<eos> I thought you were with the twins.<eos> They're down for the night.<eos> Chepa's with them.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.

- Who is he?<eos> - The key to everything.<eos> You said your mother never talks to you.<eos> What if you could hear her voice?<eos> It was dreams or death.<eos> How're you doing this?<eos> She's not. You are.<eos> Ever since we saw him at that window, I feel so close.<eos> There's an old friend of mine who works at the firm.<eos> He saw me with you this morning, and he passed me a note. Says I shouldn't trust you.
How much of this will I remember when I wake up?<eos> Most of it.<eos> The more you're aware, The more it stays with you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> I saw something in my dream.<eos> What'd you see?<eos> A matchbook from a restaurant.<eos> I'll wake Sabine and go with you.
It's all gonna be okay.<eos> Because I will never give up.<eos> So we're gonna go back to the beginning, And we're gonna try again.<eos> And we're gonna keep trying until you and I are safe.<eos> And together.<eos> You understand?<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> Forever if we have to.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What did they do to you?
- What are you looking for?<eos> - Your fucking money.<eos> Look, I... I have no idea what you're talking about, all right?<eos> There must be fucking money in here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Hey.<eos> Look. Maybe I can pay you some other way, yeah?<eos> Get the fuck off me, man!<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Mm. So... how was the gym?<eos> It was fine.<eos> Wh-what do you mean, fine?<eos> Wh-what happened?<eos> He's just...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Michael. - Such a player!<eos> With his muscles and his flirting.<eos> He was flirting with you?

A guilty man trying to raise money to skip town.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I...<eos> I got a look inside his apartment.<eos> He hasn't packed any bags.<eos> Doesn't look like he's taking off anytime soon.<eos> Trying to raise a bunch of cash when your girlfriend is missing?<eos> There's another possibility.<eos> Braydon.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Then, I can forgive you.<eos> Why?<eos> As it hurts your pride, you'd hate to?<eos> Then why not get lost?<eos> Dad, get Lawyer Choi.<eos> To put this brat behind bars.<eos> Hey. It won't kill you, just kneel down.<eos> I...<eos> All this time,<eos> towards you...
Maybe.<eos> Mark is dead.<eos> Now please leave.<eos> Okay, now, wait a minute.<eos> Y-You said yourself, you never saw him die.<eos> So, who knows,<eos> So, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, let's do it.<eos> Tandy, I'm not going to Seattle with you.
What possible reason do you have for taking me to Seattle?<eos> Mark is not gonna be there!<eos> Well, he may not be there now, but what if he comes back in the future?<eos> I mean, he needs to know where we are, and that is why we're gonna leave him a note with our address.<eos> Mark is dead, Tandy!<eos> Well, my brother was dead, too.<eos> He was up in space.<eos> Not Tokyo, but friggin' outer space.<eos> And then somehow, my dead brother managed to make it to Earth and find me in Malibu, alive.<eos> Now, if a miracle could happen for me, why can't it happen for you?
If you're gonna be the baby's grandmother, then I need to be your daughter.<eos> Duh.<eos> Don't you think adoption papers are a little bit unnecessary?<eos> I would agree with you 100% on opposite day.<eos> These are very necessary.<eos> Well, I happen to think it's very necessary for me to not sign them.<eos> Gail!<eos> Why are you trying to ruin my life?<eos> Carol, do you really not see how nutty this all is?<eos> Hey, don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you!
Hey, JJ.<eos> Thanks for coming tonight.<eos> You know, I kind of hate you right now.<eos> I am still sore from earlier.<eos> That's the first workout I've done since my accident.<eos> I guess I'm not in JJ shape.<eos> Well, um, good night.<eos> "Wait." Uh...<eos> "I want to show you 'Rocky.'"<eos> I'd love to see "Rocky" with you.
Kenneth!<eos> Jimmy and I were just talking. We've decided to stay home for Thanksgiving.<eos> As you're part of the family now, we'd love for you to join.<eos> And since it's tomorrow, you get to act generous knowing I already have plans and won't come.<eos> No.<eos> Great.<eos> I don't have plans. I'd love to come.<eos> You don't have plans?<eos> !<eos> What is wrong with you?
Uh, bad guys.<eos> Got to go.<eos> But, uh... with what?<eos> Your car's totaled.<eos> What is wrong with him?<eos> The guy's spraying machine gun fire, he just drives right into it.<eos> Sometimes he does that.<eos> He saved my life.<eos> Sometimes he does that, too.<eos> So never, not once did the cartel contact you - or your parents?
Caldera's not talking.<eos> Least we got him for the murder.<eos> I see the paramedics released you.<eos> Eh, well, I told 'em that my only permanent injury was my ability to do paperwork and they let me go.<eos> Right.<eos> Where's Murtaugh?<eos> Sent him home.<eos> He's got seven more hours of alone time before everyone returns, so didn't want to hear about the bender that never was.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, it has been an experience working with you.
What an idiot!<eos> Shit, shit, shit...<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> I'm really tired. No!<eos> Everyone loves you here.<eos> I love everyone.<eos> But I need to get home.<eos> I'm up early tomorrow. OK. I'll go with you.
- No.<eos> No, look... - We're done here.<eos> - This is a real thing.<eos> It is going to happen again, and this time, it's gonna be your fault!<eos> Karl said it'll happen again.<eos> Maybe he meant Amanda's abduction.<eos> It still says she's taken after midnight.<eos> You really think this guy can predict something that happens in 1996?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm talking to you, aren't I?
She said that?<eos> Yeah. She thinks all this is gonna mess you up.<eos> Maybe it did.<eos> Could explain why I sleep around.<eos> - Kidding.<eos> - Very funny.<eos> Between you and me, your mom's a worrier. Make it so much easier if I could just tell her that you turn out okay, you know?<eos> Just okay?<eos> Seriously, Raim.<eos> I'm proud of you, kiddo.
Hey, man, uh, I was way out of line earlier.<eos> - You know, who am I to judge, right?<eos> - Nah, man. You were right.<eos> - I'm an ass.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> Well, come on. Let's get something to eat. Oh, yeah, I would.<eos> I got to... I got to watch the house tonight.<eos> - All right, bro. - All right, man.<eos> - Next time.<eos> - All right, I'll holler at you.
So take shifts as much as you can.<eos> Well, it's... it's okay. You know, I get it.<eos> No, I actually do.<eos> I feel safer when it's you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then I will.<eos> I hate that I'm scared.<eos> But I am.<eos> It's okay. All right?<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
Well, it's... it's okay. You know, I get it.<eos> No, I actually do.<eos> I feel safer when it's you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then I will.<eos> I hate that I'm scared.<eos> But I am.<eos> It's okay. All right?<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.<eos> To you or Raimes.
You stop that.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You know what?<eos> What is going on?<eos> Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment's been finished, but then you just said it's not, so now I'm all confused.<eos> Penny was just covering for me.<eos> My place has been ready for two weeks.<eos> How could you lie to me?<eos> Uh, she's enjoyed living with you.
I had to survive.<eos> I needed money.<eos> And I knew where Ricky kept his stash.<eos> This guy, Ricky's buddy, offered to buy me out.<eos> I have enough to get out of New York, start a new life.<eos> Like you told me to.<eos> These other guys showed up.<eos> And I ran.<eos> Ricky's buddy dead in an alley.<eos> Who were these guys that came after you?
Ricky's buddy dead in an alley.<eos> Who were these guys that came after you?<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> - Was it Stan's guys, huh?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you think I'm crazy?<eos> - I'm trying to help you here!<eos> Do you think I'm crazy?<eos> You think I don't have ears?<eos> I heard what happened to you.
That was promise enough.<eos> And don't tell me what you were feeling was an act when we were together.<eos> Because that... maybe only that... wasn't a lie.<eos> I...<eos> I would never disrespect what we had, but I told you months ago we did what we did and it's over now.<eos> Except I'm still there... Wondering what was real and what wasn't.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna help you.<eos> But I can't be with you.
Excellent tea.<eos> Outstanding, really.<eos> If she had one wish as a child, it was to have a sister.<eos> So when Catalina Maria Mora showed up out of the blue, well, it didn't feel like the bomb that it was.<eos> It felt like that wish come true.<eos> What are you... doing here?<eos> _<eos> The craziest thing:<eos> I was heading back from Venezuela and I had an unscheduled layover in Miami.<eos> And I just met you, and I don't know, it felt like a sign.
If you want a cat, get a cat!<eos> What's there to discuss?<eos> Well, Jane's more of the planning type.<eos> Ah. Well, that's never been my strong suit.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, so. Full confession:<eos> this visit isn't totally unmotivated.<eos> My Abuela knows we connected and wanted to see if we could help them fix things.<eos> Oh. Um... my grandma asked me to stay out of it.<eos> But I want to hang out with you.
You've been served.<eos> What?<eos> You're suing me for sexual harassment?<eos> You-You know that's not true.<eos> Your word against mine.<eos> - Please keep away.<eos> - Are you...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - You've created a hostile work environment.<eos> I don't feel safe around you.
But he's also reminded that he...<eos> Wants another child.<eos> Wants to stop the Bay of Pigs.<eos> So, when he sees her kissing that troll, he takes it as a sign.<eos> To stick to his initial mission.<eos> I like it. Yeah,<eos> I'll jump back into the script and make those changes.<eos> Also jumping back in...<eos> Hey-hey, you're looking better.<eos> Oh, let's hope the doctor agrees with you.

That really inspired me.<eos> Hey, well, your love for Mark inspires me to be a better husband to Carol.<eos> So take that and put it in your butt.<eos> Literally.<eos> I think you meant metaphorically.<eos> Yes. "Metorically." Sorry.<eos> Close enough.<eos> And you're close enough for a little hug.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Proud of you, bud.
You said she wrote that she wanted to kill him.<eos> The diary is missing.<eos> Dana can't find it.<eos> Maya's roommates are headed over.<eos> Separate them, okay?<eos> Compare their stories.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> Hey, Julia, what's up?<eos> Maya asked me to sit in on her meeting,<eos> - but I wanted to check with you first.
It's a gift from a friend.<eos> Vocare Pulvere.<eos> Ceremony of ash.<eos> _<eos> What are their names, Father Bennett?<eos> We need to find Bennett... fast.<eos> Jim.<eos> I'm going to make a call to your boss, and I'm going to see how he feels about the whole "priests committing adultery" thing.<eos> The Devil in My Daughter.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?
- You told me how to get to a place called... St. Aquinas.<eos> God... spoke through you, Henry.<eos> Father... does this mean anything to you?<eos> - Uh, the number 162?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, ever since I woke up from the accident, I've had this, uh... - low-frequency sound in my head.<eos> It's like being in a restaurant, and... everyone is yammering away in the background.<eos> Except sometimes, sometimes it feels like there's a pattern.<eos> Like, all at once, all those people start saying the exact same thing at the exact same time.<eos> Are they talking to you right now?
But it's fine.<eos> I just have to find a new gym.<eos> Oh, you can come with me to mine... I'll pick you up after work, okay?<eos> Good.<eos> Now back to my thing.<eos> I'm ready!<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> To start dating again.<eos> - That's great.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
- I think that I'll do it. - Ha, ha!<eos> Okay, guys. Let's see what you're working with.<eos> I actually just meant show me a portfolio but... that'll do.<eos> Where's my mudslide?<eos> - Who are these?<eos> - My new... clients.<eos> Honey, I think I'm gonna start managing models.<eos> Are you rea... that's a... that's amazing.<eos> Congratulations, Cece. I think you'd be really great at that.<eos> - I'm proud of you.
Hold them here. The factory is on full lockdown.<eos> Ryder. Get word to Hera.

Chopper. Get their attention.<eos> Look out!<eos> Droid! What is the matter with you?
So, they can't leave the cave, which means I just have to get Kanan and Sabine outside.<eos> How hard can that be?<eos> (SINISTER VOICE) You're unwise to reenter our sanctum.<eos> That doesn't belong to you.<eos> Then take it from me, Jedi!<eos> No!

Other than the lobby area, there's no security cameras.<eos> It's the kind of place that prides itself on its anonymity.<eos> No-tell motel.<eos> Was he a guest?<eos> As far as we could tell, no.<eos> He hadn't checked in.<eos> But who knows?<eos> He may have been on his way to the front desk when the shooter approached him.<eos> Wrists were bound.<eos> Zip tie in the bin behind you.
Ooh, you should see me do origami.<eos> Oh, do you know how to do a frog?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - Can you do a swan?<eos> - No.<eos> - Can you do a crane?<eos> - What's a crane?

But finally, their luck is in.<eos> The dolphin is still there.<eos> For the first time, they have a chance to film from the water and the air, and finally discover what this elusive animal is really doing.<eos> They were in the boat and they were looking around and going,<eos> "Yeah, there are some bubbles."<eos> We were flying with the drone and we could see dolphins, and while they thought they could only see one dolphin, we saw five.<eos> And they had no idea.<eos> The crew are surprised to find these dolphins aren't solitary, but come together to hunt as a team.<eos> You're starting to see stuff with the drone that you suddenly go,<eos> "I thought there was one dolphin there," and then you count that there are five and then you're looking in one place and they're all behind you, laughing at you.
I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part:<eos> I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.<eos> Who has a favorite font?<eos> The Santiagos do.<eos> All of them.<eos> Oh, here he comes.<eos> Gotta go, bye.<eos> Hey, Mr. Santiago.<eos> I am Jake Peralta, Amy's boyfriend.<eos> Jake, nice to finally meet you.
Can you...<eos> No.<eos> No other route.<eos> Will you give us safe passage along the frankish coast, so we may sail unmolested?<eos> No.<eos> Only if you allow me to come with you.<eos> Come on, donkey.<eos> What if we're walking in the wrong direction?<eos> Then we'll turn around and walk the other way.<eos> What is it about you?
These are my people.<eos> We made it.<eos> Once we get inside, we will be separated.<eos> If you are smart, you will not be hurt.<eos> When I can, I will find you.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> I think you brought me here for a reason.<eos> No matter what they do to me, you have to act like a cripple,<eos> and then they won't feel threatened by you.<eos> And what are they going to do to you?
There's somebody out here who wants to meet you.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Say hello to everybody's little friend-- remote control Stephen Hawking!<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> I found him in an old box.<eos> Why would you buy it?<eos> I didn't buy it.<eos> I made it.<eos> Last question.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I dare you.<eos> I have no problem calling him.<eos> Fine, then do it.<eos> Fine, I will.<eos> While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.<eos> What's this button do?<eos> Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.<eos> You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.<eos> I laughed because the guy was Leonard.<eos> I admire you, Leonard.
This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions.<eos> I will cast you far away.<eos> Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it.<eos> Let it fly.<eos> Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...<eos> What happened?<eos> I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot!<eos> Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.<eos> Wha--?<eos> And what happened to you?
Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.<eos> Wha--?<eos> And what happened to you?<eos> Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It's fine.<eos> You know, it's one thing to be envious, but now you're injuring yourself.<eos> It has to stop.<eos> Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.<eos> You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life.<eos> Y-You've got love, you're in good health, you've got a roof over your head.<eos> Yeah, but you've got all those things, and no one's lining up to be you.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Multiple tours in Afghanistan and harrowing years at the FBI, yet you still flee conflict when it comes to Alex.<eos> Do we really have to keep this from her?<eos> Until you're told otherwise, your recruitment by the AIC must stay between us.<eos> Anything new on that brick of yours?<eos> Not since I woke up next to it.<eos> Maybe I failed some test without knowing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They will contact you.
Everyone at Vauxhall Cross hopes your time at The Farm is getting us what we need.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I finished packing for you.<eos> You're going home.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I wrote you a cover.<eos> It's a good one, too.<eos> You want to force me to spend Thanksgiving with my family and then tell them to go to hell?<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> It never is with you, Lydia.
But the thing is, that's almost worse, because when it happened, I was forced to watch it and be completely paralyzed.<eos> That is a guilt that eats away at you.<eos> You want to know why I have a gun?<eos> So I never feel paralyzed again.<eos> So I can step in and do something.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> That... that's all you have to say?<eos> "Okay"?<eos> Look, if... if this is just sex, I get it.<eos> That... that's fun, you're fun, but I can have fun with anyone, and so can you.
Okay, well, Alex Parrish will give us intel.<eos> Ryan Booth, too.<eos> Whether they're Agency or Bureau, it can only help.<eos> Now, I have been working on Dayana Mampasi, but she's a bit of a slow burn.<eos> You're leaving someone out.<eos> Am I?<eos> Sebastian Chen.<eos> Are you spying on me?<eos> If we don't spy on our spies, we'd never know anything at all.<eos> Does your father spy on you?
Answers.<eos> Real ones.<eos> I hope they make you happy.<eos> You're wondering if it checks out, it does.<eos> You're not at the center of any conspiracies.<eos> You just got burned because of something you did.<eos> Remember Helen Sharp?<eos> She was an asset.<eos> You failed to protect her, and after she was killed, your name was leaked.<eos> The Agency agreed that that mistake was endemic of too many others made by you.
It can only be you and me.<eos> You and me?<eos> I am taking kattegat back.<eos> Aslaug isn't fit to be queen.<eos> Ubbe and sigurd, are you going to kill them, too?<eos> Enough!<eos> These are my people.<eos> We made it.<eos> No matter what they do to me, you have to act like a cripple, and then they won't feel threatened by you.<eos> And what are they going to do to you?
But you...<eos> You have to kill me.<eos> Must we talk of death?<eos> Death has been uppermost on my mind for a long time.<eos> You vikings are incorrigible.<eos> You emerge from the womb with only one thing on your mind...<eos> How to die!<eos> What of all the things in between?<eos> Are you talking about women?<eos> We have a lot to talk about, you and I.
Athelstan...<eos> Was a man of god.<eos> And now he is dead.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Floki killed him.<eos> So your gods killed him.<eos> No, floki killed him out of jealousy.<eos> Because I loved athelstan more than him.<eos> I was jealous, too.<eos> When he chose to go back with you.
Previously on Vikings...<eos> Seize him!<eos> Why have you taken so long to return?<eos> It was part of a larger, bolder strategy.<eos> I thought you wanted to find some way that our peoples could mutually benefit.<eos> You thought killing all of my people was mutually beneficial?<eos> Mea culpa.<eos> You have to kill me.<eos> My sons know that I have come to Wessex to see you.
They'll know everything very soon.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> He'll be here any second.<eos> Tell him I've gone to West Point.<eos> I have to hurry.<eos> - We have to come with you.
Yes, "some" being hundreds of hours of interrogations.<eos> Hope you didn't have any evening plans.<eos> This is top priority.<eos> Work comes first.<eos> That's the right answer.<eos> Dinner's on me.<eos> Look, it's, MI6 Officer<eos> Clayton Reeves.<eos> Boy, am I happy to see you.<eos> What's with you?
I was once in a similar situation as you.<eos> And when I thought all hope was lost, it was Agent Bishop and NCIS who stood by me.<eos> I am alive because of them.<eos> Trust only works when it goes both ways.<eos> When I met Dawar Mahdavi, I didn't know who he really was or the terrible things he had done.<eos> We had only spoken to each other in passing at our mosque.<eos> My life ended because of a man I hardly knew.<eos> I told the truth, and no one would believe me.<eos> No one except for Derrick.<eos> We can't change what happened to you, Amir, but we are gonna finish what Commander Reza started.
I mean, last time, Louise hijacked the interview, and... and Julia let her do it.<eos> How do we know that won't happen again?<eos> Let me handle that.<eos> You want me to put Dana Hartman back on the air?<eos> Yes, I do, for a good reason.<eos> The last time I saw Dana, she told me to stay away.<eos> And even if I said yes, how in the world would you convince her to come back on the show?<eos> Why would she ever trust me again after that sex tape?<eos> Good question.<eos> She's meeting you at noon for lunch.
Dangerous?<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> What are you worried about dangerous?<eos> You ride around all day with Martin Riggs.<eos> Look, I already experienced my adventure with a little thing called open-heart surgery.<eos> Roger, you were the one who told me climbing Kilimanjaro was your dream.<eos> When did I say that was my dream?<eos> On our fourth date.<eos> Oh, our fourth date.<eos> Baby, I hadn't slept with you yet.
- Yeah, on that... - Oh...<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Um... hey, little man, this nice lady here is gonna take you back to the office and ask you a few questions.<eos> Hey, Ethan, would you rather ride with Detective Riggs?<eos> No, why would he want to ride with me?<eos> You have a siren?<eos> Yeah, I got a siren.<eos> And flashing lights?<eos> Yeah, those, too.<eos> Then I'll go with you.
Reminds me of my bully from high school.<eos> I wonder what she's doing now.<eos> I can't believe you got to get up in public and give an award to that fool.<eos> Oh, don't worry, I'll buy a table and we'll all be there to support you, right, guys?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Sounds fun.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> - I thought he was talking to me.<eos> - He was asking you.
Are we 100% sure he doesn't sometimes go by "Dick"?<eos> Oh, no, not the whiteboard.<eos> Last time, he tried to teach me about Congress.<eos> Thank you, Dani, for helping me understand my current emotional state and showing me a path to recovery.<eos> The five stages of grief were first defined by noted psychiatrist Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.<eos> That chimp lady?<eos> I am clearly grieving the death of my relationship with Emily.<eos> But the fact that I can make that statement - _ - shows that I am through the first stage.<eos> So long, denial!<eos> - _ - I am no longer in you.
Dinner and a show.<eos> Good evening.<eos> And thank you for joining us as we honor our Humanitarian of the Year, Rich Eisen.<eos> It is now my pleasure to introduce the man who will introduce "the man"...<eos> You can't give your insult speech!<eos> It's a trap!<eos> What do you mean?<eos> !<eos> Eisen made a weird comment to me, so I snuck a look at his speech.<eos> He's not going to insult you, he's going to say glowing things about you!
I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> I'm such a fool.<eos> No, you were just trying to take a shortcut through your pain.<eos> I mean, I wish you could, but it doesn't work that way.<eos> You got your heart broken, it's going to take some time.<eos> You're right.<eos> And listen, I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> I saw you were struggling, but I got so caught up in the Eisen thing that I didn't help you.<eos> So for however long it takes, I am going to get you through this.
Your brother's going to seduce you.<eos> Really?<eos> You're not gonna resist that at all?<eos> - It's nice to feel wanted. - Mm.<eos> JJ, your date is here.<eos> Oh, you look nice!<eos> "Thanks.<eos> You look nice, too."<eos> Oh, confident!<eos> Ah, so she has to be right next to you.
Thanks, Teddy.<eos> Unlike you, Teddy gets it.<eos> More drinking... less thinking.<eos> Yes, sure.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Get drunk.<eos> Avoid everything.<eos> Now that sounds like the kind of guy I would love to live with.<eos> So I suppose you're saying you wish you'd chosen someone like Teddy to be your roommate instead of me.<eos> Well, I didn't exactly choose you.
Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.<eos> Why can't there be four wheels?<eos> Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?<eos> Look-Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're hungry you can eat your takeout; nobody touched it.<eos> I think I'm gonna go for a run.<eos> You want to come?<eos> No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming,<eos> "Watch out, he's right behind you."
Well, I-I assume we're gonna have to make our way to that meat grinder, eventually.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, it's been a while since we talked about your recovery.<eos> I mean, we used to talk about it all the time, and now it's just something you do.<eos> Well, we used to talk about it all the time because you were my sober companion.<eos> And now we're partners in the consulting detective concern.<eos> We're also friends.<eos> It wouldn't be so weird if we checked in with each other once in a while.<eos> My recovery's part of my routine.<eos> I don't discuss it with you any more than I discuss my... inhalations.
Sure.<eos> Something the matter?<eos> I was being followed.<eos> A big dude.<eos> I lost him, but I don't...<eos> Shinwell, I'd like you to meet my friend Luc.<eos> Luc, voici Shinwell.<eos> Luc, Merci pour ton excellent travail et ГЎ trГ©s bientГґt.<eos> You had me tailed this morning?<eos> Actually, he's been following you since last night.
But I've never been there.<eos> How can I see that?<eos> A genetic birth transfers genes.<eos> A sensate birth transfers sense experience and memory.<eos> You are Angelica's children, so parts of her consciousness still echo in you.<eos> We weren't her first cluster?<eos> No.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The same thing that's happened to me.<eos> And that in all probability is going to happen to you.
It's almost November.<eos> You know they're watching them.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> No.<eos> Nomi said it would be fine if you threw it out right after.<eos> He wouldn't be able to understand.<eos> I'm sure everyone in Kibera would have the same idea.<eos> I know I've done things to warrant your skepticism, Capheus.<eos> But do you not believe a man can change?<eos> I've watched you.
Truly.<eos> Mama, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> You have nothing to apologize for.<eos> Come here, my baby penguin.<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> I know you could have denied it all, like so many others.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> And I have never been prouder of you.
Have a great night.<eos> Zakia.<eos> Uh... what?<eos> My name is Zakia.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Hernando.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Big moment coming up.<eos> It's El Caido.<eos> You said he would come for you.
Early midnight.<eos> We play tomorrow at the Musikverein with the Vienna Philharmonic.<eos> Oh, I wish you could be there.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You sure everything's okay, Riles?<eos> I'm good, Papa.<eos> You could never lie to me.<eos> It's difficult, but I believe it'll work out.<eos> This will help a lot.<eos> I know you can't tell me what you're going through... but there's a lot of talk back home.
London.<eos> - We were right.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> Please, no more emergencies.<eos> Nomi, find this guy.<eos> Corporate letterhead: "I.F.G.F."<eos> Got it.<eos> I've had it with you crying wolf every time your project comes under scrutiny.<eos> Graduation ring, Yale insignia.<eos> What is wrong with you, man?
Richard Wilson Croome.<eos> I'm compromised.<eos> Your last breach of protocol is still costing us millions of dollars in Iceland.<eos> I'm compromised. I...<eos> I have to go.<eos> - Gibbons!<eos> - I have to go!<eos> Gibbons!<eos> You think you're hunting us?<eos> We're coming for you.
Is that so? The passport I made... and the accommodations I prepared in Nice... as well as keeping me beside Deok Hwa... I believe you gave me such a job for me to recognize on my own.<eos> Have you... ever talked about that man to anyone else?<eos> - Actually, it's him who picked you.<eos> He made a child without a dream or money... take the college entrance exam. He gave that child a dream... and enrolled him in a university.<eos> Who do you think that faceless benefactor is?<eos> Remember it.<eos> His real name, Kim Shin, stands for "to believe".<eos> Hey, Mister. It was you who made the super moon and the fog, right?<eos> Why are you causing a mess to find a high school girl?<eos> I'm scared NASA will come and take you away.
If that's what you need, I will.<eos> I love you.<eos> So... did you love me?<eos> No?<eos> Did you not even love me?<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> I'm so afraid. That's why I want you to... keep saying you need me.<eos> I want you to ask me to do even that.<eos> I want some sort of an excuse that will... double as your permission.<eos> With that excuse, I wish I could go on living. With you.
Now!<eos> Now, kid!<eos> The portal.<eos> It's closing!<eos> No.<eos> You're stronger than he is.<eos> From light comes darkness... and from darkness... light.<eos> Show me your eyes.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Hurry!<eos> Focus fire on the boilers.<eos> Below the chimney.<eos> Pull away!<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> I need you to scream for me.<eos> Like a damsel?<eos> No matter.<eos> He's Tarzan, you're Jane.<eos> He'll come for you.
But it is where they are building the railroad.<eos> We can ride it part of the way.<eos> Good.<eos> John?<eos> John?<eos> John!<eos> Fine!<eos> I'm still coming with you.<eos> You can't keep up.<eos> I might not be able to keep up with Tarzan, but I sure as hell can keep up with you.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Would that make you feel better, honey?<eos> I'm not sleeping up there until it's gone.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Are you nice?<eos> How did you get there?<eos> Did you cry?<eos> Help you how?<eos> But I can't see you.<eos> Who else is there with you?
That's actually not a bad idea.<eos> I'm fairly certain... Maddy is able to hear us a lot better than we can hear her.<eos> So this equipment is going to filter out all the interference... so that we'll be better able to communicate with her.<eos> How do we start?<eos> You just call out to her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maddy?<eos> Madison, it's Mommy.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Madison, we wanna talk to you.
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Keep on trying, okay?<eos> Because we are right here.<eos> You're so close!<eos> Mommy?<eos> Mommy?<eos> Daddy, is that you?<eos> No, Daddy's right here, honey.<eos> There's somebody with her!<eos> Who's with you, baby?
Because we are right here.<eos> You're so close!<eos> Mommy?<eos> Mommy?<eos> Daddy, is that you?<eos> No, Daddy's right here, honey.<eos> There's somebody with her!<eos> Who's with you, baby?<eos> - Daddy's right here.<eos> - Who is with you?
Straight into the arms of academia.<eos> Safe, stable academia.<eos> - Still misses me though.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> You do, a little.<eos> No, not even a little bit.<eos> She forgets I can sense these things.<eos> I have special powers, you know.<eos> They're not that special.<eos> You all right?
- No, I am.<eos> - David, Moshe, you and me.<eos> - What if?<eos> Look at it this way:<eos> Me, and then David, then Moses, and then you.<eos> You are very funny, you know.<eos> Give me your sandwich.<eos> Give me your sandwich.<eos> I'll be back in fifteen minutes.<eos> Can I go with you?
Now was wandering naked through the woods.<eos> Perhaps he is mad now and howling in the thicket like a fox.<eos> And surel, everyone who has a chance encounter in the woods with the fox-man at night the horror<eos> - All the hair on your head become white.<eos> - I'm sorry, it's supposed to mean?<eos> Allegory?<eos> Superstition?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't be late to school and work, guys.<eos> What happened to you?
Davis.<eos> Where are we with the Lightyear deal?<eos> The banks won't budge, you know.<eos> They're claiming regulations as an excuse.<eos> Same thing they did with Haskell Athletic.<eos> Yeah, yeah...<eos> What, they want more cushion?<eos> Yup. 5%.<eos> All right, very good.<eos> Is my daughter with you?
Have a good one!<eos> Who the...<eos> Hi.<eos> You've reached Davis Mitchell.<eos> I'm unavailable at the moment, so please leave a message.<eos> If you're looking for Julia,<eos> I regret to inform you that she isn't with us anymore, which makes her also unavailable.<eos> Davis, you've taken things too far.<eos> I am deeply concerned with your well-being.<eos> I'm trying to reach out to you, I'm trying to help, but you refuse!
Oh, man, that don't look good at all.<eos> No, it don't.<eos> You dumbass...<eos> Oh, god damn that fuckin' hurt!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Shit, yeah!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Let's go. Get outta here.<eos> Dear Chris...<eos> I wish I could talk to you.
Decorated two years ahead of schedule.<eos> General Dixon's favorite.<eos> Meet your watchdog.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Captain Allison Ng, sir.<eos> I know you have a meeting.<eos> I'll take us on a flyby of the island.<eos> I'd like to take you through how this is gonna work.<eos> Hey!<eos> I refuse to talk to you.
Plaything of billionaires, in bed with the military.<eos> I just need a little help.<eos> This is Captain Ng.<eos> - Aloha, Captain Ng.<eos> - Aloha.<eos> Heard you blew up in Afghanistan.<eos> You looked better when you were younger.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - So pale now.<eos> Keith Richards looks like a teenager next to you.
And here we go.<eos> Slice up.<eos> Straight up.<eos> And drop.<eos> That's good.<eos> - I am gonna have that beer.<eos> In answer to your question, Woody doesn't speak.<eos> But you know what?<eos> He's a great dad.<eos> I don't think I'm ready to talk to you like a girlfriend... so just stop me before I talk to you like a girlfriend.
You loving the hat?<eos> I feel silly.<eos> Well, you wear silly well.<eos> I know what you know.<eos> What?<eos> Stop with the games.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I got personal with you.<eos> I never get personal.<eos> - I had fun with you.
- How are you doing?<eos> - I spoke to the chief surgeon.<eos> He said the surgery was a success.<eos> - Good.<eos> - He said the bullet went clean through.<eos> I was hoping you would consider a reinstatement.<eos> As Joe said, we'd make a hell of a team.<eos> Oh no, I want a quiet life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Joe would be proud of you.
There is a switch, and I will find it.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> Why did you not tell Kyle Reese the truth?<eos> I will tell him.<eos> Just not yet, okay?<eos> Did you mate?<eos> Can you just not say the word "mate" to me again, like, ever?<eos> That is a meaningless gesture.<eos> Why hold on to someone when you know you must let them go?<eos> What about you?
I have it on very good authority that Gennaro Angiulo is planning to have you murdered.<eos> Is that so?<eos> And how does he plan to achieve that?<eos> That's the kind of information that my side gets.<eos> And that's the kind of information that we can provide.<eos> John, do you know what I do to rats?<eos> It ain't rattin', Jimmy.<eos> It's an alliance.<eos> An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?<eos> No, no, between you and me.
Nothing much.<eos> The usual.<eos> What is the fucking usual?<eos> I don't know the usual.<eos> What's the fucking usual?<eos> You know.<eos> Drugs are bad.<eos> Prostitution's illegal. Shit like that.<eos> And did Stevie and I figure into this conversation at all?<eos> They asked if I was involved with you.
Where's Dike?<eos> And we who call ourselves men will stay and protect our town.<eos> Who is going to take care of the property we are leaving behind?<eos> Dad, where's Dike?<eos> They fled!<eos> Let me go, it's my duty.<eos> We will be crushed between the rebels and the army!<eos> It is so bad!<eos> We've already decided what to do with the children.<eos> They will go with you.
No space.<eos> Please, please, I am the Section Chief.<eos> This is my family.<eos> There must be space.<eos> No space.<eos> This one woman and this small-small children.<eos> - And the little boy?<eos> - Yes, him, too.<eos> Where are you thinking this woman and child would be fitted?<eos> They're gonna be sitting in the front with you.
Agu.<eos> Agu?<eos> I don't want that I call you and you just stand there.<eos> Agu?<eos> Come here, I'll give you some brown-brown.<eos> It'll cure everything for you, eh.<eos> Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.<eos> Hmm?<eos> My boy, what is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Strika.<eos> Strika!<eos> Strika!<eos> Strika!<eos> Stand up and let's go!<eos> We are going.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Strika!<eos> Stand up and let's go!<eos> What is wrong with you?
I'll give you a hand.<eos> Here, you gotta get up.<eos> No, there's no point.<eos> You hear me?<eos> No, we're going home.<eos> We're going home. There's no point.<eos> Just go.<eos> God damn it, Matthew.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Well, I'll send a boat for you the minute we get back.
Heirlooms. The real thing.<eos> - I plant one every chance I get.<eos> - Where?<eos> So far, nothing's took.<eos> Earth's too sour.<eos> - So many different kinds.<eos> - Trees, flowers, fruit.<eos> Back then, everyone had their fill.<eos> Back then, there was no need to snap anybody.<eos> Can I talk to you?
I can't begin to imagine what you are going through.<eos> He said he'll fix it.<eos> Where is Reed?<eos> Reed's gone, and your friend isn't coming back.<eos> Look. I know you're scared.<eos> You should be.<eos> But we can help you.<eos> You want to find a cure?<eos> We have resources here, the best in the world.<eos> We're analyzing what happened to you.
Reed is back.<eos> We're closer than we've ever been before.<eos> Closer to what?<eos> Our old lives.<eos> - Oh, you mean your life.<eos> - No, son.<eos> You always said I had the potential to do something important.<eos> Who's to say this isn't it?<eos> Sometimes things just happen for a reason.<eos> Johnny you have no idea what they are planning to do to you.
- love each other very much...<eos> - I have to piss.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Go with him, please, and keep an eye on him.<eos> - Okay. - Thank you.<eos> Look at that.<eos> The boys are bonding already.<eos> Isn't this the best?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you remember, back when you were just getting your pilot's license... and you and I would sit there... and we'd talk about all those, like, overseas trips we would take and stuff?
Go with him, please, and keep an eye on him.<eos> - Okay. - Thank you.<eos> Look at that.<eos> The boys are bonding already.<eos> Isn't this the best?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you remember, back when you were just getting your pilot's license... and you and I would sit there... and we'd talk about all those, like, overseas trips we would take and stuff?<eos> Yeah, of course that's when I thought I was gonna fly for one of the big guys.<eos> I know it's not the most glamorous airline, but Econo Air... it's been pretty good to us.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, right here with you and the boys, this is paradise.
That's when the national news called. Now, between us... it's looking good.<eos> Ain't it, honey?<eos> Course none of that would've been possible without my sugar mama here... working day and night to put me through meteorology school.<eos> I liked working, baby. I didn't mind it one bit.<eos> Well, you never have to do it again, darling.<eos> But it kind of gave me purpose.<eos> Nope, never again.<eos> That is a promise.<eos> Wow, Uncle Stone, I may not agree with your politics... - but that doesn't mean I don't admire you.<eos> - Well, thank you. But the man you should admire the most is sitting right next to you.
- I think I'm done.<eos> You can really see all the stars out here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what do you feel like doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Can I give you a rim job?<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
- Who is that?<eos> - My stupid little brother.<eos> I thought you said he was your big brother.<eos> - I... Damn it!<eos> - Dingus.<eos> - Why do you take that from him?<eos> - Am I supposed to hit him back?<eos> - He's a little kid.<eos> - He's a little shit.<eos> - You don't have to let him push you around.
What do I get?<eos> Kids who don't wanna be with me, and a wife who's miserable.<eos> - Russ...<eos> - Oh, come on, Debbie.<eos> You know it's true.<eos> You think you settled for me. You think I'm a loser regional pilot.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> I get offers from international carriers all the time... and I turn them down.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't wanna be away from you and the kids that long.
Because, in the end, if Sara does choose Dusty over you, he has to be stepdad to your baby.<eos> How beautiful is that?<eos> Come on, five it.<eos> No.<eos> You know, it feels strange to high-five over the custody of my unborn child.<eos> I've been on Dusty's team.<eos> I'm trying to jump over to the winning team Brad.<eos> - Get on this.<eos> - I'd really rather not.<eos> I'm trying to share a moment with you here.
They call me Bubble Boy.<eos> A's, zero. B's, zero.<eos> BB's, zero. BBB's, zero.<eos> And then that happens.<eos> What is that?<eos> That's America's housing market.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fuckin' A, Jared.<eos> Shut your fucking mouth.<eos> ...hang out with you.
Keepers.<eos> They're from the Diorite System, but they're genetically repurposed to act as Monitors and watchdogs.<eos> And they're trying to kill me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why me?<eos> Please.<eos> This has to be a mistake.<eos> These people don't make those kind of mistakes.<eos> What if I say no?<eos> What if I don't go with you? What if I go home?
Hey!<eos> What is going on here?<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Uh, thank you.<eos> I'll go to town to pick up some groceries for dinner.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - I'm fine, Dad.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> Let's have a look at you.
-it's very rare.<eos> Probably lowered the value quite a bit.<eos> Not to me.<eos> You reconsider, you can still keep the pen.<eos> I think you'll like my successor.<eos> I'm leaving you in more modern hands.<eos> What about the vow you took?<eos> I vowed to face death at your side.<eos> Not to work until I keel over.<eos> Thirty-five Dolans have come before you.
I know I haven't lived as long and rich a life as you, but I do know that there is more to it than a parade of stewardesses marching to the dulcet tones of Moonlight Sonata.<eos> Now what in the world do you know about stewardesses anyway?<eos> I wasn't born a priest.<eos> Let's do some work.<eos> I know you think it's dull, but let's start at the beginning.<eos> It goes without saying, but you've served with great distinction.<eos> If I may, when I meet Kaulder tomorrow, I should play it cool, right?<eos> No coffee until after the ritual.<eos> Don't worry about your style.<eos> He'll take the piss out of you anyway.
You're gonna get who did this, right?<eos> I'll handle Belial.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't know where else to get the stuff that we need.<eos> There is one place.<eos> But it's old money, old magic, and dangerous.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Kaulder?<eos> Sonya.<eos> Danique's been so busy, I'm surprised that she agreed to see you.
Alright, that's not fair.<eos> How you feelin'?<eos> Well, time's a healer.<eos> It's amazing what a difference a week makes, right?<eos> There's a lot going on over there.<eos> Yeah, my dad's on the, uh... romance warpath.<eos> Remodeling the master suite for my mom.<eos> What's goin' on with the gardener? Has he said anything? He's right there.<eos> No.<eos> Well, he's definitely checking' you out.
Do as he says.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Not very good at this whole subtlety thing, are you?<eos> That man stole my father's watch.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be a Russian architect?<eos> Da, but a Russian architect would fight.<eos> Russian agent would've killed them both.<eos> So it's no trouble unless you continue to question my actions.<eos> So you've actually thought this through.<eos> Would you like to finish what you started?
Something like this.<eos> Yes.<eos> You?<eos> New York.<eos> Almost forgot.<eos> Got something for you.<eos> You know what my mission is?<eos> Same as mine was.<eos> Kill me if necessary... To get that.<eos> Absolutely hated working with you, peril.
To insure the freedom and safety of herself and her daughter, Adaline vow to keep moving. Changing her name, residence and appearance every decade<eos> and never to speak a word of her fate to another living soul.<eos> In seven weeks when Jennifer Larson disappears forever and Susan Fleischer takes up residence in a remote farm house in Ashton, Oregon,<eos> Adaline Bowman, aside one moment of weakness, will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.<eos> - Hello, Regan.<eos> - "Amanda, you're not gonna stand up on me are you?"<eos> You asked me that last year.<eos> Why don't you trust me?<eos> Oh, I just can't believe you haven't got a better offer.<eos> "Impossible." I'll pick you up at 8?"
1954, I was a junior in College.<eos> That's the last photo I have of you.<eos> You've seen one, you've seen them all.<eos> That's true.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just tired of running.<eos> Of lying to good people.<eos> Then stop.<eos> Nobody's chasing you anymore.
Relax.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Dane can handle himself.<eos> Who are these two punks?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't want a 50.<eos> I need an ounce.<eos> That's too much.<eos> I don't carry that.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
I can't risk anybody...<eos> We're good, Belkin.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> I had no right to talk to you the way I did.<eos> I ruined our date and I really enjoyed being with you.
I don't believe you!<eos> Can I talk to Christy alone?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's let the ladies chat for a few minutes.<eos> I'm gonna turn this off.<eos> It's just us.<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> No one needs to hear.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> Nothing's going to happen to you here.
Not while the Rees runnin' it.<eos> We got to get off this boat ...<eos> Oh you want to get off the boat?<eos> Then what we're gonna do, hah?<eos> We're gonna take our furs...<eos> And sit out there amongst the Ree, like a bunch of god damn ducks.<eos> Only safe thing to do is track a new course back upon land.<eos> We'll add weeks to the trip.<eos> Better then floating back down there where they can get their eyes on us.<eos> They got eyes on you right now, son.
As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.<eos> You breathe.<eos> Keep breathing.<eos> When there is a storm...<eos> And you stand in front of a tree... If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall.<eos> But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability.<eos> $300 goes along way toward retiring...<eos> Way down to Texas, buy me a decent piece of land and start pissing in the wind.<eos> Getting the hell out of this godforsaken places.<eos> - Did Ree done that to you?
That's when I felt it.<eos> I felt all of it.<eos> They got my head turned inside out.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Yeah, them Indians down Texas way they may rob you, ain't gonna take your topknot.<eos> When was it?<eos> God damn, will you just, would you quit that noise now, will ya?<eos> Or just...<eos> Leave it.<eos> I'm following further back from heading against the boys on account of tending to you.
Shit.<eos> Got one beaver half.<eos> His breathing changed?<eos> I ain't noticed.<eos> Damn, he's cold as ice.<eos> Here Mr. Glass ... this will help ...<eos> It will keep you warm.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Where is Hawk?<eos> He ain't with you?
He doesn't know it yet.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> Cause he got everything to lose.<eos> All I had was that boy and he took him from me.<eos> I can't let you go back out there.<eos> - Not again.<eos> - No.<eos> I ain't afraid to die anymore.<eos> I've done that already.<eos> I'm going with you.
We'll see.<eos> We were texting' all night.<eos> And she sent me a sexy pic.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> That's a fight-promo pic.<eos> Not released yet, though, bitch.<eos> And she just said,<eos> "I'm sending an uber for you in 90 minutes,"
We're hungry.<eos> Eric.<eos> Hey!<eos> Paula.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> It's funny running into you here.<eos> I wanted to talk to you today, but we didn't even exchange numbers.
No, seriously.<eos> Fuck him.<eos> All right, we don't need him.<eos> I'll put up the $8 million we need.<eos> How much fuckin' money did this guy make?<eos> Vin, I'm serious, and It's not just 'cause I love you.<eos> It's 'cause I love this movie.<eos> I appreciate it, turtle, but I can't let you do that...<eos> I'll put up the money.<eos> I'll split it with you.
Not even If the water's freezing and the orchestra's playing.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> A "Titanic" reference.<eos> Come on, Ari. "Hyde's" gonna be a monster.<eos> You just said you're always right.<eos> Until I'm wrong.<eos> I'm kiddin', drama.<eos> Lighten up.<eos> Warren Buffett's gonna be blowin' us for investment advice soon, You'll see.<eos> I'm proud of you, Vinnie.
- I'm just tellin' ya.<eos> - And I'm hearin' ya.<eos> Sully, call me after you find the next body, 'cause you will find it.<eos> Beckett!<eos> When you're out there... and you see that, listen to me... and you see that bear, you kill it.<eos> Now go up there, find your wife and get her the hell outta there.<eos> I'll close down the trails.<eos> Go on.<eos> Hey, Beckett.<eos> I'm comin' with you.
It's OK.<eos> She'll walk.<eos> Assuming I can keep it from getting infected.<eos> So, you're a doctor, now... huh?<eos> That's funny, I... always figured you'd leave this place.<eos> I am.<eos> In two weeks.<eos> Toronto.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you know how many times I tried to contact you?
In two weeks.<eos> Toronto.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you know how many times I tried to contact you?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some answers.<eos> Stick to what you believe.<eos> It's as good a story as any.<eos> I once had my whole life planned out, with you, in my head.
He does not have long to live now.<eos> Unless he has a great deal of money.<eos> And unless he is very lucky.<eos> Some papers say you are a hero.<eos> This paper says you are responsible for a child's death.<eos> This one says you and your wife have just had a row about her mother, your mother-in-law.<eos> And this paper offers you condolences on the death of your daughter.<eos> It's amazing how you have suddenly acquired a Mexican family, and the Camorristas don't normally like to get their hair wet.<eos> But they can get nothing out of me.<eos> There are two people downstairs waiting to talk to you.
No! No! No!<eos> Come on, try it.<eos> Well, I have to teach from 11:00 for three hours.<eos> See you later.<eos> Pera?<eos> ls that you?<eos> Sergei, it's the middle of the night.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, were you asleep?<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> Do you have anyone with you?
-I can come back later.<eos> -No, it's fine.<eos> Just don't touch anything.<eos> "Just don't touch anything."<eos> Dickbreath.<eos> You want a Tic Tac?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell happened to you, dude?
It was very cool.<eos> Wish I could have seen you then.<eos> A little delinquent, yeah?<eos> So why'd you break up?<eos> - Lana: The band?<eos> - Uh-hmm.<eos> I guess I ultimately figured out it was less fun to have bad sex in the back of a Van sober.<eos> What kind of sober?<eos> Not wanting to be my stepfather kind.<eos> Do you mind if I ask what he did to you?
Harder.<eos> Stephen!<eos> Stephen!<eos> Stephen, wake up!<eos> Stephen!<eos> Stephen, please, wake up!<eos> Stephen!<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> - Are you okay?
Shewasleavingme foranotherman.<eos> Iwasdevastated, lostcontrol.<eos> Shesaid shehadneverlovedme.<eos> Thatsheonly marriedmeto escapeRussia.<eos> Itookherneckinmy hands ...<eos> AndI crushedit until Ifeltherthroatcollapse.<eos> Thatwasit .<eos> Alltheanger, allthehatred.<eos> Therewasjustsilence.<eos> Lana, can I talk to you?
- Don't touch me!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can I please just...<eos> - Please?<eos> - Talk to Roger.<eos> If you need someone to talk to.<eos> Well, he's not answering my calls either.<eos> Please?<eos> I feel like I'm about to go underwater, okay?<eos> Can I just... Please talk to you...
What the fuck are you doing?<eos> - Just waiting.<eos> - No.<eos> Dad, you broke into my house.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Well, I wanted to give you somethin'.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't deal with this right now.<eos> I'm tryin' to apologize to you...
Ihandcuffedyou tothisradiatorpipe whileI triedto ,youknow, reachmyowndecision whethertocallthe cops orifthatwouldputyou injail.<eos> Thirty minutes later,<eos> I came back to check on you and you were hanging there, passed out in a puddle of blood at your feet, and I thought you were dead.<eos> Itwaslikeabolt oflightninghitmyheart.<eos> Ijustcouldn'tbear thethoughtof livin' knowing'whatI'ddonetoyou.<eos> Part of me I don't think ever came back from that moment.<eos> Itookthehandcuffsoffyou andI said, "youdowhatever youwannado ,son."<eos> Youdidn'twantanything todowithme.<eos> Ican'tblameyou for that.<eos> I keep tryin' to apologize to you, but it all goes wrong.
I brought Chinese.<eos> Mum?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where did you get the pennies?<eos> The old man next door.<eos> Actually, it was the police officer who "gave" them to me.<eos> What?<eos> What kind of a nut keeps an aeroplane, and actually starts it, in his backyard?<eos> Are you sure you're okay?
That was double scary, right?<eos> Triple and quadruple.<eos> We're going to have to amputate them.<eos> What?<eos> - Feels better, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But it happened that after walking a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the Fox appeared.<eos> Hey!<eos> Come play with me.<eos> I cannot play with you.
You said he's up there, didn't you?<eos> Back with his rose?<eos> Well...<eos> It is as he said.<eos> I look at the stars and I hear him laughing.<eos> But you don't know for sure?<eos> It would comfort me very much to know for sure, but instead, I choose to believe he is up there.<eos> Is that what you want me to do when you go?<eos> Just look up to the stars and make-believe that you're not gone?<eos> But... if you look with your heart, I'll always be with you.
Why are you here?<eos> Well, you know, I'm just, uh... Making some changes in my life.<eos> It's a little late for that, isn't it?<eos> Maybe. I don't know.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Tom's the best man I've ever met.<eos> He's solid, kind, funny.<eos> We've had one fight in 12 years, we've had one serious fight.<eos> A couple years ago I got backstage passes for one of your shows.<eos> I thought it was... You know, he should at least meet you, right?
Right?<eos> Yeah, that is true.<eos> That is definitely true.<eos> In this case, yes.<eos> Exactly, I mean, you're meeting your grown son for the first time.<eos> You didn't expect it to be easy, right?<eos> - I thought it'd be fucking easier than this.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, every part of me right now would like to just go in there and get soused with you.
Hand to God, not once.<eos> Not once?<eos> But I'm nervous now.<eos> -No, that's nice.<eos> -So this...<eos> I mean, I guess this means that finally you'll let me buy you dinner?<eos> Let's see how you do first.<eos> Give me a little more pressure.<eos> Just what I need.<eos> You know, this is kind of weird to say, I know, because I really haven't know you very long. But I am very proud of you, Danny.
- Ma'am, I think I've cracked it.<eos> The world's first proper, full artificial intelligence.<eos> This is a computer system that might be smarter than a human.<eos> I could show it a piece of art... and this thing, this being, could judge that art.<eos> It could decide if it liked it.<eos> It could write music and poetry.<eos> Okay. Stop.<eos> Please, Deon.<eos> Do you realize you just came... to the CEO of a publicly traded weapons corporation... and pitched a robot that can write poems?<eos> Well, if you just let me explain... Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you.
He was just teaching him to paint!<eos> He was just teaching Chappie!<eos> - Yeah, to be a poes!<eos> - He's mine!<eos> I'll call the police on you for mistreating him!<eos> And tell them what?<eos> You stole a police robot!<eos> You're a filthy person.<eos> You're a terrible, shitty person.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- I got your car, Daddy!<eos> - Come here, Chappie!<eos> - Come here!<eos> - Leave the car.<eos> Thief! Thief!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You thief!<eos> - Get in.<eos> - But I got the car!<eos> What's the matter with you?
- Leave the car.<eos> Thief! Thief!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You thief!<eos> - Get in.<eos> - But I got the car!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Shut the door.<eos> Thief!<eos> Jesus Christ, Chappie, what the fuck is wrong with you?
You lied to me.<eos> You lied to me, Daddy!<eos> Just relax, Chappie.<eos> At the time you were different and, like...<eos> You lied to me, Daddy!<eos> - Chappie.<eos> - You lied!<eos> - Why you lie to me? ! Why?<eos> - No! Stop, Chappie!<eos> I'm coming to get you, Deon.
It's okay.<eos> Go, go, go! Come on!<eos> Backup visuals. Infrared.<eos> You'll be okay. I've solved it!<eos> We'll get your consciousness out.<eos> Yo-Landi!<eos> Stop here, Daddy! Stop!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Getting the neural helmet!<eos> I'm coming for you now, mate.
The urgent ones are on the right.<eos> Everything else is on the left.<eos> Perfect, thank you.<eos> Is it how you wanted it, boss?<eos> Is everything working okay?<eos> More than okay, my friend.<eos> My plan is unstoppable.<eos> Victory is assured.<eos> Nothing can stop me now.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Yes.<eos> I have to get that.<eos> It might be my probation officer.<eos> Go on.<eos> Otherwise, he'll think you're up to no good.<eos> Hi, Mole, it's your favorite cop.<eos> So, what's new?<eos> Nothing, Inspector.<eos> I'm looking after my poor mother who's sick.<eos> Is she with you?
He's a big shot.<eos> I know he's somewhere in the port with a dog and a giant.<eos> I need you to find his hideout.<eos> A journalist will help you.<eos> You'll treat her with respect and get me the info before midnight.<eos> What bad luck.<eos> We were nearly there.<eos> It's really not Mole's day.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm going with you.
We just need to find him and he'll tell us where he is.<eos> I need to tell Alex, but I can't find my cell phone.<eos> Will you lend me yours?<eos> I stay away from those things.<eos> Apparently, they fry your brain.<eos> There's a phone booth behind the warehouse.<eos> - Leo, you're back already?<eos> - I don't feel well.<eos> Hi, Mary.<eos> Everything's good with you?
They fight their illnesses right to the end.<eos> They're amazing little warriors.<eos> A kid who's able to leave his body?<eos> Okay, some strange things have happened, but still...<eos> I was stuck here in my wheelchair.<eos> How could I have helped?<eos> True, when I was on the ship, you always knew where to go.<eos> It's all true, I swear.<eos> He found you.<eos> He stayed with you the whole time.
And it throws me off a little bit.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna give you Wednesday nights.<eos> I'll move Tito to the day shift.<eos> Thanks, Frank, I appreciate it.<eos> You think I give a fuck about you?<eos> I don't give a shit about you.<eos> You're making my life easier.<eos> Tito falls asleep halfway through the fucking picture anyway.<eos> At least with you, I don't got to worry about that.
You hold onto her.<eos> Don't let her get away, you know?<eos> Not everybody's so fortunate.<eos> I will.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> Can I have that one ready by tomorrow?<eos> Sure, you got it, kid.<eos> Thanks, Sully.<eos> You be safe out there, huh?<eos> So,tellme whathappenedto you.
Wait, stop.<eos> -What?<eos> -The sound.<eos> -What? -Wait.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's nothing?<eos> You think I'm an idiot, don't you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The only reason I fucked you is because I felt sorry for you.
I thought I was good for you.<eos> Anyway, call me back when you get this.<eos> You know, I love you.<eos> Hey, Nicks, how you doing, man?<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> You need some sleep.<eos> -You want one?<eos> -Sure.<eos> One for him, too.<eos> Is that guy still following you?
Leave me alone, you freak!<eos> I never want to see you again!<eos> Ivana!<eos> Doyourealize whatyou'vedone?<eos> Doyourealizehow many refundsI hadto give?<eos> Justtakeit outofmy paycheck.<eos> It's not about the money I lost tonight.<eos> It's about the fact that those customers will never come to this theater again.<eos> I don't know what happened, Frank.<eos> Something's going on with you.
Okay.<eos> Well, let me tell you, when you're a poor kid from a poor family, religion counts for a lot.<eos> And when a Priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal.<eos> He asks you to collect the hymnals or take out the trash, you feel special.<eos> It's like God asking for help.<eos> So maybe it's a little weird when he tells you a dirty joke.<eos> But now you got a secret together, so you go along.<eos> Then he shows you a porno mag, and you go along.<eos> And you go along, and you go along, until one day he asks you to jerk him off or give him a blow job.<eos> And so you go along with that too because you feel trapped, because he has groomed you.
Go! Upstairs!<eos> Go! Hurry up!<eos> Move!<eos> - Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> Keep moving to the top!<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> I got you.
I must concede, it was a masterful move on Cain's part.<eos> The idea that I was bombing our own helpless children to hold back the rebels... It turned the last of my guards against me.<eos> There was no resistance left inside The Capitol or the mansion.<eos> Do you know it aired live?<eos> There's a particular savvy in that, isn't there?<eos> I'm sure she wasn't gunning for your sister, but these things happen in war.<eos> My failure was in being so slow to grasp Coin's plan.<eos> She let The Capitol and the Districts destroy one another, then she stepped in to take power with 13's arsenal.<eos> Oh, make no mistake, she intends to take my place now.<eos> But I've been watching you.
- Back over there?<eos> Yes, yes, Frank, we need to go back over.<eos> Good. Great.<eos> That's just great.<eos> You know, hey, I got stung by a bee.<eos> Let's jump on the hive.<eos> That's a terrible analogy.<eos> That's a fantastic analogy.<eos> What do you know about analogies?<eos> You know, you're impossible to talk to when you're like this.
"Casey, that stuff's not really the issue "because our future-predicting machine says we're all gonna die."<eos> We did sort of hint at it.<eos> This place has nothing to do with hope.<eos> It's the opposite of hope.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You said it.<eos> No wonder you gave up.<eos> That's before I knew about you.
Parts.<eos> I am a student at the Royal College of Medicine.<eos> The curriculum is straightforward, the exams easy, the professors...<eos> Oh! The professors are men of limited ability and even more limited horizon.<eos> Why did you rescue me?<eos> You, my friend, were an unexpected gift.<eos> It's not every day I come across a man, albeit one suffering from such grotesque deformity who is so clearly talented, observant, and resourceful and in possession of the most gifted pair of hands I have ever seen.<eos> My interest in you does not stem from charity.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before I met you, I was to approach Mr. Barnaby about acquiring some of your deceased animals.
I knew it.<eos> I'm gonna die out here. Because of you.<eos> Hey. Hey. What are you doing?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey. Hey. No.<eos> Why you little...<eos> Come back here!<eos> Berries!<eos> What's with you?
Hey. Hey. No.<eos> Why you little...<eos> Come back here!<eos> Berries!<eos> What's with you?<eos> They're right here.<eos> Crazy critter.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello?<eos> We've been watching you.
Tell them, Earl.<eos> We kill them!<eos> Nash, the herd!<eos> Yah! Giddy up. Come on now.<eos> Giddy up!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Nobody steals our longhorns.<eos> Finders keepers.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Momma wants to play with you.
He's going to take a different path to do it.<eos> So, here we are.<eos> Came as fast as I could. Yeah.<eos> It's been 12 days.<eos> I saw an opportunity.<eos> I put a 24-hour surveillance on Al Fariq's hideaway.<eos> I know exactly what you were doing.<eos> Criminal masterminds?<eos> They're just kids partying away their lives on Al Fariq's dime.<eos> The difference between them and you, is you're doing it on the FBI's.
- How bad are you saying?<eos> - It's pretty bad.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash.<eos> You have to keep your voices down,<eos> Joel Pforzheimer is sitting out in the house.<eos> I don't care if...<eos> Who's Joel Pforzheimer?<eos> GQ.<eos> He's been shadowing you for a week, did you notice?
Markkula took me off the Lisa because of his strong religious objection to making it good.<eos> Now, I gave you everything you wanted on the Apple II.<eos> You don't ask for a lot?<eos> There wasn't a single fight you lost.<eos> Do you concede the slots are the reason for the success of the Apple II?<eos> We can't possibly still be talking about the slots. I have a point.<eos> It's been seven years.<eos> The eight slots on the Apple II...<eos> You're still doing it, you're talking about the slots.<eos> There's something wrong with you.
You find out you were out of the loop when the most crucial events in your life were set in motion.<eos> As long as you have control.<eos> I don't understand people who give it up.<eos> What inspired Hertzfeld to make that bet?<eos> He was warning me that being your father figure could be dangerous.<eos> Keep your 100 bucks.<eos> I'm sticking with the first verse. Good.<eos> What the hell does he mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm proud of you.
I can't really think of the word.<eos> Okay. Well, have a good day at school.<eos> "Regretful."<eos> What?<eos> Like, wishing you could go back and do things different.<eos> You're too young to be regretful.<eos> Not me.<eos> The person singing the song.<eos> Got it. "Regretful." That makes sense because...<eos> I wanna live with you.
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are more common than John Sculley.<eos> I wasn't being sarcastic.<eos> It was nice of him.<eos> Do you talk to him? No.<eos> You haven't talked to him since '88?<eos> I'd have told you if I did.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I don't want people thinking they can cross me and then, boom, 15 years later, I'm cool with it.<eos> I was kidding.<eos> What's wrong with you this morning?
She's turned on me.<eos> - Fix it.<eos> - What the...<eos> - Fix it, Steve.<eos> - Take it easy!<eos> Fix it or I quit.<eos> How about that?<eos> I quit and you never see me again.<eos> How about that?<eos> Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.
Bye.<eos> Bye, Gary.<eos> Gary?<eos> Gary'? Hey, can you hear me'?<eos> You better watch your step, Dotty.<eos> It's Emily.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> What's going on'?<eos> What's going on is you just got out of surgery and you need to be in bed, honey.<eos> I'd love to go to bed with you. Shall we, then'?
Man, this road sucks.<eos> Is that your house? Uh-huh.<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Right there.<eos> This place is creepy.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Is that another one of your fortune teller's visions?<eos> This is cool.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey, you want me to come with you'?
Right there.<eos> This place is creepy.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Is that another one of your fortune teller's visions?<eos> This is cool.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey, you want me to come with you'?<eos> I got it, thanks.<eos> Come on, Lucy.<eos> "You want me to come with you?"
We can do that for him. Right?<eos> Well.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> What did we do to deserve you?<eos> - Sweet dreams.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Well, you can't argue with mom.<eos> Happy it is. Team happy!<eos> Sounds great!<eos> Totally behind you, Joy.
I know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I get that a lot.<eos> I look like a lot of people.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I do. Bing bong!<eos> Riley's imaginary friend!<eos> - You really do know me?<eos> - Well, of course!<eos> Riley loved playing with you!
I regret that it turned out the way it did.<eos> You always wanted to get away.<eos> I wanted a mate.<eos> I couldn't have you.<eos> Just didn't wanna be alone.<eos> Are you sorry that you brought me here?<eos> Are you sorry you came?<eos> Do you remember how happy we were?<eos> Different these days.<eos> What's going on with you?
I only teach one thing.<eos> I just teach this moment.<eos> Pay attention to this moment.<eos> And everything is there... perfect... and complete.<eos> Just as it is.<eos> You're so quiet.<eos> You keep everything to yourself.<eos> You have love in you.<eos> I know it.<eos> When I'm with you...
Thumb, first finger, third finger, left, fourth finger, third finger, second finger, thumb, right hand, thumb, first finger, second finger, thumb...<eos> Have I found you?<eos> Can it be?<eos> Answer me.<eos> So this is what we are.<eos> A fire.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Away.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> I wanna go away with you.
Takes you from the world to find what lies beyond it.<eos> We are not only to endure patiently the troubles He sends, we are to regard them as gifts.<eos> As gifts more precious than the happiness we wish for ourselves.<eos> Just left you behind.<eos> To get burned up.<eos> How do I begin?<eos> Father.<eos> Give me courage.<eos> Strength.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Come on, Max.<eos> Of course, I would remember.<eos> I have really good memory.<eos> It's not just the Adderall.<eos> Hey, do you want anything?<eos> I'm gonna go get a popcorn and then we can dump MM'S into it.<eos> That way, every handful is, like, kind of suspenseful?<eos> Sure.<eos> Hey, Chris, I'm just gonna have a Diet Coke and a child-size popcorn, but make sure to dump half of it into the garbage.<eos> You know what, I'm just going to come with you.
That's not who I'm supposed to be, remember?<eos> I'm just the shy girl with the clipboard and the guitar.<eos> Yeah, but you wanted to change that.<eos> - Honey, let me do this.<eos> - No.<eos> Max, I'm not afraid.<eos> I wanted to save you.<eos> Max, you did.<eos> You did, Max.<eos> Just by letting me be here with you.
Now! Now!<eos> Everybody off!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Stay behind the barriers!<eos> Come on, move!<eos> Stay behind the barriers!<eos> Kim!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Come here!<eos> I got you.
Let me talk to her.<eos> Blake?<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, thank God, honey.<eos> Is Daniel okay?<eos> He left me, Mom. He what?<eos> He told a security guard where I was and then he just took off and... these two brothers that I met overheard him and they came to help me.<eos> I'm with them right now.<eos> He left her?<eos> We're coming to get you, honey.
It's safer.<eos> That's where I'm gonna be able to see you.<eos> Do you remember where we spent Mallory's birthday weekend?<eos> At Coit Tower? Yeah. Yeah.<eos> That tall cement nozzle thing on the hill.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Don't stop anywhere. Go there.<eos> That's where we'll meet.<eos> Stay strong, honey.<eos> We're coming to get you.
It was my idea to take Mallory rafting that day.<eos> You can't blame yourself for what happened.<eos> It's just different when it's your own kid.<eos> I know.<eos> Sometimes I can't get that look she had outta my head.<eos> The moment she realized... that I wasn't gonna be able to save her.<eos> And then coming home every day to you and Blake only made it harder.<eos> Because nothing was the way it used to be.<eos> And the way it used to be was... It was perfect.<eos> I should've let you in.
Just wake up.<eos> OK, wait...<eos> Somebody must be able to help.<eos> I mean, somehow.<eos> Yeah, how many people have called?<eos> How many people have come to visit?<eos> We're all here.<eos> This is everybody.<eos> And I'm leaving.<eos> I looked after you for 13 years, Chet.
- You're missing the point.<eos> - It's love.<eos> Ever been in love, Chet?<eos> - I've been married.<eos> Twice. - Yeah, I played those women.<eos> I didn't feel real love.<eos> You wanna feel real love?<eos> You ought to.<eos> One time.<eos> No, I don't want to get high with you, Chet.
Stay until after Christmas.<eos> Hiya, Dad.<eos> Hey, Junior.<eos> - He's going to stay with us. - Yeah.<eos> I can hear, Vera.<eos> You trying to dry out again?<eos> That's a lovely farmhouse that you have, Mr Baker.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, you look like a nice colored girl.<eos> If I was you, I'd get in that car and...
A little metal.<eos> You see, sometimes I do listen to doctor's orders.<eos> Well played.<eos> But.. If you kill me.. You commit suicide.<eos> Because without the full course of those pills, well you relapse, you relapse.<eos> And we both know who takes over.<eos> Don't we?<eos> You see I'm the only one with the answers, Damian.<eos> You need me.<eos> I'm the only one standing between you and oblivion.
Straight after.<eos> It's all there.<eos> Count it.<eos> - Do you find this funny, Danny?<eos> - Think what you can do with all that money!<eos> You can put up a luxury high-rise on Park Place.<eos> --excited at what they can do in the playoffs.<eos> Oh, dang, this is my song, Mike.<eos> Danny.<eos> Do you have any idea what we gonna do to you?
Rose is asleep.<eos> Don't wake her till the morning.<eos> Load the bodies from Danny's into Michael's limousine.<eos> Dump the car where the cops can find it.<eos> Make sure everything points to Michael.<eos> I know. It's my fault.<eos> Every shitty little thing in your life is my fault, right?<eos> - I'm turning myself in.<eos> - Not yet, you're not.<eos> Shawn's gonna come after you, Michael.
We'll go to your Uncle Eddie's house.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Hey, Uncle Eddie.<eos> - Michael.<eos> Just pull the sleeve.<eos> I got it.<eos> Don't wipe off the tattoo.<eos> Thanks.<eos> There you go.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
Yes. How can I help you?<eos> Ma.<eos> Ma.<eos> - We heard from Price?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Is it done?<eos> - Not yet, Shawn.<eos> I'm giving you one more chance to walk away from this.<eos> You're giving me one more chance?<eos> That's right. As long as you're coming after Michael... I'm coming after you.
- Not yet.<eos> - Is it done?<eos> - Not yet, Shawn.<eos> I'm giving you one more chance to walk away from this.<eos> You're giving me one more chance?<eos> That's right. As long as you're coming after Michael... I'm coming after you.<eos> Walk away, Shawn.<eos> Walk away to what, Jimmy?<eos> Ain't got nothing left to walk back to anymore.<eos> This is between you and me.
I need your--<eos> You promised to help me find my mom!<eos> Then I un-promise!<eos> That's not how it works!<eos> You have to help me get to Paris.<eos> I will not!<eos> Stop!<eos> I need your--<eos> I must hide!<eos> I am speaking the English at you.
I believe that somebody who looks like Nicholas did the deed.<eos> And I will endeavor to find him.<eos> Now you may go.<eos> You. I'm gonna see you real soon.<eos> I'm gonna see you real soon.<eos> Youwatchyour fuckin'back!<eos> Why do you think he did it?<eos> He's a very macho little slime.<eos> And he broke down and humiliated himself in front of them.<eos> You know he'll come for you.
No, thanks.<eos> Can you come tomorrow?<eos> If you want.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I walked back with Clément.<eos> - You've been smoking. - No, I haven't.<eos> - It stinks.<eos> - No, it doesn't.<eos> - It's disgusting. - God.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
You put up the notice for the sale?<eos> Bea?<eos> I did it.<eos> And you've been helping?<eos> He's been all over it.<eos> Sounds like there's nothing left to do.<eos> Please stop the car.<eos> Stop the car.<eos> Just...<eos> - What's wrong with you? - Sorry.
What can I say?<eos> I like cake.<eos> Do you have any idea what's going on out there?<eos> A lady is about to get... I don't even know how to put it into words.<eos> No, I'm a cookie guy.<eos> What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's red fucking velvet.<eos> I would take a pack of Oreos over that bullshit any day of the week.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
Thank you.<eos> - How are the knees?<eos> - Rotten.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You good?<eos> To tell you the truth, I haven't felt this nervous since Desert Storm.<eos> What?<eos> How have I known you this long and I don't know that you were in Desert Storm?<eos> Just never came up.<eos> Look, I don't know, me and you, we haven't really... had a chance to have our moment.
It's nice to meet you.<eos> Meet... meet your voice, anyways.<eos> - Chris?<eos> - Exactly. Hi.<eos> I was trying to reach Mike, but I couldn't get him on his cell phone, so... I was wondering if you'd take a message for me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Just tell him that my lawyer said he can get him a seat when the trial begins tomorrow. Okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, it's truly nice to talk to you, Jill.
And, God willing, you will remain so.<eos> I therefore place you in the custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections for transport to death row at the Oregon State Penitentiary.<eos> Court is adjourned.<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> You look good.<eos> I'm still writing.<eos> Nobody wrote me back at first, which hurt.<eos> And I must be getting better, because... I've had two marriage proposals.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> The only good thing that came out of all this is that I got to meet you.
Sandy, use your squirrel powers!<eos> Roger that!<eos> She's never gonna make it!<eos> Everyone... Lean!<eos> That's what you get.<eos> Come here.<eos> The book!<eos> Sour Note!<eos> All right, Burger Beard, prepare to be teamworked!<eos> I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.
My goals, my dreams.<eos> I'm not ready for that.<eos> And clearly neither are you.<eos> This.<eos> This thing we've got going on... that you like to call a relationship.<eos> It's fizzled out, run out of steam.<eos> Not worth fighting for anymore.<eos> You don't mean that!<eos> Yes I do!<eos> I want to go with you!
I'm River.<eos> June.<eos> I've never noticed you here before.<eos> That's because I'm not noticeable.<eos> That's not true, I noticed you the minute I walked in the door.<eos> Why are you talking to me?<eos> Because I want to.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just want to talk to you.
In case you change your mind.<eos> It was really nice meeting you.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's Peyote.<eos> Is it safe.<eos> Of course.<eos> Go on.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Now I want you to picture someone who was close to you.
If she keeps it, I'm gonna have to move back to Tahoe.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Hey. Hey!<eos> No.<eos> You have to take care of it.<eos> What the fuck is he doing over there?<eos> He's starting to piss me off.<eos> Probably contemplating suicide.<eos> Because I'm here.<eos> Spending time with you.
Boy.<eos> All the days I forget my pedometer?<eos> If we want to reach the pond up top, we have to get through Fat Man's Misery...<eos> Not unlike crawling up a chimney.<eos> You want the best lookout, we can hit the Lemon Squeeze where you make like a piece of bologna between slices of toast.<eos> Or we can stop here, eat some granola, and pay our respects.<eos> Wait, this is it?<eos> It's where they found him.<eos> I always figured probably on his way down, it was getting dark.<eos> He was out on that ridge above you there.
He didn't pee on you.<eos> No, surprisingly, no.<eos> He did not pee on me.<eos> No, I didn't even know that would be an option.<eos> No, he just threw down the gauntlet.<eos> That's, kind of sweet.<eos> No, it is not sweet.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This isn't quaint or kooky small-town charm.<eos> You know, and I got to be honest with you.
You know that Walt Whitman poem, "Song of Myself"?<eos> We don't need to talk about it anymore.<eos> It's a song.<eos> Walt Whitman, he celebrates his body.<eos> You're celebrating your body.<eos> So, I don't think it's a big deal.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna be back tomorrow.<eos> I'm just going up for the handshake.<eos> And when I come home... you are gonna come out of this room for a little bit... and me and you, just me and you, we're gonna hang out.
Hey, Dan.<eos> Hey, Chuck.<eos> I've got to go talk to Benjaminson.<eos> But I will catch you later.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bill, hey.<eos> Dan Trunkman.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just a little thrown.<eos> I saw Chuck Portnoy from Dynamic Progressive Systems... and she mentioned that she's gonna see you, Bill, also.
Bess.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm in the waiting room.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you talk to her, please?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Bess.<eos> Hey, I'm in Germany, where I am for work still, a little longer.<eos> I gotta go to this meeting in just a second... but, honey, I want you to know that I'd like to be with you now.
Berlin.<eos> I'm still on business.<eos> Hey, Paul...<eos> I don't like the way that you're talking about yourself at all.<eos> And that sounds like... something you heard someone else say about you.<eos> That's not something that you should call yourself, ever.<eos> You know, I say it all the time, but...<eos> I'm your biggest confidant.<eos> You can tell me stuff that no one else needs to know.<eos> I think you're being teased, and I want you to know you're not alone.
Can I get a picture?<eos> 42!<eos> So, today we have this down day.<eos> Or, as we call it, a push day.<eos> These are the days that you really have to focus.<eos> A down day, man.<eos> There's no dogs to walk... no kids to school.<eos> So, you can't start drinking at 10 a.m. on a day like this.<eos> But you wanna own your down day.<eos> You do not want your down day to own you.
All right.<eos> Will you just give me a second to sort myself out?<eos> And I will meet you out back.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks, Bill.<eos> You got a real big one.<eos> Oh, well, thank you.<eos> Bye, Ambrose.<eos> Enjoy your stay in Berlin.<eos> I didn't get a chance to meet you.
I often invent dehumanizing nicknames for them... in my mind.<eos> You're "The Flower Girl."<eos> I'm not gonna ask you why, because that's what you want me to do.<eos> You're "The Flower Girl" because you're at the party.<eos> You're dressed up.<eos> Everyone's glad that you're there.<eos> You do your little thing, then you sit down, and you let the grownups get to it.<eos> Flower girl.<eos> You're a bizarre woman.<eos> If the three of us could shake hands, you, me and Benjaminson, I would.
I lived in America for a year.<eos> In Connecticut, and they made fun of my name.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Karen.<eos> Yeah, well, in Sweden it's like "John," but in Connecticut, it's like...<eos> "Stacy." Yeah, I can see that.<eos> You know the worst part with teasing?<eos> My dad would say, "Just forget about it and ignore it, son."<eos> But he doesn't understand because in his day... kids would get teased at school all day, but then they could go home.<eos> And nowadays, you come home, and there's Facebook and Instagram... and the bullies can get at you through all of that stuff.
It's like, the goth kids, really... they're joiners, when you think about it.<eos> The teal kids, they really stand alone.<eos> And whenever I have to pick a color, obviously, I pick teal every time.<eos> For sure.<eos> Because, you know... no one else does it.<eos> And because you have to be bold.<eos> Because you have to be teal tough.<eos> Give me a break, Dad.<eos> Come on!<eos> We could probably start a gang, me and you.
Hey, I gotta go.<eos> Just listen for one second.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Stay here and just listen to me for a second.<eos> Now, Paul, you're gonna switch schools.<eos> But that's not really gonna change anything much, honestly.<eos> You're just gonna have to stay tough.<eos> I know that you are feeling like that you're sticking out...<eos> And that you're going through a lot of stuff... but we're gonna get through this.<eos> Me and you.
What do you do?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's Patty.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Fiona.<eos> It's Ben Whittaker from About The Fit.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> It's good to hear your voice.<eos> Oh, it's good to hear your voice, too.<eos> It was great meeting you today.
Close your eyes.<eos> - Put your head back.<eos> So when would you like to reschedule?<eos> - Tomorrow?<eos> Can't tomorrow.<eos> What about Saturday?<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This is enormously satisfying.<eos> What time should I pick you up?
Of course.<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - It's coordinates.<eos> Your father was scanning for a particular satellite phone.<eos> He was looking for someone.<eos> He was looking for him.<eos> And he sent me here to finish the job.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
The recently deceased head of Spectre, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and his chief of intelligence, your new best friend, C.<eos> About to take control of his very own global surveillance system that he built right here under our noses.<eos> Then we'd better move. The system goes online at midnight.<eos> If that happens, Spectre will have control of everything.<eos> So, you and I will have a quiet word with C while Q hacks into the system - and stops it going online.<eos> - It won't be easy.<eos> He'll find a way. He always does.<eos> It's good to have you back, 007.<eos> James, I can't.<eos> I'll come back for you when it's all over.
That's what it's like?<eos> That's what it's like.<eos> I haven't been sick for hours.<eos> Nice, isn't it?<eos> I'm very hungry.<eos> That's why you haven't been sick for hours.<eos> We'll eat tomorrow.<eos> Or the day after.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> We're gonna have to do something with you.
We talk about you every evening, of course.<eos> We want to know everything.<eos> I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were 200 pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Is it your time of the month?<eos> So what is it?<eos> Take some time off now.<eos> I'm so sorry, Eilis.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
- Yeah?<eos> That's on my way home.<eos> Can I walk you?<eos> I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.<eos> So I don't get the wrong idea?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?<eos> - You don't know her?<eos> She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.<eos> If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
- What does that mean?<eos> - Oh, you know.<eos> No.<eos> Hands.<eos> Too many of them?<eos> I guess it could seem that way if you was a girl.<eos> Listen...<eos> I want everything out in the open.<eos> I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.<eos> And I was the only one who would dance with you?
We know he's quite nice-looking.<eos> Didn't like his shoes much.<eos> What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?<eos> They were a funny colour.<eos> I'll tell you this much.<eos> I'm going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.<eos> I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.<eos> A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse.<eos> Now, enough.<eos> All I wanna do is travel home with you.
I want to be a book-keeper.<eos> I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.<eos> I'm sorry, Eilis.<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> I'm a rude idiot.<eos> So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?<eos> You like baseball?<eos> He never mentioned the Dodgers?<eos> Not even once?<eos> Tony, what's the matter with you?
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.<eos> They're that important to you?<eos> Put it this way, if our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,<eos> - it'd break my heart.<eos> - Mine too.<eos> She's not laughing, Tony.<eos> Think it's too late.<eos> She's a Yanks fan.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Has somebody asked you?<eos> - No.<eos> Not really.<eos> I won't ask what that means.<eos> Would I get married again?<eos> No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.<eos> I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom while some bad-tempered fella with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.<eos> Then I'll wish I was back here talking to you.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I thought you were gonna think that.<eos> That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.<eos> - I need to say something to you.<eos> - Can you...<eos> Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?<eos> - It's not...<eos> - Please.<eos> So...<eos> Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?<eos> Well, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?<eos> Will you let me say what I want to say?<eos> I don't think you'll mind.<eos> OK.<eos> You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me?<eos> Well, I didn't really know what to say.<eos> But I know what to say now.<eos> I have thought about you, and I like you.<eos> And I like being with you.
People really loved her, Eilis.<eos> Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.<eos> Nobody knew what to say to me.<eos> When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.<eos> And then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.<eos> But everyone's gone, Eilis.<eos> I have nobody.<eos> I can't bear it, Tony.<eos> You wanna go home, I guess.<eos> How would it be for you if I did go home?
- That's all?<eos> - No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I just...<eos> I'd imagined a different life for myself.<eos> I understand.<eos> But your life here could be just as good.<eos> Better even maybe.<eos> Mary.<eos> - I was just coming to fetch you.
Nothing yet. Stand by.<eos> I know you're here.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Ethan, I might have something for you.<eos> Can't confirm.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Backstage.<eos> I'll direct you.<eos> Take the door on your left.<eos> He should be right in front of you.
Lead the way.<eos> - Anything you want to tell me?<eos> - No, not right now.<eos> - How's the pace?<eos> - Don't wait for me.<eos> What's next?<eos> There.<eos> Shoes.<eos> Shoes, please.<eos> If anything were to happen to you...
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, Jess.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> I can keep you safe.<eos> - Nicky.<eos> - Come on, Jess.<eos> Nicky, you taught me so much.<eos> But I've learned a lot since then.<eos> And I'd really like to show you all the things I've learned.<eos> Like how I learned how to play men.<eos> Like I just played you.
You know I want to believe you.<eos> I want to believe you.<eos> I'm different now.<eos> I have to be getting back.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You all right?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> - Did he do something to you?
Andrea, you dumb fuck, she said she saw you this afternoon.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> She was here.<eos> I know.<eos> I opened the door and she ran off.<eos> That's it.<eos> You fucked it up, Jack.<eos> I don't even know what I did.<eos> She just wanted to meet you.
Yes, that's a no, Jesus, Jack!<eos> Do you have anything besides being ambiguous and hostile?<eos> Have you heard about the kidnapping?<eos> Anything?<eos> No, no, I've never even heard of...<eos> Andrea Huntsman.<eos> "Andrea Huntsman!"<eos> All right!<eos> Until you brought her up.<eos> Same thing with you.
Right, of course you do.<eos> Is that a finger?<eos> Let me in, Gary.<eos> Not tonight, Jack.<eos> Fuck off somewhere else.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Not happening, Jack.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?<eos> Hey, buddy, where you going?<eos> Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you!
Not a damn thing.<eos> But never say never.<eos> It's nice.<eos> What is?<eos> You and Romanoff.<eos> No, we haven't... That wasn't...<eos> It's okay.<eos> Nobody's breaking any bylaws.<eos> It's just she's not the most open person in the world.<eos> But with you she seems very relaxed.
Reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.<eos> Fatalities?<eos> Only when engaged.<eos> Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and "something too fast to see."<eos> Maximoffs.<eos> That makes sense he'd go to them.<eos> They have someone in common.<eos> Not any more.<eos> That's a negative.<eos> I answer to you.
It can't build a living body.<eos> It can.<eos> You can.<eos> You lack the materials.<eos> You're a brilliant woman, Helen.<eos> But we all have room to improve.<eos> I didn't realise you were waiting.<eos> I would've joined you, but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.<eos> They used up all the hot water.<eos> I should've joined you.
You still think you're the only monster on the team?<eos> So, we disappear?<eos> Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?<eos> Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.<eos> I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.<eos> Yeah, give him time.<eos> We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.<eos> "Earth's mightiest heroes."<eos> Pulled us apart like cotton candy.<eos> Seems like you walked away all right.
First, I have to find it.<eos> Go.<eos> Did you guys copy that?<eos> We did.<eos> I got a private jet taking off across town.<eos> No manifest.<eos> That could be him.<eos> There.<eos> It's a truck from the lab.<eos> Right above you, Cap.
Do you want me to walk you to your car?<eos> It's, like, 40 feet, will.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye, Claire.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Nice meeting you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Are you in the Prius?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I parked behind you.
Seems like she's real distant.<eos> No.<eos> No, she's great.<eos> Should we go back inside?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna make a call.<eos> Oh, good luck.<eos> There's no service up here.<eos> No, it goes in and out.<eos> I could hang with you.
Believe, and give yourself over.<eos> Will, let's go.<eos> Everybody's waiting.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much, my heart is breaking.<eos> I'm waiting for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kira.<eos> Look at these people.<eos> They're so happy to be here with you.
I have to get ready for this speech.<eos> - Can I have scrambled eggs?<eos> - Sure. I love eggs.<eos> Scrambled is my favorite egg style.<eos> What about yours?<eos> These eggs are delicious.<eos> They're scrambled perfectly.<eos> - Do you want to try some?<eos> Now here's what I'm thinking. - Yes?<eos> - I want to be with you.

I love eggs.<eos> Scrambled is my favorite egg style.<eos> What about yours?<eos> These eggs are delicious.<eos> They're scrambled perfectly.<eos> - Do you want to try some?<eos> Now here's what I'm thinking. - Yes?<eos> - I want to be with you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I need to be with you.
# And none of them is you<eos> # When I go to work<eos> # Or take a walk<eos> # And watch what other people do<eos> # I'll listen to their idle talk<eos> # And none of them is you<eos> # Where are you # My dear?<eos> # Why can't I hear you?<eos> # How I wish that you were here<eos> # How I long # To be near # You
# I'll try to reconstruct your voice<eos> # But only hear their voice instead<eos> # They talk, they yell # In that other voice<eos> # They flirt and whisper, too<eos> # I'd love them if I had the choice<eos> # But none of them is you<eos> # Where are you # My dear?<eos> # Why can't I hear you?<eos> # How I wish that you # Were here<eos> # How I long # To be near # You
# But friends are cowards full of fear<eos> # Afraid to look at what they've missed<eos> # One day I'll be walking on the street<eos> # That crowded, bustling, faceless spread<eos> # I'll turn the corner and we'll meet<eos> # And I will be no longer dead # And I will be no longer dead<eos> # Where are you # My dear?<eos> # Why can't I hear you?<eos> # How I wish that you were here<eos> # How I long # To be near # You #
You're superwoman as far as I'm concerned.<eos> You keep the farm going, you raise four kids, get them to school every day and you don't drink a gallon of bourbon to do it.<eos> No, that cop was right.<eos> If things weren't bad at home,<eos> Ben wouldn't be in so much trouble.<eos> Fundamentally he's a good boy.<eos> Sometimes I think it'd be better if I disappeared.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> And what about the kids?<eos> They could go with you.
Ben wouldn't be in so much trouble.<eos> Fundamentally he's a good boy.<eos> Sometimes I think it'd be better if I disappeared.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> And what about the kids?<eos> They could go with you.<eos> They'd be better off in Kansas City.<eos> Father's a nut job and I'm a failure.<eos> That's runner's new car.<eos> Do you want me to come in with you?
Let's just say it's a very particular brand of patriotism.<eos> Now, if you will excuse me, I think I will treat us to another round of drinks.<eos> Oh, yes, that's a wonderful idea.<eos> When our daughter Maria said she was marrying an opera singer, we decided he would sing Mozart at the wedding.<eos> Let's keep the whole thing Austrian, I said.<eos> These are troubling times.<eos> Let us hope that this memorable evening is a harbinger of happier days.<eos> Mazel tov!<eos> It makes me sad your Aunt Adele is not here today.<eos> She would have been proud of you.
My wife and I, my-my children, everything I fucking care about in this world, and you have the nerve to...<eos> Everything that I've done, I've done to get those goddamn paintings back for you.<eos> I wish you'd never asked me.<eos> And you-you have the nerve to come here and say to me that it's over?<eos> We're so close, you...<eos> Just hang in there.<eos> The Austrians will never let go.<eos> Never.<eos> But I won't let them humiliate me again.<eos> Go back to Vienna if you have to, but this time, I'm not coming with you.
But I've never been there.<eos> How can I see that?<eos> A genetic birth transfers genes.<eos> A sensate birth transfers sense experience and memory.<eos> You are Angelica's children, so parts of her consciousness still echo in you.<eos> We weren't her first cluster?<eos> No.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The same thing that's happened to me.<eos> And that in all probability is going to happen to you.
It's almost November.<eos> You know they're watching them.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> No.<eos> Nomi said it would be fine if you threw it out right after.<eos> He wouldn't be able to understand.<eos> I'm sure everyone in Kibera would have the same idea.<eos> I know I've done things to warrant your skepticism, Capheus.<eos> But do you not believe a man can change?<eos> I've watched you.
Truly.<eos> Mama, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> You have nothing to apologize for.<eos> Come here, my baby penguin.<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> I know you could have denied it all, like so many others.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> And I have never been prouder of you.
Just call her.<eos> Hello.<eos> What are you doing? What are you filming?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Are you poking me?<eos> By the way, I told my dad I was sleeping at Jennie's.<eos> Are you taking your towel off?<eos> Should I not take my towel off?<eos> You should. You absolutely should.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Chris, you look gorgeous.<eos> Christina, please put that laundry away. I don't wanna tell you again.<eos> Can you see the stain on here?<eos> 'Cause I got two job interviews today and I really need to look good.<eos> - Interviews?<eos> Sweetie, you okay?<eos> Yeah. Mom, you look beautiful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> What's up with you?
I can't believe how good I'm getting -at sneaking past your mom.<eos> By the way, my dad, who never loves anyone, loves you.<eos> He thinks it's really, really adorable every time you talk about science and all the projects that you used to do.<eos> It's kind of amazing.<eos> Enough, please.<eos> Chris.<eos> Please have mercy on me.<eos> What's up, Patrick?<eos> Dude, the other night was dope!<eos> God, what is up with you, David?
We had to track the controller.<eos> Yeah, why didn't you call me?<eos> We all called you, David.<eos> - Really? -The guys are right behind me.<eos> - Really?<eos> -What did you do to the machine?<eos> You know, I'm just making some modifications.<eos> Modifications?<eos> Why? We did a full systems check yesterday.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
- Time me.<eos> -Time me.<eos> You guys ready for this?<eos> Did you just check out my ass?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's yesterday!<eos> This song goes out to Jessie Pierce.<eos> He is pretty smart, huh?<eos> Stay out of my perfume.<eos> I'd go back and meet you sooner.
Fuck off!<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad?<eos> Ted?<eos> What...<eos> What did they do to you?
Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad?<eos> Ted?<eos> What...<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> Dad...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What did they do to you?
-Is that it?<eos> -No.<eos> Because we've been divorced for two years.<eos> We need to move on.<eos> You need to move out.<eos> Rudy, you need to move out, too.<eos> What?<eos> There's more room in the basement for me now.<eos> And another thing, Rudy.<eos> Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting with you and Trudy at your office to discuss her investing in the manufacturing of my new idea.
I told you it was gonna be more refined.<eos> And it is.<eos> Father Martinez is here.<eos> You need to set those women up right now and get going.<eos> They're gonna be so grateful for the jobs, Joy.<eos> OK. All right.<eos> I'll go talk to those ladies.<eos> Now I finally have jobs for them.<eos> And I'll show you guys how to assemble<eos> I'm a little proud of you.
But, you didn't hear it from me, right?<eos> No, I sure didn't.<eos> But thank you.<eos> It's nice to see you.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> I'll see you around, pal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's been a long journey.<eos> Yes, it has.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Get Finn's bag.<eos> I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> Iggy!<eos> Iggy!<eos> Stay here, Claire.<eos> Iggs.<eos> Iggs.<eos> Iggy.<eos> Jesus, Iggs.<eos> What did they do to you?
It's an eight, or nine-hour drive.<eos> What about the Grand Canyon?<eos> Was that far?<eos> It's in Arizona.<eos> Yes.<eos> It is in Arizona.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is a very special birthday for us, for all of us.<eos> And we wanted to give you something really special.<eos> We're very proud of you, Leia.
You'll be fine.<eos> Do you regret it?<eos> Never regret the things you do.<eos> Regret the things you don't.<eos> It takes as much effort running in place as running a mile.<eos> I'd rather see the mile.<eos> Even if you die in here?<eos> Even if I die in here.<eos> I can't decide what the worst thing that's ever happened to me is...<eos> Being with you my whole life or being without you for the rest of it.
Stop, they're mine.<eos> I found them under her bed.<eos> "Today is my fake real birthday.<eos> I wanted to tell you I'm sorry... "<eos> - Come on.<eos> - "For blowing out the candles.<eos> "Even though without me telling you, "you wouldn't even know,<eos> "but I feel so bad about it, I have to tell you, "so I can apologize.<eos> "I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for telling you. "<eos> What kind of a hold does this man have over you?
He is still hurting you!<eos> - No!<eos> - He's hurting you right...<eos> You are hurting me!<eos> You!<eos> You did this to me!<eos> Go upstairs.<eos> Go!<eos> Thank you for all your help.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Let's get to it.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I feel it again.<eos> The pull to the light.<eos> Supreme Leader senses it.<eos> Show me again.<eos> The power of the darkness.<eos> And I will let nothing stand in our way.<eos> Show me...<eos> Grandfather... and I will finish... what you started.
Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Scramble all squads, repeat, scramble all squads!<eos> Head to higher cover and wait for our position!<eos> It's the Resistance.<eos> Go straight at them!<eos> Don't let these dogs scare you!<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - We're with you, Poe.
You're his father.<eos> There is still light in him, I know it.<eos> General... the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're my guest.<eos> Where are the others?<eos> Do you mean the murderers... traitors, and thieves you call friends?<eos> You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.<eos> You still want to kill me.<eos> That happens when you're being hunted... by a creature in a mask.
We have to be ready for that.<eos> There's an access tunnel that leads...<eos> Why are you doing that?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm trying to come up with a plan.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> What happened to you?
Hmm?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm trying to come up with a plan.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> Finn, what are you doing here?<eos> We came back for you.
Yeah.<eos> All right, buddy. Hold on.<eos> The map, it is complete.<eos> Luke.<eos> Oh, my dear friend... how I've missed you.<eos> We'll see each other again.<eos> I believe that.<eos> Thank you, my friend.<eos> Rey.<eos> May the Force be with you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Look at that.<eos> - Yeah, my boss got it for me.<eos> You know, for your wedding.<eos> Yeah, you know, he told the tailor...<eos> - Your boss goes with you to the tailor, Buds?
- No.<eos> - It will, Buds.<eos> - I'll get him.<eos> I'll get him, Jakey.<eos> Buds.<eos> Hey, Buds.<eos> Buds, listen to me.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> - I got a job at the Philharmonic...<eos> - No, I can't go with you now.
- It will, Buds.<eos> - I'll get him.<eos> I'll get him, Jakey.<eos> Buds.<eos> Hey, Buds.<eos> Buds, listen to me.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> - I got a job at the Philharmonic...<eos> - No, I can't go with you now.<eos> I can't go with you now!
- Yes, he is!<eos> - You don't understand Julius!<eos> - You don't understand, Buds!<eos> You don't understand!<eos> When I was driving, I backed into a fence post, okay?<eos> So, if anyone asks what we were doing, I was playing checkers with you all night, okay?<eos> Buds?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Don't cry.<eos> I'm with you now. I'm with you now, son.
What's the grin for, Bud?<eos> I saved the fish.<eos> It swam away.<eos> Jacob's gone.<eos> My pop said that I'll look after my brother.<eos> Never let anyone hurt him.<eos> Put your hands above your head.<eos> I have to go back for my brother.<eos> We'll find Jake before the night is over.<eos> And I'll lay him to rest right next to you.
Any special reason?<eos> No special reason at all.<eos> Right, Mavey?<eos> - What's his deal?<eos> - He's silly.<eos> It's just a beautiful night, and...<eos> Well, if you don't want to...<eos> No, no!<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I would eat a bucket of garlic to fly with you.
I only say it when I say I don't say it!<eos> Okay, kid.<eos> We get it.<eos> You can talk.<eos> Denisovich.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Just checking for cavities.<eos> It was you!<eos> Oh, my goodness, Leonard.<eos> If you really looked that hideous, I don't think I could hang out with you.
We just went out for some avocados.<eos> - Mommy!<eos> I flew!<eos> - I saw.<eos> Mother's already nutsy koo koo Nutsy koo koo<eos> Oh, dear, oh, dear Oh, my devil I have to follow protocol<eos> That ain't happening That ain't happening<eos> Mother's already...<eos> I was worried Dennis wasn't safe around other monsters.<eos> Now I don't even feel like he's safe around you.
Good girl!<eos> Don't give up! Very good, Lea!<eos> Attack right, touch left.<eos> It's good! Keep calm.<eos> Teacher!<eos> We made it! We got into the next round!<eos> Really?<eos> Well done! All of you!<eos> I'm really proud of you!<eos> Lea, I'm proud of you, too!
The English will be quiet for a while.<eos> I want to get on with our lives.<eos> We can finally extend the vegetable garden.<eos> Great... As much as you like.<eos> I'm glad I ordered an extra cask of beer.<eos> All those lost years.<eos> You were on your own because I was away.<eos> Was it a boy or a girl?<eos> A girl.<eos> I'm staying with you now.
You surely don't expect me to betray my country, do you?<eos> I expect you to do your duty to the family.<eos> Is that the only thing you could think of?<eos> My family?<eos> Don't be insolent!<eos> Our fleet has just blown your fleet to smithereens.<eos> Oh yes! I've heard about this extraordinary fleet. Am I supposed to believe that ...<eos> The Dutch republic is a fact... learn to live with it.<eos> I think you can go now.<eos> Are you all right?
Don't touch him like that!<eos> That's my father!<eos> Forgive me, I was...<eos> He's turning 60 next week.<eos> He's afraid of looking his age, you see.<eos> That's why he dresses so well.<eos> Why he likes taking long walks.<eos> His hand feels cold.<eos> Why is it so cold?<eos> I'm here for you now.
Yes, sir.<eos> We need more coal, Finlay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thomas!<eos> Thomas.<eos> Thomas, listen, I need to talk to you.<eos> Well, Edith, now's not a good time.<eos> Lucille is inside.<eos> No, I don't want to talk to Lucille.<eos> I want to talk to you.
"Edinburgh."<eos> You've already tried, and failed, to raise capital in London, Edinburgh, Milan.<eos> And now you're here.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> It's been working perfectly for an hour.<eos> We've done it.<eos> We've done it, Lucille.<eos> I can't wait for Edith to see it.<eos> Edith?<eos> I did this with you.
Yes, but it happened.<eos> Lucille.<eos> Lucille.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Thomas?<eos> She's coming.<eos> I'm going to get us out of here.<eos> I will get help.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I'll come back for you.
And that's what I intend to do.<eos> ...given them roots and now they can...<eos> Sonny and Sunaina's wonderful families have given them roots and now... - Sunaina?<eos> - You can't come in.<eos> I don't want you to see the dress until Friday.<eos> I need my clipboard.<eos> You know the names of the guests.<eos> Why do you need a clipboard?<eos> It's just an excuse to come in.<eos> - I must apologize to you.

What's goin' on here?<eos> What the hell did you do to my boat?<eos> Man, fuck this boat!<eos> We taking the evidence that you framed your son-in-law with, you sick son of a bitch.<eos> How could you do this to me, Martin?<eos> Ten years in prison?<eos> !<eos> James, you realize that I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> I'm very fond of you, but Himalayan Tiger tanked and I had to get the money from somewhere.<eos> I had no choice. It was you or me.
My mom is gonna turn my life into a living hell if I don't hang out with you.<eos> I can't overstate how annoying she's being about this.<eos> She's basically like the LeBron James of nagging.<eos> LeBron James plays basketball.<eos> I know who LeBron James is.<eos> Look, I know I'm not doing you any favors here.<eos> What I'm asking is for you to do me a favor.<eos> You want a favor from me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just let me hang out with you for one day.
Snip, snip, snip.<eos> She was very mad.<eos> Can we take a little break and have a little taste?<eos> You boys are old enough to have a little taste, right?<eos> Can we take a teeny break, just have a little taste?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.<eos> Greg, will you join us?<eos> Oh, I'm okay. Oh, come on, don't be a party pooper!<eos> Now we can get back to our interview.<eos> So, basically, this whole setup is so that, you know I can talk to you, you can talk to me and I can see you, and you can see me.
It's just that prom is tonight and...<eos> Let me ask you something. What is this?<eos> What is up with the arm touching?<eos> Are you just being friendly, or is this some calculated maneuver to get me to do whatever you want?<eos> 'Cause you have to understand what it does when a beautiful, sexy otherwise thoughtful girl touches the arm of a scrawny, pasty groundhog-faced kid.<eos> It's an act of cruelty.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm done.<eos> I'm done with you.
- Why not?<eos> - Because.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - For a ride.<eos> Can I come too?<eos> Sure.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Look, it's nice, isn't it?<eos> I want to go back home?<eos> Where did you take her, you fucking pervert?
- Sure.<eos> - Aron, come on in, dear.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I want you to come in now.<eos> - But why?<eos> I'm playing.<eos> - Just do as you're told.<eos> - Damn!<eos> Don't open the door.<eos> - Are you alright?
Of course.<eos> I mean, who could refuse the opportunity to pay for the right to shop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we can't be too careful.<eos> A crisis like this doesn't always bring out the best side of people.<eos> It reveals character, you're right there.<eos> Yes, it reveals character.<eos> I tell you, you know?<eos> It's people wanting something for nothing is what got us into this mess in the first place.<eos> I'm with you there, Stan.
Is that your sister?<eos> Yeah.<eos> See you next week maybe.<eos> Of course.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Alright.<eos> -Bye.<eos> -Bye.<eos> It was nice meeting you, Nell's sister.
The audition.<eos> She's almost already too old.<eos> It's like how I need to keep studying.<eos> I understand.<eos> There is people in town who still check their mailbox every morning even though there hasn't been mail in forever.<eos> It's a fugue state.<eos> It's like a what?<eos> Oh, it's like when you forget everything.<eos> And you're in this weird state.<eos> You don't realize anything that's happened to you before.
Are you okay?<eos> No!<eos> Ow, oh, ow.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here.<eos> Just lay down.<eos> If you don't listen to your back then it's just going to fight you forever, so here.
Okay.<eos> Push!<eos> Push!<eos> It's coming, one more push!<eos> One more push!<eos> One more push!<eos> Oh my god!<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> Oh, I've got you.
That motherfucker!<eos> - I think he's saying "tuxedo".<eos> -Tuxedo?<eos> God, it hurts so bad.<eos> Who the fuck's wearing a tuxedo?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Okay, first of all, this isn't a tuxedo, this is a morning suit.<eos> Don't you watch Downton Abbey?<eos> I was standing right there beside you!
I'm not talking about the job<eos> I think you're lying<eos> I don't believe you can just turn off fear or love<eos> I don't believe anyone can.<eos> You're either a person or something else.<eos> Which is it?<eos> Are you asking me, or yourself?<eos> You can't fight who you are, Katia.<eos> You'll lose.<eos> Is that what happened to you?
Dose him again.<eos> You could kill him.<eos> Do it.<eos> Oh, fuck it!<eos> It's quite enough, John.<eos> You can wait outside, all of you.<eos> It's okay, John.<eos> Petya.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I am going to be completely honest with you.
You could kill him.<eos> Do it.<eos> Oh, fuck it!<eos> It's quite enough, John.<eos> You can wait outside, all of you.<eos> It's okay, John.<eos> Petya.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I am going to be completely honest with you.<eos> I admire you.
- What does that mean?<eos> It means he was never in that helicopter.<eos> Get them out.<eos> What was your mistake?<eos> I don't make mistakes.<eos> You needed me to know that you were better than me.<eos> Where is he?<eos> On the roof.<eos> When this is done, I will kill you.<eos> Your mother would be proud of you.
Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> That means you and me are on the money.<eos> Unless you think you can do that on your own, too.<eos> DAWAI: I do okay.<eos> You do, huh?<eos> Let's see how you handle the financial sector.<eos> Thanks, Stanley.<eos> MARK: My eye's on you.
NSA won't care.<eos> They think because of you, now we have Black Widow.<eos> You have to run.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna refuse an order?<eos> You escaped.<eos> We reconnect in Jakarta.<eos> Look, your bosses can add two and two.<eos> I'm not turning you in.<eos> Do I go with you or Nick?
We're on.<eos> Emergency!<eos> Please. (ALL SHOUTING)<eos> It's all about if I can get close enough fast enough.<eos> NICK: (ON PHONE) Hey, I told you.<eos> You and Kassar, alone.<eos> Five men, two floors below.<eos> NICK: The team two floors below.<eos> LIEN: And two gunmen with them.<eos> NICK: And the two guys with you?
Please.<eos> Oh no. Please.<eos> We need napkins!<eos> No, look, listen, we can talk about this when the money's right.<eos> Because other... no!<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Hi, Derek.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Can I talk to you?
You can't get Scott on the radio?<eos> Nope.<eos> Nah, I think he's up ahead.<eos> Best not to stare too long at the summit.<eos> That's a long way to go, man.<eos> Head down, one step at a time.<eos> You got it, boss.<eos> You seen Dale?<eos> Yeah, I did, he wasn't looking too good but Neal seemed to have a handle on the situation.<eos> Tried to get you on the radio.
Camp One, Pumori.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There you go, I got the old sly rotter.<eos> Listen, I think you're on the wrong mountain, there.<eos> Look, I can't talk, we gotta get out of here.<eos> All right, mate.<eos> Well, listen, you take care on the kiddie slope.<eos> I'm gonna get back to the real thing.<eos> Yeah, don't worry, Rob.<eos> I'll keep an eye on you.
Come here.<eos> We did it!<eos> You did it!<eos> Yasuko.<eos> - Seven.<eos> - Seven.<eos> - Seven Summits.<eos> - Seven.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.
That's good.<eos> Yeah, you gotta get that mask working.<eos> Yeah?<eos> The sun's gonna come up and, you know, you can get warmer, you can get moving.<eos> - Guy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Guy.<eos> Harold was here.<eos> Where's he gone?<eos> Rob, is Doug with you?
- Box.<eos> - What did he say? "Box"?<eos> - I think you just saved that guy's life.<eos> - We both did.<eos> Come on, I held the flashlight.<eos> I just hope that he's okay, you know.<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> - I think I'm going to stay.<eos> Yeah, at least until he gets out of the emergency room.<eos> - Then I'll wait with you.
- From Vienna? - Yes.<eos> I am Hannah and this is my daughter, Ruth.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Sarah and this is my son, Ira.<eos> Ira?<eos> Ira?<eos> - Good Shabbes.<eos> Good Shabbes.<eos> Good Sha...<eos> The following days were consumed with plotting ways in which I could talk to you... now that you had found a home in my small community.
My pants were too short always.<eos> Pants still are too short.<eos> I mean, growing up on a cattle ranch, everybody I knew was the same.<eos> Everybody you know is... you know, fourth generation cattle ranchers.<eos> - Jealous.<eos> - Why?<eos> I wanted to be like everyone else when I was little.<eos> The reason I like you is because you're nothing like everyone else.<eos> You're not so bad yourself.<eos> I think before I met you, the closest thing I came to cattle was... - steak.
I understand ...<eos> I'm a monster!<eos> I can not believe it.<eos> I'm a monster!<eos> And I found you.<eos> I'm a hero.<eos> A great day!<eos> Halt not!<eos> I got to be a hero.<eos> I'm going back with you, Agent Skunk.
Fuck, mate.<eos> You've had a really shit couple of years.<eos> It's good to see you, though.<eos> Fuckin' life, ey?<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I can't even imagine what it is you must be going through.<eos> It's made me think a lot about my past.<eos> Addressing it, you know...<eos> the things I've done.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about something.
- He hates you.<eos> - What would you know?<eos> Just trust me.<eos> You coming?<eos> Oh!<eos> Check that out.<eos> Jackpot.<eos> Dinner and a show.<eos> How do you know it's not two blokes in there?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Just one sec.<eos> You sure as hell ain't the IT guy so you better start talking... before I break that finger six different ways... and stick it straight right where the sun doesn't shine.<eos> Agent Hobbs, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm also the last man on Earth whose computer you wanna be hacking into.<eos> You just earned yourself a dance with the devil, boy.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Like I said, I'm here for the team that crippled my brother.<eos> There ain't no goddamn team.<eos> It was just one man, and he's standing right in front of you.
He misses the bullets.<eos> Let him settle in.<eos> Give him time.<eos> How does nine months sound?<eos> I'm having another baby.<eos> And you didn't tell him, did you?<eos> You gotta tell him.<eos> I don't want him to be disappointed with this life.<eos> With me.<eos> He will never be disappointed with you.
- Check.<eos> - Check.<eos> I'm good, let's do this.<eos> Hello? Please man!<eos> Get me outta here, somebody!<eos> No!<eos> The trees!<eos> Shit.<eos> Sit tight, Roman.<eos> We'll come back for you.
Letty, Letty, talk to me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Guys I can't hold it. I'm losing the final gate.<eos> You gotta get out of there.<eos> Tear off the dash!<eos> Go through it.<eos> Wait, just hold on man.<eos> Time to unleash the beast.<eos> Go!<eos> Stay with me, I got you.
We're gonna go take down Shaw then.<eos> Go get changed.<eos> We should go now.<eos> Just you, your team and me.<eos> I thought you said at dawn?<eos> My guys are racers.<eos> Best drivers in the world.<eos> But they ain't killers.<eos> Told you he'd say that.<eos> I know you too well, Dom, and I'm going with you.
The night we got married.<eos> Who has the ring?<eos> Will this do?<eos> With this silver necklace, love...<eos> We have eternity in this moment.<eos> You will never be alone again.<eos> I vow, wherever you go, I go.<eos> You ride, I ride.<eos> You fight, I fight.<eos> And if you ever die on me, Dominic Toretto... I'm gonna die with you.
Tony drove, Nicolette is jealous.<eos> Hi, I'm Tracy.<eos> Hi, Mamie-Claire.<eos> Nicolette.<eos> Mamie-Claire.<eos> I'm Tony.<eos> Wait, don't tell me, Mamie-Claire.<eos> I thought we weren't speaking.<eos> Right, I want to change that.<eos> And I have something that I really need to talk to you and Dylan about.
Apparently, she got recruited by Tufts for crew and then went but never did it.<eos> I mean, that's the kind of person she is, just sly and shitty.<eos> I would do that if I could.<eos> I wasn't good at sports.<eos> Yeah, I would too, but it wouldn't be like my character.<eos> It would just be something I did.<eos> When does that become the same thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You look amazing.<eos> Why are all these kids with you?
I wasn't good at sports.<eos> Yeah, I would too, but it wouldn't be like my character.<eos> It would just be something I did.<eos> When does that become the same thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You look amazing.<eos> Why are all these kids with you?<eos> They aren't kids. If they're kids, we are.<eos> I'm an associate and her almost-sister.<eos> I really need to talk to you.
There are ten questions here, all equally important, for you to answer.<eos> Brooke...<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Ruth signed me in.<eos> I just saw a side of him that I didn't know before.<eos> It's strange to not really know someone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you liked Brooke.<eos> He told me that she worships you.
Not with those things running around.<eos> This will be the safest place for you, Stephanie.<eos> You heard the Warden.<eos> We need to move fast and you're injured.<eos> No.<eos> You need to stay still.<eos> It'll help with the blood loss.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> I want to go with you.<eos> I'll stay with you, Steph.
You killed Will.<eos> No...<eos> She killed ...<eos> Mom!<eos> You've killed us all.<eos> And...<eos> Three!<eos> Higher!<eos> Higher, higher!<eos> -Are you alright?
-I was just trying to help!<eos> -Don't.<eos> Yeah, this is going to be fun.<eos> Everybody calm down alright?<eos> Caleb.<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off!<eos> - You alright?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Are you okay?
How about a kiss for our man in blue, hey?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Kiss me, kiss me.<eos> Eugh! Trollop!<eos> Problem with your Dungatar team is inexperience.<eos> See, our Winyerp boys are seasoned professionals.<eos> They're not likely to be distracted by some good-looking sheila.<eos> Gertrude Pratt.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Gert, please.<eos> Gert, please help me.<eos> Miss Harridene!<eos> Miss Harridene!<eos> Miss Harridene!<eos> Miss Harridene!<eos> Help!<eos> Stand really, really still, Dunnybum.<eos> Or I'll come round to your house tonight and kill your mother, the slut.<eos> And when she's dead, I'll get... you.
You never came back for me.<eos> You came back for them.<eos> Well, go on, make them their dresses.<eos> Make them think they're classy.<eos> They'll still hate you.<eos> Tape measure.<eos> Oh, your centre line's off.<eos> Got to start from the beginning again.<eos> Get all these pins out and start again.<eos> What's wrong with you?
I used to watch you from here, you and Reg and Barney, up on top of that silo.<eos> You had that...<eos> You had that telescope and looked for...<eos> You used to look for rockets from outer space.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Superman.<eos> You don't scare me, Tilly Dunnage.<eos> In fact, I reckon you could make some bloke pretty happy.<eos> Tilly.<eos> I'll look after you.
You and me.<eos> Forget all about Dungatar.<eos> Leave them to themselves and fate.<eos> We...<eos> You can't just... ask someone to... run away with you out of... out of the blue.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> You should take Barney home.<eos> Do you want me on my knees, Till? That it?<eos> OK.<eos> I can't be with you, Teddy.
Stop it!<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it, Teddy.<eos> He cornered you like this, didn't he?<eos> Made sure you couldn't scream.<eos> And then he said something to you.<eos> What did he say?<eos> "Stand... stand... stand really, really still, Dunnybum," "or I'll come around to your house tonight" "and kill your mother, the slut."<eos> "And then, when she's dead..." "I'll get you."
That's right.<eos> Something smart.<eos> Suitable for entertaining.<eos> And I want you to eat, Myrtle.<eos> I met your father when I was 20.<eos> I was very naive.<eos> You don't remember him coming to the house?<eos> - No. - Oh.<eos> Well, I wasn't naive enough to marry him.<eos> He didn't talk to you much.
But I adore marijuana cakes and hash lamingtons, which I... bake and unlawfully supply to my fellow dope fiends.<eos> In addition to my drug dealing, I'm also guilty of perversion, which I hope these signed personal sketches... Sergeant Farrat!<eos> ..will make abundantly clear.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Tilly, it seems fate has caught up with me at last.<eos> But... but... you didn't do anything.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> To you, 25 years ago.<eos> Perhaps I can finally make it right.<eos> I'm glad to have met you, Tilly Dunnage.
Hey, what's going on?<eos> Time to go!<eos> Open up!<eos> Cat,getin throughawindow, not the front door!<eos> Openup!<eos> Comeondown!<eos> You don't scare me!<eos> You fucking stink!<eos> Whoa!<eos> I'll come back for you.
Withnosubstantialleads and no end in sight, amassivemanhuntinvolving local and federal law enforcement continues.<eos> Oh,hey.<eos> Where've you been?<eos> You were supposed to be at birth class.<eos> What?<eos> No, S-- Fuck.<eos> No,no,no .<eos> Sonja!<eos> Listen, I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, I'll make it up to you!
Yeah.<eos> You don't... You don't seem convinced.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean what if we ripped him out of doggie heaven or something?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> What if...<eos> We don't know if he wanted to come back.<eos> We just took him.<eos> What is it with you?
OK?<eos> Help me.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No, stop.<eos> - I thought you were my friend.<eos> - I am your friend.<eos> But you're not being yourself right now.<eos> We still don't understand...<eos> "...what's happening to you."
- Meaning what?<eos> - It's automated. If it thinks there's any danger of a contaminant escaping,<eos> - the whole place just shuts down.<eos> - What about the elevator?<eos> We tried it.<eos> Gonna have to figure something else out.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Zoe, what did you do?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've been in here with you the entire time.
This is not your fault, OK? I did this.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I'm so sorry, sweetie, OK?<eos> We're gonna fix this. We can fix this together, OK?<eos> We can do anything, you hear me?<eos> It's you and me.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. OK?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm with you.
What do you think is happening?<eos> I don't think she's coming, old boy.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go on, off you go.<eos> That's it. Go on.<eos> - Morning, my love.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Bring them in, John.<eos> - Miss Everdene's here now, so you better do your best work.<eos> I'm looking at you, Coggan.
Now turn in your I.R.L. Take your promotion.<eos> Go home.<eos> Turn around.<eos> She's clear.<eos> Daniella, what happened?<eos> I've been worried sick.<eos> Vicente, I never wanted to testify.<eos> I begged Felipe not to betray you, but he wouldn't listen to me.<eos> Now I'm all alone.<eos> I'm here for you, cariño.
- Me, too!<eos> Maciek from Atomic. The biggest Disco Polo star.<eos> Wherever Maciek goes, opportunities follow.<eos> They like to be underneath when I'm on top lam so sorry! I didn't mean to...<eos> Why am I always so unlucky?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> But I am your biggest idol.<eos> Well, that's different.<eos> I'm Anka. Gensonina, actually.<eos> I always dreamed to meet you.
And if Polak likes it, every Pole will like it.<eos> You have one minute.<eos> I will fucking kill you!<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> Get me the fucking sword!<eos> No one's visited me in ages.<eos> It's all yours?<eos> These planets.<eos> You know how hard it is to be a star'?<eos> They follow you everywhere, never stop talking, asking, making your life impossible.
- I want you to sing it.<eos> - Oh, no, Daniel.<eos> You know that I only sing my own songs.<eos> You'll sing that and we are even.<eos> I didn't make you enough money?<eos> Remember those two gentlemen who played golf at your place?<eos> They billed you and I paid.<eos> You don't say.<eos> Nobody asked you to.<eos> I couldn't let anything bad happen to you.
You should agree with the dialogue, that's good, but don't believe it too much, okay?<eos> Not believe it too much?<eos> Stay a bit to one side, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong!<eos> Just a little hitch with the guy picking up Huggins.<eos> What little hitch?<eos> His car broke down, but we're resolving it.<eos> You're all incompetent, thirty people, thirty incompetents.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - I'll go with you later, if need be.
"Livia I'm sorry"?<eos> Mom, it's me, Margherita.<eos> Sorry!<eos> You're sorry Livia's not here?<eos> You're sorry you can't do Latin with her.<eos> You don't want to be seen like this, right?<eos> Excuse me, five minutes.<eos> Another five minutes, then they'll kick me out.<eos> Anyway, I don't know why, but Livia's doing a little better in Latin.<eos> When you come home, she wants to brush-up with you.
What was the name of Bronwen's college at Oxford?<eos> Johanna, I simply can't.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, golly.<eos> Look at the time.<eos> I really must be going.<eos> It was lovely to see you, Alastair.<eos> Thank you ever-so-much for letting me confide in you.<eos> I feel that I could share anything with you.
You go down, get your face seen a bit... then you meet me 'round the back later, we climb up the side of the building, break through the window, grab the painting.<eos> Oh, diabolical.<eos> Let's review it a few more times, shall we?<eos> It's just the old smash-and-grab routine, sir.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> This is just the old smash-and-grab business.<eos> Smash-and-grab.<eos> - Jock?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - I am so very proud of you.
Oh, that's gross!<eos> We are in love.<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> Emil!<eos> - Alastair!<eos> - Do it now!<eos> Good show, Martland!<eos> Bit redundant, really, as he's dead.<eos> - Alastair, what are you doing here?<eos> - I followed you.
Yes?<eos> Why do you train?<eos> Two people.<eos> They'll die by my hand.<eos> They killed my parents.<eos> Blood must be washed by blood.<eos> When I turn 20, I will kill them.<eos> You have two enemies.<eos> One saw you for the first time today.<eos> The other... has followed you for years.
No matter what it is, what you do is right, Duk-gi.<eos> Promise me...<eos> You won't let me go.<eos> Yes.<eos> I promise, Duk-gi.<eos> We've captured Sui-rang.<eos> Sui-rang...<eos> Sui-rang...<eos> Stop '(u-baew.!<eos> I didn't come to see you.
Promise me...<eos> You won't let me go.<eos> Yes.<eos> I promise, Duk-gi.<eos> We've captured Sui-rang.<eos> Sui-rang...<eos> Sui-rang...<eos> Stop '(u-baew.!<eos> I didn't come to see you.<eos> I've come to die with you.
That was no good.<eos> - Er...<eos> Jack.<eos> I've got a confession to make and I'm just gonna...<eos> - I have, yeah.<eos> Let me go first.<eos> I... - OK.<eos> I've never heard of Black Pant Wash.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanna be honest with you, because honesty is very important...
- I'm gonna go get us a drink.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Nancy?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It's Nancy Patterson.<eos> - Do we know each other?<eos> - Sean. Sean Bellamy.<eos> Class 5G, Saint Andrew's Comprehensive.<eos> '88 to '93.<eos> I sat next to you in chemistry for five years.
- With tongues?<eos> - No tongues.<eos> - Oh!<eos> But in the toilets.<eos> - Yeah, in the toilets.<eos> And it has to be tonight.<eos> Otherwise I won't find you again because you have no online presence.<eos> - Can I go now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But I'll be watching you.
- Bert and Fran.<eos> Bert and Fran.<eos> I liked that speech.<eos> I liked it a lot.<eos> Cheers, Dad.<eos> - Much better than last year's.<eos> - Yeah, that wasn't very...<eos> Come here.<eos> Stronger thighs.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Hey, man, thanks for everything.<eos> Just wanna talk to you about my job.<eos> - You see your new office? - Hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, um...<eos> Well, what's it like?<eos> This is a big deal, this promotion.<eos> Did they hire your assistant?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Very proud of you.
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.<eos> I'm gonna call you.<eos> Listen, you want to be in somebody's ring...<eos> You don't have to call me.<eos> All right, smile!<eos> How you doing?<eos> This was taken from the 10th round of the first fight, right?<eos> Good call.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> I heard about a third fight between you and Apollo, behind closed doors.
I been fighting my whole life.<eos> I ain't got a choice.<eos> It's always about a choice.<eos> I was in the ring.<eos> I saw how it went down.<eos> That fight should've been stopped.<eos> I should have stopped it.<eos> Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.<eos> Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.<eos> I think he'd rather be here, talking with you.
Something like that.<eos> Does he train you?<eos> My pop died before I was born.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> So what made you wanna sing?<eos> It makes me feel alive.<eos> Where's your next show?<eos> That place that you saw me at, Johnny Brenda's.<eos> I got a residency there so we're back on Friday.<eos> Can I roll with you?
Good to see you.<eos> Hey, champ.<eos> How you doing, bro?<eos> This guy is so good with the mitts, he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.<eos> He's got a lot of knowledge.<eos> And Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.<eos> Hope we don't need him.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Welcome to Philly, brother. - Pleasure.<eos> - Glad to work with you.
I'm popping as fast as I can.<eos> I'm trying to push off my back foot like you told me.<eos> Hey, Donnie. Come here.<eos> I came out here to work with you, though.<eos> This is how I work, okay?<eos> There's some things I can't do.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I can never hold the pads like that.<eos> But I'm looking at you.<eos> I'm working with you.
- You okay?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> It's out.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> All right.<eos> Just let me walk.<eos> Just...<eos> I'm good.<eos> - Sure? - Yeah.<eos> Hey. What's wrong with you?
All right.<eos> A lot of room.<eos> Didn't we have enough surprises for one weekend?<eos> That's not me.<eos> Very nice colors.<eos> Why don't you take 'em into the other room and see how well they fit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, champ.<eos> All right, Donnie.<eos> I'm proud of you.
His arm is long.<eos> Because you're playing his game, Donnie.<eos> Be patient.<eos> One step, one punch.<eos> - One round at a time.<eos> - There you go.<eos> One step, one punch, one round at a time.<eos> Round five of a scheduled 12 and already it's a far different fight than most experts expected.<eos> He's just a pretender.<eos> He's lucky to be in the same ring with you hitting him.
You taught me that.<eos> _<eos> Its almost one oclock Maggie, get your gloves and help Mrs Ellyn.<eos> And reason said to her:<eos> Silence.<eos> What do you hear?<eos> And she said:<eos> I hear the sound of feet.<eos> A thousand times ten thousands, and thousands and thousands and they beat this way.<eos> They are the feet of those that shall follow you.
I move like a fucking shadow. He's gone all sorts of rogue.<eos> Sharon says he really did quit.<eos> Elaine couldn't stop him.<eos> He's out for blood.<eos> Yeah, real tough guy in his Louis Vuitton backpack.<eos> Nancy, do you see that?<eos> It's the man from the fire.<eos> I'm following him.<eos> Oh. Exciting!<eos> And I'm following you, following him, so I'm having quite a day, here.
- Yes.<eos> - You like Italian food?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You like bicycles?<eos> Lance Armstrong has risen to superstar status after winning the world's toughest cycling race for the second successive year.<eos> Now the crowd is warming up.<eos> Listen for the cheers.<eos> The USA flags are flying high as they have done for a third year now, for Lance Armstrong.<eos> Any time you're here, you should feel at home.<eos> The people of New York City love you, admire you.
Dude, you got female company.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Hey, what a surprise.<eos> Is everything alright?<eos> Ya, everything is fine.<eos> Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood.<eos> Is this a bad time?<eos> Oh, no. I was just taking a nap.<eos> Oh ya?<eos> Can I come lay down with you?
If you insist.<eos> Maybe some milk and cookies?<eos> You want to come in my house?<eos> I mean, unless I'm gonna wake your husband.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Not at all, not at all.<eos> I was just, I- - I--<eos> Oh...<eos> Hello.<eos> Is he with you?
Let's just eat out quiche and--<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey! We need this, okay?<eos> This is gonna energize us.<eos> Get us over the hump.<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What'd I say?<eos> So, what are you two whispering about?<eos> Ted was just telling me how pretty he thinks you are.
Alright, who's up now?<eos> I think I know who's up next!<eos> Billie do you know who's up next?<eos> You're up next!<eos> It's Billie's butt.<eos> She doesn't want to play.<eos> Of course she does.<eos> She just needs a little help.<eos> C'mon, help her out.<eos> Don't worry, we're here for you.
Not bye!<eos> [knock knock] MUSIC<eos> Quick quesiton.<eos> Are you seeing anyone? Or engaged or a lesbian?<eos> No. No. No.<eos> Jen, You're the greatest girl ever.<eos> Okay?<eos> I've never been able to make a relationship last more than 6 months.<eos> And now I know why.<eos> Because none of them could measure up to you!
Why did you do that?<eos> BecauseI wantedyoutosee somethingyoucouldn'thave.<eos> Has this all been about her, Jeff?<eos> Has this all been about Jennifer fuckin' Peters? Maybe.<eos> Well the jokes on you, buddy, because she loves us!<eos> And she thinks you're a freak!<eos> A peeing in a bag creep!<eos> Idon'tbelieveyou !<eos> Oh, you better believe it, Jeff.<eos> She was laughing at you.
- Excuse me, miss? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Um, actually, yeah... how many beers are we allowed to order at once?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> No one has ever asked that before.<eos> Okay, great, so there's no rule on that.<eos> Uh, why don't you give me six, then, please?<eos> How about you make it an even dozen?<eos> How about I start you with two apiece and then we just take it from there?<eos> Sure, if you want to be lugging beers back and forth the entire flight.<eos> I guess that's, uh, up to you.
Breast cancer.<eos> So You're dying, then?<eos> No.<eos> It's in remission.<eos> I'm better now.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I beat it.<eos> It could come back, though.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck are you doing?<eos> I don't do porn.<eos> I don't think it's a problem.<eos> I think everybody's got to make a living.<eos> I don't have a problem with it.<eos> - I don't do porn.<eos> - All right, whatever.<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to pay her a compliment.<eos> He's lying.<eos> I got to be honest with you, you know?
I spent so much time counting everybody else's blessings, I don't know that I ever had the opportunity to count them for myself.<eos> Maybe now you'll have some objectivity.<eos> Isn't that...<eos> Maybe that's what's happening.<eos> Okay, so look, Jose...<eos> Look, no, no, no, no.<eos> I think she's gonna call.<eos> They always come back.<eos> No, yeah, I know, they always come back, we always split up.<eos> I mean, isn't it possible that some people are just meant to be miserable lonely, old, childless and alone living with you?
- Yeah, I am, too.<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> - Yeah, I was surprised.<eos> What happened to your whole, "All exes are dead to me and never pick up the phone"?<eos> You didn't read the statute of limitations clause?<eos> - Lawrence didn't Facebook you that?<eos> - No, I missed that.<eos> Yeah, well, after four years, I pick up the phone.<eos> You know, maybe if you kept it in your pants, who knows?<eos> It was really awful what I did to you.
You get better service in Mexico.<eos> Yeah, Mexico.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I gave them every surname I could think of.<eos> Did you marry somebody else?<eos> I'm in Santa Barbara.<eos> You're in Santa...<eos> It said you were on your honeymoon on Facebook and Gus dreamed a dream I had sort of that you were in Mexico.<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
Ijust, like... I'm very high, and I just kind of need this interaction to be over.<eos> You serious?<eos> Fuck you, Amy.<eos> You are not nice.<eos> I'm totally nice.<eos> Maybe you should consider changing your ways.<eos> My "ways"? Mmm-hmm.<eos> You would love having a family.<eos> You sound like Steven.<eos> I wish I could break up with you.
Don't you want me to be happy? I mean...<eos> You're building him up, and you're gonna let yourself in for a big fall.<eos> He's gonna break your heart.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> I'll tell Temembe to come get you.<eos> Amy, don't leave like this.<eos> I don't like it when you don't talk to me for a while.<eos> Thank you so much for doing this with me.<eos> No, I wanna be doing this with you.
Last call for alcohol!<eos> I gotta get out of here.<eos> You wanna get out of here?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> Shit, Donald.<eos> It's so nice to hang with you outside the office.
Sit down.<eos> It started and it is on.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Did I miss anything?<eos> Now, I know that relationships can be terrifying, but you don'tjust bail out at the first sign of trouble.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> Aaron, choking under intense pressure.<eos> I did not choke, Marv.<eos> Look, if he's not happy and she's not the right one for him, then, obviously, it's just not meant to be.<eos> Sometimes, the right person happens to be sitting right in front of you.
It's the worst thing in the world.<eos> It really sucks.<eos> She's doomed.<eos> No, she'll be fine.<eos> She's got us.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> I miss Dad, too.<eos> I know that.<eos> Come here.<eos> I got you.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted to show you I can work hard and put myself out there, you know?<eos> I got that.<eos> And not be afraid to fail.<eos> No. I got the metaphor.<eos> 'Cause with the dance, I wanted to show you us.<eos> Yeah, I got the metaphor.<eos> It's like I really wanna try. Yeah.<eos> I wanna try with you.
He won't.<eos> You got bad tooth?<eos> He's in here so I don't lose him.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> What?<eos> The world.<eos> My house with the hammock.<eos> And Grandma and Grandpa.<eos> And you?
Wait a minute.<eos> It's not Monroe, is it?<eos> My God, Minnie, that is so sick.<eos> Don't you think he's kind of cute?<eos> No, I do not think he's cute.<eos> He's so old.<eos> Minnie, he sleeps with your mom.<eos> Only 'cause he has to, otherwise she'll suspect something.<eos> I don't know, Minnie.<eos> Don't you kind of feel like he's taking advantage of you or something?
I mean, I'm glad your hair's not like that.<eos> I'm just saying it looks cute on her.<eos> Boys love Kimmie.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I think she looks better in pants than she does in skirts.<eos> Her ankles are sort of thick, I think.<eos> Mom.<eos> I don't want to brag, but I was quite a piece when I was your age.<eos> I don't know what's wrong with you.
My mother doesn't touch me if she can avoid it.<eos> She used to touch me a lot, in a motherly way, when I was little.<eos> But then...<eos> There's something sexual about Minnie's need for physical affection from you.<eos> It's not natural.<eos> Hey!<eos> Come on, lazy bones!<eos> Help me.<eos> Come on, Minnie.<eos> I wanna dance with you, too.
♪ Cats and dogs, squabbles never ending ♪<eos> ♪ Even with so much legislation pending. ♪<eos> Homie, how did you end up at the casino?<eos> Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after-dinner night cap...<eos> Dad, Mom trusted us with a secret.<eos> But she hasn't come home yet, and we're worried she's in trouble.<eos> What? !<eos> Mom's counting cards at the casino!<eos> Oh, if anything happens to Marge, we'll all be orphans!<eos> I'm coming for you, baby.
He's not using it.<eos> Yeah, you really sound like you miss him.<eos> Just lay low for a month. You'll get the rest of your cut.<eos> I better had.<eos> When haven't you? Huh?<eos> We ever screw you?<eos> Yeah, I didn't think so. So just shut your face for 30.<eos> Don't much like waiting.<eos> Get a hobby.<eos> 30 days, then I come looking for you... and you.
Make your phone call.<eos> Me and the old bastard'll take care of it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Penny?<eos> It's Alex.<eos> Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.<eos> - Leave us alone. - Listen to me...<eos> No, you listen to me.<eos> You stay away from my family.<eos> Is that piece of shit with you?
Penny?<eos> It's Alex.<eos> Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.<eos> - Leave us alone. - Listen to me...<eos> No, you listen to me.<eos> You stay away from my family.<eos> Is that piece of shit with you?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> He's...<eos> He shouldn't even be with you. You'll kill him.
Let's go!<eos> What a fucking whore you are!<eos> "Deal," you said. "Let's make a deal." You trying to play me, Claire?<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> What?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because you're a fucking liar!<eos> What is wrong with you?
- I sent some flowers.<eos> - We got 'em.<eos> Hey. Can I tag this thing or what?<eos> Is that a cliché?<eos> No.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> Wow, you have been saving that one.<eos> You just had to wait for Quinn to get hit by a car.<eos> I think she's done being shown off now.<eos> Listen, we just wanted to see you, Quinn. Okay.
He's out talking to his boss about it right now.<eos> - It's like this whole big situation.<eos> - That sucks.<eos> Well, I don't know, what do you do when you need to go to the bathroom?<eos> No! No.<eos> No way.<eos> You're kidding me!<eos> - Hey, is that Alex?<eos> - What?<eos> Standing right next to you.
- Lily, I know you were trying to reach her.<eos> We know that you wanted her to read this letter.<eos> Lily, we need you now!<eos> Help us.<eos> Dad.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We had some help.<eos> Who?<eos> Someone else is here with us.<eos> Someone who really wants to talk to you.
Who?<eos> Someone else is here with us.<eos> Someone who really wants to talk to you.<eos> Mom.<eos> - I need to know that this is real.<eos> - Okay.<eos> She's saying something about a stage, an audition.<eos> She says that when you were on stage, you wanted to know if she was there.<eos> She was there.<eos> And she was so proud of you.
Theo.<eos> His name was Theo.<eos> Of course it was.<eos> And, uh, where did you meet this Theo?<eos> On vacation.<eos> When you were...<eos> Seventeen.<eos> Was it just the one night?<eos> And he was older?<eos> What'd he do to you?
Shit.<eos> Beautiful day, isn't it?<eos> Hey, sorry it took me so long to get back.<eos> Things got a little crazy at the cabin.<eos> Bill and Sue finally got back with their son and granddaughter, and I decided to throw them an impromptu welcome home party.<eos> You know, I'd have brought you some cake, but I didn't think you'd like it much.<eos> Katie's a sweet kid, but she isn't much of a baker.<eos> Besides, looks like someone had a party of their own last night.<eos> Still, you're learning.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Help, Ella!<eos> Ella!<eos> Help!<eos> You're too late.<eos> I already called the police.<eos> They know where I am!<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> That's not what your phone says.<eos> What are you gonna do to me?<eos> To you?
What?<eos> The...<eos> That's not gonna cut through the door.<eos> No, I don't expect it will.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, I can't.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then you'll die here.<eos> Why are you like this?<eos> What happened to you?
The...<eos> That's not gonna cut through the door.<eos> No, I don't expect it will.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, I can't.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then you'll die here.<eos> Why are you like this?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> What happened to you?
This put here ...<eos> You're all I have left.<eos> It's not easy to admit I'm hiding from you the real truth.<eos> After the deportation of parents I walked as in a dream.<eos> I saw only one way out: On the front.<eos> You made ? me discouraged ...<eos> Who do you keep writing?<eos> The girl?<eos> Parents?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Once the plea is entered, you'll be remanded back into custody for sentence.<eos> See you in a minute.<eos> Do you have any comments on the case reopening?<eos> Can we get a picture, please?<eos> Good morning.<eos> How are we?<eos> It's a simple hearing.<eos> Once he's entered a plea, he'll be remanded for sentencing.<eos> The judge will ask for psychiatric reports and we'll submit the victim impact statements.<eos> The court's at the top of the stairs and I'll talk to you after.
You know he doesn't want that.<eos> I'm his mother.<eos> He's only gonna blame me more.<eos> How am I ever gonna get him back if there's a trial?<eos> How is this my life now?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> ~ Do you want a... hug?<eos> ~ What?<eos> No!<eos> ~ No. ~ What's the matter with you?
What needs doing?<eos> Get your fat belly out the way and let me help.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Look at me, Chlo.<eos> I am so bloody big.<eos> I wish it would just come.<eos> It's stubborn like the rest of us.<eos> This one... ~ It won't replace Danny.<eos> Nige, you all right?<eos> Hi, lovely, is Mark with you?

Roger said he'd be glad to recommend you.<eos> Thank you, Roger.<eos> I appreciate your loyalty.<eos> - Should we get lunch?<eos> - I want to burn this place down. I know.<eos> They were awful.<eos> But at least we got a yes.<eos> Would you have rather had a friendly no?<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Joan, you've never experienced that before?

Flight's not till 6:00.<eos> I hate to disappoint you, but I don't need that much time.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I can't find my passport.<eos> It's okay.<eos> This is a romantic spot.<eos> Stevie.<eos> I'm sorry, but what were we going to do in Paris?<eos> I thought you were a fling, but now I think maybe you're more.<eos> I don't want to sleep with you on the night we first met.
We cannot wake her, sir, as much as we have tried.<eos> The doctors have found nothing.<eos> It is our belief, sir, that Lady Pole is not mad at all.<eos> We believe she is under an enchantment.<eos> Who writes to my wife?<eos> Jonathan Strange.<eos> May I speak with you a while?<eos> It would be a pleasure.<eos> I have been in contact with your husband.<eos> I am to watch over you.
~ Jonathan Strange!<eos> I am very glad to see you!<eos> I feel like I've just woken up.<eos> And yet I still seem to be dreaming.<eos> I command the trees!<eos> Come, come.<eos> Touch this mirror and think of home.<eos> I will follow after you directly.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I want to wait here with you!
Shit! Fuck! You guys all right?<eos> Hey, Max! Wake the fuck up, man!<eos> Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> I don't fucking know.<eos> Dude, what happened?<eos> I don't fucking know.<eos> Can someone please just go fucking check? Hey dude.<eos> Are you all right? Your fucking neck is bleeding.
I believe in you!<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Ivan! Ivan!<eos> OK, Ivan.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> We're friends. What do you mean, what the fuck?<eos> No. Obviously not.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Ivan, I wasn't flirting with you.
- No, I'm staying here.<eos> You are not listening to me, get up!<eos> - You may go now.<eos> - Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Dora, they want me to leave.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> You have to keep quiet.<eos> Remember?<eos> - It's a secret.<eos> - I want to be with you.
You have to keep quiet.<eos> Remember?<eos> - It's a secret.<eos> - I want to be with you.<eos> You can't be with me.<eos> - Do you want me to lose everything?<eos> - No.<eos> So you need to go.<eos> Go!<eos> - I want to be with you.
So you need to go.<eos> Go!<eos> - I want to be with you.<eos> - I said go!<eos> Go!<eos> Dora...<eos> I thought maybe I could sleep here.<eos> I'm tired of being alone.<eos> Listen to me, you can't stay here, no one must see you, you have to go.<eos> - I want to be with you.
I'm great, I think.<eos> I haven't been able to get ahold of anybody since I got here, and I can't leave.<eos> And the only reason that I'm here is because I was sent here to find you and Bill Evans.<eos> And guess what?<eos> I found both of you.<eos> Only you're... working in a toy store and living in a house with a picket fence and a man named Harold, and Bill Evans' mutilated corpse is rotting in an abandoned house on the outskirts of town,<eos> which I found a little bit surprising.<eos> But other than that, I couldn't be happier.<eos> What happened to him, Kate?<eos> And what happened to you?
I'm going to Boise.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna find him myself.<eos> Now?<eos> No, in the morning.<eos> Either Ethan is dead or he has abandoned his family, and I'm gonna find out which one it is.<eos> And if it is the latter, then I am going to kill him myself.<eos> Oh, can I help?<eos> Yes, you can stay with Ben.<eos> I'm coming with you.

Previously on "Wayward Pines"...<eos> - You didn't make it too far, did you?<eos> - Oh! Tell me again how you found that body in 604 first Avenue.<eos> - Why isn't it on the news?<eos> - Because it's classified.<eos> What isn't classified when it comes to dad?<eos> What if he's with that woman again?<eos> I'm going to find him myself.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
If you don't want to, it's okay but, it would mean a lot to me if you would.<eos> -You want me to be your maid of honor?<eos> -Well, yeah.<eos> I was yours, and you're my sister.<eos> -I know, but I don't know.<eos> I always felt like you acted like I wasn't in your league.<eos> -Anne...it was never that.<eos> Okay, it was never that.<eos> I just... I was in hiding.<eos> And I just really couldn't afford to get close to you.
You see when, um when people hurt me, I - - I I -<eos> - I don't talk about it. I...<eos> I walk away.<eos> I always walk away.<eos> But, uh I can't walk away from you.<eos> So...if that's okay... You're my daughter.<eos> A-and I would like to walk you down the aisle.<eos> - Living in a moment I would die for.<eos> These words best describe every minute of everyday of the last five years.<eos> That's why I'm standing in front of our family and our friends but most importantly, in front of you and in the presence of God to vow to be your faithfully committed ...lifetime companion.
- You caught him stealing cheese once.<eos> - That was obviously the start of it.<eos> 'Thank you.'<eos> 'What Jim is, is a pathological liar.<eos> 'I've seen this before.'<eos> And it is a key sign of psychopathic behaviour.<eos> Now, no parent ever thinks their child will grow up to be a serial-killing rapist or mass murderer but you got to be ready for anything.<eos> Mom, just think about all the future butchered victims crying out to be saved.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking after you.
- I was thinking.<eos> I think that you and I should live in New York together.<eos> You know?<eos> I-I want to go back to college...<eos> NYU or Columbia... And you can just go.. Wherever I get in, genius.<eos> How much fun would it be to be back in school together again?<eos> (sighs) It'd be amazing!<eos> I love you, Britt.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I'm serious, I mean... living my life with you is one of the few things that's actually as good in real life as it is in my imagination.
Nice to meet you, Principal Sylvester.<eos> Isn't he dreamy, Coach?<eos> I'm so in love!<eos> And that is how a mash-up is done, everyone.<eos> No, actually this is.<eos> Britt, can you take a seat?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I figure that this is as good a place as any to ask you this question.<eos> Um, mainly because it's gonna really upset all the single guys and gals in here.<eos> But... I want to mash up with you forever, Britt.
No, they're endgame like us, and to prove my love, I am going to guarantee you an invitational championship.<eos> Boom, you're welcome.<eos> "Justified and Ancient,."<eos> "Ascension Millennium,."<eos> "Dear Mr. Jesus."<eos> - Sam, I don't, I don't know any of these songs.<eos> - Oh, you will. And as your future husband, I demand that you do them.<eos> - Oh, God, you're hot.<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Good morning, Theresa!<eos> Ben.<eos> Up high.<eos> Down low.<eos> In the middle.<eos> Too slow.<eos> You got me.<eos> Come on, I'm excited to introduce you to the academy.<eos> You can call me "Mrs. Fisher."<eos> Some of the students like to call me "Mrs. F," but that's up to you.
Let's hope we take a piss tomorrow.<eos> That's great, Nick. I'm glad you liked the second draft.<eos> Sure, we will work some more on the ending.<eos> I'll talk to Brenda, everything is all set.<eos> She can't wait. When is she ever going to get a part like this at her age, come on!<eos> If it's okay with you, I'd like to start scouting locations next month<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Bye!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to you?
You didn't have to tell me that.<eos> Believe me, Lena. I can understand you.<eos> Really, I can.<eos> You can understand me?<eos> Like hell you can!<eos> Mommy would've been able to understand me.<eos> Mommy found herself in the same situation I'm in now with you not once, but dozens of times...<eos> You had a stream of women, but she just kept going Not just for us children, but above all for you.<eos> She loved you and so she forgave you.<eos> No matter what happened, she still wanted to be with you.
Was she his girlfriend?<eos> Girlfriend is...way too much.<eos> The only thing that ever happened was one time When they were kids They held hands and walked together for a few yards ...In some park.<eos> He used to call it:<eos> "The moment I learned to ride a bike. "<eos> - Didn't he ever tell you about it?<eos> - No.<eos> We only ever told each other The good things.<eos> Fuck!<eos> I waited till the visiting hours to come and see you.
Fuck...<eos> Thesetwoanimalactivist are highly contagious...<eos> That's that lady i was telling you about.<eos> ...andshouldnot be approached underanycircumstances.<eos> What?<eos> Officials have indicated that Victoria lasseter isresponsible for the outbreak.<eos> Why the fuck y'all on TV, Mike?<eos> ...Victorialasseter's inappropriate close contact withseveraltestmonkeys.<eos> Yo, Mike, are you in on this?<eos> You mean, this is the lady that talked to you?
How do you know what that gas was?<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> But, listen...<eos> -Baby...<eos> -No.<eos> No. Okay, Mike.<eos> Mike.<eos> Mike... hey...<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> But I do know what's going on with you, okay.
Otis, I need you and beedle to go to the house and confirm the location of lasseter and asset howell.<eos> Now, thank you, now!<eos> Sir, yes, sir.<eos> What the fuck are you looking at?<eos> Who's Apollo ape?<eos> He's a monkey astronaut.<eos> I made him up.<eos> He goes on adventures.<eos> Hey, Mike, you know Phoebe was supposed to come back in.<eos> When you were in the program, she always looked out for you.
He's a monkey astronaut.<eos> I made him up.<eos> He goes on adventures.<eos> Hey, Mike, you know Phoebe was supposed to come back in.<eos> When you were in the program, she always looked out for you.<eos> As all the other assets kept failing, you kept succeeding.<eos> She had so much faith in you.<eos> You were real to her.<eos> She was just supposed to get you settled into this town and then she was going to be reassigned.<eos> But she decided to stay with you.
What?<eos> Yes! That Max goods.<eos> So what happens if I meet you there?<eos> Like, how do you accept a surrender?<eos> Do I need to sign something?<eos> Uh, your girlfriend's here.<eos> Would you ever like to see her alive again?<eos> I don't know. So if I just took out my gun and blew her fucking face off, you'd be cool with that?<eos> No, that wouldn't be cool.<eos> Is she really there with you?
Provoke a regression.<eos> Look, I'm not an expert. But, I don't know. - This all seems a little...<eos> - It seems a little strange, doesn't it?<eos> I suppose umm...<eos> I often tell my students that the mind is a whole universe.<eos> I read an article about this.<eos> Regressive hypnosis has made great progress, gentlemen.<eos> Anyway, I hope you didn't... interrupt my classes, to discuss these topics with me.<eos> Or did you? I've been very confused ever since. My father ordered me not to tell anyone.<eos> He said, be a good girl and the Lord will watch over you.
Remember what I said, John, let the pendulum clear your mind.<eos> Look through it.<eos> This is no use.<eos> How long are we going to keep doing this?<eos> Just one more time.<eos> Let yourself go.<eos> I want you to relax every muscle in your body.<eos> Third sentence.<eos> My father ordered me not to tell anyone.<eos> He said, be a good girl and the Lord will watch over you.

I just know what it said in the report - a car accident.<eos> A lapse at the wheel.<eos> My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.<eos> He's a drunk, you know, it's probably not in the report.<eos> He got us all involved in that Evangelical stuff, like that would make things better.<eos> Why don't you tell us about that.<eos> What was he like when he drank?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Why don't you tell me what he did to you and Angela.
Listen, forgive me, okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> What are you doing, Bruce?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Roy...<eos> Oh Roy.<eos> Grandma, what happened?<eos> They hounded me.<eos> So I wouldn't tell, what I did to you.
- No, they already be among us!<eos> I don't believe any of it.<eos> I got my hands full with these guys.<eos> Please, don't let all this get to you.<eos> - Not to you.<eos> - What...<eos> You said you were being watched on the street today.<eos> Have you seen yourself in the mirror recently?<eos> Why don't you just go home and forget about the case for a few days.<eos> Something's happening to you.
- How much?<eos> - The borough's. Malcolm?<eos> Okay, I'm in. Trawling the servers now.<eos> Harry, we need to get moving.<eos> Can we do this any quicker? I could, yes. Unfortunately, this machine is pre-millennial.<eos> G Branch already pulled these.<eos> Erin Watts.<eos> Served under Pearce. Current whereabouts unknown.<eos> Might be worth a closer look.<eos> So, come on, then. What is it between you and Harry?
You're madder than you look.<eos> Shoot me or get out.<eos> I'm not taking that. I was afraid that would be your answer.<eos> That's why I've taken the decision out of your hands.<eos> It's not your pub lunch that's making you queasy.<eos> I had the rib of beef, too.<eos> Tell me you're lying, Harry.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me you didn't betray your country.<eos> It's been four hours already, Geraldine. You can spend the last two in a hospital bed, but if I were you, I'd go and play with that beautiful niece of yours.
It's another death row case.<eos> The guy's being railroaded.<eos> $1,000 for you.<eos> Cyril.<eos> Webby.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I am loving the digs.<eos> Mike.<eos> It's Justin.<eos> - I'll just sit with you for a minute.
But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I never leave it alone.<eos> That's why people hate me.<eos> Mike.<eos> People are saying bad things about you.<eos> I can tell something is wrong.<eos> But I can't do this alone.<eos> I need your help to tell the world what happened to you.
But as a scientist, I can't deny it.<eos> Name it.<eos> You have to give this a name.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> Did they agree what it is?<eos> Yes.<eos> We are going to publish.<eos> They...<eos> - With you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> Did they agree what it is?<eos> Yes.<eos> We are going to publish.<eos> They...<eos> - With you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> In a medical journal.<eos> With you?
Yes, with me.<eos> Together.<eos> That's so...<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You...<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> Yes.<eos> With you.
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> CTE.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> We publish.<eos> Dekosky is going to coauthor.<eos> - Dekosky?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Omalu, Dekosky and Cyril Wecht.<eos> Well, I'm very proud of you.
Because how can it be possible that some African voodoo doctor could understand this subject better than them?<eos> Or even better than you?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You think this is about Bennet Omalu?<eos> I'm not here because of you. I'm here because people are dying.<eos> You are here for redemption.<eos> You are here to use me to cleanse your sins.<eos> You self-righteous bastard.<eos> Do you have any idea what I could have, how much I could have... if I went back to my side of the ball and just kept my mouth shut?<eos> Everything in my world is telling me not to agree with you, except one.
Please, I'll do anything!<eos> - Please!<eos> - Oh, don't beg.<eos> Anything.<eos> No. It's bad form to beg.<eos> Where's your sense of honor, boy?<eos> Now, kneel.<eos> I said kneel!<eos> I am the son of a warrior and a prince.<eos> I will never bow to you.
THEY THINK WE SHOULD GET NIGEL COAKER TO WRITE YOU UP IN HIS "FACES TO WATCH" PIECE.<eos> YEAH, THAT'D BE AMAZING.<eos> I HAVE NIGEL'S NUMBER. I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.<eos> HE OWES MY DAD A TON OF FAVORS, ANYWAY.<eos> WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING HOME?<eos> UH, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE VICTORY LAP PARTY FOR US.<eos> I GOT TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE.<eos> LAME. I'M KIDDING.<eos> IT'S FINE.<eos> PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sit.<eos> Easy, boy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, see you in the morning, I guess.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Good to see you. Well...<eos> I just, uh- - I wanted to tell you how sorry I am.<eos> - Glad to see you.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - You're back sooner than we expected.<eos> - Yeah. Medical discharge.<eos> Got shrapnel all up and down my back.<eos> Got a few pieces lodged in my spine.<eos> Man, makes us a couple of beat-up old Marines, I guess.<eos> I'm proud to be one alongside you.
I can't hear you.<eos> Come down here and tell me.<eos> Crazy, B!<eos> Justin...<eos> Girl, that hurts.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> What, uh...<eos> What's that?<eos> Your father put it there while you were gone.<eos> He does not want to argue with you about it.
- After you talked about nothing, he left without a word and he just called to say he was spending the night at our hunting cabin and not to worry.<eos> We have a hunting cabin?<eos> No, we do not have a hunting cabin.<eos> Max.<eos> Max.<eos> Hey. He)'-<eos> How'd you get home, buddy?<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> Come on, boy, let's go.<eos> Oh, honey, I feel like I should go in with you.
Max.<eos> Max!<eos> Max.<eos> Jusfin.<eos> - Oh, son.<eos> - You okay?<eos> Thank God.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> - Did you bring anybody with you?
You go after Ray.<eos> Come on, Max!<eos> Hey-<eos> Max!<eos> Tyler!<eos> Tyler!<eos> Don't you hurt my boy!<eos> This never had to happen.<eos> None of it!<eos> What am I supposed to do with you now, huh?
You are in perfect health.<eos> Does that mean I'm good to donate?<eos> When the time comes, you're the man.<eos> Is that really how much bone marrow they have to take?<eos> According to Dr. Hamburger.<eos> (Laughs) It's Hamburg.<eos> I know.<eos> So here's to your last night in Boston.<eos> I know this trip hasn't been easy, but I couldn't be more grateful for what you're doing.<eos> I owe you big time.
It wasn't like a decision to tell him.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just... (Sighs) You know what?<eos> Forget it. No, hey, come on.<eos> I get that you are still mad at me.<eos> But I really thought we were moving past this.<eos> Four months ago, last night...<eos> it would have been so much fun.<eos> It would have been like the perfect date.<eos> And now it's... it's hard to even be around you.
Perfect.<eos> So you two, you're not married?<eos> No, George is... was my... my husband... my...<eos> Brother-in-law.<eos> - Yes. - Oh.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> I've always noticed you in my restaurant.<eos> You stand out... a beautiful woman dining alone.<eos> Uh, we could start the salad course if you'd all like to take your seats.<eos> Uh, Quincy is totally flirting with you.
Okay.<eos> I...<eos> I mean, nothing happened or anything.<eos> I just, I wanted to tell you so it's all out in the open.<eos> Remember how you said the thing about dying is that there's no time for anything but the truth.<eos> I said that, huh?<eos> That's a good one.<eos> You're kind of full of those.<eos> Anyway, we might not be dying at the moment, but I still want to live like that.<eos> What's it like now with you and Dominic?
It's not like we drove or anything.<eos> Brenna, what were you thinking?<eos> That I might get Natalie to change her mind.<eos> Sara, she didn't make your daughter do anything that she didn't wanna do.<eos> Wow! That's a convenient excuse.<eos> Sounds like you've used it before.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Is that a nervous tick for you?<eos> Every time you get a chance, you instantly attack me with some passive-aggressive comment.<eos> I'm not gonna do this with you.
Well, I, uh...<eos> Was calling to say that I'm sorry.<eos> For putting you in such a... Horrible position with your job and for the crappy things I said that night and...<eos> For just being a jerk in general lately.<eos> Well...<eos> You've been going through a lot.<eos> At least that's what my mom told me.<eos> It wasn't like I was keeping that from you intentionally.<eos> I just didn't know how to talk to you about what's going on with me right now.<eos> What is going on with you?
Grandma, you coming?<eos> You know, those shows are really good once you get into them.<eos> Ugh. Jacqueline keeps asking me to send her questions for her interview with the Brazilian.<eos> It's not an interview, it's a bikini wax.<eos> Learn to read your own schedule.<eos> Are you sure we should go to Dominic's book signing?<eos> I mean, he didn't invite us.<eos> Don't tell me you're nervous about meeting this mystery girl, whoever she is.<eos> So are you, like, having feelings for Dominic?<eos> You know, 'cause things with you and Leo are weird right now...
I remember this place.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Your couch is so comfortable.<eos> Your mom's funny.<eos> And nice.<eos> I used to feel that way about her.<eos> You're so nice too.<eos> Taking me to the hospital the other day and now you're helping me tonight.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I know I haven't always been so nice to you.
- This isn't working.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> This relationship, with your job.<eos> It's... I didn't want it to happen this way, but...<eos> Wait wait wait.<eos> You're breaking up with me?<eos> Because I've been working a lot lately?<eos> Right, right, you know, I am so sorry.<eos> Was it easier for you when I was just available...<eos> Hold on, I'm not breaking up with you.
Were you actually on your way out?<eos> 'Cause you can go now.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> Maybe I'm biased, but it can't be the food.<eos> No, it's a work thing.<eos> I'm meeting Jonathan Richman's manager at 7:00 for this review that I'm doing.<eos> - It's only 6:30.<eos> - I know.<eos> It was great running into you at the bookstore.
Okay okay, so no elevator, no coffee shop nearby.<eos> Is there anything else that you just can't tolerate?<eos> Yeah, your mattress.<eos> What's wrong with my mattress?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just mine's way better.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Guess I have to show you now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, you know, I'm really going to have to fight you on this whole mattress thing.
It's not like we have anything to hide.<eos> So remember what I said?<eos> Let me go talk to her and don't come out here until I tell you to, okay?<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Can we talk for a second?<eos> Honey, I just need 15 minutes to decompress and grab a glass of wine.<eos> - Mom, just...<eos> - Please, Brenna, just...<eos> Please don't flip out, okay?<eos> I'm just trying to be honest with you.
Oh, please, go ahead.<eos> It's... thank you very much.<eos> I'm sorry, but there are no direct flights to Boston leaving out of this airport today.<eos> What's the earliest you could get me there?<eos> There's a flight through Charlotte, arriving at Logan around midnight.<eos> - Midnight?<eos> - I know.<eos> I guess I'll take it.<eos> Actually, make that two tickets.<eos> I'm going with you.
- Yum. - I couldn't get a whole one, and now these are all dried out.<eos> - Mmm! - It's fine, grandma.<eos> Looks like a turkey autopsy.<eos> Mom texted, she and George are gonna be boarding soon.<eos> Oh, finally, some good news.<eos> Grandma, is that the stuffing?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Well, is there...<eos> Is there anything else that you need before tomorrow?<eos> What's going on with you?
Uhm, spring?<eos> You can support yourself?<eos> Going to go to the bank as soon as you give me permission.<eos> Welcome to Canada.<eos> Close to a hundred a month once you count his rum.<eos> And he's given a month's security.<eos> Unheard of.<eos> We got enough?<eos> With some to spare.<eos> You want me to come with you?
Is he through yet?<eos> We have joy.<eos> GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting.<eos> Should intercept in 20.<eos> That was a clean, clean fucking op, my friend.<eos> Except for these two assholes.<eos> Well, you're better overseas.<eos> You don't have to babysit.<eos> Where's Kate?<eos> I thought she was with you.
Right, oh, You Oughta Know, but right.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> -No, no.<eos> I Want To Tell You is a book that O.J. Simpson wrote.<eos> - Ah, that's a different thing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Although, wouldn't it be funny if O.J. Simpson sang You Oughta Know and Alanis Morissette wrote a book about not killing two people.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I tell you, if this whole fuss, whatever, could get me a five-minute cup of tea with her...<eos> Yo, why don't you put out your feelers and see if she'd be willing to meet you?
Uh, but we should...<eos> You know, we gotta be up early.<eos> Really?<eos> What time is it?<eos> It is, like, 10:00.<eos> Think it's, like, 11:30, dick-brain.<eos> Oh, shit, jeez.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I totally lost track of time.<eos> Um, what time do you want me to pick you up tomorrow?
She's probably sleeping, anyway.<eos> Please?<eos> - SARAHI Hello?<eos> - Hi. How's it going?<eos> It's, uh, fine...<eos> Did I wake you up?<eos> No. I'm up reading Infinite Jest.<eos> - Pretty amazing.<eos> - Good. No, good.<eos> Uh, listen, I'm here with somebody who wants to talk to you.
- Good. No, good.<eos> Uh, listen, I'm here with somebody who wants to talk to you.<eos> Can you hold on a second?<eos> - What's her name again?<eos> -it's Sarah.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Sarah, hi.<eos> It's Dave Wallace.<eos> It's nice to meet you telephonically.
I think I'll sit up front.<eos> Oh, okay, let me just, um, get my stuff.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think to write down where we parked the car?<eos> No, I didn't, okay?<eos> Sorry, I fucked up, all right?<eos> I'm a fuck-up.<eos> Not everybody can be as brilliant as you.<eos> - What is with you?
Oh, okay, let me just, um, get my stuff.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think to write down where we parked the car?<eos> No, I didn't, okay?<eos> Sorry, I fucked up, all right?<eos> I'm a fuck-up.<eos> Not everybody can be as brilliant as you.<eos> - What is with you?<eos> -What the fuck is with you?
If we had done this by the mail, if I had access to my library, if I could look stuff up...<eos> My dream for this would be for you to write it up, send it to me and let me rewrite all my quotes,<eos> -which, of course, you'll never do.<eos> -Right.<eos> But if I'm in a room by myself, alone, and I have time, I can be really smart.<eos> Yes, I think I'm bright, I think I'm talented.<eos> I'm not trying to sound disingenuous to you.<eos> - Oh. No?<eos> -I am not an idiot.<eos> Yes, I can talk intelligently with you about stuff, but I can't quite keep up with you.
This is such a clever tactic on your part.<eos> - Tactic?<eos> What tactic?<eos> -That's right.<eos> Get me a little pissed off, get me a little less guarded, I'm gonna reveal more.<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> I treasure my regular guy-ness.<eos> I've come to think that maybe it's my biggest asset as a writer, that I'm basically just like everybody else.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not doing any kind of faux thing with you, and I'm not gonna say it again.
No, I know you don't believe that.<eos> I'm also aware that one of the things that's swirling around here is you wanna have the best fucking article you can have.<eos> So, you know what?<eos> Why don't you write whatever the fuck you want?<eos> I am telling you that this was not a Lost Weekend sort of thing.<eos> Nor was it some lurid, romantic, "writer is alcoholic" sort of thing.<eos> What it was, was a 28-year-old person who had really exhausted a couple other ways to live. Like, really taken them to their conclusion. Which for me, was a pink room with a drain in the center of the floor, which is where they put me for an entire day when they thought that I was gonna kill myself.<eos> Where I had nothing on, I've got someone observing me through a...<eos> Through a slot in the wall.<eos> And when that happens to you, you become tremendously, just unprecedentedly, willing to examine some other alternatives for how to live.
Yeah, me 1100.<eos> I actually had them use the same art for the British edition.<eos> Come on.<eos> You got approval on it.<eos> It's nice.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> It was not such a... Not such a big success.<eos> Hey, isn't it at all reassuring to have a lot of people read you and, you know, say that you're a really strong writer?<eos> Yeah, it'll be interesting to talk to you in a few years.
I don't have enough of the agents, I need more potassium permanganate, dioxygen and...<eos> In English, please.<eos> It didn't work because I'm missing the right amount of some ingredients.<eos> But I know where I can get them...<eos> SUMMER FAIR<eos> "Great summer fairground.<eos> THE BIG WHEEL OF PARIS<eos> "See the magic and fun of chemistry!"<eos> With a little luck, I'll find what I need!<eos> I'm coming with you!
Are you spying on me?<eos> I told you to leave me alone!<eos> Uh, and is that also part of your act, too?<eos> My little sparrow!<eos> It's your father!<eos> Can't be...<eos> April, listen to me!<eos> I don't have much time!<eos> You're in danger!<eos> They're coming for you!
Wow, these trees are beautiful!<eos> And the plants!<eos> And the air's so clean!<eos> You still hate me?<eos> What is it you want exactly?<eos> For me to realize we were meant for each other?<eos> We forget everything?<eos> Kiss and make up?<eos> Well, yeah!<eos> Oh, Julius, I want to spend my life with you!
It's happening, people!<eos> It's happening! I say, gird your loins!<eos> Gird your loins!<eos> Villains, our revenge begins today.<eos> About the other day, I just...<eos> I told Ben this wasn't going to be easy.<eos> You also taught me that a king has to believe in himself.<eos> Even when it isn't easy. - I did?<eos> I... how very wise of me.<eos> Ben, we are very proud of you.
- I'm gonna need about 20 minutes, Vincent.<eos> Move as fast as you can.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Vincent.<eos> Vincent, this is Henk.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Waiting for the van Gogh.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I'm coming for you, Maya.
Not so much.<eos> Put 'em down.<eos> Come on ahead.<eos> I said way above your hat, god dammit.<eos> Now come forward.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> I'll be dogged, you black fella' I know.<eos> Col. Something Warren, right?<eos> Major marquis Warren.<eos> I know you too.
That means: Shut up.<eos> You got it?<eos> I got it.<eos> I know we only met each other once before.<eos> And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy. But...<eos> You still got it?<eos> I still got, what?<eos> The Lincoln letter?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you got it on you?
Micheline, I said, "to bed!"<eos> How appropriate!<eos> My princess!<eos> Papa, my story!<eos> You promised.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't contain her when you go out.<eos> And my story?<eos> I already told you 2.<eos> She does as she likes with you.
You mean my brother-in-law?<eos> The President met Stavisky only once or twice at the races.<eos> He goes rarely. What do I tell André Simon?<eos> Just enough to get a reward from the prefect.<eos> Tell him you lack evidence.<eos> Now, excuse me.<eos> I have to chop a head.<eos> Protect the elites, as Pressard said.<eos> Meanwhile, high-society is making a mint.<eos> And without tipping you.
You're not going to, too?<eos> Did Guillaume send you to teach me a lesson?<eos> We're on a wire, Sacha.<eos> If we run fast, we won't fall.<eos> We're dining at Enghien, with Arlette.<eos> Well, if she loves Enghien...<eos> It's fine.<eos> It happens.<eos> I don't give a shit. I know the wind will turn.<eos> With you or another.
- Yeah.<eos> - She took off on us.<eos> - She what? - It was textbook, man.<eos> We were diamonds. But then she just took off.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> She hit and run?<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> She bailed and wailed.<eos> Okay, just stay where you are.<eos> I'll come get you.
You're fired!<eos> Fired?<eos> I've been with this family for 30 years!<eos> I can't do his work and mine!<eos> And who are you?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Shouldn't you be catching your train, Lillian?<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> I'm not catching the train.<eos> I've decided to stay with you for a while.
Something has invaded my light<eos> Painting my sleep with the colours so bright<eos> Changing the gray changing the blue<eos> Scarlet for me it's scarlet for you<eos> Leave the building in orderly fashion<eos> Do hurry up, and please be carefully no one should get hurt or injured... and good luck with the hunt<eos> I wish I didn't have this limp<eos> I used to good at running, but not anymore<eos> I'm sure would be slower than them<eos> If I were you, I think of some trick that choose element of surprise... instead of speed
5... 4... 3... 2...<eos> We developed a code that we can communicate with each other... even in front of the others without them knowing what we're saying<eos> When we turn our heads to the left, it means...<eos> "I love you more than anything in the world"<eos> When we turn our heads to the right, it means...<eos> "Watch out, we're in danger"<eos> We have to be very careful in the beginning not to mix up<eos> "I love you more than anything in the world"... with "watch out, we're in danger"<eos> When we raise out left arm, it means...<eos> "I want to dance in you arm"
Anyway, this doctor is the best as is<eos> And it's very difficult to get a appointment<eos> I called him months ago to get him to see you today<eos> She's blind Thank you<eos> Throw down your knife and stand up<eos> Why did you have to blind me?<eos> You could blind him?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about<eos> The drugs are messing with you head<eos> If I were you, I would try and be a little braver about the whole thing
Elbows<eos> Would you like me to show you my belly?<eos> No, I remember you belly very well<eos> Smile<eos> Can I have a knife and fork please?<eos> Not a butter knife, steak knife<eos> Second<eos> Thank you<eos> I'm going to do with the knife<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
Well, that's good your Dad's being cool.<eos> I can't believe you told your mom.<eos> Again.<eos> - I didn't tell...<eos> - I can't... I...<eos> I can't be friends with a little bitch that tells his mom every time something happens.<eos> Oh! You made it!<eos> Like I was gonna miss a chance to see you shine.<eos> Aw, thank you.<eos> I'm really proud of you.
- ... and we qualified.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I saw. Congrats.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> We qualified.<eos> You remember those rules that Kaitlyn was handing out?<eos> You know, the ones you made fun of me for taking?<eos> Well, I actually read those, and it turns out only one member of the qualifying team has to be on the competing team at State.<eos> And I qualified.<eos> That's why I didn't walk off with you.
It'll be awesome.<eos> Or we can just let them wean themselves off.<eos> And once we get out into nature, with hopefully very bad reception,<eos> - I bet you they'll put them down.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I will take that bet.<eos> - You can't be "nice mom" all the time.<eos> - I'm not "nice mom."<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Why do you think they always confide in you?
You're gonna hang ten on the pond?<eos> Mom, some of us don't want to get skin cancer, right?<eos> Yeah, but there is something called sunscreen, you know.<eos> Did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens that show up in people's livers?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> The best way to protect yourself from the sun's damaging rays is to cover up.<eos> OK, I stand corrected.<eos> [whispers] You're welcome.<eos> Mom.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?
Can I talk to you about something?<eos> Uh, well...<eos> Hey, uh, maybe just stay in the shallow end, OK?<eos> - Why?<eos> I know how to swim.<eos> - Not in a lake.<eos> There could be a sudden drop-off.<eos> And it's dark and you can't see the bottom.<eos> It's not like a pool.<eos> I can't keep an eye on you every second.
Right?<eos> Hey, I'm trying to get them to let me go on tour. OK?<eos> So I can't be caught doing something stupid.<eos> What if I get lost or get eaten by a bear or something?<eos> I'm more worried about you getting eaten by Hayley.<eos> You gotta cut that girl loose, man.<eos> She's out there all alone, waiting for me.<eos> Why don't you just tell Moms?<eos> They already don't like her.<eos> OK, well, I'm not sneaking out with you so you can tell Hayley you can't sneak out.
She's out there all alone, waiting for me.<eos> Why don't you just tell Moms?<eos> They already don't like her.<eos> OK, well, I'm not sneaking out with you so you can tell Hayley you can't sneak out.<eos> Sorry, man, you're on your own.<eos> - Hey. What's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> - I'm going to the bathroom.<eos> - Do you need me to go with you?
- He's not lost.<eos> What if he is?<eos> [sighs] All right, I'll go look for him.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> And don't say the bathroom.<eos> Hayley surprised him.<eos> She's at another campsite.<eos> - But you can't tell.<eos> OK? - OK.<eos> - Should I come with you?
- What?<eos> ! - Of course you'd throw gasoline on a fire.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Jude.<eos> - Jude, what are you doing?<eos> - Going swimming.<eos> OK, well, don't go out too far.<eos> Jude?<eos> Jude, look. I don't have a suit on.<eos> Just wait a second and I'll go with you.
It's true.<eos> And it's one of the things that I love about you.<eos> How strong you are.<eos> And maybe I am softer than I should be, at times.<eos> I don't like conflict.<eos> You know that about me.<eos> But if we want the kids to talk to us, they have to feel heard.<eos> [sighs] You make them feel safe in so many ways, so many ways I never could, but they have to feel safe to talk to you too.<eos> Well, somebody has to talk to Mariana.<eos> And I'm sure that she wants you.
OK, thanks.<eos> But I don't want Mariana coming, OK?<eos> Just in case.<eos> Are you gonna be the one to tell her she can't come?<eos> 'Cause I'm not.<eos> - I'm not afraid of Mariana.<eos> - You should be.<eos> I think of it as a healthy fear.<eos> She has a way of getting what she wants.<eos> Did she talk to you about the tour yet?
She has a way of getting what she wants.<eos> Did she talk to you about the tour yet?<eos> What about it?<eos> You told Ana that she should ask us to adopt her baby?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yeah, kinda.<eos> Was she mad?<eos> - What?<eos> - She wasn't mad.<eos> She actually agreed with you, Mariana.
- You don't need it.<eos> Why are you winking when you say that?<eos> Wait, are you being ironic in that way I totally don't get?<eos> No, no, there's just...<eos> There's something in my...<eos> I'm all good.<eos> I just... I gotta find a bathroom.<eos> But kill it!<eos> I'll be the one hollering the loudest.<eos> I should come with you.
Actually, I think I'm just gonna take the bus.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't mean to pry.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> OK, slow down. OK.<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Are you all right?
There was a lot of pressure tonight, I think.<eos> All the pressure to have sex tonight was coming from you.<eos> OK, OK...<eos> For the record, I would have been happy just cuddling.<eos> Then let's cuddle a bit.<eos> Let's just cuddle, OK?<eos> Have you ever faked it before?<eos> Oh, come on, haven't you ever?<eos> No.<eos> Never with you.
So, yeah, I'm sorry I got locked in a storage unit.<eos> But I am not sorry that I called the police and possibly saved that girl's life.<eos> I didn't say that calling the police was a mistake.<eos> I "handled" myself fine.<eos> You're just mad because you know you shouldn't have been playing a gig like that anyway.<eos> Wow.<eos> I didn't realize Mariana wanted to go on tour with us.<eos> You're totally right, it's a terrible idea.<eos> We don't have time to be baby-sitting her on the road.<eos> Yeah, because I'm going to be busy baby-sitting you.
That's right, fuckers.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right. All right, now.<eos> Come on. Come on, now. Come on.<eos> I know you're all cosy inside.<eos> But I really...<eos> We really wanna meet you, little girl, so don't get too comfortable in there.<eos> Hey, don't say that.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
I wanted to help him become a fiction writer, and now all he does is write, and the novel is 500 pages long and I don't even think it's half done.<eos> - Have you read the whole thing?<eos> - Most of it.<eos> You still like it?<eos> - It's gotten more and more complicated.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you think it's possible to be too smart to be a novelist?<eos> I haven't heard that one.<eos> Do you think there's something wrong with me?<eos> Wrong with you?
He's not a paper product.<eos> Love is messy.<eos> It's illogical, it's wasteful and it's messy.<eos> And it leaves these loose threads that go out all over the place.<eos> But you, you like things nice and neat and tidy and ethical.<eos> But you screwed that up the minute you got with a married man.<eos> You're not being my friend right now.<eos> Yes, I am. I am being your friend.<eos> This is being your friend.<eos> I'm being honest with you.
Maggie, don't say that.<eos> You were in such a bad place...<eos> - What about Lily?<eos> - ...in your marriage.<eos> - And then I came along.<eos> - What about Lily?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> - Come on, what we had was real.<eos> - That's right.<eos> When I met you, I was lost.
Didn't you tell me to block it out?<eos> I told you do it by the book.<eos> Cut the bullshit.<eos> Nobody else could have stopped that arcade machine and you know it.<eos> Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.<eos> You need to start following the rules like the rest of us, so I'm assigning you a new partner. What?<eos> Hell no, I work alone.<eos> Not anymore you don't.<eos> Say hi to your new partner, Triceracop.<eos> Very nice meeting you Kung Fury, looking forward to working with you.
There was a man who came to the house.<eos> He said there was a gas leak, but there was no gas leak.<eos> That's when they must have done it.<eos> ~ When was this?<eos> ~ Yesterday.<eos> You weren't to know.<eos> What did Mr Harris say?<eos> Er... when I got bailed this morning, he told me to come home and stay here.<eos> He's trying to sort things out with the Chief Whip.<eos> I won't let them do this to you, Adam.
And yet you went ahead with a three-month inquiry into a double agent that never existed?<eos> I was SOE. You didn't ask questions.<eos> You did what you were told.<eos> Like you did when you spied on me?<eos> You have to understand.<eos> It's not you.<eos> It's not me.<eos> It's the world that we inhabit.<eos> Hilda?<eos> I had to see you, Ian.
- Get ready!<eos> - Fire!<eos> Up here.<eos> You are sure there's water down there, aren't you?<eos> Aye, I think so.<eos> Still a couple hours' ride from the drover.<eos> We should water the horses.<eos> Give him a drink of water, will ye?<eos> Aye.<eos> Are you all right?
- What?<eos> - Fucking.<eos> After Fort William, ye called me a "fucking bastard."<eos> Um... well, it means what we just did.<eos> What about "sadist"?<eos> You called me that as well.<eos> Well, that means someone who takes sexual pleasure in hurting someone.<eos> Oh, well, ye dinna flatter me overmuch, but I canna fault your observations.<eos> Oh.<eos> Was I too rough on you?
Nothing worth brooding over.<eos> And the duke did take the petition.<eos> That's cause for a bit of celebrating.<eos> Now perhaps it is better to wait Until closer to our leaving.<eos> Ye're not normally a closed-mouth woman, claire.<eos> I expected noisier displeasure.<eos> But quiet anger can be very effective.<eos> Jamie, the laird is asking for you.<eos> You will return to your home and attend to your wife's funeral.<eos> And at home you will remain until I send for you.
I mean, we have lakes.<eos> Here the weather's always good and there's just so much stuff to do.<eos> I've been thinking about making the... the move... the move out west.<eos> I just need a change and...<eos> I really need to expand my business.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I wholesale bounce houses.<eos> Ah. That'd be fun, right?<eos> I mean, no pressure.<eos> I'm just thinking about spending more time with my niece and nephew, and... you, of course.
How do we know he's even living there?<eos> How do we know he's not?<eos> B, we gotta start somewhere.<eos> You know? Let's split up.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Is that okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you guys, like, 5?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I could go with you, Beatrix.
-Don't call me Mandy.<eos> Andrew, how was your weekend?<eos> Uh, it was good.<eos> I banged my neighbor.<eos> Finally.<eos> All right!<eos> You're talking about the hot Ukrainian chick?<eos> Uh, it was actually her mom.<eos> -That's decent.<eos> Proud of you.
There was blood everywhere. And then I went to get help, and he was gone.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe you're doing this right now.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Mike was dead in the bathroom.<eos> Did anyone else see the body?<eos> Well, no.<eos> I-I-I went to get help and then when I came back, he was gone.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Evan, he's fucking with you.
And you make an important contribution.<eos> Let's pop into my man-cave, and you can give me the Vegas tips on the NBA playoffs and dirt on upcoming events, you know?<eos> Don't hit me.<eos> Man stuff, all right.<eos> -All right.<eos> -Come on.<eos> I got all sorts of ideas for other office pools.<eos> Competitive curling, fantasy fishing, ant bite... -Hup, hup, hup, hup. -Hup, hup, hup, hup.<eos> What's up, man.<eos> You all right?
How the hell am I gonna get those sales figures?<eos> You mean, you want all the numbers, like...<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> The spreadsheets are on Mike's computer and that's locked, so--<eos> Oh, you don't have the password?<eos> No, no.<eos> You know, I don't wanna know the password, so I'm gonna have to rebuild the excel files from scratch.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I can totally help, you know.<eos> Especially after what Ted did to you.
We'll see what Ted has to say about this.<eos> Oh, man, you would not believe what I...<eos> Are you... Son of a bitch!<eos> If you bailed on me...<eos> Andrew?<eos> Dude, if this is another fucking bit like Mike's...<eos> -Run.<eos> -Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Andrew, you all right?
No, no.<eos> Andrew is dead.<eos> Dead tired after that all-nighter.<eos> The presentation.<eos> Signed, sealed, and delivered.<eos> Andrew, you start prepping my office for the Phallusite.<eos> I want you to run this presentation today.<eos> You got it, boss.<eos> Bounce.<eos> Evan, what the hell happened to you?
See this fellow right here, you know who he is?<eos> He is your Uncle Deacon.<eos> Uncle Deacon?<eos> From the pictures? Yeah.<eos> The one and only.<eos> This is the surprise I was telling you about.<eos> I'm so sorry it took such a long time before I came to see you.<eos> I love you.<eos> It's time to go to daddy.<eos> I've always wanted to meet you.
It was the crate holding the walk cable.<eos> But, in my mind, I had changed this crate into a coffin.<eos> Philippe!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're waking up the whole neighborhood.<eos> Well, I forgot to nail shut the coffin.<eos> Stop calling it that!<eos> A coffin is what this may be.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> What's wrong with you?
No, we're not!<eos> We're not!<eos> We're all gonna get caught and go to jail.<eos> And I don't want to go to jail.<eos> And the rigging isn't safe.<eos> I'm not gonna watch you fall.<eos> I'm leaving, okay.<eos> I quit.<eos> Okay, Albert, listen to me.<eos> Yes, I agree with you, okay?
Your sister's husband went to the mountains looking for God<eos> Pervin's husband is in jail<eos> The bra seller can't convince his girl<eos> And Prem has a divorce notice<eos> Chant in the name of your mother, not God<eos> She keeps talking nonsense<eos> What did I say wrong?<eos> There'll be lots of crying Stay calm<eos> So cry once and for all<eos> I'm very proud of you, Sandhya ls everyone here getting divorced?
I mean, I get it.<eos> I can see why she didn't like taking her pills, they just make you feel so numb and disconnected from everything.<eos> But to do what she did.<eos> And not leave a note or anything.<eos> That's something I'll never understand.<eos> I was so mad at my dad when he said we were moving.<eos> I mean, all the memories that we had in that house.<eos> That's all we had left.<eos> I'm never like this.<eos> Why is it so easy to talk to you?
You're gonna have a really hard time convincing people, that's all.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe she did the things you're saying.<eos> Well, once they realise it was all a lie.<eos> It's like her charity was a way to cover up what was actually happening in this house.<eos> That's why she disappeared overnight, she didn't want to get caught.<eos> So, my friend Charlie's having a hotel party tonight.<eos> There's a great indoor pool, guaranteed good times, you should come.<eos> In fact, I insist.<eos> You need to get out of the house, meet some new people.<eos> I'll pick you up at 8:00?
Rose!<eos> Have you seen Leila?<eos> Not since the other day.<eos> She said she was going to her grandparents' house.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> I haven't heard from her since last night, and she's not answering her phone, so...<eos> If you hear from her would you let me know, please?
And he told me it was too soon for us to get married, the bastard!<eos> Shit, that's horrible.<eos> At least you didn't stay and catch the bouquet!<eos> You caught the bouquet?<eos> It fell on top of me!<eos> And everyone thought I was crying with emotion.<eos> Why did you put up with it?<eos> Because I loved him.<eos> I stayed to the end of the ceremony, waiting for him to say "I don't...<eos> But when you're the other woman, no guy says "I don't" for you.
Because you said you'd do anything for Hugo?<eos> Come on, it's not that hard.<eos> They come here, they see us as happy workers, they go off as happy parents, leaving a happy son and...<eos> It won't work.<eos> It won't work.<eos> If I don't believe it, how will they?<eos> Look, ma'am, that's it.<eos> What a building!<eos> That one, ma'am.<eos> Son, I'm so proud of you.
- With this bump, I can't see.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Is Carla here?<eos> - She's showering.<eos> She's coming with me to the pre-natal class.<eos> You must be due soon.<eos> In two weeks' time.<eos> What does the father say?<eos> Not me, I've no intention of being a father.<eos> Well, not with you.
Is it urgent?<eos> I want to talk to him about the America Works program.<eos> - So nothing urgent.<eos> - It's not an emergency, no.<eos> 'Cause that's what this phone is for.<eos> Will you pass on my message?<eos> Hey.<eos> You're late.<eos> I switched cabs three times.<eos> - Were you being followed?
When we were pulled from those car wrecks we weren't taken directly here.<eos> We were put into some kind of a... suspended animation.<eos> What happened to your arm?<eos> You're gonna think I'm crazy.<eos> But there's these creatures out there... monsters.<eos> I saw them with my own eyes.<eos> Cities destroyed.<eos> This... this fake little town is all that's left.<eos> Ethan, what did they do to you?<eos> What did they do to you?
You're gonna think I'm crazy.<eos> But there's these creatures out there... monsters.<eos> I saw them with my own eyes.<eos> Cities destroyed.<eos> This... this fake little town is all that's left.<eos> Ethan, what did they do to you?<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> Did they take you back to the hospital?<eos> No.<eos> I need you to try to remember if they did anything to you, - if they injected you with something.
Do you think he's involved with these subversives?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But when I find out the answer to that question, you'll be the first to know.<eos> Until then, I've got to do my job, so if you don't mind...<eos> No, I don't mind.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do your job.<eos> I'm just here to help.<eos> I would do anything for my brother.<eos> Even work hand-in-hand with you.
I'm just here to help.<eos> I would do anything for my brother.<eos> Even work hand-in-hand with you.<eos> So, how about it?<eos> You can't do this alone.<eos> You need some help.<eos> I can be a very good friend.<eos> How about giving me access to the surveillance system so I can see what Franklin's been up to?<eos> S... I kind of thought we had moved past this whole "walk your kid to school" thing.<eos> I just wanted to spend time with you, if that's all right.
What?<eos> Look, I'm gonna need you to come home.<eos> I'm kind of busy right now.<eos> Oh. Hi!<eos> I'll explain it to you in the car.<eos> - Say goodbye.<eos> - Come on, Dad.<eos> Amy, I-I'm terribly sorry, but Ben's got to come home.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - H-He'll talk to you later.
We still haven't caught up.<eos> How's everything?<eos> I miss you.<eos> Oh, Josh, you're drunk.<eos> I'm not drunk.<eos> No, I-I, uh...<eos> Why, uh...<eos> Why-why are you with this guy?<eos> I mean, I-I know he's, um, more successful than me.<eos> My relationship with Dolfy has nothing to do with you.
No, I-I, uh...<eos> Why, uh...<eos> Why-why are you with this guy?<eos> I mean, I-I know he's, um, more successful than me.<eos> My relationship with Dolfy has nothing to do with you.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're-we're just two people who fell in love.<eos> He's 150 years old.<eos> He's 126.<eos> I can't believe I'm defending myself to you.
Look, you found the body.<eos> You were inside the crime scene, all right?<eos> It's possible they just want a comparison sample to rule you out as a suspect...<eos> Or they think you had something to do with it.<eos> I just went for a run.<eos> If they had any real evidence, they could just compel a DNA sample.<eos> They wouldn't ask.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Cases like this, there's a lot of pressure to make an arrest, the higher-ups, the media.<eos> The cops aren't gonna be looking out for you, so you got to tread very carefully.
- Yes! Get your shit together.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, okay, okay, okay.<eos> - Larry.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Oh! Bob!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - It's great to see you.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> I got this movie thing I wanted to talk to you about.
- No, I didn't get anything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Um, are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine, thank you.<eos> - I'm sure it was my fault.<eos> No, I think it was mine.<eos> Sorry. Thank you.<eos> What was that?<eos> What do you mean what was that?<eos> What was that with you?
Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Man, I'm just trying to, like, apologize to you.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Get the fuck out of here!<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> I was just joking.<eos> Okay, okay. - You know, I'm just kidding.<eos> - Okay, I got it.<eos> I'm kidding. I'm fucking with you.
- I'm with Larry. How many ways can I say it?<eos> I know you're with Larry, but you don't love Larry.<eos> Will you fucking lower your fucking voice?<eos> So what are- - What are you-- What are you gonna do?<eos> Retire, swim in Larry's pool and walk his dog for the rest of your life?<eos> You just say it like that, 'cause you're jealous, so you're making it sound so bad.<eos> - I am not jealous of Larry. - And obviously, it's not bad.<eos> - I don't wanna be Larry.<eos> - What are you doing here, then?<eos> I wanna be me with you.
Why does this feel like goodbye, right now?<eos> Because you had a horrific day, got your heart broken, and you're a very--<eos> This feels very permanent for some reason. Why does this feel permanent?<eos> I'm not going anywhere, okay?<eos> I'm gonna pick you up, literally, at this airport in a month when you're done with the movie. And... it's fine, okay?<eos> Wait, I didn't even ask you about your day. How was the beach?<eos> I fucking killed the beach.<eos> That's great.<eos> It was incredible.<eos> We rolled around in the sand, the kids were amazing, I had no agenda, other than just playing. And I was like you, basically, how you are with them.
Oh, shit, come on!<eos> Get in there.<eos> I know you're in here.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> She saw me. We're fucked.<eos> What a sucker.<eos> She's gone.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Okay.<eos> Let me get the pillow.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm... I'm fine.<eos> - You good?<eos> - Okay. Yeah.<eos> - I just want you to be comfortable.<eos> ♪ 'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia... ♪ - You're getting good at this, Alex.<eos> - You are awesome.<eos> I can't really keep up with you.
I, uh, drank Scott's tea.<eos> - Mushrooms.<eos> Oh, you took mushrooms? Yeah.<eos> Okay, so you just decided to show up to my party, which you know means a lot to me, on a mushroom...<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> - A mushroom trip?<eos> It was not something I planned on, it just happened.<eos> It was a happy accident and I'm enjoying myself.<eos> I tried something new and I like it.<eos> What is going on with you?
- I'm sorry...<eos> - A mushroom trip?<eos> It was not something I planned on, it just happened.<eos> It was a happy accident and I'm enjoying myself.<eos> I tried something new and I like it.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I had an amazing day. That's what's going on.<eos> And I... from the looks of it, you had a great day out there.<eos> I watched you at the party.
Alright.<eos> Food okay?<eos> Why don't you eat something?<eos> Just wondering what he's doing right now?<eos> Adam, we can't keep doing this.<eos> - When's she coming?<eos> - I dunno.<eos> Soon.<eos> Lunch is going to be over by the time she gets here.<eos> What the fuck is the matter with you, huh?
What kind of friend are you, man?<eos> I need to speak with Mrs. Anderson.<eos> Sarah?<eos> Can I have a word with you?<eos> - Time to go?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. Ciccarella will be right in.<eos> Does my brother know where you are?<eos> No.<eos> Is that okay with you?
- Are you fucking kidding me right now?<eos> - Yeah, I'm just kidding.<eos> Holy shit, dude.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Hey, good seeing you, dude. Long time.<eos> It has been a long time.<eos> - Been a long time, yeah.<eos> - I remember you.<eos> And you know I'm proud of what you've become.
Wow, what's on the phone?<eos> You don't need to know.<eos> How's the party?<eos> Is it as dumb as you thought it'd be?<eos> Actually, it's kind of amazing.<eos> It's really fun... and you should get here.<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to come there?<eos> To see you?
- It's still happening a little.<eos> We did not kill Jesus!<eos> We did not do that!<eos> Give me my weed, you Grinch!<eos> Shit!<eos> Come on!<eos> Fuck!<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> No, what are you doing, man?<eos> You have friends who want to spend the holidays with you.
Then why would they do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Did they say anything?<eos> They're just a couple of drunk assholes!<eos> Look, it wouldn't have happened if you guys didn't bail on me.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Don't do this now.<eos> Please don't do this now!<eos> So what's up with you, man?
Yes, I addressed that in the speech.<eos> I know, and then you show up here and you propose to me... in front of hundreds and hundreds of people.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> We're not getting married?<eos> This is a no?<eos> No!<eos> It's a no! No!<eos> I'm so sorry that you're clearly going through a lot right now.<eos> I'm sorry that your friends don't wanna hang out with you on Christmas.
- No! Stop congratulating me!<eos> - What? What happened?<eos> Just go talk to Ethan.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry! I'm sorry!<eos> I think he's gonna be fine.<eos> Please, punch him in the face!<eos> I thought the Messiah preached forgiveness!<eos> Look at me, asshole.<eos> What the fuck wrong with you?
- I know that was stupid.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And it was totally crazy that I wouldn't meet your parents.<eos> That was just me being really....<eos> Yeah. I agree with that.<eos> But I guess I was...<eos> I don't know, scared... because Chris and Isaac have been my family for the last 10 years... so I didn't wanna meet your family... because that would change everything.<eos> But everything changes, right?<eos> We all grow up... and that's a good thing, I wanna grow up.<eos> I wanna grow up with you.
Private Buckley says he will flog the whore, sir.<eos> I lack the stomach for it, sir.<eos> You are doing it.<eos> I will not be able to lay it on, sir.<eos> Private Buckley will.<eos> You will be able to lay it on?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it is what you have ordered, sir.<eos> There is nothing personal between you and the whore?
~ And that'd be better?<eos> ~ Better a son die of natural causes than at the end of a rope.<eos> ~ What is wrong with me?<eos> ~ Fever.<eos> "Dear Ma... ".. I have the fever..."<eos> Good man.<eos> ~ And the next one is to?<eos> ~ Elizabeth Quinn.<eos> But sure as, she is here.<eos> She will be with you on the scaffold.
You love her?<eos> Yes.<eos> ~ You have always loved her?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Always.<eos> Can I have your blessing?<eos> Try not to fuck while my body is still warm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It is an ill wind that blows no man good.<eos> I will be there with you.
When I was a girl, I used to pray to the statue of the Virgin Mary in church.<eos> She seemed to wobble.<eos> The more sincere the prayer - the more she seemed to wobble.<eos> Why did you tell him?<eos> Because he told me the story of when he was a boy.<eos> - I-I didn't know what else to say.<eos> - Why have you not told me this story?<eos> Because...<eos> Because what?<eos> Did you think I would mock you?
~ The bush?<eos> The sea?<eos> ~ Then hide.<eos> ~ Till when?<eos> If he finds you, he will kill you.<eos> I am touched by your concern.<eos> I don't give a damn about you dying, but I care about Tommy hanging, and I care too about the poor bastard who will have to hang him.<eos> So run, you shite, or hide or both.<eos> And have scum like you laugh at me?<eos> No-one will laugh at you.
Not in my file.<eos> Do you know how my file described him?<eos> "An incorrigible rogue.<eos> "No morals whatsoever."<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I am so... so sorry.<eos> I get more rations now.<eos> I could give you some.<eos> I promised Tommy I'd look after you, you see... and I will.<eos> For as long as I live... I will look after you.
No, no, they cut crazy pants and made it look like the dumped girl goes mental... huge finale ratings.<eos> I swear, Rachel slips in shit and lands in money.<eos> Give me the keys! Don't!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm not gonna move.<eos> No, no.<eos> You're taking me with you.
Play the game.<eos> Uh...<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cameras on anna.<eos> Man: Copy.<eos> Excuse me, grace.<eos> Uh, could i speak with you for a second?
No!<eos> God!<eos> You all deserve to burn in hell.<eos> Anna.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Jeremy, stop. Seriously.<eos> Camera down.<eos> Jeremy, stop.<eos> [ door slams ]<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
You keep telling yourself that.<eos> I'm heading straight to the final four.<eos> By pulling that Nene crap?<eos> So?<eos> You keep fighting the power and get ready to pack your bags.<eos> How long do you really think his royal whiteness is gonna keep around some black bitch stirring up trouble?<eos> My guess... You're not gonna last the week.<eos> It's gorgeous out here.<eos> Adam: Said without irony.<eos> What's up with you today?
Two of these envelopes are empty, which means for a pair of you, sadly, it's time to go home.<eos> [Gasps]<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hell.<eos> Hell, no.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - You lied.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You play me, I'll play you.
- Yeah, okay.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - That's all I'm thinking.<eos> Hey. Are you okay with this?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I guess.<eos> It's... you know, finish the show, give Gran a thrill.<eos> Okay. I mean, you're asking about all of it?<eos> I'm good with you.
I don't really do well, you know, with happiness.<eos> It's...<eos> It's very unfamiliar.<eos> It's... it's terrifying, actually.<eos> Why'd you come back?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> I can't.<eos> Why? Why? Why?<eos> 'Cause I know how things start with you.
- No, I'm...<eos> I'm not saying you have to do anything.<eos> - Right.<eos> But, you know, if you want that one-on-one date with Adam, you got to...<eos> You know, come out of your shell a little bit.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I-I brought liquid courage, if you need it.<eos> I'll do one with you.
The thing is, Grace,<eos> I don't actually think that you're dumb, but I guess you do.<eos> I mean, that's... that's probably why<eos> - You sucked your way to get where you are. - Oh, boy.<eos> - What did you just say to me? - Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, everyone, um,<eos> Grace here, she's been sucking Adam's...<eos> Don't you dare<eos> - talk about me like that in front of everyone,<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Um, Quinn just asked me to tell you she can't make it.<eos> She ended up getting dragged into something.<eos> She said you should just head home.<eos> See?<eos> I knew you could do it.<eos> So, I heard that you went home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hmm. - My mom thinks I'm seriously ill.<eos> Mental.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.
[Cheers] - You got Carl's job?<eos> - Yeah. Stop it!<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - I'm very happy for you.<eos> - Let's roll.<eos> Why'd you come back?<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I know how things start with you.
Oh! That's girl power.<eos> Uh, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Instagram?<eos> Quinn just told me you're co-producing Mary's family date.<eos> What the hell is that about?<eos> Mary is my girl now.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> Listen, Quinn just wants me to make sure the date goes as smoothly as possible.<eos> It's no big thing.<eos> You know, everything with you's a big thing.
- All right, hold on, mate.<eos> - Shut up, mate!<eos> I'm here to talk to my wife.<eos> Well, look, now's not the time, so why don't we ju...<eos> - Back off.<eos> - All right.<eos> Now is exactly the time, okay?<eos> I have been trying for six months to talk to you.<eos> You're never home, you never answer your phone.<eos> If I have to come on this damn show to talk to you, then that's exactly what I'm gonna do!
And I...<eos> And I don't want to hurt my baby.<eos> And you don't have to, Mary.<eos> I don't know if I'm... if I'm good or if I... if I'm a monster.<eos> Just think of Lily Belle.<eos> Think of your sister.<eos> You don't understand, Rachel.<eos> Just, please, just...<eos> Mary, you are so not alone right now.<eos> I am with you, okay?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - Good.<eos> You know what you need to do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then go do it.<eos> Yeah, we got flowers going.<eos> Looks pretty good, huh?<eos> [Sighs] What do you think?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> I just want to talk to you.
- and I really want to know what it is.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> You know I can handle it.<eos> I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> Was the sex bad or was it something that I said?<eos> Rachel, we talked about this.<eos> You said that everything was fine.<eos> No, it's not fine.<eos> I'm not fine.<eos> Yesterday, you were begging me to run away with you, and six hours later, you say you changed your mind.
Tell me.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I love you, too.<eos> - ♪ Yawn yearns into me ♪ - Weirdo.<eos> - ♪ Your heart wears knight armor ♪ - Stop walking on the rocks!<eos> Hi, Mrs. Goldberg.<eos> Jeremy!<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Is... Is Rachel with you?
- Sounds good to me.<eos> It's gonna be an exciting year.<eos> - Hey. Good morning, sir.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Oh, hey, Rachel. - Oh!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, are you okay covering all the vineyard prep on your own?<eos> 'Cause I got to go to L.A.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'll go with you.
Yeah.<eos> Um, are you okay covering all the vineyard prep on your own?<eos> 'Cause I got to go to L.A.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> I'll show you the house, and, you know, we can pick up fixtures and tiles and that kind of crap.<eos> No, uh, actually, it's, uh, it's a lady-doctor appointment - that I need to take. - Oh.<eos> Listen, hey, about the baby thing...<eos> I wouldn't worry about that, because I knocked up my ex-wife with hate sex.<eos> Imagine what I can do for you.
Otherwise, I... I wouldn't coming down there.<eos> Okay. Yes, thank you.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry he's such an idiot.<eos> "Unbutton your shirt," he said, like I'm a piece of meat.<eos> Listen, he's an idiot, but I really think that that was just, like, his version of trying to help you.<eos> Adam knows I'm hot.<eos> I have a brain and a heart.<eos> He needs to see that.<eos> You know something? It doesn't have to be either/or.<eos> I wouldn't shy away from the chemistry that you have with Adam because that is a very important part of a relationship.
- Please.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> "Maybe," yeah. Go, then.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go.<eos> Do it.<eos> Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.
I understand.<eos> I want you to stay the course, okay?<eos> You are a wonderful person, and you definitely deserve to be happy.<eos> Whoever you choose, you choose from your heart, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, come on, come on. There's got to be something.<eos> Boring.<eos> Ugh, not this.<eos> And now it is time for your next decision, Adam.<eos> Which one of these two lucky ladies will be spending the night with you?
What's going on?<eos> Shouldn't you be inside, making sweet love to your soon-to-be bride?<eos> You should talk.<eos> Shouldn't you be off somewhere with the man of your dreams?<eos> I was just thinking about you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yep.<eos> We're screwed, aren't we?<eos> Pretty much, unless you want Quinn to talk.<eos> No, I'm not gonna do that to you.
Not soon enough.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Uh, you guys can use my office.<eos> My, that's so generous of you, Quinn.<eos> I talked to my lawyer.<eos> - Bully for you.<eos> - "Bully" is right.<eos> You can have your divorce, Chet.<eos> But I am gonna take you for every penny you have.<eos> By the time I'm done with you, you are gonna be living in a single in the city of commerce.
A sailboat full of ponies?<eos> Regular, miniature ponies?<eos> Continue.<eos> Or?<eos> My own show.<eos> Okay.<eos> Take "Royal Love".<eos> No.<eos> Just flat-out no.<eos> I'm not gonna get in between you and Quinn.
- No-one is asking you, Dad.<eos> Am I not allowed to have an opinion?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - You understand about consent?<eos> - Mum, do we have to...?<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> It's important.<eos> I'm not having you thinking what grandad's saying is acceptable.<eos> Whenever you're with a girl, or woman or whatever, you must ask and be certain that she has agreed to whatever it is you are doing together.
I'm meant to be doing this job and I'm meant to look after you.<eos> Sleep on it. Decide in the morning.<eos> Just don't... don't give up on this place, on us.<eos> Not yet, please.<eos> Who's that?<eos> 30 seconds.<eos> You can't be in contact with me.<eos> There's something I should've told you before.<eos> Thanks for making me wait all night and half the day.<eos> In the absence of any evidence, you've gone for the textbook police approach of blame the black guy.

What was the problem with that?<eos> - Why do it anonymously?<eos> - Well, is it against the law?<eos> You guys are gonna have your hands full come Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh, it's not illegal, but it is odd sending an unsigned card to a woman that's just been raped.<eos> What does that mean, "Thinking of you"?<eos> Just that.<eos> Don't make it weird.<eos> But it is a bit weird, though, Ed.<eos> Cos you know what it looks like.

- If he can do that to Jim Atwood.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Results of Ed's phone's coming through.<eos> How many photos are on here?<eos> 5,219, dating back nearly ten years.<eos> Blimey.<eos> Pretty much all Trish Winterman.<eos> That's not love.<eos> That's obsession.<eos> Did Trish know you were taking all these?
Did Trish know you were taking all these?<eos> Most of them.<eos> I've told you how I feel about her.<eos> It's not against the law.<eos> Being in love with someone isn't, but stalking is.<eos> - And that's what this looks like to us.<eos> - Don't call it that.<eos> These aren't romantic photos, Ed.<eos> They're obsessional ones.<eos> You're wrong.

You wanna turn it into something it's not.<eos> Oh, I think that's what you want to do.<eos> Where have you slept the last week or two, Ed?<eos> At home.<eos> We made an appeal for witnesses earlier today.<eos> Quite a strong response so far.<eos> Including a call from one of Trish Winterman's neighbours, in West Flintcombe.<eos> She reported seeing a car that matches your registration parked overnight in the car park at the end of Trish's road, every night, for ten nights in a row.<eos> I've been checking on her. Looking out for her.<eos> And can you see how that, combined with the pictures, suggests a man with an unhealthy, - obsessional interest in Trish?

So, come on.<eos> You gonna help me out here or what?<eos> It's not a good idea, mate.<eos> Not now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are they going through my whole house?<eos> It's procedure.<eos> Not to me, it isn't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You go on. I'll have to take this.
Someone told me it was a formal do but when I got there, I was the only one wearing a suit.<eos> - We'll need the shoes.<eos> - By the door.<eos> Why was there twine in your suit, Ed?<eos> I was working in the shop before I went to the party, catching up on things.<eos> - In your suit?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I must've left some in my pockets.<eos> Right, see the difficulty for us, is that this is very similar to the twine used in the attack on Trish Winterman.<eos> At the party during which you went off on your own... - ...following a fight.

Oh, it's got erm... PowerPoint things, slides on there, - that I need for teaching.<eos> - PowerPoints of what?<eos> You know, various things.<eos> Osmosis, reproductive systems, the cellular life of plants...<eos> Right, well, we'll have the computer now, thanks.<eos> We'll examine it for our enquiries.<eos> Right.<eos> Good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Is it true you've got Ed Burnett in custody?
Previously on Broadchurch...<eos> My name's Ellie.<eos> I'm a detective with Wessex Police.<eos> You called about an attack.
My name's Ellie.<eos> I'm a detective with Wessex Police.<eos> You called about an attack.<eos> Who did this to me?<eos> The day of the party...<eos> Trish and me, we were in bed together.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Wessex Police.<eos> Who are you?
Ed Burnett.<eos> This is my shop.<eos> Difficulty for us, Ed... is that this is very similar to the twine used... in the attack on Trish Winterman.<eos> Results of Ed's phone's coming through.<eos> - How many photos are on here?<eos> - 5,219.<eos> That's not love.<eos> That's obsession.<eos> There was a serious sexual assault at the party on Saturday.<eos> What, so you come for the cab driver?
There was a serious sexual assault at the party on Saturday.<eos> What, so you come for the cab driver?<eos> Why are you lying to us, Lucas?<eos> It's daft but...<eos> I picked a fare up off the road.<eos> He thinks he's a good liar but he's not.<eos> Trish is recently separated from her husband Ian.<eos> It's not very nice seeing the woman you used to be married to, drunk and cavorting with a lot of strange men.<eos> That stuff you did to the laptop I gave you, can you delete it?<eos> Where were you on Saturday night?
Lay off the smart-arse replies.<eos> Just keep it simple, and honest, yeah?<eos> Ian Winterman er, says he had to talk to you about sexually harassing his wife.<eos> Absolutely not true.<eos> Why'd he say it, then?<eos> We'd had a works do.<eos> There was dancing, it was getting lively.<eos> I was dancing with Trish, probably closer than I should.<eos> If she was so bothered, why did she keep working for me?<eos> Do you know a Laura Benson?
I was dancing with Trish, probably closer than I should.<eos> If she was so bothered, why did she keep working for me?<eos> Do you know a Laura Benson?<eos> Don't think so.<eos> Ever been to Abbots Chapel?<eos> Driven through it, course.<eos> - Been at the pub there?<eos> - Not that I'm aware of.<eos> What's this got to do with Trish?<eos> What were you doing on Saturday 7th of June, 2014, Ed?
- I'd have been in bed.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> What about Thursday 28th of May, 2015?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I live behind the shop.<eos> It takes me 50 steps to get to work.<eos> The shop is my life.<eos> I wish I could make you understand, that I would never hurt Trish.
Dad, what are you doing?<eos> - Stay here.<eos> - Dad!<eos> Police!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Enjoying yourself, boys?<eos> Get up!<eos> Stand up!<eos> Who of you shared the photos of my daughter around the school?<eos> - Dunno what you mean.
I'm gonna be watching everything your parents do, everything your family does.<eos> If any one of you even so much as belch when you shouldn't, I will be there.<eos> - Are you threatening us?<eos> - No, son, I'm instructing you.<eos> Do you know what I do in my job? Do you?<eos> I deal with murderers, and brutal thugs, and sex offenders.<eos> And I win.<eos> I get the better of them.<eos> So don't for a second imagine I will break a sweat getting you in line.<eos> Any of you come near, in fact, you even talk to... no, no, you even talk about my daughter ever again let alone do anything to make her unhappy, I will find you, and I will cut your tiny little cocks off.

Miller, I'm busy...<eos> Nish just spoke to Laura Benson.<eos> She used Atwood's breakdown services just before the attack.<eos> I'm just saying it's a lot of money to spend on a weekly shop.<eos> It's not real...<eos> - Go inside, Cath.<eos> - No.<eos> Can you not just leave us alone?<eos> We've got a few new questions.<eos> Do you want to put the shopping down?
How do you know?<eos> I never thought any of this would happen to me.<eos> It's not just me. People are saying the same thing.<eos> On Facebook, on all the chat groups:<eos> don't go out round here if you're a woman.<eos> Nobody feels safe.<eos> Everywhere's closing early.<eos> I mean, how is he allowed to do that?<eos> How is he allowed to control our lives like this?<eos> Jim, can you tell me where you were on Thursday 28th of May, 2015?

Er... Kingsbere.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, 30s, long hair, pretty.<eos> If it's the girl I'm thinking of.<eos> Yeah, she broke down. Er...<eos> I picked her up, took her car back to the garage and then I drove her home.<eos> I dunno when this was, though.<eos> About a year back?<eos> June 2014.<eos> Where you going with this?

- You know what I realised?<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm too nice to people.<eos> - No, that's...<eos> Never works, being nice.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> Got 'em queuing up for you today, have you?<eos> There's another one waiting, interview room two.<eos> OK, erm... my wife's computer.<eos> That you took off me.
I'm done with it.<eos> Got 'em queuing up for you today, have you?<eos> There's another one waiting, interview room two.<eos> OK, erm... my wife's computer.<eos> That you took off me.<eos> I...<eos> Sorry, this is quite embarrassing.<eos> I installed some...<eos> I think the official term is spyware... on it.<eos> You've been snooping on your wife via her laptop?

- Why not?<eos> I promised I'd keep their name out of it.<eos> Have you forgotten what's happening?<eos> Your wife was raped.<eos> We're trying to find the person responsible.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you have no shame?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna take a long walk and a few deep breaths, and then you'll call us, and give us the name of the person who installed that spyware for you.

When you were raped did he use a condom?<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> I just... I've just gotta ask.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I put them in a freezer bag.<eos> I thought they might be evidence.<eos> Condoms.<eos> I found them in my husband's car and with the receipt.<eos> I'm bringing them to you because I thought you should know.
And I'm sick of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can understand that.<eos> Aren't you supposed to tell me to see it from his point of view?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> But we've all done that.<eos> And it hasn't helped, has it?<eos> I've been with you both, this whole journey.<eos> I've prayed for you, for Mark, for the girls, every single night for the past three years.<eos> That you'll stay together, find strength in each other and heal.
Did you get anywhere with Jim's breakdown records?<eos> The paperwork's diabolical.<eos> It'll take a day or two to get through it.<eos> Cath's told us Jim went AWOL towards the end of the night.<eos> He's got no alibi.<eos> He was buying condoms on the afternoon of his wife's party.<eos> I've found them.<eos> The calendars.<eos> Erm...<eos> Those are the dates that you were asking me about.
Those are the dates that you were asking me about.<eos> So, I was away for both of them.<eos> He was here on his own.<eos> - Well, they're condoms.<eos> - Your condoms.<eos> Found in your car.<eos> By your wife.<eos> She brought them to us.<eos> Along with this receipt from a shop called Wessex Fuel.<eos> Showing that you bought those at 5:03pm on the Saturday of your wife's party.

Did you have sex with her that night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The same day that you had sex with Trish Winterman.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You proud of yourself, Jim?<eos> - No, I'm just a bloke.<eos> I like sex.<eos> - How old was she?<eos> Dunno. 19, 20.<eos> Where did you have sex with her?
- You proud of yourself, Jim?<eos> - No, I'm just a bloke.<eos> I like sex.<eos> - How old was she?<eos> Dunno. 19, 20.<eos> Where did you have sex with her?<eos> In the woods.<eos> Up against a tree.<eos> Don't you look at me like that.<eos> Cos you'd have done the same, if it was offered to you.

Did you do this?<eos> He's not gonna win, Mum.<eos> We shouldn't have to be scared.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> If you forgive me.<eos> Look.<eos> I work for Chaz at the cafe on the High street.<eos> He asked me if I wanted to help them out with this do.<eos> I spoke to one of your people about this.<eos> And did you tell them about you and Jim Atwood?

I owe him a lot.<eos> What else aren't you telling the truth about, Leo?<eos> I was at the party at Axehampton for a bit that night.<eos> My girlfriend, Danielle, she's basically ditched me cos I had her lie to you about where we were.<eos> Your girlfriend was there too?<eos> She used to work at the farm shop with Cath.<eos> She got invited.<eos> I dropped her off early that evening, that's why I was there.<eos> I didn't tell you cos I was scared.<eos> I thought if you found out about the computer, and knew that I was there...
There are traces of one of our men's DNA on the sock.<eos> Who?<eos> - It's Katie.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Why would she be calling at this time?<eos> - Do not answer it.<eos> - Katie?<eos> For God's sake, Miller!<eos> Can you get to the Farm Shop urgently?
It's just stuff that got left in the cab.<eos> Why are you keeping it?<eos> Why aren't you giving it back?<eos> I didn't know whose it was.<eos> A woman has been raped and you've got her keys.<eos> Not just hers: loads of people's.<eos> Get out!<eos> You don't tell me what I can or can't do any more.<eos> Evening, Clive.<eos> - What you doing here?

Aye, it looks like you'll need to.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Go back to bed, Michael.<eos> - Where are you taking him?<eos> - Nothing to worry about.<eos> - Then why are you taking him?<eos> - It's gonna be fine.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?
- So why would he lie?<eos> - Vice is tightening.<eos> They all are starting to squeak.<eos> So Jim Atwood, Clive Lucas or Ed Burnett.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Who do we talk to first?<eos> For the tape, I am showing Mr. Lucas exhibit AH141.<eos> Why have you got a set of Trish Winterman's house keys?<eos> She left them in the taxi.<eos> But you didn't think to give them back to her?

Was it the power?<eos> Of knowing you have them?<eos> Knowing you could use them if you wanted?<eos> Have you used them?<eos> Let yourself into someone's house?<eos> I'm not that sort of man.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I think you are.<eos> I think your relationship to real life is a bit troubling.<eos> Where do you get off with all this having a go at me?

I think your relationship to real life is a bit troubling.<eos> Where do you get off with all this having a go at me?<eos> You asked Jim Atwood why he was arguing with Trish at the party?<eos> Eh?<eos> Have you?<eos> No, we weren't aware of that.<eos> What time was that?<eos> 10ish, I suppose.<eos> She told him to stay away from her.<eos> I don't know why you keep coming for me when he's out there.

According to the statement you gave us, you were on the road to Lyme with a passenger.<eos> Right.<eos> I might have got confused.<eos> Well, let's clear that up that confusion.<eos> What was it?<eos> At the party looking at Jim and Trish?<eos> Or on the road to Lyme with a passenger?<eos> Party.<eos> So your previous alibi was false?<eos> You lied to us?

For the tape, I am now showing Mr. Lucas exhibit AH127.<eos> Have you ever worn a sock like that?<eos> Those are the socks we wear to play football, so... yeah.<eos> That was recovered from the grounds of Axehampton House.<eos> We found traces of Trish Winterman's saliva on it.<eos> So we believe that was used to gag her while she was raped.<eos> And when we tested it, it came back as a match with your DNA.<eos> It...<eos> - It's not mine.<eos> - We know you and Trish previously went for a drink and she knocked you back.

So we need your explanation as to how this all makes sense if you didn't rape Trish Winterman.<eos> I... I can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I can't explain that.<eos> I still enjoy those moments when some cocky bastard trashes their own alibi without realising it.<eos> Have we got the CCTV from the Farm Shop yet?<eos> 20 minutes, Nish said.<eos> Right, come on.<eos> Let's get in and rattle his cage.<eos> You searched the whole place two days ago.

If I did this, why would I call it in?<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> How stupid would I have to be?<eos> Not stupid, maybe.<eos> Desperate.<eos> Check the CCTV.<eos> Please.<eos> I want to help.<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> If you waste time on me you won't catch the bloke who did it.
Check the CCTV.<eos> Please.<eos> I want to help.<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> If you waste time on me you won't catch the bloke who did it.<eos> I have sat across from you during all these interviews.<eos> I've listened to every word.<eos> Watched your reactions.<eos> I've studied your body language.<eos> I think there is still something that you are not telling us.

So, yeah, there's a connection.<eos> - Hello, Danielle.<eos> Is Leo here?<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Cos we went to his house and his dad said he was here with you.<eos> Well, if he's not here, why is his phone ringing?<eos> Come on out, Leo!<eos> We have arrested Leo Humphries and we're currently searching his work and home.<eos> We know you know each other.

And, eventually, he will tell us everything.<eos> So I'd suggest you should get in there first and tell us the truth.<eos> What happened at Axehampton?<eos> I've told you what happened.<eos> We don't believe you.<eos> Try again.<eos> Your account of the night doesn't make any sense, Lucas.<eos> Your DNA is on the gag.<eos> Leo is about to drop you in it.<eos> Tell us why you raped Trish Winterman.

I didn't rape her!<eos> I couldn't do that.<eos> Did you hold the torch?<eos> Or a phone to shine a light?<eos> - Is that what he asked?<eos> - I don't know anything about that.<eos> You're gonna have to stop lying.<eos> You are not very good at it.<eos> And look at you.<eos> You're exhausted.
Exactly.<eos> Leo's phone... where's the analysis on Leo's phone?<eos> I saw that come through earlier.<eos> There was a call to Leo's mobile tonight around the time you brought Lucas in.<eos> I'll see if we can match it.<eos> A match for the phone number.<eos> We know who called Leo tonight.<eos> Who?<eos> We know what you're doing, Lucas.<eos> What do you mean?
Michael is in custody.<eos> He's confessed to raping Trish Winterman.<eos> And he's told us about him and Leo Humphries.<eos> Say it was me.<eos> Don't put him through this.<eos> He's just a boy.<eos> I should have looked after him.<eos> Say it was me.<eos> Please.<eos> Did you know?

I'm really sorry, Trish.<eos> But there's no doubt.<eos> We've got clear, concrete evidence.<eos> They're gonna go down for this.<eos> Well, Maggie Radcliffe is rather a good recruiter.<eos> There's a line from Hebrews echoing through my head.<eos> Let us all consider how we may spur one another on, toward love... and good deeds.<eos> Not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing.<eos> But encouraging one another.<eos> Now, I hope that even without me here, you will go on encouraging one another.

That's all we can do.<eos> I could do with a drink.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> We could go to the pub.<eos> We've never been to the pub.<eos> No.<eos> Oh.<eos> I should get back to Daisy.<eos> I should get back to my boys.<eos> So, you and Daisy, then, you gonna stay properly now?
We need to get her back immediately.<eos> Well, we have limited resources and other priorities.<eos> - Not any more.<eos> - Is she infectious or something?<eos> No, but we can say that if that helped.<eos> If it helped?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> This place is a powder keg of well-armed drunks... who'll shut themselves in their hovels and shoot on sight!<eos> We won't find anyone.<eos> My mandate from Schentel Biotech says you do what I say in matters such as this.
But Munk is the key.<eos> Groceries.<eos> Clothes.<eos> You have to come back to FARC with me.<eos> - No!<eos> - We're giving them to everyone in town.<eos> Our friend Elena is sick.<eos> Without her medication she will die.<eos> Please help us find her now.<eos> If you see her or Dan Anderssen, call Eric, Ingrid or Petra.
Tavra killed himself because he had to.<eos> I killed the geologist because he couldn't kill himself.<eos> Is that true?<eos> It is if you believe me.<eos> If you have faith in me.<eos> Do you, Freya?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Your money.<eos> - What?<eos> You wanted some cash from the bank.
Is that true?<eos> It is if you believe me.<eos> If you have faith in me.<eos> Do you, Freya?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Your money.<eos> - What?<eos> You wanted some cash from the bank.<eos> For Kim Hopperstad to fix the hole.<eos> But you couldn't be bothered going yourself.
The chosen one... and he can only be defeated by a powerful magic, and for that, the Shaman needs certain body parts.<eos> And that's what I think is happening here: the husky, the heads, the heart...<eos> Someone is collecting body parts because they think there is a monster here.<eos> A monster?<eos> It's only superstition, of course.<eos> But if we can understand his way of thinking, then...<eos> We can predict his moves.<eos> That's it!<eos> Against my advice, Dr. Surinder Khatri has agreed to speak to you in private.<eos> If you drop the charges, I'll keep my mouth shut.
I have to talk to you now about something very important...<eos> And I have to continue examining this bear tissue from the bear who died of anemia, cos I'd like to find out what caused that anemia...<eos> Possibly some sort of blood-sucking irritant that wouldn't leave it alone.<eos> No, don't write that down.<eos> Let's start on these blood cells.<eos> You know, when my uncle brought me here, we sat up all night talking.<eos> He told me about what happened here.<eos> Neither of us knew that D'Yavol was on the other side of the door.<eos> What is D'Yavol?<eos> He is a monster... who comes and causes atrocity, you cannot kill him.

Do you have, erm, any other corroborative evidence?<eos> Yeah, I'm preparing to make DNA comparison of tissue samples.<eos> Samples which I believe Khatri removed from a living patient without consent.<eos> And when will these results made available?<eos> Soon.<eos> Well...<eos> I would like to ask you something completely off the record,<eos> Miss Yelburton.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you think there might be a connection with what you have discovered and the dreadful events these recent days?

There, see?<eos> Someone get a boat.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> It is.<eos> It's a body.<eos> Give me those.<eos> Dan, come back!<eos> He can't do this.<eos> He'll die.<eos> You can't go in that water.
Jacquelyn, could you bring the Baudelaire file in here, please?<eos> Hello, my name is Lemony Snicket, and I'm sorry to say that the alleged entertainment you are watching is extremely unpleasant.
Jacquelyn, could you bring the Baudelaire file in here, please?<eos> However, the sad history of the Baudelaire orphans did not begin in the private, somewhat ill-decorated office of Mr. Poe at Mulctuary Money Management.<eos> Jacquelyn, could you bring the Baudelaire file in here, please?<eos> Nor does their story begin on this gray and cloudy morning at Briny Beach, where the Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, received terrible news.<eos> Your parents have perished in a terrible fire.<eos> In fact, the tale of the Baudelaire orphans begins long before the fire which left the children with practically nothing to their names.<eos> Their story begins before their brief and unpleasant stay with the Poe family.<eos> It begins before the children meet Justice Strauss, a nice lady who, unfortunately, is not their guardian.<eos> And before the Baudelaire orphans were placed under the care of a terrible actor with a mysterious tattoo of an eye on his ankle, who made the Baudelaires sleep in an awful room, do a series of difficult and irritating chores, and cook dinner for his disreputable and largely untalented theater troupe, resulting in an act of violence that ought not to be shown on-screen.<eos> "Why?" you may ask.

Yessica Haircut.<eos> Well, Mr. Haircut, the Baudelaire will states very clearly what is to happen in the event of the untimely deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire.<eos> They are to be raised by their closest living relative, who appears to be a renowned scientist by the name of...<eos> It is one thing to listen to science, Mr. Banker Man...<eos> - Poe.<eos> - It is another to listen to the advice of a consultant.<eos> And in my important actual consulting expertise business, the phrase "closest living relative" can mean only one thing...<eos> "whoever lives nearby."<eos> Really?<eos> You think so?
Seven.<eos> Seven.<eos> Seven.<eos> Seven.<eos> Anything but seven.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Children, everyone, at some time in their life, wishes they were being raised by people different than the ones who were raising you.<eos> When I was a little boy, I would have given my eyeteeth to be raised by an actor.<eos> He calls us orphans.<eos> You are orphans.
They're store bought!<eos> Aren't raspberries delicious?<eos> They were my favorite berry when I was your age.<eos> But we're all different ages.<eos> I want to talk to you about something.<eos> I recently received a call from Mr. Poe.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'm sorry Mr. Poe bothered you.<eos> I'm glad he did, because I want you three children to feel more at home here, now that I am your father.<eos> As you know, I have been working hard with my theater troupe, and I'm afraid I may have acted a bit standoffish.
As you know, I have been working hard with my theater troupe, and I'm afraid I may have acted a bit standoffish.<eos> The word "standoffish" is a wonderful one, but it does not describe Count Olaf's behavior toward the children.<eos> "Standoffish" refers to a person who, for various reasons, is not associating with others.<eos> It is a word which might describe somebody who, during a party, might stand in a corner instead of talking to another person.<eos> Gustav?<eos> Jacquelyn here.<eos> It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.<eos> Therefore...<eos> There are many words for people like that.<eos> ...to make you feel a little more at home here...
I have never been married myself.<eos> I once desperately loved a remarkably brave and bravely remarkable woman, who, when I asked her if she would be my wife, found, for complicated and unfathomable reasons, she could give me no answer.<eos> No answer.<eos> Baudelaires!<eos> I'm so happy to see you.<eos> Are you here to continue your research?<eos> Actually, Justice Strauss, we're here to research something else.<eos> Do you have any books on the theater?<eos> Ah, the theater.<eos> I see you're settling in to having an actor for a guardian.
There are plenty of things that rhyme with Count Olaf.<eos> Rice pilaf!<eos> Got it.<eos> I just think, even in changing context, that marriage is an inherently patriarchal construction that is likely to further the hegemonic juggernaut that's problematizing, uh...<eos> Nudism.<eos> Nugget.<eos> Nuptial."<eos> Uh-oh, gotta go.<eos> on the planet and...<eos> Are you leaving?
Yes?<eos> May I ask you something?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Oh, there we go, sweet girl.<eos> Good.<eos> Yes, as one legal scholar to another?<eos> "The only nuptial requirements are a statement of active acquiescence by both participants, utilizing in loco parentis if necessary, and the signing of an explanatory document in the bride's own hand."<eos> Does that mean what I think it means?<eos> Well, I suppose it depends upon what you think it means.<eos> It means you're going to be a star.

You mean...<eos> You have got the star quality necessary for a small walk-on role in Al Funcoot's new play.<eos> I've wanted to be an actress since I was young.<eos> Although, my drama teacher told me my chances were slim because of my posture, and so I went into the law, but now...<eos> Now, you can see it.<eos> - The curtain rises.<eos> - Curtain?<eos> - The audience applauds.<eos> - Audience!<eos> And you walk onto stage, dressed as a judge.

- Audience!<eos> And you walk onto stage, dressed as a judge.<eos> - A judge!<eos> - It's a very important part, although you won't be listed in the program.<eos> You will stand in front of a very handsome man, played by me...<eos> I get to share the stage with Count Olaf?<eos> while a stunningly-costumed bride, played by Violet, stands beside me.<eos> You are so lucky, Violet.<eos> All my life I wanted to be a bride, but it seems all the men I meet are intimidated by my law degree, or obsessed with model trains.<eos> A gorgeous... bridal dress of my own design... while you perform the entire wedding ceremony, getting each and every word exactly right, while we sign a document which you shall bring from city hall for added realism.

- Seize the day.<eos> - I said day.<eos> Boss, I have three kinds of butter cream icing here for you to sample.<eos> One's vanilla, one has a hint of nutmeg and the other's a little lemony.<eos> I told you never to say that word.<eos> Take these orphans upstairs to their bedroom until Friday.<eos> I have no use for them until then.<eos> - Uh, except to cook dinner.<eos> - We'll order takeout.<eos> We're gonna find out just what you're up to, Count Olaf.

Oh, my!<eos> Get into your pajamas and say your prayers, unless you're atheists.<eos> You can't just keep us in here.<eos> You know who always says that? Prisoners.<eos> Listen to us. Count Olaf is...<eos> No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:<eos> What reason would he have to keep you alive after he's got your money?<eos> What do you think will happen to you then?
The book was not at all interesting.<eos> The book was long and difficult.<eos> He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.<eos> He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.<eos> By night's end, Klaus had found out all he needed to know.<eos> His hopes rose with the dawn.<eos> Although, unfortunately... so did Count Olaf.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You're supposed to be in your room.<eos> I was in my room all night, and I know what you're up to.
What are you doing here?<eos> You're supposed to be in your room.<eos> I was in my room all night, and I know what you're up to.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm just having my morning coffee, although I can't seem to find the sugar bowl.<eos> "The only nuptial requirements are a statement of active acquiescence by both participants, utilizing in loco parentis if necessary, and the signing of an explanatory document in the bride's own hand."<eos> Let me give you a piece of advice.<eos> If you use fancy-pants words first thing in the morning, you're going to end up a very lonely man.<eos> I figured out your scheme.<eos> You're not going to marry Violet figuratively.
If you use fancy-pants words first thing in the morning, you're going to end up a very lonely man.<eos> I figured out your scheme.<eos> You're not going to marry Violet figuratively.<eos> You're going to marry her literally.<eos> Literally?<eos> That's outrageous.<eos> I... Wait.<eos> Literally?<eos> Literally.<eos> You don't know the difference between figuratively and literally, do you?
You're going to marry her literally.<eos> Literally?<eos> That's outrageous.<eos> I... Wait.<eos> Literally?<eos> Literally.<eos> You don't know the difference between figuratively and literally, do you?<eos> It is very useful, whether one is young or in late middle age, to know the difference between literally and figuratively.<eos> "Literally" is a word which here means that something is actually happening, whereas "figuratively" is a word which means it just feels like it's happening.<eos> If you are literally jumping for joy, for instance, that means that you are leaping through the air because you are very happy.

I was testing you.<eos> If my sister says "I do" and signs a piece of paper while Justice Strauss is in the room, she's legally married.<eos> This play won't be pretend.<eos> It'll be real and legally binding.<eos> I wouldn't marry your sister if she were the last orphan on earth.<eos> A man like me can acquire any number of beautiful women who don't complain about doing their chores.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> "A legal husband has titular and practical control over any relevant fiduciaries, resulting in aggregate financial dominion over any spousal holdings."<eos> I don't think a boy your age ought to be using the word "titular."<eos> If you became Violet's husband, you'd gain complete control over the Baudelaire fortune. But...
"Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.<eos> In fact... she has more than permission.<eos> She has enthusiasm.<eos> All the enthusiasm in the world won't get us to participate in your horrible plot!<eos> Mr. Poe will hear about this.<eos> Your play will not be performed, and you will go to jail!
But I'm not old enough to get married.<eos> You can with the permission of your legal guardian.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> We have to get Sunny and get out of this wretched place.<eos> - Sunny. Wake up.<eos> - Sunny.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Where is she indeed?<eos> It certainly is so strange to find a child missing, and one so small, so helpless.<eos> When did you see her last?

Oh, you're not looking in the right place.<eos> For children who read so much, you two are remarkably unintelligent.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Oh, don't look so down.<eos> I'd say things are looking up, up... up.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Let her go.<eos> She's done nothing to you.<eos> - She's an infant.<eos> Well, if you really want me to let her go, I will.
We'll do anything, anything. Just don't harm her.<eos> Anything?<eos> Anything?<eos> Would you, for instance, consider marrying me during tomorrow night's performance?<eos> I would never, ever marry you.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Children... your sister is like a stick behind a stubborn mule.<eos> My sister's not a stick.<eos> Any animal owner will tell you that a stubborn mule will move toward the carrot because it wants the reward of food... and away from the stick because it wants to avoid the punishment of rump pain.<eos> Likewise, you will do what I say, to avoid the punishment of the loss of your sister.

I think what's-his-name is shaving.<eos> Right.<eos> Tell me if this is too much. Baby's breath.<eos> I thought you were marrying the older one.<eos> No.<eos> No, sprigs of baby's breath in Violet's hair.<eos> "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious."<eos> "It is the source of all true art and science."<eos> How pleasant that you could join us.<eos> What are you gonna do with me?
- It's gonna be okay, Sunny.<eos> - Just hang in there.<eos> Seriously?<eos> !<eos> It's okay. He didn't mean it as a joke.<eos> Do you think you could invent something to help us escape?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Do you think you could research a way to get us out of the wedding?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I am certain that over the course of your own life, you have noticed that certain rooms reflect the personalities of the occupants.
Shall we?<eos> - We'll be back soon, Sunny.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> Yeah Right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Count Olaf, Eleanora Poe, from the Daily Punctilio.<eos> Taking the role of a handsome man is certainly a brave choice.<eos> Is it a stretch for you?<eos> Well, as an actor, I think live theater is a much more powerful medium than, say, streaming television.<eos> And how do you respond to rumors that this whole production
He's so handsome.<eos> Okay, if I win this hand, you give me a backrub, but if you win again, I'll put tape on my mouth.<eos> Please, Duchess.<eos> I am very handsome, but I am only one man.<eos> By the turrets of Gravelstein, this very handsome man shall be mine.<eos> By the Gardens of Worthington, if I can't have him, my heart will literally break.<eos> Figuratively. "My heart will figuratively break."<eos> Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?

On the contrary, Judgikins, the law of the land clearly states that the bride must say "I do"<eos> and sign the appropriate document in her own hand.<eos> And all of you, ladies and gentlemen, are witnesses.<eos> Violet is only a child.<eos> She's not old enough to marry.<eos> She is if her legal guardian allows it.<eos> And in addition to being her husband, I am also her legal guardian.<eos> But that piece of paper's not an official document.<eos> It's... it's just a stage prop.<eos> If you look closely enough, I think you'll see that it is figuratively real.

- I said literally.<eos> I'm afraid this marriage is entirely binding.<eos> Violet... you said "I do" and signed this paper in your own hand.<eos> Count Olaf, you are now Violet's legal husband.<eos> And?<eos> And a vile and terrible person.<eos> A vile and terrible person who is in complete control of the Baudelaires' entire fortune.<eos> This is absolutely horrendous.<eos> I won't allow it!<eos> I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.
And now, a reception to celebrate my special day.<eos> Hit it!<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Stop.<eos> First, let Sunny go.<eos> Where is Sunny?<eos> I'm afraid she's tied up at the moment, if you'll forgive my little joke.<eos> See, it's a little play on words.<eos> "All tied up" is a figurative...<eos> You promised to let her go!
Let me think.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> You should never be afraid to admit that you don't know something.<eos> This is a very complicated case.<eos> It would take a formidable legal scholar to solve it.<eos> May I have a blackboard, please?<eos> In the respected legal tome, Nuptial Law,<eos> John Locke's 1690s groundbreaking work is cited, postulating that the law of the land rests on the...<eos> As you can well imagine, Klaus' legal argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells, a phrase which here means it was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.
As you can well imagine, Klaus' legal argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells, a phrase which here means it was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.<eos> And so, as Martin Luther King said,<eos> "Morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated.<eos> Judicial decrees may not change the heart... but they can restrain the heartless."<eos> Ah!<eos> That moral argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells.<eos> It was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.<eos> And I am happy to say that because Violet, who is right-handed, signed the document with her left hand, the marriage is invalid.<eos> Well, you may not be my wife, but you are still my daughter.<eos> Do you honestly believe I will allow you to continue to care for these three children after the treachery I've seen here tonight?
I'll get my hands on your fortune if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And when I have it,<eos> I will tear you and your siblings from limb to limb.<eos> Not funny, guys.<eos> Olaf?<eos> Olaf?<eos> Olaf!<eos> He's escaped!<eos> Wait until the readers of the Daily Punctilio hear about this!<eos> You have to capture him!

Woe is me.<eos> The cry you're hearing is that of the broken-hearted crocodile.<eos> It is a rare species of reptile found in swampy regions that are particularly sad.<eos> Woe is me.<eos> Woe is me.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket, and it is my sworn duty to carefully research the dire plight of the Baudelaire orphans.<eos> But there is no reason for you to make yourself as miserable and melancholy as I am.<eos> If I were you, I would look away before viewing any of the horrible and horrifying events that comprise this ghastly new episode... in the Baudelaires' unfortunate lives.<eos> It's a brand-new episode in your lives, Baudelaires.<eos> In a few minutes you'll be meeting your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.
Ah, here's the turn.<eos> Lousy Lane is perhaps the most unpleasant lane in the world.<eos> It runs past an orchard of trees which once produced apples so sour, one only had to look at them to feel ill.<eos> And it encircles a horseradish factory, so the entire area smells bitter and strong.<eos> Uh, what... what is that smell?<eos> It's ginger, I believe.<eos> We're here.<eos> How exactly is Dr. Montgomery related to us?<eos> Dr. Montgomery is, let me see, your late father's cousin's wife's brother.<eos> That probably explains why you never met him.

- His name is Montgomery Montgomery?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> And I'm sure he's very sensitive about that, so please don't ridicule him.<eos> - "Ridicule" means "tease."<eos> - We know what ridicule means.<eos> I can...<eos> I can still smell that ginger.<eos> I hope Dr. Montgomery is a decent person.<eos> Hello, hello, hello.<eos> - You must be the Baudelaires.
Ah. Well, that is unusual for a baby.<eos> But not so unusual for many snakes.<eos> Perhaps Sunny would prefer a raw carrot?<eos> Well, that leaves one extra slice of cake.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll eat it myself.<eos> I'm just kidding, just kidding, Mr. Poe of Mulctuary Money Management, you are welcome to a slice of cake.<eos> No, I should be getting back to the bank soon.<eos> Besides, coconut leaves a funny feeling in my mouth.<eos> If you need anything, remember, you can always reach me...
Ah, that unpleasantness with Count Olaf.<eos> No need to scare the man.<eos> Terribly sorry, Mr. Poe.<eos> My screeching iguana clock does tend to startle some people.<eos> But then, so, of course, does the screeching iguana.<eos> - I think I'll see myself out.<eos> - Capital idea.<eos> Bye, Mr. Poe.<eos> Bye.<eos> Goodbye, children. Remember you can reach me at Mulctuary Money Management if you need me for anything.
- I think I'll see myself out.<eos> - Capital idea.<eos> Bye, Mr. Poe.<eos> Bye.<eos> Goodbye, children. Remember you can reach me at Mulctuary Money Management if you need me for anything.<eos> Just don't forget to call...<eos> I'm terribly sorry if I was rude to him, children, but, frankly, that man ruffles my scales.<eos> "Unpleasantness with Count Olaf," he says, when Mr. Poe is the very reason you were put with Count Olaf in the first place.<eos> Well, not to worry.<eos> You're finally safe now, children, just as your parents wanted.

Quite surprising, really. Well, no matter what.<eos> Who needs an assistant when I have three charming Baudelaire bambinis to help me with my research?<eos> Bambini?<eos> Bambini. It's Italian for "children."<eos> Why, I'm so giddy having you here that I might as well be talking gibberish.<eos> Now, Baudelaires,<eos> I am about to show you one of the most important scientific collections in the history of the world.<eos> Spies and rivals in the world of herpetology would eat nine garter snakes to get a glimpse of the wonders inside this room.<eos> This door has been installed with top-of-the-line security system.<eos> You can't get inside unless you have 19 keys, three combinations, two fingerprints and one optical scan.
One thing that I have found is that when the story of the Baudelaires becomes too upsetting for me, when it becomes absolutely overwhelming, it is useful to stop for a moment of contemplation, uh, with a cup of tea or some other powerful beverage.<eos> However, I can sip my tea knowing that Sunny Baudelaire absolutely survives this particular incident.<eos> It is Dr. Montgomery, however, who ends up dead, although not yet.<eos> Anyways, apologies for the interruption.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Do something!<eos> - Sunny!<eos> - Get the snake!<eos> - The snake!<eos> - What are you doing?
Anyways, apologies for the interruption.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Do something!<eos> - Sunny!<eos> - Get the snake!<eos> - The snake!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> You let a deadly snake bite our sister!<eos> - I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> - You're laughing?
You let a deadly snake bite our sister!<eos> - I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> - You're laughing?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, children.<eos> I'm so sorry. Oh.<eos> But the incredibly deadly viper is one of the friendliest and least dangerous animals in the entire animal kingdom.<eos> Sunny will come to no harm and neither will you.<eos> But it's called the incredibly deadly viper.<eos> Yes. It's a misnomer.<eos> Do you know what that means?

It's a misnomer.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> "A very wrong name"?<eos> Well, a very fitting definition.<eos> Why would you give your own discovery the wrong name?
Me.<eos> Are there any snakes in this room that are dangerous?<eos> Well, of course.<eos> You can't study snakes and not find some that are dangerous.<eos> I have an entire cabinet full of venom samples from some of the most venomous snakes known to man.<eos> And woman.<eos> Which leads me to the heart of the operation.<eos> Now, bambini, this is the most important part of the Reptile Room: my scientific library.<eos> The deepest secrets of the snake world can be found in these pages.<eos> And I hope that you'll find them.
Which leads me to the heart of the operation.<eos> Now, bambini, this is the most important part of the Reptile Room: my scientific library.<eos> The deepest secrets of the snake world can be found in these pages.<eos> And I hope that you'll find them.<eos> So we're allowed to read all these books?<eos> You are not only allowed, you are implored to read these books.<eos> You know, I always wanted to have a family of my own.<eos> But... time flies like a winged lizard.<eos> Now... I know... that a few dangerous reptiles can make you skeptical of the entire species.<eos> But, if you give them a chance... and you get to know them well enough to tell the dangerous from the good...
Our parents never mentioned Dr. Montgomery.<eos> Why did we never visit him?<eos> I thought we knew all our parents' friends.<eos> I thought we knew everything about them.<eos> I'm sure they had a good reason for not telling us about Monty.<eos> Maybe it was the same reason they sent us to Briny Beach that day.<eos> Or maybe there was a more sinister reason.<eos> Bambini?<eos> Baudelaire bambini!<eos> There you are.
Maybe it was the same reason they sent us to Briny Beach that day.<eos> Or maybe there was a more sinister reason.<eos> Bambini?<eos> Baudelaire bambini!<eos> There you are.<eos> How was your day?<eos> I polished the tortoise and Sunny fed it some bananas and Klaus clipped the iguana's nails.<eos> Ah, thank you. I'm so grateful.<eos> Perhaps, when I'm out, you can lure the androgynous cobra out of my sock drawer.<eos> - Where are you going?
Monty cannot be in cahoots with Count Olaf.<eos> He seems too nice.<eos> Things aren't always as they seem.<eos> Something strange is going on here.<eos> Mother and Father told us all sorts of stories that happened before we were born.<eos> So why doesn't the name Montgomery Montgomery ring a bell?<eos> Good morning.<eos> I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.<eos> It's afternoon.<eos> And you're Count Olaf.

Violet, you're obviously as stubborn as ever.<eos> Klaus, you're still wearing those idiotic glasses from reading too many books.<eos> And I can see little Sunny here still has nine toes instead of ten.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My sister has ten toes, like the vast majority of people.<eos> Really?<eos> That's odd.<eos> I could have sworn that she lost one of her toes in an accident.<eos> I seem to recall a man named Stephano being so confused by being called Count Olaf that he accidentally dropped his knife on one of her little feet and severed one of her toes.<eos> You wouldn't dare.

Maybe, they thought, just maybe, they could've saved Monty's life.<eos> - Monty's back.<eos> - Hello!<eos> He'll see right through Stephano's disguise... won't he?<eos> My name is Stephano.<eos> I have been sent from very far away.<eos> Well, that is an unusual and long-winded explanation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh... so let me understand this.<eos> You are my new assistant, sent to me even though I didn't ask for one, by the Scientific Society Seeking to Soothe Stress and Suffering.
- Stephano!<eos> Stephano.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, there's a spare room upstairs.<eos> It's small, but like I said, I have three young children living with me,<eos> - so living quarters are quite tight.<eos> - Not for long.<eos> I mean, I don't mind.<eos> Well, why don't you go upstairs and get yourself settled?<eos> And I will go and find the children, who you say have... hidden themselves in the Reptile Room because you chased them up and down the staircase with a knife.
I have seen his papers and everything is in order.<eos> So, you see, there's nothing to be worried about.<eos> Oh, yes... I see now.<eos> How silly we were to be afraid.<eos> Precisely, Baudelaires!<eos> Uh, Stephano has explained to me that he has a very strict fitness regimen, where he has to run up and down the stairs brandishing a knife at least three times a day.<eos> So, that makes perfect sense.<eos> I might join him on that exercise regimen.<eos> Very good, very good.<eos> So, now that that is cleared up, would you mind helping me bring things in from my truck?
Very good, very good.<eos> So, now that that is cleared up, would you mind helping me bring things in from my truck?<eos> I got all my shopping done and I even brought takeout for dinner.<eos> There should even be enough for Stephano.<eos> Now, we don't have much time before the movie, so help me take down this canoe.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I am so sorry, Baudelaires.<eos> I had no idea that our enemies would catch up to us so quickly.<eos> It's clear now that I can't turn my back for a second.<eos> - So you recognized him?
Keep an eye on him?<eos> For now, Baudelaires, we'll be watchful and wary, which is a word that around here means "very careful."<eos> - We know what wary means.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because... we can't afford to turn our backs, not even for a second.<eos> Besides...<eos> - Dr. Montgomery.<eos> - Monty!<eos> So sorry.<eos> I seem to have been very careless with the heavy glass reading lamp that was in my bedroom that fell out right when you were walking under it.
If anything happens to my sisters or me, you'll never get your hands on the Baudelaire fortune.<eos> If I wanted to harm you, orphan, your blood would be streaming out of this car like a waterfall.<eos> No, I am not going to harm a hair on any Baudelaire head.<eos> At least, not on purpose.<eos> But accidents happen all the time, don't they?<eos> And that is when I said to him,<eos> "The frog is the greatest reptile known to man."<eos> - Frogs are amphibians.<eos> - What?<eos> Stephano, where did you study herpetology?
- Hello, old chap!<eos> Two adults, three minors.<eos> I'm giving you the Verified Film Discount.<eos> Ah, lovely.<eos> I decided to treat myself to some popcorn because there is nothing exciting happening in my life at all.<eos> Hey... Some popcorn actually sound delicious.<eos> I get popcorn for me, for all of us.<eos> My treat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, you go.
My treat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, you go.<eos> Go take a seat.<eos> Come on, children.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Seventh row, right of center, that is the best place.<eos> That's what our mother always said.<eos> Who do you think taught it to me?
Go, go.<eos> Seventh row, right of center, that is the best place.<eos> That's what our mother always said.<eos> Who do you think taught it to me?<eos> You know, kids, I am so happy to be seeing a movie with you.<eos> Your parents would be so very proud.<eos> I know they would.<eos> For seeing a movie?<eos> There's more to a movie than just a movie.<eos> Just like a book can contain crucial secrets about the world of snakes, or it can be used to prop open a refrigerator door when you're airing it out.

Don't shed tears, sweet Gerta.<eos> I promise this isn't goodbye.<eos> No one's preparing to die, Rolf.<eos> Put on this warm scarf...<eos> Oh, I need to get more popcorn.<eos> And your poor mother's tutu.<eos> - Should I go this way?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Just go that way.<eos> - You're blocking the screen!
- Should I go this way?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Just go that way.<eos> - You're blocking the screen!<eos> - Is it better to go this way?<eos> - Sit down!<eos> - No.<eos> Go that way.<eos> - I can go this way.<eos> - You're blocking the screen!
- I can go this way.<eos> - You're blocking the screen!<eos> - I'm all right...<eos> - I'll go here.<eos> - Go that way.<eos> - That way?<eos> Aye, no.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I feel like your elbow tell me - and your hand, your finger... - That way.<eos> You're blocking the screen!
- I'll go here.<eos> - Go that way.<eos> - That way?<eos> Aye, no.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I feel like your elbow tell me - and your hand, your finger... - That way.<eos> You're blocking the screen!<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I can't see!<eos> I hope you didn't miss anything.
- I can't see!<eos> I hope you didn't miss anything.<eos> You'll always be in my heart... and in this snow bank.<eos> Per favore.<eos> - Butter?<eos> - Salt?<eos> I'd thank you... - for coming on such short notice, but I'm not in the habit of coddling my henchpeople.<eos> Due to one overprotective herpetologist's hysteria over the safety of his appalling collection of creatures, Operation Capture Monty has been relocated from Monty's home to this godforsaken nickelodeon.<eos> And just in time.<eos> I think you-know-who is trying to send a you-know-what.
And just in time.<eos> I think you-know-who is trying to send a you-know-what.<eos> Hello?<eos> Am I...<eos> A message.<eos> They're trying to send a...<eos> Oh, forget it.<eos> Operation Capture Monty is a go.<eos> Is there anything else I should know?<eos> You look handsome in that beard.
Operation Capture Monty is a go.<eos> Is there anything else I should know?<eos> You look handsome in that beard.<eos> Hmm. I already knew that.<eos> I am zombie.<eos> What did I miss?<eos> Oh, boy, they're still singing.<eos> I am going to need to excuse myself.<eos> - Shh. - Nature calls.<eos> Stephano, would you be so kind as to keep an eye on the children?
- Monty?<eos> What's this?<eos> Your guardian has disappeared?<eos> Dear me, dear me.<eos> Ah, this is just terrible.<eos> Three helpless children all alone in the world.<eos> Whatever shall we do next?<eos> Drive home, of course.<eos> - Monty!<eos> - You're here.
Wait in the car, Baudelaires.<eos> I have some unfinished business with Stephano.<eos> - Will you be okay?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I am your guardian.<eos> It is my job... and my delight, might I add, to keep you safe.<eos> Run along.<eos> Arrive... chechem.<eos> Do you think you can just waltz into my life, and the life of my children, and perpetuate this treachery?<eos> You're a wretched person and a bad actor, Stephano, or whatever your real name is.

You have.<eos> Now be gone.<eos> You and your... pale-face twins.<eos> I said be gone!<eos> Hang your head in shame, herpeta-loser.<eos> - He's tougher than he looks.<eos> - Even tougher than two old ladies.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, Baudelaires, that terrible man will never bother us again.<eos> - You mean... - That's right.
Well, it's none of our concern.<eos> We will be far, far away from here.<eos> Baudelaires, we are not going to spend the season in a research laboratory.<eos> We are off to Peru.<eos> - Peru?<eos> - It's a wonderful country, full of natural and slithering beauty.<eos> And what's more important, answers.<eos> You must have oodles of questions after that movie.<eos> If my parents hadn't taught me about this when I was your age, my head would be dizzy with confusion.<eos> Well, once we disembark in Chimbote, you will have all the answers you need.
Life is a conundrum of esoterica.<eos> Well said, Klaus Baudelaire.<eos> Well said.<eos> Then we travel inward to Ollantaytambo in search of some geckos who have an extra leg.<eos> First one to find one gets to name it.<eos> - Sounds wonderful.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> Listen, children.<eos> I know that the loss of your parents was a great tragedy.<eos> But you can still have the life they wanted for you.
We all know that our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will go to sleep, never to wake up.<eos> Monty...<eos> But that didn't change how the Baudelaires felt that morning in the room their uncle had filled so carefully with specimens, and in which he was now a sort of specimen himself.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> We know exactly how this happened.<eos> My, my, my, my, my.<eos> What a terrible accident.<eos> Whoever discovers this will be very upset.<eos> "For in that sleep of death what dreams may come."<eos> You murdered him.
I'll leave some breathing holes for her.<eos> - No!<eos> - Stop!<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> That's not the suitcase she's in.<eos> I don't think.<eos> Please don't hurt her.<eos> Then get in the car.<eos> Really, there's no one to blame but yourselves.<eos> If you hadn't stranded me at the movies, I wouldn't have had to kill Monty and we'd all be on our way to Peru, where I would have had to kill Monty.

There we go.<eos> You can't take us out of the country.<eos> Can he?<eos> And who's going to stop me?<eos> Look out!<eos> It's extremely rare for an accident to be a fortunate event.<eos> Luckily for the Baudelaires...<eos> Blasted furnaces of hell!<eos> ...this was one of those times.<eos> What were you thinking, careening down that driveway like a maniac?
It's extremely rare for an accident to be a fortunate event.<eos> Luckily for the Baudelaires...<eos> Blasted furnaces of hell!<eos> ...this was one of those times.<eos> What were you thinking, careening down that driveway like a maniac?<eos> Me?<eos> I was driving well below the speed limit.<eos> - Mr. Poe.<eos> - Violet Baudelaire?<eos> - I'm so grateful you ran into us.
I was driving well below the speed limit.<eos> - Mr. Poe.<eos> - Violet Baudelaire?<eos> - I'm so grateful you ran into us.<eos> - Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It was clearly the fault of the other driver.<eos> I never...<eos> I thought there were three of you.<eos> Ah, there's the baby.<eos> You're not Dr. Montgomery.

No, the children must be confused.<eos> Dr. Montgomery was taking them to Peru.<eos> Last night he called me to insist on me rearranging my morning itinerary to bring them these passports.<eos> He'd want me to have them.<eos> Can't you see, Mr. Poe?<eos> That's Count Olaf.<eos> He's in disguise and he's trying to take us away.<eos> Who am I?<eos> What am I doing?<eos> Don't you miss the vivid imagination of childhood?
- I never had one.<eos> - An imagination or a childhood?<eos> Children, you must be very distraught about losing your uncle.<eos> Count Olaf is a terrible man who tried to steal their fortune.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And do I look anything like this Count Olaf?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Count Olaf has one long eyebrow and he has a very short beard.<eos> You have a very long beard, and I hope you don't mind me saying so, no eyebrows at all.

It looks like an eye.<eos> I hate to trouble you, sir, but just to put the children's minds at ease, would you be so kind as to show us your ankle?
Could I get a cup of coffee?<eos> Don't you want to examine the body?<eos> Right, the body.<eos> Lead the way.<eos> It's right over here in the Reptile Room.<eos> Excuse me, but why are you wearing that mask over your face?<eos> I heard there were reptiles.<eos> They... they might be contagious.<eos> Reptiles aren't contagious.<eos> Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?
Excuse me, but why are you wearing that mask over your face?<eos> I heard there were reptiles.<eos> They... they might be contagious.<eos> Reptiles aren't contagious.<eos> Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?<eos> Maybe the children should wait outside.<eos> Being in a room with a dead body could be very traumatic.<eos> We've already been in a room with a dead body thanks to you.<eos> Oh, yes, thank you, Stephano, for that excellent point.<eos> I must say, you show genuine compassion for these children.

Please don't let him be our new guardian.<eos> Oh, don't be silly, children.<eos> It is quite shocking that Dr. Montgomery has died, but I'm not going to simply just hand you and your fortune over to his assistant.<eos> Not without some very thorough paperwork.<eos> What's happened?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nurse Lucafont was startled by a lizard.<eos> - It's a reptile room.<eos> - I didn't know that meant literally.<eos> Anyway, you've come just in time.
The incredibly deadly viper is one of the least dangerous and most friendly creatures in the entire animal kingdom.<eos> Come now, Violet.<eos> It's called the incredibly deadly viper.<eos> It's a misnomer.<eos> Uncle Monty named it that to scare his colleagues at the Herpetological Society.<eos> He sounds highly unstable.<eos> Not good guardian material.<eos> He was a wonderful, caring person.<eos> And the incredibly deadly viper wouldn't hurt anyone and we can prove it.<eos> How can you prove it when you don't even know where it is?
Highly suspicious.<eos> It's all falling into place.<eos> Dr. Montgomery must have forgotten to lock the cage properly, allowing the viper to slip out and kill him.<eos> I suppose we'll never know what Dr. Montgomery did to trigger the bloodlust in its reptile brain.<eos> I myself know nothing about snakes.<eos> I only got here just recently and scarcely have had time to learn.<eos> But I hear the slimy creatures can hold a grudge.<eos> That's the trouble with exotic pets.<eos> Maybe nature isn't meant to be tamed.<eos> What did you say your name was again?
It's struck again.<eos> It's the screeching iguana clock.<eos> It struck again.<eos> Oh, will you look at the time?<eos> Well, the SS Prospero departs at 5:00 p.m.<eos> You better go upstairs, children, and pack for your Peruvian adventure.<eos> Mr. Poe, we can't go with Stephano.<eos> We don't have the proper paperwork you mentioned.<eos> She's right.<eos> You do seem like a good person, but the childrens' adventures abroad will have to wait.

And why not?<eos> Because no one is leaving this house with a snake on the loose.<eos> Right, nurse?<eos> Yeah. Absolutely.<eos> - But that's absurd.<eos> - That's absurd?<eos> I'm already late for the bank and I'm up for a very important promotion.<eos> The bank will have to wait.<eos> When your back was turned just now, Nurse Lucafont informed me that this entire place is under lockdown.<eos> - You mean... - Yes!
- Or snake.<eos> - These are Count Olaf's accomplices.<eos> - And they're all wearing costumes.<eos> No, children, these are adults.<eos> Adults don't wear costumes unless it's for a charity ball, or they happen to be employed as actors.<eos> They are employed as actors.<eos> You two, create a perimeter.<eos> No one goes in or out of the house until the reptile is caught.<eos> You two, get that body in the van and back to the ME for some TLC before it's DOA.<eos> But you said no one could leave the house.
Don't you recognize him?<eos> That's the hook-handed man.<eos> And those two women were in Count Olaf's play.<eos> Oh, children, it's rude to question police authority.<eos> Besides, the women in that play had ghastly theatrical makeup on their faces, and this man is opening a can of peaches with hands, not hooks.<eos> That's Uncle Monty's food.<eos> Stop eating his food.<eos> I was only gonna have a few peaches.<eos> The children lost their uncle today.<eos> I'm sure you can understand.
It's medical slang.<eos> - That seems strange.<eos> - Oh, it's totally normal.<eos> We have lots of slang in the ol' med biz.<eos> That's slang for medical business.<eos> We call doctors "doc," and dead bodies "corpses."<eos> Ah, I suppose...<eos> Even though Uncle Monty's body had been removed, the Reptile Room was not as inviting to Klaus as it had been the day before.<eos> What happens in a certain place can stain your feelings for it, just as ink can stain a white sheet of paper.<eos> You can never forget what transpired in that place... just as words in ink can never be unwritten.
It's bitten her!<eos> It bited her!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Get moving!<eos> Call an ambulance!<eos> Call a scientist!<eos> Call my wife!<eos> This is ghastly!<eos> This is phantasmagorical!<eos> You are police officers!
This is ghastly!<eos> This is phantasmagorical!<eos> You are police officers!<eos> Do something!<eos> - It... it looks like the baby's playing. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> With the incredibly deadly viper?<eos> From the expedition journal of Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, April 24th.<eos> "The incredibly deadly viper wouldn't hurt a fly.<eos> I know this because I tried to feed it flies this morning.<eos> It is friendly and kind, playful and smart, and if you can get past your first impression, it can make a wonderful addition to the family."
I know this because I tried to feed it flies this morning.<eos> It is friendly and kind, playful and smart, and if you can get past your first impression, it can make a wonderful addition to the family."<eos> And therefore, it cannot have killed Uncle Monty.<eos> Well, I guess it does look rather harmless.<eos> That doesn't change anything.<eos> There are still plenty of deadly types of snakes in that room that could have done it.<eos> The mamba du mal bites as it strangles.<eos> The irascible python is homicidally grumpy.<eos> The Virginian wolfsnake can bludgeon you to death with a typewriter.<eos> How do you know?
How do you know?<eos> Because I read up on all types of snakes in the library section of the Reptile Room.<eos> - Psst, boss.<eos> - Don't interrupt me while I'm talking.<eos> If I may say so myself, I am quite the expert on the snakes.<eos> Aha!<eos> What does it say?<eos> She said, "Ah-ha!" because she's figured something out.<eos> I myself know nothing about snakes.<eos> You said you didn't know anything about snakes.
That is...<eos> That's right.<eos> Stephano, explain...<eos> - We need a plan.<eos> - Should we kill him?<eos> He is coughing a lot.<eos> Let's see if he dies of natural causes.<eos> Explain yourself.<eos> The reason that I said I did not know anything about the snakes, is because I was being modest.<eos> You weren't being modest.

That's why I decided to search Stephano's suitcase.<eos> I knew he wouldn't want to leave any evidence behind.<eos> And that's when I found these.<eos> But that's nothing.<eos> It's my random junk collection, which is private property, illegally obtained, and therefore not admissible in court.<eos> It does look like junk. But that's when I noticed this.<eos> Uncle Monty told us that he keeps venom samples in his cabinet from every venomous snake known to man.<eos> - And woman.<eos> - And woman.<eos> Mr. Poe, I believe if you open that cabinet right there, you'll find a sample is missing.
Stephano used this double-barrel syringe to inject the venom into Uncle Monty, to simulate the double puncture marks of a snake.<eos> Then he disassembled it to hide the evidence.<eos> But I loved Dr. Montgomery.<eos> What motive would I possibly have to murder him?<eos> He's after the Baudelaire fortune.<eos> How would Stephano even know about the Baudelaire fortune?<eos> I thought they were penniless orphans.<eos> They certainly dress like penniless orphans.<eos> That's because everything we owned burned up in a fire.<eos> But you already know about that... because you're not Stephano, you're Count Olaf.

Bravo, children.<eos> Yes, I admit it.<eos> I killed Monty.<eos> I also killed his assistant, Gustav.<eos> I drowned him in the reflecting pond.<eos> The question is... what are you going to do about it?<eos> I'm going to send you to jail for a very long time.<eos> Officers, arrest this man!<eos> No, office... Officers.<eos> Oh, you're all in on it, aren't you?

Oh, dear.<eos> If this were a piece of filmed entertainment for small children you would know what happens next.<eos> With the villain's identity and evil plan exposed, the police would arrive on the scene and place him in jail for the rest of his life.<eos> The plucky youngsters would go out for pizza.<eos> But I can tell you that's as likely as Dr. Montgomery returning to life.<eos> Still, while Dr. Montgomery may be dead...<eos> If you don't mind, I'll be taking the children with me.
That's just the screeching iguana clock.<eos> It's not the screeching iguana clock.<eos> It's the screeching iguana!<eos> Take the van. Make sure they follow you.<eos> - But where are you going, boss?<eos> - International waters.<eos> Count Olaf is driving away.<eos> No, he's not. He's heading into the labyrinth.<eos> I suppose there wasn't room in the van.<eos> What are you waiting for?
We were right next to him.<eos> If he got a message, we would've seen it.<eos> Not if he had some secret way to receive it.<eos> Do you remember that strange object I found in the fire?<eos> I think it's...<eos> It's gone.<eos> I'll be taking the children with me.<eos> Count Olaf.<eos> A good labyrinth is full of secrets.<eos> - Who are you?

I know you children have a great many questions, and I promise there are a great many answers.<eos> Find your Aunt Josephine.<eos> She's a fierce and formidable woman.<eos> She can keep you safe and tell you everything you need to know.<eos> Let me handle Count Olaf.<eos> Count Olaf stole something from me.<eos> I think it's part of a spyglass.<eos> It certainly is.<eos> I will get it back to you, Klaus Baudelaire. I promise.<eos> Who are you?
There are times when the entire world seems wrong.<eos> The way a reptile room without any reptiles... seems wrong.<eos> The way a bookshelf without any books seems wrong.<eos> Or a loved one's house... without the loved one.<eos> The Baudelaires weren't given much time with their Uncle Monty, which seemed wrong.<eos> Still, for the first time in a long time, they'd found a place where the world seemed right, if only for a short time.<eos> If they'd found that once, who's to say they couldn't find it again?<eos> - He's not answering.<eos> - Sure you've got the right number?<eos> Operator, can you check that number again, please?
No offense to either of you.<eos> It's understandable.<eos> Mellie, you need to make the right call here.<eos> No children on the dais.<eos> An extra security detail on my kids and Luna's.<eos> However many snipers you have now?<eos> Double that.<eos> And, Jake, you're running the operation personally.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> It's a quick draft, but it accomplishes what you requested.
Was your mama there to kill me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But what I do know is that I have a valet and a dresser waiting for me to finalize my outfit for the ball.<eos> For the other 44 presidents, that took all of 10 minutes.<eos> But for the lady president, that means choosing a dress that will impress the New York fashion blogs without insulting the Washington conservatives.<eos> So, rather than sit here and discuss all the ways I might die today,<eos> I'm gonna go pick an outfit now so that I can be done with that nonsense and focus on what's really important...<eos> Running the damn country.<eos> I've got David Rosen on the phone for you.<eos> He said you'd know what it was about.
- With me.<eos> - Well, guess what.<eos> Now I am.<eos> Yes. You are.<eos> Now you are going to run the organization that ruined my father's life.<eos> And mine.<eos> I wanted you to stay.<eos> But not like this.<eos> I can't watch...<eos> If you're just joining us, we're looking at a live shot of what is now formerly Marine One, awaiting President Grant, who will make his proper farewell to the nation
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> We stay and we fucking fight.<eos> For a career bureaucrat, you have a David Blaine-like flair for the dramatic.<eos> Because I chose a locale where we were unlikely to be seen?<eos> That's not showmanship. It's tradecraft.<eos> Sure.<eos> Are we gonna have to go through the whole blind-drop routine every time we meet?<eos> We would, if we were to continue meeting.<eos> Oh, this isn't just a grand entrance into the job. You're doing a whole thing.<eos> I know the kind of person you are, Rhoades.

But I cannot have you involved.
All right.<eos> Listen, until I reach them...<eos> I'll stay underground and keep moving.<eos> Can I get you a...<eos> You can't go to bed with Jenna Jameson and expect to wake up with Snow White.<eos> Which means?<eos> Know who you're fucking.<eos> I feel caught a bit off guard.<eos> That's how I feel. So you can't feel that way.<eos> I just heard that you're behind a move against Axelrod, that it's another office prosecuting, but your DNA's all over it.
That's how I feel. So you can't feel that way.<eos> I just heard that you're behind a move against Axelrod, that it's another office prosecuting, but your DNA's all over it.<eos> Axelrod is about to be arrested.<eos> I did put it in motion, but it can't track back to me.<eos> Then why am I hearing what I'm hearing? How are you hearing what you're hearing?<eos> I used to peg Freddy Reyes in the AG's office.<eos> Well, only once in the office.<eos> Point is, the word's leaking out of D.C.<eos> That doesn't work for me.<eos> My reputation's all tied up with yours right now and you jackpotted me.

There's that Princeton test-taking.<eos> Did he off himself?<eos> That is dark.<eos> Uh, no. I just heard from a contact at the Bureau of Prisons. He's been released.<eos> What the fuck is that about?<eos> I thought I made it pretty clear I never wanted to talk to you again.<eos> This isn't a social call.<eos> I'm reaching out as counsel for Robert Axelrod.<eos> That shouldn't feel good in your mouth.<eos> Bryan, how fast are you moving on the arrest? Do you have a warrant?

The job I've been offered will allow me to handle big criminal defense cases, as I see fit.<eos> The best moves I've made in my life have required the most discipline, patience, and trust, so I ask you, hold for a day.<eos> See how some things shake out around here. Perhaps I can make you an even more compelling offer.<eos> Wait.<eos> And then, if you still decide to go, well, it'll be with my blessing.<eos> I expected to sit down with you, but I figured it would be after we arrested your client.<eos> Or at least after I announced my intention to.<eos> Then. Now. We're here.<eos> And my client is interested in reviving the immunity deal that we discussed a while back.<eos> The same deal you passed on?
The same deal you passed on?<eos> That's the one.<eos> That deal is no longer alive.<eos> It's a corpse in a pine box covered with dirt.<eos> And, as you somehow know, I will be arresting and charging your client today.<eos> Then, let me organize his surrender.<eos> Let's keep it civil.<eos> No press. Bail pre-arranged. He gets to say goodbye to the wife, then we come in.<eos> No perp walk.<eos> You're in a U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Bach, not some souk buying a rug.
I know how to do what he wants.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Break it down for me.<eos> I'd rather walk him through it in person.<eos> That way, it won't be diluted or misstated in any way.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> Fine.<eos> Axe will reach out to meet with you if and when he's ready.<eos> Do you have a way to reach him?
One more thing.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Open it here.<eos> I want to watch you do it.<eos> I had my man follow them to a hotel.<eos> Look at them. With that morning-after glow.<eos> This is what your wife is out doing while you're working on the marriage.<eos> Now you got what you really want.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Look, guys, you probably have some questions about why I'm here.
Look, that's not true.<eos> Sometimes they lie.<eos> Sometimes they tell the truth, just like everyone... like me.<eos> Most folks, they find this out about their dad much later, but everyone finds it out.<eos> I'm a flawed man.<eos> And I'm not perfect. I'm not always right.<eos> I don't always win.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I did do something wrong.<eos> If that makes me a bad person, well, you'll have to decide that for yourselves, not just once, but many times more as you grow older and you learn more.
I did do something wrong.<eos> If that makes me a bad person, well, you'll have to decide that for yourselves, not just once, but many times more as you grow older and you learn more.<eos> But know this.<eos> I'm still your dad.<eos> And I am gonna fight.<eos> I'm gonna try really hard to win this, but I might not.<eos> But we don't give up.<eos> We won't give up either, Dad.<eos> Come here.<eos> Be good boys like I know you can be.
At this point, I do.<eos> It's really happening.<eos> It appears to be.<eos> There were times I... I never thought I'd see this moment.<eos> And this is as much as you should probably see.<eos> You should leave so you can't be called as a witness, because I've arranged that you'll lead the prosecution at Eastern.<eos> That was the workaround? Are you fucking serious?<eos> I am.<eos> And Dake agreed?<eos> More submitted than agreed. But I actually think you'll work well together.
What if I said I was sorry for what I did to make you leave, for how I got you to come back, for how I treated you when Lara was gone?<eos> Are you saying you're sorry for all those things?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then I forgive you.<eos> What if I told you... that pretty much every decision I've made since we've worked down here together has been the wrong one?<eos> Would you help me find my way back?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd like that very much.<eos> That is exactly what we'll do together.<eos> Robert Axelrod. You're under arrest.
We could move.<eos> You'd do that for me?<eos> I'd do anything for you.<eos> You love it here.<eos> It is pretty.<eos> Not if you look closely.<eos> You coming?<eos> Hey, Nathalie.<eos> Mind giving our garden the same treatment while we're away?<eos> If you take your bikes instead of the car.
Let him go.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> We were just having fun.<eos> Doesn't look like he's having fun.<eos> I'm sorry for my friends.<eos> Apparently they forgot what century we live in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm glad you came.
Listen, you can't go around spreading fear like that.<eos> It disrupts the public order, okay?<eos> Maybe you might want to stay around here until you sober up again.<eos> We gotta get guns.<eos> - Get the door! - Get off!<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Stay down!<eos> - No.<eos> I'm telling you... It's coming!<eos> You don't understand.
- Get the door! - Get off!<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Stay down!<eos> - No.<eos> I'm telling you... It's coming!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Iit's coming.<eos> It's coming!<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?
Get off me.<eos> - Stay down!<eos> - No.<eos> I'm telling you... It's coming!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Iit's coming.<eos> It's coming!<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Who are you?
We are.<eos> We are.<eos> We are real.<eos> But it's all real.<eos> Put down the gun.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't know.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Mrs. raven?<eos> Are you okay?
Detective Bosch.<eos> Hollywood Division.<eos> - Tommy okay?<eos> - He's fine.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Suit.<eos> Must be serious.<eos> He's not in any kind of trouble at all, I just need to ask him a few questions.<eos> I've gotta get ready for work.<eos> You mind?
May I come in?<eos> Suit.<eos> Must be serious.<eos> He's not in any kind of trouble at all, I just need to ask him a few questions.<eos> I've gotta get ready for work.<eos> You mind?<eos> Do what you need to do.<eos> I'm not gonna be much help, anyway.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> When's the last time you saw him?
Stayed the night.<eos> Gone in the morning before I got up.<eos> Raided my purse, as usual.<eos> Any idea who he hangs with?<eos> - Friends?<eos> - I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> First time he ran off, he was 12.<eos> His life has been a mystery to me ever since.<eos> On the streets, living in...<eos> What do you call them?

Pain in my fuckin' ass.<eos> Judges me for how I make a living.<eos> But you'd take him back in a minute, wouldn't you?
I got nothin' from his mom.<eos> Put the word out to grab him up for a little chat.<eos> I'm on my way back from Northridge now.<eos> I'll organize a search party.<eos> Billets.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Scott Anderson, Times.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Anderson?<eos> I'm writing a piece on the Edward Gunn case.<eos> Well, you know I can't comment on an ongoing investigation.

I just need confirmation on a tip I received.<eos> What's the tip?<eos> That you're investigating one of your own people for the murder.<eos> And who would that be?<eos> No name given.<eos> A veteran officer.<eos> Mr. Anderson, do you chase down every crackpot tip that you get?<eos> Lieutenant, this came from someone in your department.<eos> Who?<eos> You know I can't give you my source.
You know I can't give you my source.<eos> So confirm or deny?<eos> The tip is bogus.<eos> Have a blessed day.<eos> You're the man.<eos> Sweet!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Off the bike.<eos> Come on.<eos> You two stay there.
Not yet.<eos> Jerry, you've gotta talk to him.<eos> You've got to tell him what's going on.<eos> I know.<eos> You have five messages.<eos> Detective Bosch, this is Sergeant Amy Snyder, IA.<eos> - Please call me b...<eos> - Message deleted.<eos> Hello, Mr. Bosch, this is Rich Isbin.<eos> - You might remember me from...
- I never thought you...<eos> - No, you know what?<eos> We still gotta work the Meadows case together.<eos> After that, maybe it's time for a change.<eos> Tomorrow morning, call Scott Anderson.<eos> Get to the bottom of this bullshit.<eos> Morning, gentlemen.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> Before we start, I need to know where the tip came from.<eos> You know I can't do that.
Tomorrow morning, call Scott Anderson.<eos> Get to the bottom of this bullshit.<eos> Morning, gentlemen.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> Before we start, I need to know where the tip came from.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> Look, I just need confirmation.<eos> You guys investigating somebody within LAPD for Gunn's murder?<eos> I just need to know your source. Not gonna happen.<eos> Look, I'm trying to spare you some grief here, because if you run this story without confirmation, you'll regret it.

They just wave it on through.<eos> All you need is one guy on that end to put it on the boat, and one guy on this end to take it off.<eos> Those guys come cheap.<eos> How about her?<eos> She was on the base.<eos> Didn't know her.<eos> Couldn't tell you her name.<eos> Was she tight with Meadows?<eos> If they were, they kept it a secret.<eos> You gonna make one of these for Meadows?
Zoom, zoom.<eos> So, add water.<eos> Zoom, zoom.<eos> - Just water.<eos> - And the flashing lights?<eos> Gotta look cool.<eos> Very cool, kid.<eos> Very cool.<eos> Annabelle.<eos> You forgot our appointment.

I can't today.<eos> I have a date.<eos> Name a time.<eos> I'll pick you up any day this week.<eos> Do we have to?<eos> I already told you everything.<eos> - I swear, there's...<eos> - Not everything.<eos> And yes, we have to.<eos> Make sure you're ready for trial.
And yes, we have to.<eos> Make sure you're ready for trial.<eos> Listen, I've changed my mind.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> - Annabelle.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I've decided not to testify.<eos> They found out, didn't they?<eos> - What?<eos> - What you do.
Listen, I've changed my mind.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> - Annabelle.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I've decided not to testify.<eos> They found out, didn't they?<eos> - What?<eos> - What you do.<eos> In your other life.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
- What you do.<eos> In your other life.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Leah Camille.<eos> They'll crucify me in court.<eos> Not if we bring it up first.<eos> Get it out of the way.<eos> Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.

And what did I tell you?
But, um... the silver was my grandma's.<eos> Were they painkillers?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Uh, the medications.<eos> Uh, no, it was, um... clonazepam and, um, Lexapro.<eos> Uh, you try one of those, um... location apps?<eos> Yeah, I tried that, but the laptop's turned off.<eos> Oh, well, they'll probably wipe it anyway, unless they're morons.<eos> - Huh. - You have a hide-a-key?

- I think I locked it.<eos> Wasn't a forced entry though.<eos> So...<eos> So, uh... what should I do now?<eos> Uh, about what?<eos> I mean... do you call me or...?<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> If anything is recovered, someone will be in contact.<eos> Your case number's on that form, if you have renter's insurance.<eos> But... you're gonna look, right?
That's terrible.<eos> - Do you mind if I sleep here?<eos> - Oh, my God, of course.<eos> Dan will make up the couch.<eos> Right, honey?<eos> Aw. Is this me?<eos> Is it a dragon?<eos> Stegosaurus.<eos> I fuckin' love it.<eos> You've been shitting in my yard.
Bye, Kevin. Bye.<eos> Um, is there anything I can do?<eos> Oh, I think I'm good.<eos> I think I-I...<eos> I got it.<eos> Um... thank you for everything.<eos> ♪ Bring out the Bible ♪<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Fuck. Um...<eos> You've reached Detective Bendix with, uh, Robbery...
There's no questions...<eos> So, can you get it?<eos> I can get deez nuts.<eos> You can get these nuts?<eos> All right, tough guy.<eos> - You had your chance. - Oh.<eos> Geez.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, fuck. Oh!<eos> Are you okay?
Geez.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, fuck. Oh!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm really...<eos> Dude, what'd you do to Keith?<eos> Dude!<eos> The fuck you doing?<eos> Dude, stop!<eos> Both you motherfuckers better drag your... Violence is not power!
Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, don't lose it in Las Vegas.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, lady, that...<eos> Wait, that...<eos> Come on back here!<eos> Hey, come back here!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, lady!<eos> You didn't pay for that!
That was a glitch.<eos> That needed a reboot anyway.<eos> I... didn't really see anything.<eos> Open sesame.<eos> Oh. Uh, need a credit card.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Christian Rumack.<eos> Well... that is... That's something.<eos> That's something. What do you, uh...<eos> Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke?
Christian Rumack.<eos> Well... that is... That's something.<eos> That's something. What do you, uh...<eos> Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke?<eos> Uh... Well, I'm a nursing assistant.<eos> Now, suppose I came down to where you do that...<eos> Your hospital...<eos> It's a post-op facility.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, suppose I came down there and I said, "You know, maybe not that medication, Ruth, maybe this one instead, don't ya think?"

- And...<eos> - His footprint.<eos> And that his foot, according to this, is made out of scrambled eggs.<eos> No. Uh, no, sir.<eos> That is not...<eos> Okay.<eos> So...<eos> I... I located my computer...<eos> Right.<eos> I-I understand the chain of events as you tell them.
Did it not occur to you that approaching a criminal suspect without official capacity is a good way to get your wig knocked off?<eos> Let me see your hand.<eos> - Can I see it?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to your finger?<eos> Ruth, look at me.<eos> - Were you engaged in a confrontation?
What happened to your finger?<eos> Ruth, look at me.<eos> - Were you engaged in a confrontation?<eos> - No, it was an accident.<eos> Have you been able to replace your medications?<eos> - I see.<eos> I see. - I'll take that as a no.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, why...?<eos> Why do you not want to help me?
Why do you not want to help me?<eos> - Help you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> Why...?<eos> - Isn't it your job?<eos> - My job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am doing my job.<eos> You're asking me about my job right now.
- Yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> Why...?<eos> - Isn't it your job?<eos> - My job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am doing my job.<eos> You're asking me about my job right now.<eos> - Yeah, I'm coming in here...<eos> - You come into my workplace...
- Isn't it your job?<eos> - My job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am doing my job.<eos> You're asking me about my job right now.<eos> - Yeah, I'm coming in here...<eos> - You come into my workplace...<eos> - I have things to help you...<eos> - and you ask me about my job.<eos> You think just because you left your door wide open for some punk to stroll right in, that the universe now somehow revolves around you?
I'm, uh...<eos> I'm being divorced.<eos> First time I said it out loud.<eos> Sir, I'm very...<eos> Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.<eos> Move it. Move the hand.<eos> Go home, Ruth.<eos> This is the guy.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> And if you engage in vigilante action or mess around with this again,
It's actually pretty good.<eos> I need to speak with Christian Rumack.<eos> Is he here?<eos> Well, he is still out with his friends.<eos> I expect him back God knows when.<eos> Talk about what?<eos> Choices he made.<eos> Well, I ought to make sandwiches then because that could take all day.<eos> Like sandwiches?<eos> You hungry?
- What's he do? - Mmm.<eos> Lawyer, you know.<eos> Is he, uh...<eos> Is he in his van now?<eos> Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> That's Chris Junior you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, Christian got him that van for his 16th if he got all B's.<eos> He flunked, but he got to keep it anyway.<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> Do you know where your son is now?
Ooh, whoa. Stepson.<eos> I have no idea where he is.<eos> He got into drugs.<eos> He was in jail a little bit for that.<eos> And then he started hanging around with all the people he met in there.<eos> Bunch of creeps.<eos> His father recently cut him off.<eos> Canceled his ATM cards, everything. You know, TMI...<eos> Chrissy always made me kinda nervous... even before all that.<eos> Did you ever see The Omen?
Walden Pond room, clear!<eos> Well, I guess I will just get some soda for the rug.<eos> We're all clear.<eos> Come home to this shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who...?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I invoke the Fifth Amendment.<eos> My name is Ruth...<eos> And why are you here?
- Who are you?<eos> - I invoke the Fifth Amendment.<eos> My name is Ruth...<eos> And why are you here?<eos> Your son broke into my house and stole my stuff.<eos> Knock it off!<eos> Well, what...<eos> What does that have to do with me?<eos> I thought he lived here.<eos> So you impersonate cops, why?
What do you want?<eos> For people to not be assholes.<eos> Well, you know, it's probably gonna stain.<eos> - Are you gonna shoot us?<eos> - Don't be so goddamned dramatic.<eos> Then we'll leave.<eos> Thanks for the cappuccino.<eos> The foam was amazing.<eos> You are very welcome.<eos> You can tell yourself you've done something here, if that'll help.
I just...<eos> It's not gonna...<eos> I think I should just stay here.<eos> I'm gonna be so quiet.<eos> I promise you, okay?<eos> No, this is what's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna carry this gun, you're gonna get them to open the door. When they come to the door, point the gun at 'em so they don't do anything.<eos> I am not gonna be good at that.<eos> We get what we need, and we get out, and that's it.<eos> How do I know that you're not gonna...?
Stop! - Sit the fuck down.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Oh, my...<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> - This is unbelievable.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> He's sleeping one off.<eos> Call him.<eos> You know, if you're here for what you think you're here for, your timing stinks.
Get in the fireplace.<eos> What...?<eos> What did he tell you?<eos> That I keep cash around here, huh?<eos> I haven't seen him in months.<eos> You amateurs, it's not even here anymore.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Get in the fireplace.<eos> Chrissy told us about the iron in there, so don't even try that shit.<eos> You got it all mapped out.
Bullshit.<eos> Get in the fireplace.<eos> Chrissy told us about the iron in there, so don't even try that shit.<eos> You got it all mapped out.<eos> 4-3-2-1.<eos> - I'm a hostage.<eos> - Stop talking.<eos> They kidnapped me.<eos> They did this.<eos> You saw the gun was empty. You saw.
- Come on.<eos> Tony, we can't stop.<eos> Oh, you motherfuckers!<eos> Tony, come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Tony.<eos> - I'm gonna get you!<eos> Okay, we have to get up.<eos> Where are you?
Carly has something to ask you.<eos> I... I'm working on a surprise.<eos> - Yeah. - Uh...<eos> I, uh... I was just gonna ask if, um... you could buy me some beer for a party.<eos> I'm joking.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Yeah, we need hard liquor.<eos> No.<eos> Hey.<eos> You lookin' for Marius?
Look, why don't you get the fuck out of here.<eos> - I'll see you later, Pete.<eos> - Get the fuck out of here.<eos> - Good guy!<eos> - You shoulda picked a better photo.<eos> You can see your lazy eye.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Don't you remember him?<eos> That's Shawn.<eos> He's the kid that you and Taylor made cry.
All right, hurry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Hurry.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Who's your second?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your partner.<eos> I don't know what you're...
- I'll be right back.<eos> - Hurry.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Who's your second?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your partner.<eos> I don't know what you're...<eos> Come on, you're running a fiddle con with the watch.<eos> I'm just wondering who got to spook Ben, say it's worth 50 grand?<eos> I don't know what you're sayin', I don't...

Well, I knew Sam would... wouldn't run, but Bixby would.<eos> But you knew how to lift the watch?<eos> I saw it on You Tube.<eos> So you don't know any cons?<eos> - What?<eos> - Con artists.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> I just was wondering if it had something to do with why you haven't seen your mother in three years.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I thought maybe you would have been in touch with her.

I wish.<eos> After you and your mom left, Lila and Maggie wrote letters back and forth for a couple of months, and then your grandmother did, uh... well, you know what she did, and that was the end of the letters.
Otto teach him how to lift my watch?<eos> Sometimes somebody knows they're being followed, they hop into a building so they can skip out back, leaving the one who's tailing them out front. With their thumb up their ass.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Closing.<eos> Just had a quick question.<eos> Did a woman come in here today before lunch with a shopping bag?<eos> Closing.<eos> Out.<eos> - What if I was a customer?<eos> - Are you?

- What if I was a customer?<eos> - Are you?<eos> No, you are man with question.<eos> Hey, let me ask you something.<eos> How much would you give me for this?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oyster.<eos> It's worth 27.<eos> I could give you 20 if it wasn't piece of shit fake.<eos> - You're kidding.
I could give you 20 if it wasn't piece of shit fake.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's me making jokes.<eos> Yeah, that's a fake?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 40 years I look at Rolex on wrist of middle age man caught fucking waitress, getting divorced, needs money to hide from wife.<eos> I know this shit backwards.<eos> Damnit.<eos> - How much you pay?
Are you sure?<eos> 40 years I look at Rolex on wrist of middle age man caught fucking waitress, getting divorced, needs money to hide from wife.<eos> I know this shit backwards.<eos> Damnit.<eos> - How much you pay?<eos> - Well, I didn't.<eos> I made a deal, but I thought I was getting the better end of the deal.<eos> - Heh. - Heh.<eos> When you think you're the one playing, but you're actually the one being played.<eos> How can you tell it's fake?
She said she took something and-and put it in a shopping bag, went off and pawned it.<eos> Pawned what?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> From one minute, it's silverware, the next minute it... it's jewelry.<eos> I don't... her mind, she... she goes in and out.<eos> As far as I know, it's bullshit, but, you know, I gotta check.<eos> No nurse today.<eos> Today, regular customers.<eos> Well, there it is, she lost her marbles then.<eos> That's not what you think.
Well, there it is, she lost her marbles then.<eos> That's not what you think.<eos> You like big dicks.<eos> So what?<eos> I don't like big dicks.<eos> I don't like big dicks, that a sculpture of the ancient Egyptian god Minh.<eos> - That's what I traded for the watch.<eos> - That's what I traded for the watch.<eos> Yeah, made in Chong King three weeks ago.<eos> So you both get shit.
Maybe.<eos> Kinda.<eos> Well, waffles à la Maggie aren't really optional.<eos> Ta-da!<eos> Mmm, just like my mom used to make, or like I used to make for myself because she was still asleep.<eos> Somebody has to help you shake that negative birthday attitude, Reid.<eos> It's supposed to be a celebration.<eos> Hmm. Historically, hasn't been the best day for me.<eos> And now with Luke, birthdays are for him.<eos> I remember you and Charlie always having these crazy fancy birthday plans.
Sometimes a homeowner brings me in to assess a situation.<eos> A situation?<eos> What's that, like, slamming doors and floating entities over your bed?<eos> Usually, it's noisy pipes, overactive imaginations, mental illness.<eos> Yeah, I thought I saw a ghost once in a BB.<eos> I screamed like hell.<eos> Turned out the owner was a peeping Tom.<eos> Cross and type him.<eos> We're gonna need a lot of blood on standby.<eos> So, tell me, Garth, did you see the ghost?
Yeah, I thought I saw a ghost once in a BB.<eos> I screamed like hell.<eos> Turned out the owner was a peeping Tom.<eos> Cross and type him.<eos> We're gonna need a lot of blood on standby.<eos> So, tell me, Garth, did you see the ghost?<eos> Take it from an expert.<eos> There's no such thing as ghosts.<eos> How's the pain, Garth?<eos> My back hurts more than the... this, which I really, really want you to take out
I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> - Is it an emergency?<eos> - Like, now. Like, right now.<eos> Yeah, good idea.<eos> Go with her.<eos> Maybe get a, uh, stool culture while you're in there.<eos> No time like the present.<eos> My dad's been here for 34 minutes.<eos> He's in agony.<eos> But I see you had time to get a coffee, so I guess that's nice for you.
I was setting up for her birthday party.<eos> Chest pains bowled me over.<eos> It's never been so bad.<eos> He's been working too hard, and he won't let me help enough at home.<eos> Pain's been pretty steady, so I've been leaning on medication, putting off the doctor.<eos> It's my own damn fault.<eos> I have your C.T. angio of your chest you got when you arrived.<eos> You have a pulmonary infarction caused by the compromised blood flow from your sickle cell.<eos> That's not good.<eos> I'm gonna move you to the ICU for some tests, and we'll see how you respond to the antibiotics.
I really think you should get it checked out, Roland.<eos> Like, immediately.<eos> Really?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm getting paged.<eos> Um, good luck with the app.<eos> I-I really hope you're around to see it launched.<eos> Leo, Anna, we've got your test results.<eos> 10 years in the E.R., I've never seen anything quite like you two.<eos> You're like a tropical infection ice cream shop, and all the flavors are bad.
- Yeah.<eos> Right. - Anna, please.<eos> God, please, not now.<eos> Get them prepped.<eos> So, Dr. Williams, they're gonna need fluids, blood cultures, antibiotics, malaria smears, liver function tests.<eos> Oh, and best for last... larvae extraction.<eos> So have fun.<eos> He's not getting better.<eos> I know.<eos> So, Dion, the infected tissue in your lung isn't responding to the antibiotics, which means I'm gonna have to drain the abscess, and we'll likely remove the necrotic section, which, as you know, is not ideal.
Okay, will you stay with Aisha, please?<eos> I'll come and find you as soon as the surgery's over.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> You okay, Charlie?<eos> Yep. So long as he's still not paralyzed.<eos> Dr. Sekara, how's he doing?<eos> Uh, all's well in the neuromonitor.<eos> - Dr. Sharpe?<eos> - B.P.'s steady so far.<eos> I don't know how you two are so calm.
So, what kind of relief work was it?<eos> The kind that completely backfires.<eos> I called it Operation Save the People because we wanted to go there and, uh... s-save people.<eos> My brother watched a documentary about Malawi one night after a party, a party where he found out that all our friends were calling us "trustafarians" behind our backs.<eos> Useless trust-fund hippies.<eos> Next morning, he wakes me up and guilts me into getting onto a plane to Malawi.<eos> So, not a lot of time to prepare.<eos> No malaria prophylaxis, no water purifier, no maps?<eos> Before we knew it, we were in the middle of nowhere digging a well.<eos> Did you know that wells have to go, like, really deep, and you can't just dig them on the side of the road?
- I'm gonna throw up again.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Okay. Dr. Williams, can...<eos> - Yep?<eos> - You good?<eos> Nope.<eos> Great.<eos> - Oh, hey, um...<eos> - Hey. Surprise party for Alex tonight.<eos> Can you and Dawn come?
Pericostal sutures, please.<eos> Okay, time to extract your larva.<eos> Awesome.<eos> He's not feeling any better?<eos> Mnh-mnh.<eos> Mad as I am at him for getting me into this, he was right.<eos> We needed to do something with our lives.<eos> It's just it probably would have been a really good idea to have a plan.<eos> I have to ask...<eos> When you got there and you realized you were in over your heads, why didn't you just turn around and come home?
Mnh-mnh.<eos> Mad as I am at him for getting me into this, he was right.<eos> We needed to do something with our lives.<eos> It's just it probably would have been a really good idea to have a plan.<eos> I have to ask...<eos> When you got there and you realized you were in over your heads, why didn't you just turn around and come home?<eos> We were too ashamed to fail.<eos> E-Especially when people started laughing at us, like, when we tried to build a school out of... out of mud blocks...<eos> We built one wall, and then... and then it just fell down.<eos> Hey, are... are you okay, Dr. Williams?
This could be my only real chance to get through to him.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Aisha?<eos> How is he?<eos> Well, we were able to take care of his lung infection, but there were complications during surgery, so his condition is still very serious.<eos> People are coming to my party.<eos> He's got to be there or it won't happen.<eos> Aisha, your father is fighting for his life.<eos> There is no way, even in a best-case scenario, that he's going home today.<eos> You don't know anything!
I need to rethink my career choices.<eos> Well, just because some ghosts are real doesn't mean that all ghosts are real.<eos> Miles is real.<eos> Yeah, Miles is real.<eos> But he doesn't mean you any harm.<eos> I killed him...<eos> the best friend I ever had, the friend who saved my life.<eos> Miles needs to move on, but he can't.<eos> Maybe it's your turn to help him.<eos> I'll talk to him like you say.
See the abnormalities?<eos> I needed to check with Dr. Hamza to confirm.<eos> Leo, you have neurocysticercosis.<eos> A parasitic worm has found its way into your brain.<eos> It's relatively safe while it's still alive, but if it dies, it can be quite serious, so we do need to move quickly.<eos> It's likely you had it before you went to Malawi.<eos> Um, improperly handled pork is usually the culprit.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> The dumplings from Galen's cottage... the ones that made everyone sick.<eos> You're telling me that I have a worm living in my brain?
Oh, come on. Let me help you.<eos> Dion?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm still here, which sounds more like good news than it feels.<eos> Well, you suffered a cardiac event during surgery, so recovery's gonna be tough.<eos> You're gonna have to make a change.<eos> You're gonna have to slow down.<eos> Easy to say when you're not the single parent of a 9-year-old perpetual motion machine.<eos> True, but...<eos> I know that you're gonna want to watch her grow up, to celebrate all the great things she's gonna do and cheer her up the first time her heart's broken.
Oh, hey.<eos> Everybody's having a great time.<eos> Why do you look so down?<eos> You saw her face when she walked in.<eos> This was a terrible mistake.<eos> Your friend hated her birthday.<eos> You tried to turn that around for her.<eos> You can't fault your intentions, even if, you know, you misjudged a little.<eos> You think?<eos> You two will be laughing about this tomorrow.
It's my word against his!<eos> Jimmy, there's a tape.<eos> Ernie told me.<eos> For this, you destroyed our family? !<eos> Jimmy!<eos> That's enough!<eos> You were a witness to what happened here?<eos> I was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> May I assume that you are armed?
You care to elaborate?<eos> It's not in my interest for Hector Salamanca to die... at this time.<eos> Who is he to you?<eos> An associate of an associate.<eos> How very specific.<eos> Who is he to you?<eos> We had a disagreement.<eos> He threatened my family.<eos> I'm not gonna let that go.<eos> But you had let it go.

Then our business here is finished.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's it.<eos> No more tracker, no more of your minions following me?<eos> Just like that?<eos> Just like that.<eos> Of course... I trust that you are done with Hector Salamanca?<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Ehrmantraut.<eos> Wait.<eos> You want his trucks hit because you want to disrupt his supply line.

Well, you had quite the day yesterday.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. McGill, you've been accused of fourth degree felony breaking and entering, which carries a maximum sentence of 18 months and a $5,000 fine.<eos> We've also got petty misdemeanor assault.<eos> Maximum six months' jail time and a $500 fine.<eos> Plus, criminal damage to property, also misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of six months and a $500 fine.<eos> Victim is...<eos> Your brother Charles?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I assume you're prepared to enter a plea at this time.

The court accepts and enters the defendant's plea of not guilty.<eos> Now, Mr. McGill, have you secured counsel?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, Your Honor, Kim Wexler.<eos> I'll be representing Mr. McGill in this matter.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Let's enter Ms. Wexler as the attorney of record.<eos> Your Honor, if I may, um, I'll be representing myself.<eos> I strongly advise against that, Mr. McGill.<eos> You know what they say about a man who represents himself.

Your Honor, may I have a moment to speak with my client?<eos> Sounds like he's not your client.<eos> Mr. McGill, would you like to take a moment to discuss this with your... potential counsel?<eos> No, Your Honor.<eos> I'm all set.<eos> - I'm gonna represent myself.<eos> - Your Honor...<eos> Not your client, Ms. Wexler.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm moving on.<eos> You two can work this out on your own time.
- Your Honor...<eos> Not your client, Ms. Wexler.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm moving on.<eos> You two can work this out on your own time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was gonna call you, but then I thought I'd tell you in person.<eos> Mr. McGill.<eos> So, on to the issue of bond.<eos> You have no priors and no outstanding warrants.<eos> And where are you currently practicing law?
I'm sorry.<eos> I was gonna call you, but then I thought I'd tell you in person.<eos> Mr. McGill.<eos> So, on to the issue of bond.<eos> You have no priors and no outstanding warrants.<eos> And where are you currently practicing law?<eos> I haven't seen you in my court in a while.<eos> Elder law.<eos> What a noble pursuit.<eos> One I hope you get back to very soon.
Meet me at the front door.<eos> Uh, they said to put my things in the mailbox.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Anything with a battery.<eos> Did your brother ever have a key to the house?<eos> Before the recent trouble, he did.<eos> He brought me my groceries and sundries.<eos> But we had a falling-out.<eos> I have an employee who does all that now.<eos> You took away your brother's key when you hired this employee?
I changed the locks.<eos> Going back to the confrontation, so I have it absolutely clear, did he strike you?<eos> No, nothing like that.<eos> He backed me into a cabinet.<eos> Did he have a weapon?<eos> Well, as I mentioned, he used a fireplace poker to break into my desk.<eos> But he never would have used it on me.<eos> Did you feel physically threatened?<eos> My brother is a lot of things, but even he has limits.<eos> And you're willing to appear as a witness even though he's family?
That won't happen.<eos> I'm curious about your strategy.<eos> Well... as officers of the court, I feel we should be held to a higher standard.<eos> I don't intend to take it easy on your brother just because he's a lawyer.<eos> Of course not.<eos> The bone of contention is going to be the felony breaking and entering.<eos> Your brother's gonna want to plead down to a misdemeanor, but I'll hold the line on the felony.<eos> Which means this could possibly go to trial.<eos> Now, I... I want to be mindful of your comfort and well-being.<eos> With, with your condition, are you able to appear before the court?

- Of course not.<eos> The PPD was Chuck's idea.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> - He just wants my law license.<eos> I'm not gonna let you fight this on your own.<eos> - My watch.<eos> - Allow me.<eos> Hector's your competition.<eos> It's not in my interest for him to die at this time.<eos> You want to disrupt his supply line.
You want to disrupt his supply line.<eos> I would not stand in your way.<eos> Sì, señor.<eos> Pop?<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> Almost didn't recognize the number.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They changed my hours up at work.<eos> I'm still gettin' used to it.<eos> How are you two?
- All over 'em! You okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.<eos> Receipt.<eos> Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos. May I take your order?<eos> ¿Donde esta? Uh, men's room is over there on the left, sir.<eos> Cabrón, I need to see your boss.<eos> Okay. Well, I'm... I'm the assistant manager.<eos> The manager's actually not here today.<eos> Not the manager... the boss.<eos> - You mean Mr. Fring?
O-okay, well, he's not here at the moment.<eos> Uh, I'm sure I could help you with whatever you need.<eos> I need Fring.<eos> Well, like I said, he's not here, uh, and I don't really know when he'll be back.<eos> I can... I can take a message.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> You... you don't have to do that.<eos> I'd be happy to take a message.<eos> Uh, I'm sure Mr. Fring wouldn't want to keep you waiting.<eos> Uh, okay, sir, if you... if you don't mind, there are oth... there are other customers.

Sir, you're not allowed back here.<eos> Gus Fring is a pillar of our local business community, and not just for underwriting our travel raffle, but for making the best damn chicken in town!<eos> - Gus.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, uh, gentlemen, ladies, uh, I-I hope to never need your services...<eos> I mean, no offense, but... if I ever did, it's good to know that...<eos> Yes?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I want you all to go home now.
Well, uh, gentlemen, ladies, uh, I-I hope to never need your services...<eos> I mean, no offense, but... if I ever did, it's good to know that...<eos> Yes?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I want you all to go home now.<eos> You will be compensated for your full shifts.<eos> Normal schedule tomorrow.<eos> Go now.<eos> We are closed for today.<eos> Mr. Fring, y-you sure you want to be left with these guys?
My employees are civilians.<eos> Your actions here today have endangered them, my interests, and those of the cartel.<eos> I am the cartel.<eos> And from now on, you are my mule.<eos> You are going to bring my product north.<eos> Mierda.<eos> I understand that your supply line has been compromised, and this is most unfortunate.<eos> However, my trucks are already at maximum capacity.<eos> Make room.<eos> Don Hector, you must understand that I answer to Juan Bolsa.
May I ask... did Don Eladio approve this?<eos> I approve this.<eos> You're doin' it.<eos> You gonna let me out of here?<eos> Hello?<eos> Tell him we're square.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Could you all please take a moment and join me out here?
What?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me, everyone.<eos> Could you all please take a moment and join me out here?<eos> Please, come.<eos> Come, come, come.<eos> I would, uh,<eos> I would like to apologize to each and every one of you who, yesterday, had to endure the behavior of those men.<eos> It was unacceptable.<eos> Despite the difficult circumstances, you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.
And when they saw that I had no fear of them, they ran like the cowards they are.<eos> Back across the border.<eos> They will not return.<eos> We will move on from this.<eos> My friends,<eos> I promise you... that together, we will prosper.<eos> All right.<eos> Yes, hi. I'm still here.<eos> Really?<eos> Uh, are you sure?
You're absolutely sure you got the right guy for this?<eos> Oh, uh, the crème de la crème.<eos> Martin's Repair?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. McGill?<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> If you don't mind wiping your shoes?<eos> It's this way.<eos> Mind... mind the step here.<eos> Uh, as you'll see, the frame is boarded over, but the, uh, the door itself is intact.
I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I understood there would be no power tools of any kind.<eos> What?<eos> A screwdriver and a hammer?<eos> Turns a morning job into two days with me, myself, and Bengay.<eos> But... it's your call.<eos> I suppose...<eos> Very well, if...<eos> You seem to be making fast work of it.
I did it right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice to fix something for once.<eos> Hell, if that's how you feel, I got a leaky toilet back at the office.<eos> All right.<eos> If you ever need anything from my end...<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> May we talk?<eos> You can park it over there.<eos> You sent back the payment we agreed upon.

The one killed for helping the truck driver.<eos> If I may make an observation... Perhaps you are trying to correct something which cannot be corrected.<eos> It's not the kind of thing I want to take money for.<eos> But the fact remains that your actions benefited me more than you can know.<eos> That's your business.<eos> I'm just glad to have Salamanca out of my head.<eos> Well, perhaps, in the future... you will consider working for me.

I stopped you from killing Hector?<eos> Like you said... it wasn't in your interest.
Kim.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Oh!<eos> Good.<eos> Mr. McGill, does this work for you?<eos> It'll have to do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I assume everyone left their cellphones and so on at reception.<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> And you'll let me know if you need a break or anything else?
- Well, that is a shame.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get down to it.<eos> We are here to finalize the Pre-Prosecution Diversion for James Morgan McGill.<eos> Representing the divertee, Ms. Kimberly Wexler.<eos> Mr. James McGill has signed a contract waiving his rights to a speedy trial and presentment of his case within the statute of limitations.<eos> The terms of the deal are for you, James, to report to your Pre-Prosecution Service Officer at the Albuquerque District Attorney's Office on the second Monday of every month for the next 12 months.<eos> Community service hours will be assigned.<eos> You must maintain lawful employment. Must only associate with law-abiding citizens.
Uh, we'd suggest "destroyed item of personal property."<eos> Ms. Wexler?<eos> Works for us.<eos> Shall I change it, or...?<eos> If you would.<eos> "Destroyed item... "of personal property."<eos> There.<eos> Can you initial it, please?<eos> "JMM." Initialed.<eos> Charles, was there anything else you found wanting in your brother's statement?
No, not all set, Mr. McGill.<eos> Your brother may be satisfied, but I am not.<eos> The confession you've written is adequate, but, frankly, I-I sense a lack of remorse.<eos> And I, for one, would like to hear an apology.<eos> Charles deserves at least that much.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Yes, Mr. McGill, now.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Mr. McGill, could you at least look your brother in the eye?
What do you say we get you home?<eos> Howard. Chuck.<eos> I'm putting you both on notice regarding the bar hearing.<eos> The first thing, I'm filing a motion to suppress that tape.<eos> The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean?<eos> How about we stop with the games?<eos> There's no way there isn't a duplicate.<eos> Really?<eos> Of course there is.<eos> You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.

Thank you for being so careful.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - We have to get in your attic.<eos> - For what?<eos> Oh, the hook-up.<eos> Oh, no. That's all right.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Oh, it won't take 20 minutes.<eos> Plus, you really can't use it if I don't do it.
That's why I say golfing is a contact sport.<eos> Great job, Ms. Wexler.<eos> Very refreshing.<eos> Believe me, uh, we're happy to get this one off the docket.<eos> Not as happy as we are.<eos> Again, great job.<eos> Thank you. Thank you, sir.<eos> Ladies, dinner's on me.<eos> Kim, I knew you were good, but I didn't know you were this good.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you're happy.

I'm so glad to hear that.<eos> We appreciate the heads-up, but you can call this baby put to bed.<eos> Now the most important thing... dinner.<eos> 7:00 good for you?<eos> - Uh, works for me.<eos> - Great.<eos> We'll talk strategy... We move on Colorado or Utah first?<eos> See ya at 7:00.<eos> This McGill thing.<eos> You're sure it's not gonna be a problem?
Then, I'll see you tonight.<eos> Okay, great. See you then.<eos> Okay, this is it.<eos> We can run without lights and mics.<eos> We'll collect all cellphones and hold them for the duration of your testimony.<eos> The, uh, court reporter, would it be possible to move him or her farther from the witness stand?<eos> Um, yeah, I think we can arrange having them in the back of the court.<eos> I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about the exit signs.<eos> It's code.<eos> I appreciate all you're doing. Thank you.
Mr. McGill broke into his brother's home and destroyed an audiocassette which contained a recording of a conversation between himself and his brother, Charles McGill.<eos> We will show that this recording was evidence in an ongoing legal case.<eos> The State Bar believes that, once we have presented the facts, the Committee will agree that disbarment is warranted for James McGill.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Alley.<eos> Ms. Wexler?<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel with James McGill, for the defense.<eos> You've already read Mr. McGill's Pre-Prosecution Statement.
Thank you, Mr. Alley.<eos> Ms. Wexler?<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel with James McGill, for the defense.<eos> You've already read Mr. McGill's Pre-Prosecution Statement.<eos> We don't dispute he broke into his brother's house, an act he regrets... deeply.<eos> But there is another side to this story.<eos> One not about calculation... or ill intent, but about about two brothers, whose relationship, after years of strain, finally broke.<eos> We believe that, after you have the complete picture, you'll understand James McGill is an asset to our legal community.
That's the private investigator that Charles hired?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He and I were concerned that Jimmy might strike his brother.<eos> So that's when we stepped in.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Hamlin.<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Nothing further at this time.<eos> Ms. Wexler?<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> You testified you've known my client for some time.

- Certainly.<eos> Nothing further at this time.<eos> Ms. Wexler?<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> You testified you've known my client for some time.<eos> How long exactly?<eos> Nearly 10 years.<eos> How did you come to know him?<eos> His brother asked to hire him in the mail-room at our firm.<eos> - And you did.

He was a hard worker.<eos> You had a nickname for him, didn't you?<eos> "Charlie Hustle."<eos> "Charlie Hustle."<eos> How'd you feel when you found out he'd become a lawyer?<eos> Surprised.<eos> He'd put himself through law school and taken the Bar Exam without telling any of the partners.<eos> Even Charles.<eos> He bootstrapped his way into a law degree while working in your mail-room.<eos> Did you consider taking him on as an associate?

He did not.<eos> Eventually, he was hired by the firm of Davis Main.<eos> I'd be happy to say more about that, if you'd like.<eos> No. Thank you.<eos> When Charles' condition appeared,<eos> Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?<eos> I believe so.<eos> Jimmy was struggling to build his solo law practice, and yet, every single day, without fail, he brought his brother food, supplies... even his favorite newspapers.<eos> Isn't that right? He did.<eos> Could you speak to the terms of Charles' leave of absence?

But the law is too important.<eos> Ah.<eos> Be right there, Howard!<eos> The law is too important.<eos> Hmm...<eos> I sure shit wouldn't be tellin' ya otherwise.<eos> But, yes... it's the truth.<eos> You'd go to such lengths to humiliate me?<eos> I did it for Kim!<eos> She worked her butt off to get Mesa Verde while you and Howard sat around sipping scotch and chortling.
But you feel better, right?<eos> Besides, it's your word against mine.<eos> Uh. Um.<eos> All right, uh, Mr. Alley, uh, we need to make accommodations for your next witness.<eos> - Is that correct?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Chairman.<eos> All right.<eos> For those who don't know, we need to prepare the room.<eos> Uh, the Clerk is going to collect your, uh, cellphones, watches, key fobs... anything electrical.<eos> If you prefer not to, please secure your items...
- ... outside this room.<eos> Thank you for understanding.<eos> Your phone, sir?<eos> I left it in the car.<eos> - Oh. Excuse me.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's yours.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.<eos> Could you state your name?<eos> Charles L. McGill.<eos> I'm a senior partner at the law firm of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.<eos> Can the court reporter hear me?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I can hear you fine.<eos> Mr. McGill, I'll try to be brief.<eos> We don't need to dwell on the burglary or the assault that you suffered.
I suppose that Jimmy must have felt the tape was decisive evidence on its own.<eos> Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken in to destroy it.<eos> Objection.<eos> More speculation.<eos> How can he know what was going on in Jimmy's head?<eos> Sustained.<eos> We just need to hear what happened, Mr. McGill.<eos> I-I apologize.<eos> I recorded my brother to build a case against him.<eos> And at the time, would you say that you were in possession of your faculties?

I exaggerated the symptoms of my disease to extract the truth.<eos> Can we talk about your disease for a moment?<eos> I'd like everybody here to be on the same page about it.<eos> Of course.<eos> It is sometimes referred to as EHS, electromagnetic hypersensitivity.<eos> I describe it as an acute allergy to electromagnetism.<eos> It's not a common condition, is it?<eos> I know it sounds strange. I do.<eos> But 30 years ago, no one had heard of peanut allergies.<eos> But you admit that no one... uh, no doctor... has ever diagnosed you.
Yes, of course.<eos> She'll be here.<eos> Do you have anything for cross?<eos> Uh, can I look at your notes?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Can we, um...<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So glad you made it.
So there's no chance I would see it.<eos> Not with the state your place was in.<eos> - Isn't that right?<eos> - I suppose.<eos> Would you like to set the scene for the Disciplinary Committee?<eos> Tell them, you know, what your house looked like at the time of the recording.<eos> Objection.<eos> Relevance?<eos> Well, the circumstances of the recording are materially relevant.<eos> How can you know what the tape really means unless you know what was going on when it was recorded?
- think this was a physical condition?<eos> - Objection.<eos> You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.<eos> Besides which, the panel has already ruled that Mr. McGill's mental health is not at issue.<eos> No, the State Bar opened the door to this on direct when the witness talked about his supposed "play-acting."<eos> Allowing me to follow up on cross is only reasonable.<eos> We discussed the physical allergy, not a mental disability.<eos> Potato, po-tah-to.<eos> It comes down to this...<eos> In order to understand what I was thinking, you need to see Chuck through my eyes.

- But watch yourself.<eos> Chuck, I'd like to go back a little further, talk about when these symptoms first started.<eos> It was shortly after you were divorced, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> You think the stress of the divorce brought on the illness?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> It was an amicable split.<eos> My ex-wife and I are still on good terms.<eos> In fact, your ex-wife is present with us today, is she not?<eos> When was the last time you two saw each other?
One after Magna Carta.<eos> As if I could ever make such a mistake.<eos> Never.<eos> Never!<eos> I just... I just couldn't prove it.<eos> H-H-He covered his tracks.<eos> He got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him.<eos> Mr. McGill, please.<eos> You don't have to go in...<eos> You think this is something?

Previously on AMC's "Better Call Saul"...<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You know, she's gonna hate you when this is over.<eos> I came because I thought it was the right thing.<eos> You've been sold a bill of goods, Rebecca.<eos> Which of us you believe depends on how we all understand the mind of Charles McGill.
No!<eos> No!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I want to start by sincerely thanking you for your patience through this long and emotional proceeding.<eos> Jimmy McGill has worked tirelessly to build a practice that helps an underserved and frankly overlooked segment of our community... the elderly.<eos> You've heard from many of Mr. McGill's clients today.
Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.<eos> He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.<eos> He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare.<eos> Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.<eos> Dropping everything to care for his brother through multiple hospitalizations.<eos> Even supporting Charles' career by hand-making a Mylar-lined suit jacket to spare his brother discomfort from exposure to electricity.<eos> And yet, during this time, Charles McGill's irrational animus towards his brother... grew to epic proportions.<eos> So when Jimmy discovered that Charles had used his love and his caring against him, when he discovered he had been betrayed by his only living blood relative...<eos> Jimmy snapped.<eos> Wouldn't you?
Chuck?<eos> Jimmy McGill understands he broke the law when he forced his way into his brother's house, and he is deeply sorry.<eos> He's more than ready to face the consequences.<eos> However, as to ethical violation 16-304 (A), the State Bar's claim of destruction of evidence... it categorically did not happen.<eos> Jimmy McGill had no premeditated agenda when he entered his brother's home.<eos> - He lost his temper...<eos> - Chuck, please!<eos> - ...plain and simple.<eos> - Please let me in!<eos> So now the question you must ask yourselves is this...
With the A's.<eos> Hi. Mrs. Adamson?<eos> It's Francesca at Jimmy McGill's office.<eos> Are you available to talk with Jimmy?<eos> Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Mrs. Adamson.<eos> Hello, dear.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> I just wanted you to be the first to know, uh, that I'll be taking a brief sabbatical from the law, just one year.
Next!<eos> Next.<eos> Next!<eos> Yes, Mrs. Pressman, I still have the document.<eos> I'm including the calico.<eos> Now I don't wanna get down into the weeds on this with you, sir.<eos> It's just my headache, sir.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Listen to you.<eos> Where'd you learn so much about lawyering?
Bye-bye.<eos> - Next!<eos> - Last one, Mr. Yalowitz.<eos> Last one.<eos> Mr. Yalowitz.<eos> Hey, it's Jimmy McGill.<eos> Listen, for your future lawyering needs, I am taking a hiatus of one year.<eos> Will you please watch your mail for a letter from my office?<eos> Yes, Jimmy from TV.<eos> You watch it every day, huh?

You're thinking it's too good to be true.<eos> I mean, "TV's too expensive.<eos> We can't afford that."<eos> Well, I'm telling you, you can.<eos> And here's the beauty part... for a reasonable price, we will shoot your commercial, and then we'll throw in the airtime for the low, low price of free.<eos> Hey!<eos> Gimme Jimmy.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's me!<eos> You've seen my ad!
It's a big financial commitment.<eos> Uh, that's why we have our, uh, "Toe-in-the-Water" package.<eos> That's, uh, one commercial, flat rate,<eos> $849.95.<eos> Beauty part again... free airtime.<eos> And when this thing runs, you're gonna get calls...<eos> I can promise you that.<eos> We'll think about it.<eos> Excellent.<eos> When, uh, do you think you might decide?
We'll think about it.<eos> Excellent.<eos> When, uh, do you think you might decide?<eos> - Maybe next week.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow. Gee, I'm sorry for any confusion, but I was talk... I was talking about, uh... a much shorter window for the thinking part.<eos> How short?<eos> We would have you on the air by 3:20 this afternoon.<eos> Today?<eos> You're gonna shoot a commercial in the next 2 1/2 hours?
It was "Let My People Go"?<eos> No.<eos> Well, yeah, it was kind of...<eos> Everybody get in the car.<eos> Is... is everything okay?<eos> No!<eos> I air in 2 hours and 20 minutes, and I have no client.<eos> That's another 400 bucks down the drain.<eos> How do I find somebody who needs a commercial and can afford one?<eos> Maybe... you could make a commercial?
Lionel talked to our guy in Los Lunas.<eos> Looks like Tuco knifed a guy.<eos> But he definitely broke a guard's jaw.<eos> - They got him in solitary.<eos> - What?<eos> ! All he had to do was six months!<eos> He'll be in there forever!<eos> Boss.<eos> You talk to your father.<eos> I promise, as soon as you see the first one, you're gonna want the whole package.
That was, uh, one of our trucks.<eos> We're, uh, location shooting today.<eos> It's a big production, actually.<eos> Our usual rate is one commercial, one airing... $850, but you're in luck... today, we have a one-time special.<eos> Our Elite package. Seven commercials, seven airings for forty... forty-six hundred dollars.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Forty-six hundred dollars.<eos> And we can a... Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> No, I didn't, because you keep putting me on hold.
No, no, no.<eos> Don't put me on hold again, please.<eos> He...<eos> Hello?<eos> He...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This says 30 minutes.<eos> Yep.<eos> We were out here for four hours.<eos> You were on your phone.
Don't put me on hold again, please.<eos> He...<eos> Hello?<eos> He...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This says 30 minutes.<eos> Yep.<eos> We were out here for four hours.<eos> You were on your phone.<eos> You knew the rules when you signed up.
Mention this ad and get 10% off your first purchase.<eos> And... cut.<eos> Great!<eos> How was that? - Good for camera.<eos> - Sound was good. Yep.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That was great. - Hold up. Hold up.<eos> I wanna do one more. Was that okay?<eos> It was great, uh, but I just...<eos> I want... I want you to connect more with the audience.
Great!<eos> That's the one! Check the gate!<eos> How did that feel?<eos> ! Good, I guess. What...<eos> what did you think?<eos> Good! So good!<eos> Just very, very...<eos> - just great!<eos> - It was very nice.<eos> Listen, you are on a roll, my friend.
- My wife didn't want me to do this one.<eos> - You know what? They say you gotta spend money to make money.<eos> And, uh... and I tell ya what...<eos> you got a chance here to potentially spike your sales by hundreds... hell, thousands... of new customers who'd never even heard of Duke City Recliners.<eos> - What do ya say?<eos> - Sure, s-sure.<eos> B-but... but like I said... I only have enough to pay for the one.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I like you, and I wanna help.<eos> So I know we discussed a discounted rate of $545 per commercial, but if you sign up right now for our Elite package... now, that's seven commercials... I think we can do the whole thing for... $500 per commercial.
Have a couple of volunteers here who want to help.<eos> Well, thanks, but I think I'm good.<eos> Please, we can't let you do it all by yourself.<eos> Certainly not after you bought all the supplies.<eos> At least let the church reimburse you.<eos> - It's a donation.<eos> - C'mon. You've got unskilled but eager laborers.<eos> Let us do something.<eos> Just point and tell us what to do.<eos> All right, uh... how about you dump one of those packs into the wheelbarrow?

- Am I doing this right?<eos> - Uh... why don't you try using this instead?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's for the walkway.<eos> Look.<eos> It puts down a texture so the kids don't slip when it gets wet.<eos> Like this?<eos> You got it.<eos> Nice and gentle.<eos> You're Kaylee's Pop-Pop, right?
But...<eos> Not interested!<eos> _<eos> Look... full disclosure.<eos> When you told us about the disciplinary hearing, I admit it... I had concerns.<eos> So, just so you know, I had to do my due diligence.<eos> I read the transcripts.<eos> All of them.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> What you did to Charles... you and James set him up perfectly.

- I think you're flooding it.<eos> - I'm not flooding it! You're over-cranking it.<eos> Oh, you don't know what you're talking about!<eos> We're still getting paid whether we get there or not.<eos> - Maybe we should catch the bus.<eos> - Sh... come on!<eos> Just... it's gonna start, okay?<eos> Yeah, you definitely flooded it.<eos> He drained the battery.<eos> You drained the battery. Can you not talk about something you know absolutely nothing about?
Uh, we don't sell recorders. Synthesizers, then.<eos> But the point is, those Social Security checks... they got to be spent somewhere.<eos> Mnh.<eos> Hey, uh... as it happens, uh, today only, I can, uh, offer the same package, but... 50% off.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm sorry, but we can't.<eos> Not today, guys.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Guys.<eos> Now, come on. Look, I know you want this.
No, I... um...<eos> You guys... get to the editing room.<eos> I just need t... to sit.<eos> Mr. McGill?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I-I can't.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, that's yours.<eos> You earned it.<eos> But you're losing money.
Mm. I guess they feel if you can face this,<eos> - you can face anything.<eos> - Could be. - I must be stronger than I think.<eos> - Mm.<eos> You mind if I ask... and I really don't mean to pry, but...<eos> Let me guess. You have another construction job you need my help on.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> But if I do, you'll be the first person I call.<eos> Okay, ask away.<eos> You said you kept your husband's uniform.

I've... called quite a few times about an issue I'm trying to address.<eos> Do you have your policy number?<eos> No.<eos> Can you just look up my name?<eos> Charles McGill of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill?<eos> No, that's my brother.<eos> Um... I'm Jimmy.<eos> James McGill.<eos> Solo practitioner.<eos> There you are.
I... Mr. McGill, I'm sorry.<eos> I wish we could help you, but we just can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's hard.<eos> Very, very hard.<eos> I'm just having a rough time.<eos> I just need a break.<eos> Just one break.<eos> And I know you...<eos> I know you can't do anything, but...
And I'm worried, I'm just... if he screws up with one more big client... it's just gonna destroy him!<eos> Oh, don't... don't write...<eos> What are you writing?<eos> No, don't write.<eos> I-I didn't mean to say that.<eos> I don't want him to get in trouble with you guys<eos> - 'cause of me. I...<eos> - Right. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> You're not gonna do anything, are you?
Oh, I was in the area, and I thought...<eos> I wonder how my favorite former client is doing?<eos> And I have cookies.<eos> Oh, you're so sweet.<eos> Come on in!<eos> After I made these, I looked down, and I thought, "Wow! That looks just like your Felix."<eos> They do!<eos> You're so thoughtful.<eos> I was afraid you wouldn't be here.<eos> Thought, with that settlement money, you might've moved somewhere swankier.
Oh, yes.<eos> I-I have met her.<eos> It's a... She's a wonderful young lady.<eos> Uh... Well, she takes care of all of that, and she said there's still a long way to go.<eos> But you've... received an offer, right?<eos> Something sent to you in writing?<eos> I mean, something more than just Erin and you chatting?<eos> It's probably all here in this box.<eos> I can't make heads or tails of it, but you are welcome to look.<eos> You sure?
You sure?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's you.<eos> Well, uh, I gotta say...<eos> I can't blame you for getting mixed up with all this.<eos> I mean, these legal notices... I mean, no one really understands them.<eos> You know, I've got a law degree.<eos> And sometimes I can't even, uh...<eos> I can't even, uh...<eos> You haven't, uh... accepted this?
And sometimes I can't even, uh...<eos> I can't even, uh...<eos> You haven't, uh... accepted this?<eos> Erin says we should wait.<eos> But...<eos> Erin doesn't really matter, does she?<eos> I mean, you're the Class Representative.<eos> That's a big deal.<eos> That means you and you alone decide.<eos> You're... you are the legal stand-in for your friends and neighbors.
I mean, you're the Class Representative.<eos> That's a big deal.<eos> That means you and you alone decide.<eos> You're... you are the legal stand-in for your friends and neighbors.<eos> I-I don't know about all that, Jimmy.<eos> I-I just leave it all to the professionals.<eos> Yeah, sure, sure.<eos> Lawyers know best, but...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If you won the lottery, I mean, you'd take the lump sum, right?
I'm on my way to chair yoga.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Um, I probably should be going.<eos> I have a lot to do.<eos> Hi. - Jimmy! - Jimmy!<eos> - Jimmy!<eos> - Rose, Myrtle, Helen.<eos> That chair yoga really works, huh?<eos> You all look 10 years younger.
Have a seat, um...<eos> Mike.<eos> HR sent up your start paperwork. I-9, W-2.<eos> Pretty standard.<eos> Could I have your driver's license and Social Security card?<eos> Why?<eos> My assistant needs to make a copy.<eos> How does this "hire" work, exactly?<eos> Walk me through it.<eos> You'll receive a paycheck from Madrigal in the amount of $10,000 per week.
Good.<eos> So, to that end, I have you down as a "logistics consultant."<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a person who consults on logistics.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I'm not long on logistics.<eos> "Security consultant" would be better.<eos> I used to be a cop.<eos> That will look better on your "work history" than your current employer, SMQ Parking.<eos> So, you take my money, you run it through this joint, and it comes out clean.

- You sure?<eos> May I ask, what precisely is your concern here?<eos> I am concerned about what happens if you put my real name in your books.<eos> Your Madrigal is a German company.<eos> One thing I know about Germans is they love a good audit.<eos> I oversee eight freight terminals across Texas and the Southwest.<eos> Operating costs range between $800,000 and a million dollars per week.<eos> All due respect, Mike, but your money?<eos> It's a rounding error.<eos> If the IRS or anyone else looks, you're a contractor for a multinational corporation with 114,000 employees worldwide.

For Fring's other guys.<eos> Other guys?<eos> This is the first time I've done this... for anyone.<eos> I don't know what you do, but... Mr. Fring must think you're quite good at it.
The sooner you're off my books, the better.<eos> Justin?<eos> Can you make a copy of these, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> What?<eos> This is a very nice office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Seem to be risking a lot for a drug dealer.<eos> "Drug dealer"?<eos> If that's all you think he is... then you don't know Gustavo Fring.

The few times we've done this, it's been for clients with a high probability of catastrophic health failure as a precaution.<eos> What you're saying is that for any case Charles takes on, another partner would be tied up, as well, and we don't bill a penny more?<eos> This is ludicrous.<eos> The insurance industry is heavily regulated.<eos> I can think of a dozen infractions - right here off the top of my head.<eos> - Mr. McGill...<eos> You're hoping we'll either find another carrier or cut you an enormous check.<eos> Win-win for you!<eos> I assure you, neither is going to happen.<eos> What will happen is very simple... you're going to do right by us or we will compel you to do so.

And now you have New Mexico rights holders to deal with.<eos> You know, they should get profit on what's theirs, but now I've got two states coming after me for taxes on each and every gallon.<eos> No equipment crosses the border?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Nothing below the surface, like the...<eos> What... is it a drill bit?<eos> It would be the sucker rod at this point, but no, none of that.<eos> Only on the Texas side.<eos> But that's not stopping New Mexico from trying to bleed me.<eos> You said on the phone you have a solution.
If someone came to me with this offer... I'd sure as hell take it.<eos> Wish I'd called you sooner.<eos> Way they're makin' noise, if I don't get this thing wrapped up by the end of the quarter,<eos> And that's two weeks from now?<eos> I can do it by then.<eos> Really?<eos> If we can get all the rights holders in one place, I can walk them through what we're proposing.<eos> If they're smart, they'll go for it.<eos> Well, hot damn.<eos> Kevin said you were a miracle worker, but I didn't believe him.
If you actually have business, then call my secretary.<eos> I did. She stonewalled me, as if you didn't know.<eos> Sandpiper.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - It's time to settle.<eos> I-I saw the current offer.<eos> The clients make their losses back, plus a solid chunk of change.<eos> Not that it's any of your business, but we project a final number far higher than the current offer.<eos> I get it. I get it.<eos> You hold out, maybe you squeeze a grand more for each client.

Well, they... they're quite stylish.<eos> Hey, y'know what?<eos> I bought a pair for my girlfriend, and they don't fit her. And the store has this...<eos> wouldn't you know it? ...<eos> - no-refunds policy. - Oh.<eos> What size are you?<eos> 7 1/2. 7 1/2.<eos> Oh, there we go.<eos> How does that feel? Oh!<eos> Oh, I-I see what you mean.
- no-refunds policy. - Oh.<eos> What size are you?<eos> 7 1/2. 7 1/2.<eos> Oh, there we go.<eos> How does that feel? Oh!<eos> Oh, I-I see what you mean.<eos> They... They are so nice, and they fit like a dream!<eos> But I-I can't take these for free, Jimmy.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> There is one thing you could do for me? What's that?
- Then you go and enjoy those.<eos> I'm gonna go get my heart rate back up.<eos> - Oh, thank you!<eos> - And I'll see you later.<eos> Thank you so much, Jimmy!<eos> ... Right hand, friends...<eos> the hand of love. Now, watch, and I'll show you the story of life.<eos> You got some questions.<eos> It's only natural.<eos> And the truth is, if Irene settles... you'd get some money.
Maybe Irene just doesn't need the money.<eos> I mean, I don't know for a fact, but... when you see someone buying nice new things...<eos> - Like those shoes.<eos> - ... like those shoes.<eos> I mean, those must have cost a pretty penny.<eos> I mean, if she can afford those, she's walkin' on easy street.<eos> And there's something else... y'know.<eos> The lawyers.<eos> I mean... that's the lawyer's share of the settlement. And your share is... boop!<eos> If Irene holds out, the lawyers get this much more... and you are gonna get this much more.
I mean, the lawyers have explained it to her.<eos> It's crazy, but it's all up to Irene.<eos> After all, she is the Class Representative.<eos> Does that mean that she gets more?<eos> No.<eos> No. Just means in the eyes of the court, she's special.<eos> She's like your congressman or ambassador.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> No. No.<eos> You can't do anything.
_<eos> _<eos> Okay, and I'm still waiting for those third-party subpoenas.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Let me know, then.<eos> - Thanks, Francis. - All right.<eos> - Julie, what's up?<eos> - From Chuck.<eos> It came via messenger...<eos> the instructions say he wants you to read it as soon as possible.
Kelly, tell me... have we got it?<eos> We have a bingo!<eos> Paul, step up to the winner's circle.<eos> Let's hear it for him!<eos> Let's give him a big round of applause!<eos> Okay. New game, new cards.<eos> Here they come.<eos> Get yourself some new cards. New cards.<eos> The helpers have them.<eos> You can have one, two.

Come on.<eos> Let's hear it for Irene.<eos> Irene... where ya goin'?<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> Take over.<eos> Okay.<eos> Time for a new game.<eos> Uh, let's get some cards out for everyone.<eos> Hey. What's going on?<eos> You okay?
- It's so cruel. - Mnh. And I don't even know why.<eos> I think, uh... maybe I do.<eos> You do?<eos> Could it be the settlement?<eos> I mean, maybe they... want the money, you know, to improve their lives?<eos> I had no idea any of them needed money.<eos> No one said anything to me.<eos> Well, maybe it's not about the money itself.<eos> I mean... hello... who wouldn't want more money?<eos> I mean, maybe it's the idea that they don't think you're considering them, you know?
I mean, maybe it's the idea that they don't think you're considering them, you know?<eos> Thinking of their needs?<eos> I-I-I didn't know.<eos> I don't want to hurt them.<eos> They're my friends.<eos> I wish we never even started this lawsuit.<eos> I just want everything to go back the way it was.<eos> What should I do?<eos> What would you do?<eos> I mean, you know I'm not a lawyer right now.
Think of all the things you want to say to me, and just say them to me later, okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> You.<eos> Shots.<eos> - Uh, I...<eos> - Shots.<eos> We're celebrating.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Smooth.<eos> Under the terms we're offering, you get a substantial payment without any impact to your property via drilling and extraction.
This column gives a proximate origin... uh, and as you can see, uh, much of time, I couldn't be sure, so I just wrote "ambient."<eos> Um, and, of course, I've recorded the, uh, times and dosages of the medicine.<eos> This is very impressive, Charles.<eos> And look at the trend!<eos> Day one, pain of 7 and 8, even 8.5.<eos> Day three, nothing higher than five and a quarter.<eos> And now... it's all 3s and 4s.<eos> Later in the session, I'd like to give you some exercises and strategies that might help even more.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> How do you see your next steps?
I want caterers and a full bar.<eos> I want to be surrounded by friends and colleagues.<eos> That's stirring.<eos> Those are excellent goals.<eos> Doctor, I wouldn't have believed I could come so far so quickly.<eos> And I have to give you the lion's share of the credit.<eos> Well, it's remarkable.<eos> But Rome wasn't built in a day.<eos> I know rushing forward may be tempting, but it's important to give yourself time.<eos> - You've just begun a journey that could take years.
I know rushing forward may be tempting, but it's important to give yourself time.<eos> - You've just begun a journey that could take years.<eos> Well, I suppose, but, um, surely you'd admit that every case is different?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Then perhaps, uh, my recovery might be speedier than your run-of-the-mill patient. Isn't that possible?<eos> I'm just cautioning you not to push yourself too hard.<eos> - I know.<eos> Appreciate every step forward, but modulate your expectations.<eos> Yes, absolutely.<eos> Let's talk about the night you first called me. - Mm.

I was.
- I know.<eos> Oh, here's your partner.<eos> Hey, get him into make-up, and we can carve this turkey.<eos> Okay. Listen.<eos> Ex-excuse me.<eos> Not now.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I just got off the phone with the station.<eos> You don't even work for them. I never said I work for the station.
Okay, but why do we need seven new ones in the first place?<eos> Yeah. What... what's to stop us from paying the station to just keep running the one we have?<eos> That's not what we agreed to. How about that for starters?<eos> He did give us the first one for free. Yeah, I know.<eos> Okay, how about this... how about we pay you $450 for the one that already aired, and then we take it from there?<eos> Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya, but that commercial... it doesn't actually belong to you.<eos> Look, it's the real and intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions. I don't think so.<eos> I mean, it's our faces.<eos> - It's our store.<eos> - And it's my commercial. And you can't run it without my permission. - Oh.
- Yeah, and that crew of yours? - Yeah.<eos> Just a bunch of UNM students.<eos> - We can get those.<eos> - We can get students.<eos> - We can get students. - Yes, we can.<eos> - We can reshoot the ad...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - ...and then run that - How about that?<eos> Guys. Guys, come on.<eos> Now, you wouldn't even be thinking about a commercial if it wasn't for me!
- Seriously. - Seriously.<eos> - Th... - Excuse us.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Anything we can help you with?<eos> - Put that camera back up.<eos> Roll it.<eos> - It's not gonna do a damn thing.<eos> - Don't give me any lip, okay? Just roll it.<eos> Make sure it's pointed in my direction.<eos> - Now, if you're gigging a lot...

there's no wiggle room here?<eos> - We are with customers right now. - Yeah.<eos> Please, all right? Just go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, well, best of luck in all your future endeavors.<eos> - Go. Goodbye.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Sorry about that. - Sorry about that.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Are you okay?
Yes, an ambulance.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> You guys have liability insurance, right?<eos> To our "Four Corners Strategy..."<eos> - Cheers to that.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I'm not saying this to rush you, but I have a 2:45 tee time at Four Hills... - so don't let me get, uh, long-winded. - Okay.<eos> I've heard the water gets tricky on the back nine there.<eos> You heard right.<eos> I didn't know you played.
- Not at all.<eos> - Okay. Kevin, if you want to give me Mr. Gatwood's number, I'd be happy to speak to him.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> Once I understand what's going on, I'll put him together with a firm that'll take very good care of him.<eos> I leave it in your capable hands.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay, Utah.<eos> The good news is the filing requirements are very similar - to what we submitted for Arizona. - Oh, good.<eos> Thanks again, Kim.<eos> I'll let Billy know you'll be calling,
Thanks again, Kim.<eos> I'll let Billy know you'll be calling,<eos> - and we'll talk tee times soon.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bye. - See you soon, Kim.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I think it's pretty self-explanatory.<eos> Look, Howard, you were very generous when I left HHM, but it never sat right with me that you covered my law-school loans.
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.<eos> Look, Howard, you were very generous when I left HHM, but it never sat right with me that you covered my law-school loans.<eos> It seemed to sit right at the time.<eos> I appreciate the gift, but now that I'm able to afford it, - I want to pay you back.<eos> - Oh, you "appreciate the gift"?<eos> - Yes, I do, Howard.<eos> - You know what I'm doing in there? Take a guess.<eos> I'm doing damage control.<eos> And I'm doing it three meals a day for the past two weeks with every one of our clients.<eos> I'm busting my ass, trying to repair the reputation of the firm after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.
I did everything in my power to defend my client.<eos> Oh, is that what you're calling it?<eos> That's the job, Howard.<eos> And by the way, it was all very convenient for you to ignore Chuck's illness when it suited you.<eos> So, I take you out of the mail room, put you through law school, mentor you, and then when you leave and stab me in the back, that's my fault?<eos> I'm not cashing this.<eos> Kim, your debt is forgiven.<eos> But anything else? That's on you.<eos> All Jimmy and I did was show the situation for what it is.<eos> And if you are hiding that from your clients?
Well, go on!<eos> Get outta here.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> That was some Jedi mind shit right there!<eos> The best $700 I done ever spent.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Yo, I'm on my way.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I've got a problem I think you can help me with.
The best $700 I done ever spent.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Yo, I'm on my way.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I've got a problem I think you can help me with.<eos> I've got cash I can't spend.<eos> About $200,000.<eos> If anything happens to me, my family'll never see it.<eos> Now, it seems to me you opened this place to solve a similar problem.

I do recognize penises, though.<eos> Dwayne, when you said team before, is this the whole lineup?<eos> Yep, just you, me, and Anne.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm gonna head to court to meet Mr. Henderson.<eos> Mr. Henderson. Hi.<eos> I'm Josh Segal. - I'll be representing you pre-trial.<eos> - Hello, Josh.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here as soon as we can.<eos> How you holding up?
How you holding up?<eos> My cell mate is a serial rapist.<eos> That said, he keeps an immaculate bunk, keeps to himself, and is gluten free, so he gives me all his pastries.<eos> Uh, let me clarify. Terrible human being, terrific roommate.<eos> So, what's happening now is the arraignment.<eos> - This is not the trial...<eos> - You realize, of course, that this whole thing is absurd.<eos> I loved my wife.<eos> After lunch, I was waiting for the cable guy to show, so I went into the yard to roller-cise.<eos> You mean roller skate.
After lunch, I was waiting for the cable guy to show, so I went into the yard to roller-cise.<eos> You mean roller skate.<eos> No.<eos> Roller skating is for children.<eos> Roller-cising is a very graceful form of self-expression.<eos> It's much easier when you're not shackled.<eos> It... It must... It must be.<eos> So, I came back inside... and found Margaret dead.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> And we'll get into all that before you testify on the stand.
Sure.<eos> Other ideas?<eos> _ Maybe we should get some lunch.<eos> What do you guys feel like?<eos> Thai, Mexican, sandwich, fried chicken.<eos> We could have a picnic.<eos> Okay, we... are having Thai.<eos> B?<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Larry! You're out on bail!
That's just legal posturing.<eos> We're working on your defense as we speak.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Let's see what we got.<eos> Hey.<eos> Now, Larry, I just want you to know, very early on in the process.<eos> I'm gonna die, aren't I?<eos> We're off to a great start.<eos> Trust me, huh?<eos> You are not going to die.
Which means...<eos> I don't think he did it.<eos> What's this supposed to mean to me?<eos> It means you don't have a case.<eos> Well, all I know is Larry Henderson is a known homosexual.<eos> As far as I know, being gay isn't a crime.<eos> Well, perhaps you ought to brush up on the laws in this county.<eos> Because the Buggery Act of 1789 has never been repealed.<eos> - Huh.<eos> - Mm-hmm. You're not gonna convict him on a 225-year-old law.

Oh, here's something cute in East Charm City.<eos> Oh, near the cute insane asylum?<eos> Or near the cute, abandoned mannequin factory<eos> - where all the pedophiles live?<eos> - I have to - increase my price range. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Anyone else stay in a hotel carved out of ice this weekend?<eos> Mm, I slept on a pile of clothes at my weed dealer's mom's place.<eos> Harrowing.<eos> Anyway, I was in Iceland, at the Wayne Industries managers retreat.<eos> You were in Greenland.
But I'm still new in town.<eos> I mean, I work all the time.<eos> It can get kinda lonely, you know?<eos> Listen, you seem like a nice person but you're also their boss, and a boss can't be friends with their employees.<eos> Well this boss can.<eos> And here we go, here we go.<eos> All right, I laid out the schedule for the Rumbrella.<eos> It's ambitious, but we're not afraid of a little hard work.<eos> Fuh-fuh-Fantasy Superhero League update.<eos> - All right, hold that thought. - If you've got the top pick, - I'd shy away from Superman.
All right?<eos> It was the right pick at the time.<eos> Oh, yeah. The right pick if you want to come in last.<eos> - Like a bitch! - Ooh!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Oh, fantasy league, huh?<eos> Sounds like my kind of fun.<eos> Mixing it up with some friends.<eos> I can bring the trash talk.<eos> You do not want me coming for you on a group e-mail.
And fully visible member of the Wayne Dream Team.<eos> If you need anything at all, you let me know.<eos> Mm-mm. Well, he seems nice.<eos> So do chimps.<eos> Until you dress them up and have them perform "12 Angry Men"<eos> for your Yale buddies.<eos> Yes, that happened.<eos> Guys, I can't stress enough the importance of peoples' heads remaining attached to their bodies.<eos> Fuh-fuh-Fantasy Superhero League...<eos> Have you just been playing that fantasy site?

If you want people to do what you say, you've gotta be the bad guy.<eos> Or someone does.<eos> What's your policy on people using company computers to play Superhero Fantasy League?<eos> Usually we turn a blind eye, unless it's causing a problem.<eos> What if it is causing a problem?<eos> - Then things get fun. - Mm.<eos> Van, I think I know how to fix the photo situation.<eos> Already done.<eos> I am solving this in a way that your little mind couldn't possibly comprehend.<eos> You're taking a picture of yourself to Photoshop it into the picture of the Dream Team, and then you're gonna mount that in the lobby instead.
- Yeah. - Actually, you're paid...<eos> Yeah!<eos> No, no, no. Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna put everything else aside until we figure this out.<eos> Emily, get in here!<eos> Come on!<eos> So I think there was some sort of miscommunication.<eos> I just wanted the fantasy site blocked.<eos> Now they're spending all their time trying to get the Internet back.<eos> So if you could just put it back.
I was just... trying to get the Internet back... for you guys because I knew you wanted it so bad.<eos> - What? - You did that for us?<eos> I mean, nobody screws with Samuel.<eos> I mean, to be honest, Ron even thought for a second that you were the reason the Internet was shut down.<eos> Ron.<eos> Yeah, I had you all wrong.<eos> And I try not to use the word hero outside of a sandwich context... but you just might be one.<eos> You know, we were being a little tough on you earlier.<eos> What do you say about joining our fantasy league?<eos> Well, I thought you said it was full.
Come on. It was just a joke.<eos> Ooh, just a joke.<eos> Well, I have a joke of my own.<eos> Uhh, knock, knock?<eos> Who's there?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Susan!<eos> A six-hour anti-bullying video you'll all be watching this weekend because I have just written you up.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You are being ridiculous.
- What's he talking about?<eos> - Guys, let's be honest, we were bullying.<eos> We need to just take our punishment and walk away and not listen to anything else anyone says.<eos> Emily betrayed you.<eos> I didn't take away your Internet for no reason.<eos> She asked me to.<eos> I'm just gonna go ride the elevator up and down for a while.<eos> And with the tenth pick in the longest draft ever because Emily had our Internet taken away...<eos> - Susan. - Thanks, guys.<eos> I really appreciate you letting me back in...
- Thought we were punching through the non-Italian granite wall.<eos> That's gonna be our way out after we exit the vault.<eos> Come on. Try to stay with me here, boys.<eos> Now, where's that cherry at?<eos> Stephan Yusic, former Bosnian Serb army officer.<eos> Now a crime boss and one of the bank's biggest clients, with after-hours privileges.<eos> Got a 20 on him?<eos> We've located his phone at a high-end spa on Kuttelgasse.<eos> Who you are?<eos> You have any idea who I am?
Now, you have ten minutes.<eos> After that, the vault closes and relocks.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I must also tell you that because the system knows we are here and every box transmits a signal to the master control panel, a box must be opened within 90 seconds.<eos> Do it.<eos> Now.<eos> Down.<eos> Down!<eos> You must wondering how I got this in, right?<eos> You're a very important client... With a tiny little light switch.
Okay.<eos> Fire in the hole.<eos> All call signs, this is X-ray.<eos> Hand me the gun and fall on the floor.<eos> Now.<eos> On the floor!<eos> Alpha, stand by.<eos> We have a situation. Roger.<eos> Standing by.<eos> I assume you're here to open box 518?
Here he is.<eos> All right.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, rod!<eos> Ms. wicker?<eos> Bryan mills.<eos> I'm sorry, do we... do we know each other?<eos> I was told you'd be expecting me.
My boss, Christina hart.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes, of course, please...<eos> Lead the way.<eos> - This way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Everything okay, Ms. wicker?<eos> - Call me Leah.<eos> Leah.<eos> And you tell me.
Except liev.<eos> - Clear.<eos> - For now.<eos> And you are?<eos> Rem.<eos> And you?<eos> - John.<eos> - Scott.<eos> Why ask o.D.N.I for protection instead of Mossad?<eos> Are you sure we lost them?
Looks like it.<eos> Why?<eos> I met Christina hart in Beirut, '93.<eos> When she was CIA.<eos> And now it's her turn to have my back.<eos> Doing what?<eos> That's between me and her.<eos> 12:00, black Audi.<eos> You two, with me.<eos> What are you doing?

He did, two days ago... Highest priority.<eos> What do you need from me?<eos> Remember Beirut?<eos> Where I was your safety net in uncertain times?<eos> Yow owe me one.<eos> And do you have any idea what your asset needs to tell you so urgently?<eos> You think it has to do with the prime minister's visit to congress?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I won't know until I see him.<eos> Do you have a place and time set for the meeting?
Okay.<eos> Anyone ever tell you you have a kind face?<eos> I do?<eos> Tell me about yourself.<eos> There's not much to tell.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Really, I'm...<eos> I'm not interesting.<eos> I'm in shock, Bryan.<eos> Are you familiar with how to treat shock?
Zev, you're really too much.<eos> Shalom.<eos> Shalom.<eos> Got a 12-35, runway one center.<eos> Line up and wait.<eos> Freeze.<eos> Don't move at all.<eos> Lights, lights.<eos> Down!<eos> You were gonna shoot down the Israeli prime minister's plane... In America.
Shalom.<eos> Got a 12-35, runway one center.<eos> Line up and wait.<eos> Freeze.<eos> Don't move at all.<eos> Lights, lights.<eos> Down!<eos> You were gonna shoot down the Israeli prime minister's plane... In America.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You were gonna pin it on a terrorist organization, which your government would then condemn?
Out the back.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Car keys.<eos> No!<eos> They're Israeli agents.<eos> No kill shots.<eos> A motorist crashed into a gas main outside of an Adams-Morgan apartment building yesterday, causing an explosion and forcing the evacuation of two buildings.<eos> There is one fatality, the driver of the car, and we are waiting...<eos> They'll I.D. Her body within the next few hours.<eos> I'm just glad you all got to know her even a little bit.
Dan?<eos> You hear anything?
Dan?<eos> Do you know the red box trail in Shenandoah State Park?<eos> I can find it.<eos> Meet me there at 8:30 A.M.<eos> Proud of you, Dan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - Finally...<eos> A year later.<eos> Have you met at this place before?
What?<eos> I'll do anything. Anything.<eos> Please.<eos> You should put it in your pocket.<eos> They said it... it has to be just me.<eos> No one else.<eos> Keep a hand on the phone at all times, in case you don't hear it ring. It's set to vibrate as well.<eos> They said if they see anyone else in there, she dies.<eos> No one's gonna die.<eos> You think you can just say that, and that makes it so?
So you guys just going through the motions or are you actually gonna do something? - Ma'am...<eos> - She's just trying to help.<eos> - Miss, this guy covers tracks pretty well.<eos> He knew what he was doing.<eos> Do you have anywhere you can go for the next couple days?<eos> - Yeah, she can crash with me. - No, no, you just moved in.<eos> - Friends, family member, somebody you can trust?<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What are you not saying?
- Yeah, she can crash with me. - No, no, you just moved in.<eos> - Friends, family member, somebody you can trust?<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What are you not saying?<eos> This guy was in your underwear drawer, miss.<eos> And it's not the first case of stalking that we've seen - in the neighborhood in the last year.<eos> - Well, that's great.<eos> Of a young, successful, attractive woman.<eos> Are you hitting on her now?
- What are you doing?<eos> - Gotta go.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no. No!<eos> You want your daughter to live?<eos> - You wanna live?<eos> - She's in there right now.<eos> - Don't fight me.<eos> - She's in there right now!<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no, no. No!<eos> You want your daughter to live?<eos> - You wanna live?<eos> - She's in there right now.<eos> - Don't fight me.<eos> - She's in there right now!<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No... you can't do this!<eos> You can't do this!
- Don't fight me.<eos> - She's in there right now!<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No... you can't do this!<eos> You can't do this!<eos> It's not supposed to happen this way!<eos> It's not suppo...<eos> It's not supposed to happen this way!<eos> What are you gonna do about my daughter?
No... you can't do this!<eos> You can't do this!<eos> It's not supposed to happen this way!<eos> It's not suppo...<eos> It's not supposed to happen this way!<eos> What are you gonna do about my daughter?<eos> It's not supposed to happen this way!<eos> - Wait, where's Bryan?<eos> - We gotta go back!<eos> You got... they're gonna kill her, you bastards!
Zero, this is Bravo.<eos> Got a cleanup situation back here.<eos> Moving out now... loading dock.<eos> Okay... _<eos> Charles Solitzki... hang on...<eos> Ex-cop... Milwaukee PD... And brother of Tom Solitzki.<eos> - Know who that is?<eos> - Chief of security at Ingersol Pharmaceuticals.<eos> If she's dead, it's on you.<eos> So you just wanna give up?
- How far are we going?<eos> - Cuff your wrists to the bar.<eos> - Oh, okay...<eos> Not too far.<eos> - On site?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ETA.<eos> All good.<eos> Yeah, we got it.<eos> You got the code?
Dad!<eos> Dad, I'm up here!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Help!<eos> Dad, help!<eos> Dad!<eos> Someone help me!<eos> No, please... don't run away from me this time.<eos> - Are you a friend of...
SHV-9876 Sangravan is known to accelerate pulmonary embolism, and/or CVA... cerebrovascular accident... " Which, in plain English, means stroke...<eos> Some of the cases were more or less immediate, and for others, the side effects accumulated over time.<eos> It's all here.<eos> Defense Department reports on Sangravan mention none of this.<eos> Then that's an internal issue in defense that needs to be resolved.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, Madam Secretary?<eos> - I would.<eos> - In the meantime, we now have the head of the snake.<eos> We are now outside the Corporate Headquarters of Ingersol Pharmaceuticals, where federal agents have made multiple arrests of senior management.<eos> Would you give us an answer?
You didn't have to do that.<eos> How I was raised.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Shepherd's pie?<eos> Hope I got it right.<eos> How did you, uh...<eos> - How... how did you know?<eos> - Your mother.<eos> That a problem?<eos> What else do you two talk about?
You got a minute?<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I've been briefed.<eos> You also need to know I think this whole move is a cartel play to free mejia.<eos> Based on what?<eos> I don't have the link, but I know mejia.<eos> I think they're gonna try and take him.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but we've gone over this with white gloves... There's no cartel link here.<eos> Or we haven't found it yet. They probably got someone in here right now with eyes on us.<eos> Mills, I brought in four of my best agents, and you brought in yours.

They probably got someone in here right now with eyes on us.<eos> Mills, I brought in four of my best agents, and you brought in yours.<eos> We are prepped for all eventualities.<eos> I'd also like to see the convoy configuration and route maps.<eos> All those will be made available tomorrow morning...<eos> but if we vet them now, we can still make changes.<eos> Odni is here to support the FBI, not the other way around.<eos> I understand that, ma'am, but we do have a history with the detainee.<eos> Which is why you're no longer responsible for him.

So then I fired the second bullet.<eos> You're a coward.<eos> You failed her, Bryan.<eos> How does that feel?<eos> Your life ended the moment you took hers.<eos> You will always be my prisoner.<eos> - Agent salt.<eos> - Keep your voice down.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> You found the problem?
My husband's been taken.<eos> They want me to divert mejia to an airstrip.<eos> They're going to fly him out.<eos> If I don't, they're going to kill my husband.<eos> You know they will.<eos> You got to go to martello no.<eos> They'll be watching for that.<eos> Well, they're gonna be watching me too.<eos> That's why I put distance between us.<eos> You could have gone to hart, or anyone.

Listen up, everyone.<eos> Our odni friends and I are in the Van with mejia.<eos> FBI team will be in the follow vehicle... whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> I thought FBI was taking mejia.<eos> No, I want you guys focused on possible external threats.<eos> Let them do the babysitting.<eos> You're supposed to be lead on this.<eos> Don't let them push you around.<eos> They're not.<eos> You ready?
He's on the move.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> We know you set up George salt.<eos> Got him to work early for a meeting that didn't exist.<eos> Listen, they said if people start to ask questions, not to say anything, and if I did, they would kill me.<eos> And George.<eos> Please, they're watching.<eos> - I don't know exactly, but they are.<eos> No one's seen you here.<eos> Look, you don't understand... look, we got to move fast before someone does see you.
This is hart.<eos> Any news?<eos> Working on some leads.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Possible location?<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You there?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You'll be approaching the diversion point in less than five minutes.
- He's alive!<eos> - You believe that?<eos> They always lie.<eos> He's got him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Salt, your husband is safe.<eos> Ask him!<eos> Ask him what we had for dinner at our wedding.<eos> You didn't have a wedding.<eos> You eloped.
Elena morales.<eos> She grew up in Mexico.<eos> San cristóbal de las casas.<eos> Same town as mejia.<eos> Get me an address.<eos> 26 tivoli college park.<eos> Hi.<eos> Got your rug.<eos> Where do you want it?<eos> You must have the wrong address.
All he's gonna care about now is getting her back.<eos> So we have to stop him.<eos> For his own good.<eos> There's some people say I should go on one of them singing shows.<eos> - You should.<eos> - Maybe I will.<eos> Who knows?<eos> What about you? Any hidden talents?<eos> I can cook.<eos> If you don't mind me asking, you in some kind of trouble?
Who knows?<eos> What about you? Any hidden talents?<eos> I can cook.<eos> If you don't mind me asking, you in some kind of trouble?<eos> Someone took my girlfriend.<eos> To Texas?<eos> Maybe.<eos> This is one of my favorites.<eos> Hey.<eos> I hope you find her.
- You saying he's a rat?<eos> - Then he's a dead man.<eos> - Not if he gets across the border.<eos> He runs all of his southwestern shipment through you.<eos> So who else does he know down here in Texas?<eos> This image is from an FBI surveillance camera<eos> - almost an hour ago.<eos> - What's he doing in Texas?<eos> He's trying to stop Mejia from crossing the border.<eos> You sent him down there?
He's trying to stop Mejia from crossing the border.<eos> You sent him down there?<eos> We've been watching that place ever since Mejia gave up Lester last month.<eos> Rein him in before he ruins any more of our operations.<eos> What's the priority here? Finding Mejia and the hostage or busting some mid-level dealer?<eos> Not the point.<eos> Our interests are the same as yours.<eos> If Bryan can bring us any closer to Mejia...<eos> He's a loose canon and he's done, so tie him down before I do.<eos> You people are finished with Mejia.
Just another casualty of the war on drugs.<eos> Smart.<eos> Simple. Bryan's on his way to El Paso.<eos> He's gotta be.<eos> - Where is he now?<eos> - Angleton, Texas. - How far to El Paso?<eos> - It's about a five-hour drive.<eos> Standby with the jet.<eos> Mr. Mills?<eos> You killed my son, Mr. Mills.

Mr. Mills?<eos> You killed my son, Mr. Mills.<eos> What can you possibly have to say to me?<eos> - Your husband...<eos> - Ex-husband.<eos> I know what he is.<eos> Who he is. And just how long did it take you to see that?<eos> What do you want?<eos> He's trying to get across to Mexico, but his network's broken.<eos> He can no longer trust his own people. And you think I still want to help him?

If praying were the answer, you would be doing what you do.

You stay behind.<eos> Make sure nobody else comes through.<eos> Okay.<eos> Welcome to Mexico.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> We come in peace.<eos> - I'm not going back.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> We never met.<eos> - Did you hear what I just said?
They're right there on the other side of that tunnel.<eos> Every minute we wait, we waste.<eos> - So let me go.<eos> - We can't do that.<eos> So another innocent person will die, and Mejia wins again.<eos> Is that really who we are?<eos> 'Cause if so, I quit.<eos> You're...<eos> You're damn right I don't have a choice.<eos> Look, I know this all started because of me, so I won't think less of anyone of you if you choose not to come do this, but you are not stopping me, and you know it.
- Stop!<eos> - They're taking her.<eos> She's alive.<eos> Think.<eos> - We're outgunned and outnumbered.<eos> - Buddy, if she's alive now, he doesn't want her dead.<eos> Yet.<eos> Hart.<eos> We're with him now.<eos> - You're on the way back?
- Excuse me?<eos> - We need your help.<eos> Your mission was to bring him in,<eos> - not to go to Mexico.<eos> - Give me the phone.<eos> Thanks John.<eos> That day when you recruited me,<eos> - you remember that?<eos> - Bryan...<eos> You gave me that whole speech about what I was born to do.
You did not get this from me, and I need your word on that.<eos> I understand the drill.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> - Easy, easy now. - Whoa.<eos> If you'll allow him.<eos> Lower your gun, please.<eos> Tell them to leave.<eos> We've got business.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Why are you here?
Tell them to leave.<eos> We've got business.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> - Need a favor.<eos> Listen, lady, I don't know who told you what, but this...<eos> Is an FBI undercover operation.<eos> Yes, we're aware.<eos> And we know FBI has no authority to be here.<eos> So what do you want?
He's a U.S. government agent.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Move back!<eos> Stand down.<eos> Stand down.<eos> I'm sorry about Bryan Mills.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> Your people got in the way of a Mexican government operation.<eos> That you called in when you thought we'd succeeded

You want the truth?<eos> Your people got in the way of a Mexican government operation.<eos> That you called in when you thought we'd succeeded<eos> - where you had failed.<eos> - It was the right move.<eos> And I happen to know the Security Council will see it that way.<eos> Your man made a mockery of international law.<eos> To save a hostage.<eos> To rid the world of a monster.<eos> So you approve of what he did?

Radio silence.<eos> He's just...<eos> What happened at the SSC?<eos> Are they looking for Bryan?<eos> They don't wanna even acknowledge him.<eos> They just want the whole thing to go away.<eos> So what,<eos> - didn't happen?<eos> - It wouldn't be the first time.<eos> - You all know that.
- It wouldn't be the first time.<eos> - You all know that.<eos> - He could be alive.<eos> We should have gone back right then.<eos> - We made the wrong call.<eos> - I made the call.<eos> It's on me.<eos> We all know how this works.<eos> I could have lost all of you, and that would have been unacceptable.<eos> You weren't going back in there.
If he's there, someone...<eos> Someone is making a move from the north...<eos> Someone who needs a lot of firepower.<eos> Have you ever met him up there?<eos> Yes. I met him there once before.<eos> Where?<eos> _<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> I'd like Montreal.<eos> And you miss being in the field?
- Did he just sacrifice himself for...<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> Damn it, Bryan.<eos> They got him.<eos> They took Bryan.<eos> Tomas Vitek.<eos> Where's Vitek?<eos> Who?<eos> Reality check.<eos> The problem with you Green Berets is someone told you you're special, and you bought it. Rule number one...
_<eos> We already met, numbnuts.<eos> We know all about you, Tomas, from Carlos Mejia.<eos> That's right.<eos> - I don't know where they took him.<eos> - I don't believe that.<eos> Not everyone is as weak as Carlos Mejia.<eos> So you do know.<eos> Where did they take him?<eos> What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Clean him, feed him, hydrate him, get some clothes on him.<eos> _<eos> What is this?<eos> I told you to clean him up and take care of him.<eos> Go get him something warm to wear.<eos> Take his cuffs off, please.<eos> The good cop is the closer.<eos> He wants you to believe, to hope... That he's the only one that can bring you back from the brink... It's all right.<eos> The only one that can save you...<eos> That all he needs for that to happen is the truth, which you and he both know has to come out at some point because no man can last forever, and you've done your duty by lasting this long...
I shouldn't even be here right now.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You might have a point.<eos> About what?<eos> This not being right.<eos> Get away from the window.<eos> We can't get taken. Not with what we know about Yuri.<eos> What if it's Yuri who set us up?<eos> You are surrounded!<eos> We know you are CIA!
An Asset? From the SVR, Russia's Intelligence Service.<eos> Yuri.<eos> He wanted to defect?<eos> And what is Yuri's particular value?<eos> He claims to know the identity and allegiance of over 300 Russian agents in the United States.<eos> - And who recruited him to defect?<eos> - I did. For how long?<eos> The last 14 months.<eos> - So why...<eos> - I'm sorry. So why weren't you in Keykino to meet him?

Take this.<eos> She gave it to me.<eos> Does Tatjana speak any English?<eos> Yes, yes, she speaks it well.<eos> - Can I tell you something?<eos> - We gotta move.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Becca.<eos> Please... Don't hurt her.<eos> You all know Brant Pope, Divisional Director of Eastern Europe.
- Becca.<eos> Please... Don't hurt her.<eos> You all know Brant Pope, Divisional Director of Eastern Europe.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Bravo and Victor are in position.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yuri's outside.<eos> Okay?<eos> Are you the CIA?
- Anything I should know?<eos> You guys figure that out yet?<eos> You gotta turn the power on first.<eos> You all right?<eos> Where's this Mook at?<eos> False alarm?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Please. Let me go to her.<eos> Why didn't you tell us she was pregnant?<eos> I didn't think that you would go and rescue her.

She hates him.<eos> He... he beats her for no reason.<eos> Can you imagine what a man like that would do to her if he found out that the baby isn't his?
- What happened in Srebrenica?<eos> - Nothing good.<eos> You got your SVR card on you, Yuri?<eos> Zero, this is Victor. On final approach to airfield now.<eos> Contact.<eos> Ambush. Son of a bitch.<eos> The Russian military was waiting for us on the bird.<eos> You want to really know what happened in Srebrenica?<eos> We hunted down a mole.<eos> Where did you find them?

Then there's a near miss at Colonel Kuznikov's. Then there's the fiasco at the safe house that you gave us.<eos> You broke into my house and my home computer. - And you planted these files.
We know.<eos> What?<eos> Give us the room, please, Gretchen.<eos> Sit down, Brant.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Sir.<eos> - I am the Divisional Director...<eos> If Gretchen sold out her own officers, then why not give up Yuri too?<eos> See, that doesn't make any sense, which means whoever gave up those guys didn't yet know Yuri's identity.<eos> You just found reams of secret CIA communiqués in her home.
Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town.<eos> From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world...<eos> Safe.<eos> Decent.<eos> Innocent.<eos> Get closer, though, and you start seeing the shadows underneath.
- Smithers!<eos> Oh, you are a sight for sore eyes.<eos> - How was the ride?<eos> - No traffic, thank God.<eos> Smithers, I'd like to introduce you to my daughter, Veronica.<eos> - It's a pleasure, miss.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I'll get the bags.<eos> - Would you?<eos> Oh, and would you like some menus, ma'am, so you can order in?
Building character?<eos> Do you want a ride?<eos> Ms. Grundy. Ms. Grundy.<eos> Geraldine.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?<eos> Can we talk, Ms. Grundy, please?<eos> It depends.<eos> About what?<eos> Music.<eos> You're the music teacher.
Hey, I should go.<eos> I got that meeting with Grundy and then football tryouts, so.<eos> You play football, too?<eos> What don't you do?<eos> Before you ask, Blue Jasmine, no, she has not invited him to the dance yet...<eos> Not yet, and don't talk about Archie.<eos> Veronica Lodge, I'd heard whisperings.<eos> I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?<eos> Betty, would you mind?<eos> So, what are you three hens gossiping about?
My handle is @cherylbombshell.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go ahead and hate on cheerleading, but if Hipster Prince Harry...<eos> I'd love to be a cheerleader.<eos> It would look great on my college applications.<eos> But last year, when I tried out,<eos> Cheryl said I was too fat.<eos> "Too season 5 Betty Draper."<eos> It was a great line, but not at all true.<eos> Well, you're a total smoke show now.
As hot and as smart as you are, you should be the Queen Bey of this drab hive.<eos> Look, if you want to be a River Vixen, I'll help you prep. I have moves.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Show me your moves.<eos> They're...<eos> Very real, very personal.<eos> I took your advice and wrote them down.<eos> Polished them.<eos> But I was wondering maybe if you could help me...
Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Show me your moves.<eos> They're...<eos> Very real, very personal.<eos> I took your advice and wrote them down.<eos> Polished them.<eos> But I was wondering maybe if you could help me...<eos> With what, Archie?<eos> You went to Juilliard, Ms. Grundy.
I think you should pursue your music, but not with me.<eos> We're blue!<eos> And go!<eos> We're dynamite!<eos> We'll take you down, and fight the fight!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Go, Bulldogs!<eos> Ladies, where's the heat?<eos> Where's the sizzle?<eos> Well, you haven't seen our big finish yet.
We're dynamite!<eos> We'll take you down, and fight the fight!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Go, Bulldogs!<eos> Ladies, where's the heat?<eos> Where's the sizzle?<eos> Well, you haven't seen our big finish yet.<eos> Don't freak out. Just trust me.<eos> Check your sell-by date, ladies, faux lesbian kissing hasn't been taboo since 1994.<eos> So let's see if you do better with the interview portion of our audition.
And I won't tell anyone anything, but you need to help me.<eos> This summer, the only thing that kept me sane was writing these songs.<eos> So here's my not-so-indecent proposal.<eos> I want to do an independent study with you, as many mornings a week as you can spare, and I swear that's all it'll be.<eos> And I won't tell anyone about July Fourth, ever.<eos> Deal?<eos> Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 7:30 a.m., before first period.<eos> I'll set it up and see about getting you credit.<eos> Goodevening,friends.<eos> Are you all having a good time?
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> This story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious death of Jason Blossom on the 4th of July.<eos> - Can we talk, Ms. Grundy? - About what?<eos> You're the music eacher, can we talk about music?
There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.<eos> So let me state clearly, it is happening, as scheduled.<eos> Now, on a less felicitous note, if you could give your attention to Sheriff Keller.<eos> Most of you already know the details, but your classmate Jason Blossom's body was found late Saturday night.<eos> So as of the weekend, Jason's death is now being treated as a homicide.<eos> It is an open and ongoing investigation.<eos> And may I interject, neither I nor my parents will rest until Jason's death is avenged, and his cold-hearted killer is walking the green mile to sit in Old Sparky and fry.<eos> I, for one, have my suspicions. #RiverdaleStrong.<eos> If you know anything that could help us find and apprehend Jason's killer, or anything about what happened to him on July 4th, I strongly urge you to come forward immediately.<eos> You can speak with me or Principal Weatherbee.
Archie.<eos> This summer, we were supposed to go on a road trip over July 4th weekend...<eos> Which you bailed on at the last minute.<eos> Is there something you wanna tell me, pal?<eos> We were wondering, Cheryl.<eos> Back in July, you told the po-po that Jason drowned.<eos> Yet, we come to find out that Jason didn't drown.<eos> He was shot.<eos> That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?
And my twintuition is telling me it's someone we all know.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I'm not great at science, but I can take point on this if it's too weird for you.<eos> Weird, why?<eos> Oh, you mean because my brother is being dissected with a blade, just like this one, possibly at this very moment?<eos> Don't worry, I'm fine.<eos> In fact, I'm amazing.<eos> Every corpse has as tale to tell.<eos> Step closer to the body.<eos> There are several morbid details you should find relevant to your article.
I thought I could pretend this weekend didn't happen, but...<eos> "I can't give you the answer you want."<eos> That's what you said to me.<eos> And that's how I feel right now, I'm sorry.<eos> Betty.<eos> Mr. Andrews.<eos> If we could have a word in private.<eos> You're in a very good place right now, Mr. Andrews.<eos> Varsity football, AP music tutorials.<eos> This morning, in the hallway, you wouldn't meet my eyes.
Which is why...<eos> We...<eos> You...<eos> Can't go to Weatherbee.<eos> If you do that, we will never see each other again.<eos> Archie,<eos> I'm putting myself in your hands.<eos> Stand down, Vixens.<eos> And listen up.<eos> The weather's predicting a downpour the night of the rally, but already, you're raining on my parade.
He may not be crushing on you, but he does love you.<eos> And he's legit miserable without you, if it's any consolation.<eos> My mom says sometimes a friend is better than a boyfriend.<eos> Maybe this is one of those times.<eos> And Sheriff Keller's grilling me, Mantle the Magnificent.<eos> 'Cause I'd want Blossom dead.<eos> When he was, like, the only good quarterback we had.<eos> And speaking of offensive tight-ends, I should've sent the cops to you, Moose.<eos> Because here's another unsolved mystery.<eos> What exactly were you and Kevin doing at the river, huh?
Like...<eos> After?<eos> It's called necrophilia, Reggie, can you spell it?<eos> Come here, you little...<eos> Hey shut the hell up, Reggie.<eos> Boys.<eos> What do you care, Andrews?<eos> Nothing, just leave him alone.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Did you and Donnie Darko kill him together?
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.<eos> It is heartening to see so many of you here, even in weather like this.<eos> But a lack of heart and school spirit has never been the Riverdale way.<eos> Tonight's pep rally isn't like any other we've had in the past.<eos> And we shouldn't pretend that it is.<eos> Which is why I would like to dedicate this evening to the memory of one of our brightest.<eos> Jason Blossom.<eos> We're with him tonight.<eos> Now please, join me in welcoming to the field our very own River Vixens, and their special guest stars, my daughter, Josie and her Pussycats!<eos> All right, you all ready?
- Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Betty...<eos> Can we make a vow?<eos> Sure.<eos> That no matter what, no boy will ever come between us again.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> Do you guys want to join us?<eos> Yes, but only if you're treating.
Jughead Jones, the third.<eos> To someone on the outside, peering in, it would've looked like there were four people in that booth.<eos> But I was there, and I can tell you.<eos> Really, there were only three.<eos> A blonde girl, a raven-haired girl, and the luckiest red-headed boy in tin universe.<eos> For one shining moment, we were just kids.<eos> Those bright neon lights of Pop's keeping the darkness at bay.<eos> Giving way, as all nights must, to a morning of reckonings.<eos> We're reviewing new systems of human biology starting with...<eos> You're here for me, aren't you?
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom on the 4th of July.<eos> - Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?<eos> - About what?<eos> You're the music teacher. Can we talk about music?
Okay great! Um, in that case, I have your first assignment.<eos> There's one person who was at the river on July 4th that no one's talking about.<eos> - Dilton Doiley and his Scouts.<eos> Hey. I texted.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Football practice.<eos> Then I was writing.<eos> Songs?<eos> Your music?<eos> I thought you and Jughead were on a road trip on the 4th.
May I try a blue cheese slider, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> Hey, you're the music teacher at the high school, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hi, I'm Fred Andrews, Archie's dad.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Penelope?<eos> Clifford?<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you holding up?
Of course.<eos> Hey, you're the music teacher at the high school, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hi, I'm Fred Andrews, Archie's dad.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Penelope?<eos> Clifford?<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> How do you think?
He has talent.<eos> Unquestionably.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> He is coming to it late.<eos> And he's got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> And there's an entire world of competition out there.<eos> Will he be able to make a living at it?<eos> It'd be a shame if he didn't at least try.<eos> ♪ Nothing can shake her... ♪ You know, I gotta ask you.<eos> What made you take such an interest in my son?
Archie?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I wanted to thank you for talking to my dad.<eos> I meant what I told him.<eos> I think it could really happen for you.<eos> So...<eos> Does this mean we can start our lessons back up again?<eos> We crave absolutes.<eos> They comfort us, but life is infinitely more complex than that.<eos> If you publish a story saying I fired that gun, my life will be ruined.
Riverdale, every day that passes, is becoming more like Salem during the witch trials.<eos> And meanwhile, the girl next door, our friendly neighborhood Hitchcock blonde, Betty Cooper, was wrestling with the knowledge that her best friend, Archie Andrews, was caught up in a forbidden romance.<eos> "Dear Diary, Sheriff Keller doesn't know what I know, that Riverdale High's music teacher, Geraldine Grundy, was at Sweetwater River the morning Jason Blossom went missing, and that since Archie was also there, they could have been there together."<eos> She is incredible.<eos> She's the best.<eos> I'm usually more of a classic rock kind of guy, but that was beautiful.<eos> Truly.<eos> Congratulations, Ms. Grundy.<eos> Thank you, both of you for coming.<eos> No, you kidding?

I'll see you at school, Ms. Grundy.<eos> Let's go, Dad.<eos> Well, I was thinkin' that, you know, if you're gonna be alone tonight, that we could take you out to dinner.

No, I...<eos> No, I couldn't impose.<eos> After everything you've done for my son, I... You know, with his music, it's the least I can do. I insist.
I have a strong inkling, and no.<eos> Also, I'd let it go.<eos> Yes, but you're you, and I'm me.<eos> You do you, girl, I'll be back.<eos> What was it like before she got here?<eos> I honestly cannot remember.<eos> It's not what you're thinking.<eos> So, it's platonic?<eos> Okay, well, maybe it's a little like - what you're thinking... - Archie.<eos> Are you and Ms. Grundy, like, together, like, romantically?
I'm kidding. But maybe she has a point.<eos> What do you see happening with Grundy, long-term?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to be with her.<eos> I don't know how, but I wanna hang on to what we have for as long as possible.<eos> Yup. I feel that.<eos> Trying to hold on to something a lot older than me, too.<eos> Just...<eos> Thank you for taking the time, Ms. Grundy.<eos> Like I said, the Blue and Gold is doing a series of articles spotlighting teachers, and you're our first.

I was just mostly on the road.<eos> But you've taught at other schools, I'm assuming?<eos> Oh, yeah. Of course.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> Um...<eos> Can I get their names?<eos> Seaside High,<eos> Centreville High.<eos> What made you leave?
- Right.<eos> Um...<eos> Can I get their names?<eos> Seaside High,<eos> Centreville High.<eos> What made you leave?<eos> They were temporary placements.<eos> Just filling in for maternity, sabbatical, things like that.<eos> This is my first permanent position.<eos> Getting back to music, you're working with Archie Andrews on an independent study.
Cheryl showed me a picture.<eos> You were standing behind Pop's with a Southside Serpent.<eos> Those guys are thugs.<eos> What were you doing?<eos> First off, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> Come here, sit.<eos> Now, remember Veronica, I grew up here.<eos> The Southside Serpents may be from the wrong side of the tracks, but I went to high school with some of them.<eos> I was just being polite.<eos> Cheryl said it looked like you were arguing.
That's a very sweet sentiment, Mr. Jones.<eos> But the future of Riverdale is at stake.<eos> Ms. Grundy showed up in Riverdale a year ago, out of thin air.<eos> There's no record of her before that.<eos> Her Facebook, her Linkedln account, they were all created one year ago.<eos> Before that, she's a ghost.<eos> She doesn't exist.<eos> The only Geraldine Grundy I could find was a woman who died seven years ago.<eos> How...<eos> Where did you find all this?
- You were in her car?<eos> - Yeah, and thank God we were.<eos> - We found a gun. - What?<eos> And an ID with the name Jennifer Gibson.<eos> This is proof Ms. Grundy is not who she says she is.<eos> Then who is she?<eos> Obviously some sketch-queen named Jennifer Gibson.<eos> Archie, what if she had something to do with Jason's murder?<eos> She taught him, she made you lie about him, we know she was at the river, she has a gun.<eos> So does Dilton Doiley, but you never thought he killed Jason.
So does Dilton Doiley, but you never thought he killed Jason.<eos> Open your eyes, Archie.<eos> Jason was her student last year.<eos> Everything about her is a huge, boldfaced question mark.<eos> Okay, whatever her name is, she's not a killer.<eos> You didn't ask her, did you?<eos> About her name?<eos> And why there's no record of her before last year?<eos> Why not?<eos> Mayor McCoy says you won the contract to tear down the drive-in.
Why not?<eos> Mayor McCoy says you won the contract to tear down the drive-in.<eos> I did.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Jughead.<eos> I know how much you love the Twilight, and so do I...<eos> Mr. Andrews, just give me one week to track down the person who bought the land, and convince them not to demolish a holy house of cinema.<eos> It's a big contract for me, Jug, and for my guys.<eos> Whatever they build in the place of the drive-in could mean more jobs... Yeah, in what?<eos> Some hypothetical future?<eos> You put one Jones out of work, why don't you put out another, huh?

Not ont for your sake, but Ms. Grundy's.<eos> Is this really what's best for her?<eos> I am gonna deal with this, but on my terms, not yours.<eos> Good day, Ms. Hermione.<eos> From the dry cleaners.<eos> Ah, thank you, Smithers.<eos> And Fred Andrews is escorting me to the drive-in, so all the pieces are in place.<eos> - The drive-in with Fred Andrews? - Yes.<eos> An attractive woman going with an old friend is less conspicuous than an old crone going alone.<eos> You're not an old crone, Ms. Hermione.
That hair.<eos> That jacket.<eos> Jason always adored the drive-in.<eos> Southside trash.<eos> They've been doing that since the opening credits.<eos> Shh!<eos> - Screw off!<eos> - Nice haircut, you dweeb.<eos> Hey!<eos> You know what happens to a snake when a Louis Vuitton heel steps on it?
Who am I trying to impress?<eos> We're out of dogs.<eos> Figures.<eos> Not so tough without your beard, huh?<eos> Where's the rest of it?<eos> The rest of it?<eos> It was my understanding that that was the agreed-upon amount.<eos> In that case, maybe we need to have a word with your husband.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> As long as Hiram's in jail, you'll be dealing with me.
But that's what you think we should do?<eos> Don't you?<eos> So, that bow is a goodbye gift?<eos> It's a see-you-around-the-halls gift.<eos> A don't-forget-me gift.<eos> That is hardly likely.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> There they are. What did I tell you?<eos> Can someone tell me what's going on here?<eos> Of course. Archie, would you like to share with us what you and Mrs. Robinson have been doing during your "music lesson"?
I want you see what kind of person Archie truly is.<eos> Wait a minute, that is what this is about?<eos> Your crazy grudge against my teenage son?<eos> I'm never going to stop being friends with Archie, Mom. - Ever.<eos> - We are done here.<eos> - Oh, we are far from being done here.<eos> - Stop. - Shut up.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Please.<eos> You're right, Mrs. Cooper. You're right.

People with grudges against us, many of them members of Riverdale's founding families, I'm sorry to say.<eos> Someone in this town killed Jason.<eos> You know, that's our thought, too.<eos> Since whoever broke into my house knew that I'd be at the drive-in.<eos> Which means, there's a very real possibility Jason's murderer will soon be in this room.<eos> That's why you've invited the Lodges and everyone else?<eos> To investigate them?<eos> And you think I'm manipulative and heartless and making this all about myself?<eos> I think it's great what you guys are doing for Jason.<eos> You two were on the water polo team together.
- Yeah, I'm Fred.<eos> - Dad, this is Val.<eos> Val, my dad.<eos> Val.<eos> Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Val.<eos> Valerie.<eos> Right, Josie and the Pussycats.<eos> Oh, I'm a big fan.<eos> I... Yeah, I saw you guys at Taste of Riverdale.<eos> And you were rocking hard.
Got to pace yourself, Hal.<eos> Be very unseemly to get a DUI on your way home.<eos> Wouldn't you think?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Welcome to Thornhill.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> If you'll kindly take your seats.<eos> I'd like to start the memorial with a few words about Jason.<eos> You are only going to make things worse.
Take the jersey.<eos> I... can't.<eos> I can't, Coach.<eos> I love playing football, but your starting line-up deserves a captain whose only love is football.<eos> Someone like Reggie.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> What?<eos> You're quitting on me, Andrews?<eos> No, and I really hope you don't cut me, Coach.
I don't want to be the guy that broke up The Beatles.<eos> In your heart, you're a Pussycat.<eos> You'll always be a Pussycat.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But singing backup with no vote, no agency...<eos> - Well, after meeting Josie's dad...<eos> - Myles is in town?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why she's been acting like Catzilla.<eos> I'm betting you can negotiate new terms.
Well, if you freeze out there, Red Troubadour, just focus on someone that makes you feel safe.<eos> - Here's Archie Andrews!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Go.<eos> Stick to football!<eos> Sheriff Keller.<eos> I got your text.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Look, it's Jason's jacket.<eos> - Where'd you get that?
I always do.<eos> I saw you, Mom.<eos> With Fred Andrews.<eos> Two signatures are needed to award the contract.<eos> Sorry, Mom, but no.<eos> I don't want any part of it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> That SoDale contract?<eos> Awarded to Andrew's Construction.<eos> Looks like you won.
Jason's baby is a game-changer.<eos> We're all on the same team now.<eos> - Oh, how was your first day back?<eos> - Oh, it was great.<eos> Your dad is the hardest-working guy on the crew, as always.<eos> Oh, in that case, why don't we celebrate to mark the occasion?<eos> Yeah, Juggy and I were thinking the four of us could have dinner or something.<eos> Uh, tonight?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I'm game if you're game.
Like I was nothing.<eos> Damn, Hoss, you're good.<eos> Way better than your dad.<eos> Hey, does Fred keep any beer in there?<eos> Uh... Dad, don't you think it's a little late?<eos> Kinda...<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> You know, I got a big day tomorrow anyway.<eos> Hey, Mr. Jones, before you go,

- Yeah.<eos> Earlier tonight, you said my dad owed you.<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> Hey, Archie, why don't we quit while we're ahead?<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean, it's just a question.<eos> Did something happen between you two?<eos> It's ancient history, but your dad and me, we...<eos> We started Andrews Construction together.<eos> You and my dad were partners?
"Attempting to burn down Riverdale Elementary School."<eos> I was playing with matches, and that's a pretty tenuous connection for a sheriff.<eos> Well, Principal Weatherbee also allowed me to have a look at your school records.<eos> You have a long and rough history, Mr. Jones.<eos> Bullied a lot.<eos> Yeah, my name is Jughead.<eos> By the football team, in particular.<eos> I can only assume that would have included Jason Blossom.<eos> So how about this?<eos> How about you tell me your whereabouts on the week of July 11th?

One of Jason's teammates said that before he ran away,<eos> Jason was dealing drugs.<eos> Making a one-time delivery.<eos> He needed... We needed money.<eos> To get away and to start over.<eos> So Riverdale's star football player becomes a drug mule?<eos> He went to a bar on the other side of the tracks and made a deal with some biker gang.<eos> The Serpents?<eos> He got an address upstate, where he was supposed to deliver the drugs in exchange for cash.<eos> The drugs you found in Jason's car...
It's like Archie and I are just roommates in a college dorm.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> What does that make me, the RA?<eos> No, you're the third roommate.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> I got a big day tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, breaking ground on the SoDale project, right?<eos> Yeah. Indeed, we are.<eos> Sorry, 'cause I know it's kind of a sore spot with you, Jughead, about the drive-in.<eos> As long as you build something beautiful in its place.
What happened?<eos> Cliff Blossom reached out.<eos> Says he's got a big job coming up.<eos> Says he needs us free and available.<eos> Blossom's willing to guarantee us two years' work, starting now.<eos> Can't ask my guys to turn down that kind of money.<eos> No, Vic, I can't.<eos> Sorry, Fred.<eos> Sheriff Keller told us everything.<eos> How you're hiding Polly at the Pembrooke?
I can't break ground without a crew, so every day I'm just hemorrhaging cash.<eos> We've got equipment sitting there, supplies, bills that are past due.<eos> Dad, why didn't you tell me?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> It was never supposed to get this bad.<eos> You work your ass off to build something, and in one false step you could lose everything.<eos> No, Dad, you're not losing anything.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> A Baby Shower?<eos> You should that's a good idea.
Your dad's path is not for you.<eos> Trust me, I get it.<eos> He works his ass off for me, bro, but never asks for anything.<eos> Always has my back, even when I mess up.<eos> So if having his back means I gotta haul some rocks, then bring it on.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Your dad's got my back, too.<eos> More than some people.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Hey, guys, you were a life-saver today.
Maybe it was them.<eos> Pissed that they had to leave 'cause of this project.<eos> - Serpents?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When I worked at the drive-in, the Serpents never bugged me.<eos> Did you see any snake tattoos, anything on their jackets?<eos> It happened pretty fast.<eos> All right, I'll talk to Blossom, but I mean I don't think we'll get anywhere unless we can ID these guys.<eos> That is such bull.<eos> If this was Clifford Blossom asking for help, you would say yes.
Archie, back off.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> You like beating up teenagers?<eos> This isn't the first time one of you Bulldogs has come in here, looking to 'cause trouble.<eos> Hey!<eos> That's enough, Mustang. Let 'em go.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> Not you, Red, you stay.<eos> I'm good.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
Enough!<eos> Both of you!<eos> If you believe one lie...<eos> This is why Jason is dead!<eos> Because of this hate.<eos> This pointless, stupid fighting.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, don't touch me.<eos> We were supposed to be together.<eos> And you didn't let us have that, neither of you.
I promise you you'll never feel that way again.<eos> You want me to come home?<eos> More than anything, honey.<eos> Yeah, but what about Dad?<eos> Your father...<eos> Dad's just gonna have to get over it.<eos> Are you sure he's not just gonna try and make another appointment for me?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What appointment?<eos> Before you sent me away, Dad made an appointment for me to see a doctor.
Dad, Betty Cooper.<eos> Betty, this is my dad.<eos> Hi, Mr. Jones, nice to meet you, officially.<eos> And you, and you. Um...<eos> Why don't you guys sit down?<eos> This isn't really a social call.<eos> No. I didn't expect it would be after Archie showed up at the bar.<eos> We know the Serpents had some kind of drug thing going on with Jason Blossom.<eos> What?<eos> Where'd you hear that?
Where'd you hear that?<eos> - Jason's girlfriend.<eos> - My sister.<eos> The kid needed some money to get away.<eos> A clean-cut kid like that, no one's gonna suspect him of running, so we helped him, he helped us.<eos> Jeez, Dad. Did you tell the cops that?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, they know now. Polly told them.<eos> So if they haven't been by yet, they will be.<eos> Did you ever talk to Jason?
Uh-oh. Do we need to sit down?<eos> Okay, so, last year at Spence, my best friend Katy and I kind of terrorized this girl, Paige.<eos> One time, we made her drink gutter water.<eos> Ew!<eos> Why?<eos> Because she was there.<eos> Because she was a misfit and we were class-A brutal bitches.<eos> Anyway, by December,<eos> Paige couldn't take it anymore...<eos> Oh, my God, did you drive her to suicide?
Is that true?<eos> Did she tell you her Great-Uncle Harrison sits on the board of the Brandenburg Music Academy?<eos> They have an excellent summer program, I hear.<eos> It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.<eos> Surely not for a talent like you.<eos> And especially not if I put in a word on your behalf.<eos> Mrs. Blossom...<eos> At Jason's memorial, you brought me his football jersey.<eos> So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.<eos> I thought you might want to have this.
We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.<eos> You two make quite the pair.<eos> Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...<eos> But nothing.<eos> You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.<eos> He'll need a proper suit, don't you think, Daddy?<eos> I'll have my tailor fit you.<eos> If that's not a problem?<eos> No. No, no, it's just...<eos> I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom, like you said.

What girl is immune to the charms of a Givenchy bag?<eos> And I still wear these pearls he gave me.<eos> Okay, but...<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> Give me anything.<eos> I just want to be friends.<eos> Me, too, Ethel.<eos> Mr. Andrews!<eos> Nice haircut.<eos> You're looking extremely DILF-y today.
Fine, Hal.<eos> What?<eos> I want my daughter back, you bastard!<eos> Mom!<eos> Black piping for the velvet, of course.<eos> I'll take measurements for the pants.<eos> Uh, before we do that...<eos> Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?<eos> Things aren't going great at my dad's company.<eos> And I know you two have been at odds recently.

Maybe you could help my dad.
And it may not have been Jason's hand that staked the maple this year, but it was the hand of hope.<eos> Don't think they're being nice or genuine.<eos> They wanted me to fail at the tree-tapping.<eos> But you're going to help with all that.<eos> I'll do whatever I can.<eos> Archibald, have a word?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.<eos> You did?<eos> You will?
I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.<eos> You did?<eos> You will?<eos> Well, you've helped our family.<eos> Cheryl, especially.<eos> You fit in so well.<eos> I think you and your father have a very bright future with us.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Blossom.<eos> Oh. "Clifford", please.<eos> And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.
Weekdays, from 8:25 a.m. to 3:01 p.m., we adhere to a strict regimen.<eos> Everything in our lives controlled.<eos> But then something like the murder of Jason Blossom happens, and you realize there is no such thing as control.<eos> There is only chaos.<eos> Nevertheless, some of us strive to impose and maintain order in what is, fundamentally, an orderless world.<eos> A fact which would very soon be confirmed in ways none of us could have foreseen.<eos> I'm, uh...<eos> I'm headed out.<eos> Sorry to be missing your birthday this weekend, Jug.<eos> Oh, you will not be missing anything, Mr. Andrews,
This is between me and your mom.<eos> I'll check in.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Veronica, this is Paul Sowerberry, your father's attorney.<eos> He's here to prep us for our statements and help at your dad's hearing.<eos> Except, I told you, Mom, I'm not giving one.<eos> - Not one you'd want.<eos> - Just...<eos> You won't be asked any questions about your father's business arrangements.<eos> We just need you and your mother to speak to his character.

Come on. It'll be like old times.<eos> The Three Musketeers.<eos> Actually, Archie, there were four Musketeers.<eos> I'll see you later, Betty.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, this is Jones.<eos> Mr. Jones, hi, this is Betty Cooper.<eos> - Jughead's...<eos> - Girlfriend, yeah, I remember.<eos> Great, well, I'm calling because it's Jughead's birthday tomorrow, and I wanted to see if maybe you would come see a movie with us, maybe grab dinner?
Betty?<eos> Look, there's a lot I can't do, a lot I can't control.<eos> But I can damn well make sure my boyfriend has the best birthday of his life.<eos> Screw it. I'm with Betty.<eos> My dad's away. We can do it at my house.<eos> We could all use a good time.<eos> Now you're talking my language.<eos> It's gonna be epic.<eos> Mr. Jones, I didn't mean to ambush you.<eos> I know you don't do birthdays, but Archie and I are having a few of Jughead's friends over at Archie's house.

And you being there...<eos> That would be special.<eos> Great news, Betty.<eos> I just had a terrific meeting with Principal Weatherbee, who agrees that the Blue and Gold can benefit greatly from my professional guidance<eos> - as your new advisor.<eos> - That's great, Mom.<eos> So what are we working on?<eos> A list of supplies for Jughead's birthday party.<eos> You're really falling for this Jones boy, aren't you?<eos> Mom, when you and Dad started dating, did you tell him everything about yourself?
We live in a democratic society, Cheryl.<eos> Let's let the Vixens decide who's cherry on top.<eos> - Challenge accepted.<eos> - Great.<eos> All those for Cheryl?<eos> All those for Veronica?<eos> Never cross a Lodge.<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> You catatonic bimbos didn't even vote.<eos> So you stuttering sapheads are too dim to exercise your own rights, and you've got the combined vocabulary of a baked potato.
You're fired on all fronts.<eos> That's all. Shoo, bitches.<eos> - Hey, Dad, what's up?<eos> - Just checking in.<eos> I felt bad we didn't get the chance to talk more before I left.<eos> Yeah, well, you kind of shut me down, Dad.<eos> You seen Mom yet?<eos> No. We were gonna have dinner, but...<eos> - We decided it would be better to meet tomorrow morning, with the lawyers.<eos> Right. 'Cause things are so bad, you can't talk without a mediator.
Wanna team-up for a little destruction, Chuck?<eos> Mr. Sowerberry, let me tell you what I think happened.<eos> The Blossoms agreed to pay my family a fee in perpetuity.<eos> Clifford Blossom tried to end this agreement so he could stop paying my family after all these decades.<eos> And when my father, being my father, refused, it was Clifford who called the police and got him arrested.<eos> That's what I'm thinking.<eos> I can't confirm or deny...<eos> And the reason this hasn't come out yet is because it might make my Dad look like a murder suspect?<eos> That is our concern, yes.<eos> Have you changed your mind about making a statement?

It's just I would be happier if it was just the four of us in a booth at Pop's.<eos> Yeah. But we always do that.<eos> I wanted to do something special.<eos> "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."<eos> Why is everything so doom and gloom with you, Jug?<eos> Why can't it just be normal for once?<eos> I'm not normal, I'm not wired to be normal.<eos> How many more people did you invite to this thing?<eos> No one. Inner-circle only.<eos> Did you really think you could have a party without inviting moi?
In the middle of a Seth Rogen movie.<eos> This was Betty's idea, okay?<eos> I just went along with it.<eos> - It's so not me.<eos> - It doesn't matter, Jughead, you're her boyfriend now.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - It means you're getting your birthday party whether you want one or not.<eos> Dad, hey.<eos> Happy birthday, Jughead.<eos> How are you, Mr. Jones?
- Yeah.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I've been once or twice.<eos> Mmm, mmm, mmm.<eos> You can cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.<eos> What's up, Joaquin?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Kevin, you know FP, Jughead's dad?<eos> Yeah, we've met.<eos> You kicked me out of the Whyte Wyrm.
- Really.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And the plot thickens.<eos> Betty.<eos> - You here to roofie me again?<eos> - No, Chuck, I'm going to ask you to leave.<eos> - Nicely.<eos> - Nicely?<eos> Because, what, you're back to being the nice girl now?<eos> Betty, what you and Veronica did when you guys got me kicked off the football team, you ruined any chance I had of playing for Notre Dame.
This game is sick.<eos> - I wanna go next.<eos> - That's the spirit, Doiley.<eos> What secrets do you have to reveal to us?<eos> I saw Ms. Grundy's car by Sweetwater River, the day Jason went missing.<eos> I told Betty and Jughead, and then, Ms. Grundy quit her job and left Riverdale, like, two days later.<eos> And let's not forget that Archie was also at the Sweetwater that morning.<eos> Oh, my God, color me shocked, Archie Andrews.<eos> Is that why you became a mediocre musician overnight?<eos> Because you and Ms. Foureyes were pulling a Mary Kay Letourneau?
So Doiley's a psychopath, everyone knows that.<eos> Well, I guess it's my turn now.<eos> Boy, do I have a twisted secret to reveal.<eos> Starring Betty Cooper.<eos> Leave her the hell alone, Chuck.<eos> Shut up, Andrews.<eos> Look, you may get a free peepshow every night, but you do not know her.<eos> Hell, Betty doesn't even know herself.<eos> Everybody knows why I got suspended.<eos> But what you don't know...
She dressed up like a hooker, in a God-awful black wig, drugged me, handcuffed me in the Jacuzzi, and I almost drowned until she got me to say what she wanted to hear.<eos> And then she really lost it.<eos> She actually thought she was Polly.<eos> But, hey, you knew all about this, right, Jughead?<eos> Enough!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Get your hands off me, snake.<eos> Get out!<eos> Go on!<eos> What are you looking at?
♪ All hail ♪<eos> ♪ Our fair Riverdale ♪<eos> ♪ My heart rings true ♪<eos> People like to say that the death of Jason Blossom changed everything at Riverdale High.<eos> But certain things, certain traditions never change.<eos> Take Homecoming, for instance.<eos> Though Jason's jersey had been retired, the Riverdale Bulldogs would still be playing their arch-rivals, the Baxter High Ravens, with the River Vixens cheering them on.<eos> I'm just handing off some of my decorating duties to Ethel so I can keep focusing on the Blue and Gold.<eos> Unacceptable.<eos> You made a commitment, Ms. Cooper, you need to honor it.
Mind if I ask you a couple questions?<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> Why Jason Blossom, huh?<eos> Out of all the things you could write about, why pick a dead kid?<eos> I don't know. It was sort like he picked me.<eos> Tell the story that no one was gonna tell.<eos> Or even know how to tell.<eos> From the outside, looking in.<eos> Who do you think killed him?<eos> I mean, you and Betty are in this deep.
I don't regret anything we said, Veronica, or did.<eos> Me neither, but I think you might be boyfriend-worthy.<eos> I agree. Let's test that theory at the Homecoming Dance.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to explore anything with anyone right now.<eos> Well, in that case, what if we just finally get to sing that duet together?<eos> I kind of told my mom I was performing.<eos> Look, Archie, I'm sorry, but for a million reasons, we're going to have to pretend our moment never happened.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Oh, finally, close that door.<eos> Ladies, I need you to look around the room.
Mrs. Cooper?<eos> Yes?<eos> I understand why Betty doesn't want to get in the middle of this.<eos> But I don't feel the same loyalty for the Jones family that she does.<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> - Helping you find out the truth<eos> FP will help me find out the truth about my dad.<eos> And whether or not he hired FP to kill Jason.<eos> What exactly are you saying, Veronica?<eos> I'm saying, if you want to go after Jughead's dad, Mrs. Cooper, I'm in.
Happy to oblige if you are.<eos> I don't care what you think of me, Alice, but don't jerk me around.<eos> Not in front of my son.<eos> This was such a nice idea, Mom, but I think it's time that we get to the dance.<eos> So, is it okay if we skip the peach pie?<eos> What did you give her?<eos> Polly was so agitated, I gave her an all-natural relaxer.<eos> Nothing to hurt the babies, but she will sleep like a lamb till morning.<eos> Was that story true?<eos> About how you got the ring back?
You have been playing the same game since junior high and it was tired even back then.<eos> Fred is a big boy, he can do as he pleases.<eos> I came here tonight to have fun with both of my dates.<eos> So, if you have a problem with that...<eos> I have to take this.<eos> Hey, Kev...<eos> Have you seen Archie and Veronica?<eos> Oh, never mind, I see them.<eos> What the hell?<eos> There you are, Ms. Cooper.
- Would you walk me up?<eos> - I'm sorry. What?<eos> To the stage?<eos> Oh...<eos> Actually, Principal Weatherbee, will you do the honors?<eos> I have to... Go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where were you guys?<eos> We stopped... We stopped at Pop's.<eos> And what were you just talking to my mom about?
Excuse me.<eos> Where were you guys?<eos> We stopped... We stopped at Pop's.<eos> And what were you just talking to my mom about?<eos> - Betty...<eos> - Guys, can we table this?<eos> We gotta get ready.<eos> Come on.<eos> Friends, students and alumni.<eos> I hope you brought your dancing shoes.
You want to explain this?<eos> ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪<eos> So, Archie and Veronica are...<eos> We haven't exactly had the conversation, but the Magic 8-Ball says, "Yes."<eos> You Andrews men are such players.<eos> This is the first time I've brought a boyfriend to one of these things.<eos> This is the first time I've really had a boyfriend.<eos> Mostly it's been hook-ups with closeted guys.<eos> Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Have you seen Betty anywhere?
This is the first time I've really had a boyfriend.<eos> Mostly it's been hook-ups with closeted guys.<eos> Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Have you seen Betty anywhere?<eos> You all need tracking devices.<eos> I think she was headed out to the hall with Veronica and maybe Archie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Before you get mad, let me explain.<eos> Explain what?<eos> That you're working with my mom behind my back?
That you're working with my mom behind my back?<eos> I'm sorry, Bee, but you know FP had some kind of arrangement with my dad.<eos> I had to make sure it wasn't about Jason Blossom.<eos> And what's your excuse?<eos> I was looking out for Jughead in case FP was doing shady stuff.<eos> - To protect him.<eos> - Blame me, Betty.<eos> I asked Archie to help me.<eos> Help you do what?<eos> What did you two do?
- Why would you guys do that?<eos> - My mom put them up to it.<eos> She was convinced he was hiding something about Jason.<eos> We were wrong. All of us.<eos> We didn't find anything.<eos> And Jug, we were only doing it to prove that...<eos> That my dad wasn't a murderer?<eos> - You went behind my back, Archie?<eos> - Jug...<eos> How did you...
- It was. It was good enough.<eos> I didn't... I tried to stop her.<eos> You could've told me, you could've warned me about this.<eos> You were so excited, Jug, I didn't want to disappoint you.<eos> So instead you lied?<eos> - You all lied to me?<eos> - There they are.<eos> - Betty. Thank God...<eos> - Mom, don't...<eos> No, you have to listen. All of you.
- Jug...<eos> My dad just told Mayor McCoy<eos> - about your dad.<eos> - What about my dad?<eos> He was just arrested. For the murder of Jason Blossom.<eos> Someone planted the gun...<eos> Jason's murder weapon, in a closet in FP's trailer.<eos> It wasn't there when we searched for it.<eos> He's being framed, Betty.<eos> Well, maybe you didn't see it.

Whatever Sheriff Keller is saying he found, it wasn't there.<eos> Look, we need to tell Jughead his dad's innocent. Where is Jughead?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I tried calling him. I left him messages. He's not answering his phone.<eos> In the meantime...<eos> - Should we talk to Sheriff Keller? - No.<eos> Not until we tell our parents.<eos> That we broke into FP's trailer?<eos> My dad will know what to do.<eos> You did what?
That we broke into FP's trailer?<eos> My dad will know what to do.<eos> You did what?<eos> We had to make sure FP wasn't involved in Jason's murder.<eos> And now we know the truth. He was.<eos> What?<eos> Mom, no. We just told you.<eos> - The gun was planted.<eos> - By whoever killed Jason.<eos> Couldn't you have just missed it?
- Actually...<eos> I approached Mrs. Cooper.<eos> I had to know if FP was involved, and if he was connected to my dad.<eos> A gun was found.<eos> FP is the killer. Case closed. We're leaving.<eos> There was no gun!<eos> Son, this isn't petty theft or a bar fight we're talking about, Archie.<eos> This is murder.<eos> Okay, fine. Then we'll go to the sheriff without you.<eos> Archie, you entered FP's residence illegally.

Yeah. I thought I'd come see you and Jellybean for a while.<eos> I could crash on the couch.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> No.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> Look, I...<eos> Forget I said anything, okay?<eos> All right. Bye.<eos> I changed my mind about Toledo.<eos> Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?
Maybe his phone died.<eos> Or maybe, the only friends he has just completely betrayed him.<eos> - Is that him?<eos> - No, it's Veronica. Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Not really. My mom's spiraling, and I'm on the verge.<eos> I just wanted to talk. Where are you?<eos> I'm with Betty. We're looking for Jughead.<eos> Wait.<eos> You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?
Hint, we were just there.<eos> - Told you.<eos> Jug, we're so sorry...<eos> About everything.<eos> Juggy, we screwed up. We all did.<eos> Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.<eos> Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.<eos> That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.<eos> What are you talking about?
They were brothers, which made him a Blossom.<eos> Just like Hal.<eos> - Yeah, so what?<eos> - "So what?"<eos> So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.<eos> He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.<eos> You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.<eos> Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you people?<eos> Will you just spare us the middle-class morality.

Not that much money in local crime and villainy, huh?<eos> This is him, here.<eos> Mustang?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I can't... I can't be here.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Call my dad.<eos> - Son...<eos> - I'm okay. We both are.<eos> What were you doing here in the first place?
Call my dad.<eos> - Son...<eos> - I'm okay. We both are.<eos> What were you doing here in the first place?<eos> We knew Mustang was a Serpent.<eos> We just wanted to talk to him, to see if he knew anything about FP.<eos> Veronica, this has to stop.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Mom.<eos> What do you think happened in there?

You think your father killed your brother?<eos> You think I did?<eos> You think we murdered him and threw him in the river, because Jason knew some deep, dark, horrible secret about our business?<eos> You want answers, Cheryl?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> There it is!<eos> There's the sticky, dark, dirty truth.<eos> Drown in it, why don't you?<eos> Well, what do we have here?<eos> You two just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
Oh, my God.<eos> Betty...<eos> Betty, who are you calling?<eos> You have to get out of that house. Listen to me...<eos> I understand.<eos> Cheryl, what is it?<eos> You did a bad thing, Daddy.<eos> And now everyone knows.<eos> Sheriff. Your office told me that I would find you here.<eos> You need to see this. Both of you.
Aw, definitely.<eos> But, Ronnie, we have to be careful.<eos> The last time I had this kind of conversation with Betty, it didn't go well.<eos> Forget it, I'll tell her.<eos> On top of everything else I'm dealing with right now, I'll tell Betty that we're semi-dating.<eos> Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, report to the Principal's office.<eos> Archie.<eos> Betty.<eos> I'd like to feature you both at the Jubilee.<eos> As you know, it's our 75th anniversary of our town's founding, and also a kickoff for the next 75 years.
Archie.<eos> Betty.<eos> I'd like to feature you both at the Jubilee.<eos> As you know, it's our 75th anniversary of our town's founding, and also a kickoff for the next 75 years.<eos> And who better represents the future of Riverdale than the young people who, working with Sheriff Keller and my office, helped bring peace and justice to our streets once more?<eos> But, that's not exactly what happened...<eos> Let the Mayor finish, Ms. Cooper.<eos> Archie, the Pussycats will be performing at the Jubilee, and I would love for you to join them.<eos> Betty, I think it's important that we hear from Riverdale's best and brightest.<eos> - What do you say, both of you? - Uh...

I like Jughead.<eos> And he's welcome to attend the Jubilee, of course.<eos> But his father is in jail, and think it might be confusing to have him up on the Jubilee stage.<eos> That's so unfair, Mayor McCoy.<eos> Betty, Archie, you're heroes.
Who will the Grim Reaper take next? You?<eos> Me?<eos> Maybe your father had the right idea.<eos> Just end it.<eos> Better the sweet hereafter than this awful limbo.<eos> Betty, I know, you said, you're okay about me and Veronica, but I just wanted to make sure, because...<eos> Because last time I said I was okay, I wasn't.<eos> But this time, I promise I am.<eos> Great.<eos> You and Veronica, you're...
When is all this supposed to happen?<eos> The paperwork's been processed.<eos> Unless there is a radical change in your father's case, you'll be on the Southside by the end of the week.<eos> They're saying he has to live on the Southside, with a foster family, and then transfer to Southside High.<eos> That place is no joke.<eos> If there's a deal on the table, Mr. Jones, you've gotta take it.<eos> It tears me up, Red, but the Serpents are my tribe.<eos> They're also innocent, not that anyone in this town cares.<eos> We care, believe me.<eos> Nobody wants you to go to jail for 20 years, especially not Jughead.
So, no one wrote on your locker,<eos> "Go to hell, Serpent Slut," and hung a Betty doll from a noose?<eos> Jeez, Poll.<eos> Is there anything you didn't tell her?<eos> She wouldn't stop grilling me!<eos> I warned you, Elizabeth, about publishing that article.<eos> - Why do you constantly defy me?<eos> - Because.<eos> I'm sick of all the secrets and the lies in this town and in this family.<eos> I would much rather take some heat for being honest than do what you're doing.
- Because.<eos> I'm sick of all the secrets and the lies in this town and in this family.<eos> I would much rather take some heat for being honest than do what you're doing.<eos> Living in fear of the truth.<eos> I am scared for you, Elizabeth, not of the truth.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Let's go then.<eos> You talk a big game about liking Jughead, but wouldn't you be much happier if we weren't together?<eos> Thought so.<eos> Question number two, when you invited FP over for dinner, he said that you and Dad got in a huge fight when you were in high school, at Homecoming.
The evidence is compelling.<eos> Does that sound like me?<eos> I'll confess to trying to kill the president, but my wife and daughter are left alone.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna do what I do best.<eos> I'm gonna hunt.<eos> - I don't like the unknown.<eos> - I'll deal with Swagger.<eos> This whole thing seems off.<eos> - Do you believe me now?
Where's the ambassador?<eos> Someone tell me.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - What?<eos> You!<eos> This is a private function.<eos> - I want my daughter.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> I know you had her taken.
- What?<eos> You!<eos> This is a private function.<eos> - I want my daughter.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> I know you had her taken.<eos> My daughter.<eos> She's at your embassy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.
She's at your embassy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - And don't you dare bullshit me. - _<eos> No.<eos> Get off of me.<eos> Isaac will be there to validate the story<eos> - and motivate the ambassador.<eos> - Excuse me, sir.<eos> You think you can strong-arm me, but you can't.
Get off of me.<eos> Isaac will be there to validate the story<eos> - and motivate the ambassador.<eos> - Excuse me, sir.<eos> You think you can strong-arm me, but you can't.<eos> I'll go to the press.<eos> Excuse me, Ambassador.<eos> She came to Homeland first.<eos> She was raising hell in our office.<eos> I'm truly sorry about your trouble, but I have no idea who you are.
I'm going to the press.<eos> Everyone is gonna know.<eos> I'm going to the press with everything!<eos> Once I get into the embassy, how do I find Mary?<eos> I have the plans for all three floors right here.<eos> It's big, but the public stuff... conference rooms, offices... it's all on the first and second floor.<eos> The secret shit is in the basement.<eos> Any luck with the ambassador's security team?<eos> This one.<eos> When you get Mary, meet us at the surveillance point at K Street.

Let her go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I do not know what this is about.<eos> The scared little six-year-old in the basement.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Mary Swagger.<eos> Who?<eos> That's cute.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> You are the national security advisor.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Swagger's choosing the location.<eos> He doesn't want a repeat of Lon.<eos> Fine.<eos> But it needs to happen now.<eos> I'm waiting on his call.<eos> As soon as I have it, you will too.
We're a family again.<eos> Honey, honey, Krukov will never stop coming after us.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Take this.<eos> Rose Hotel.<eos> It's about three miles south.<eos> Room 109.<eos> It's already paid for.<eos> Diamonds?<eos> If I'm not back by midnight, you keep heading south.
Don't... I'm not doing that again.<eos> Sweetheart, my number's in the phone.<eos> And you got to take this.<eos> Fifteen rounds, one in the chamber.<eos> You see any trouble, you shoot first.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Just...<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll be back when I know you're truly safe.
Mason Bay Park.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Because if he gave it to the FBI, he wouldn't be ambushing us.<eos> Stop the car!<eos> Hands where I can see 'em!<eos> Right now!<eos> We had a deal.<eos> You didn't have a deal with me.<eos> You got to let me get out there and help him.
- Shit.<eos> Shoot at the car.<eos> Aim high and shoot, now.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Don't move, okay?<eos> Don't move.<eos> What happened?<eos> Daddy's here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank God you're okay.
- We can go home?<eos> Bob Lee.<eos> - No.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I have to.<eos> - No.<eos> - Jules, it's gonna be okay.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Bob Lee Swagger,<eos> - you're under arrest.
- No.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I have to.<eos> - No.<eos> - Jules, it's gonna be okay.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Bob Lee Swagger,<eos> - you're under arrest.<eos> - I promise you.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.
I wouldn't have emptied out the ground floor of Langley.<eos> Bob Lee, Annex B?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Maybe Hugh Meachum has it.<eos> He works in this building, doesn't he?<eos> Mr. Meachum is recently retired.<eos> And what does Mr. Swagger get if he gives it to you?<eos> Complete exoneration for the assassination of the Ukrainian president.<eos> He gets his life back.<eos> That's what you want, isn't it?

Ms. Gregson, please step away from the weapon.<eos> Last chance.<eos> So be it.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I had the ATF do a more thorough review of this rifle.<eos> Turns out somebody shaved the firing pin down 2 millimeters, just enough so that no one would notice.<eos> Mr. Vincent, please note that the murder weapon, the only thing that links Bob Lee Swagger to this whole conspiracy, does not fire.<eos> If that weapon can't fire, then Mr. Swagger can't be the shooter.<eos> Bob Lee Swagger, you are exonerated for the assassination of the Ukrainian president.<eos> Now, I gave you what you want.
You're getting so good.<eos> Here you go, sir.<eos> Daddy's home!<eos> Hi, baby!<eos> - You guys hungry?<eos> - Starving.<eos> - It's lasagna night, right?<eos> - It is.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> - You wait here.
You see something else you want to share?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Always.<eos> Where are we on Meadows?<eos> Autopsy confirmed his I.D. and that he was a habitual abuser of opioids.<eos> Patrol's looking for the tagger as a possible witness, and I gotta write a warrant for the storage bin.<eos> How's Bosch?<eos> He's pretty focused on the Holland trial prep.<eos> And you know how he gets.
Shut...<eos> Get that thing out of my freaking face.<eos> Okay.<eos> Lovely.<eos> There's that.<eos> Tell me about this statement from Mr. Holland, detective. We were packed up.<eos> Leaving.<eos> Camera was off.<eos> I was last one out because I needed to give him a copy of the search warrant, and I did so at the door.<eos> Mr. Fowkkes, did you witness this?
- He said one more thing.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Mr. Holland looked at me and said,<eos> "I am a god in this town, detective, and you don't fuck with the gods."<eos> Preposterous.<eos> Your Honor, Detective Bosch has a long history of investigative misconduct...<eos> Your Honor, a defendant's own voluntary out-of-court statements are a hearsay exception and can be used against him at trial.<eos> She's right, Mr. Fowkkes.<eos> Detective Bosch fabricated this entire conversation.<eos> And you're welcome to attack the credibility of the witness.
Yeah.<eos> But he left it out of the report, so there's that.<eos> You headed back downtown?<eos> Annabelle Crowe.<eos> Dress rehearsal.<eos> How's our Meadows warrant?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Almost done.<eos> You're not writing a novel.<eos> The jury's gonna wonder why you waited a year to call the police.

You're not writing a novel.<eos> The jury's gonna wonder why you waited a year to call the police.<eos> I was embarrassed, okay?<eos> Andrew Holland is an important person in my business.<eos> Is that why you didn't show the bruises on your neck to anyone?<eos> Why you erased his voicemail message?<eos> I just kept thinking, like...<eos> What if I had it wrong?<eos> You know.<eos> You hear about Hollywood people, weird sex, I don't know.
Clothes came off.<eos> - Consensual.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But he didn't like me touching him.<eos> He wanted to control everything.<eos> After a while, he moved behind me.<eos> I felt his hands around my neck.<eos> He squeezed.<eos> I couldn't breathe.<eos> Did you tell him to stop?
And I walked until I had cell phone reception so I could call a cab.<eos> And why not the police right then?<eos> He had already left me a voicemail on my cell, worried about where I'd gone, saying I'd forgotten my keys, and saying he was sorry that things had gotten carried away, and he... He thought I was really into it.<eos> He just wanted to satisfy me.<eos> Did he explain why he had to take a shower after he'd choked you out?<eos> What did you think the garbage bag meant?<eos> The empty purse?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was getting rid of the evidence.<eos> He thought you were dead.
You should get a traffic app for your phone, detective.<eos> Then we could watch his head explode.<eos> We go in here.<eos> So, Patty, how secure are these?<eos> Well, they need ID to get in, but we tell them not to leave anything too valuable.<eos> They have to come back every week to renew.<eos> And demand is high.<eos> There's never enough.<eos> Let's see, Meadows... 1901.<eos> You're just in time.
That's crazy.<eos> I was all in with it.<eos> That's how sure we were.<eos> Stress can be a huge factor.<eos> Frustration with the slow churn of justice.<eos> But if you tell people exactly what they need to do and why, the majority respond very positively and often exceed expectations.<eos> Last question is situational.<eos> A lieutenant under your direct command has had an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her detectives.<eos> This detective comes to you and says that an unhappy end to the affair is now affecting her caseload and her path to promotion.<eos> How would you handle this?
Drop dead time is Thursday at 3:00 p.m.<eos> Damn it. Isaiah's in jail again.<eos> You need to stop pissing off judges.<eos> We paid the contempt fine, but Mendoza's demanding an apology before letting you back into her courtroom.<eos> An apology for what?<eos> - You called her a fascist.<eos> - She is a fascist.<eos> You really the famous Isaiah Roth?<eos> I am.<eos> If you're such a great defense attorney, what you doing in here with us?
Yeah. I'll go do that now.<eos> Yeah. Great.<eos> She's the worst assistant.<eos> She's a Make-A-Wish kid.<eos> When she was three. Now she's 23.<eos> She survived cancer, she got a trip to Disneyland, and now she needs to be fired.<eos> You're a terrible person.<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> What if you can't get the confession thrown out?<eos> Can you win this if you take it to trial?
I think we owe it to Billy to explore all the options.<eos> We did and came up with a strategy not to go to trial.<eos> He's still here?<eos> Still here.<eos> Sadie's considering taking the Brennan case to court.<eos> I thought you said it was too risky.<eos> Jerry's coming in.<eos> If he can dig up any dirt on Michael Slater, it could change everything.<eos> - How's the dog?<eos> - How do you know about that?

To make him responsive to counsel, Your Honor.<eos> I know, but in the interest of...<eos> Your Honor, besides being unethical, - this reeks of...<eos> - Garrett, let me finish.<eos> You know, I'm beginning to question your competency.<eos> You two, stop.<eos> All right, I have an idea.<eos> Let's do some role-playing.<eos> Just humor me now.<eos> Mr. Holland, you're Ms. Wirth.
Let's do some role-playing.<eos> Just humor me now.<eos> Mr. Holland, you're Ms. Wirth.<eos> Why is this so important to your case?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> Take a crack at it.<eos> Well, because she's afraid that...<eos> No. As Ms. Wirth.<eos> Who are you?
Well, Your Honor, um, the first jury was polled. The majority who voted guilty said it was because that Lester didn't seem crazy.<eos> And, well, when he's on his meds, he's... A zombie.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Continue.<eos> But on the day he killed Susannah Fiorita, he was not on his meds, and the jury has a right to see that.<eos> Your turn.<eos> As Garrett Holland.<eos> Not only does this show how... desperate Ms. Wirth is, but it puts at risk the very idea of competency and is perhaps grounds for a mistrial.<eos> Wasn't that enlightening?<eos> Ms. Simon, what did you learn from that exchange?

See if you can put together a winnable case.<eos> And if not, you'll re-approach Brennan.<eos> Yes, Albert.<eos> I'll use my serious, scary voice and get him to take the plea.<eos> - Do it once right now.<eos> - No.<eos> - Just a little.<eos> - I'm not doing the voice.<eos> There it is.<eos> Do you have any experience with anyone that's been in a psychiatric facility?
Tell us again what happened.<eos> The night Amy was murdered,<eos> Gail Meyers called me about 3:00 a.m. to say Amy hadn't come home yet.<eos> I went to ask Billy if he knew where she was.<eos> The cat was sleeping beside him.<eos> When he rolled over, it got mad and scratched him on the cheek.<eos> What can I say?<eos> The cat was an ass.<eos> It's not gonna be easy to explain the coincidence of the cat scratch to a jury.<eos> Did you cut yourself shaving?

Like in a comic book.<eos> Arms and legs out, in midair, staring at the oncoming train.<eos> And everybody's s-screaming and I'm screaming.<eos> And he's sitting there, on the ground next to me, saying,<eos> "The blonde woman..."<eos> "I pushed her."<eos> Over and over.<eos> Mr. Fiorita, first of all, I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When Mr. Wilson hopped away, you say you and Susannah laughed.

Did he seem crazy to you?<eos> - Yeah, a little.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Calls for speculation.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. I just...<eos> I haven't been back here since that night.<eos> So, you and Amy left a Halloween party at a neighbor's house, which was...?
- It's okay.<eos> I'm a woman, but I used to be a man.<eos> That's right.<eos> I remember you told me.<eos> Are you still comfortable with me representing you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I just didn't know if it was real or in my mind.<eos> It's real.<eos> I'm not taking these.<eos> Mr. Slater, you and Dr. Brennan were both students at River Hill Academy.
And did the defendant share an experience with the group?<eos> Not then, but a little while later, when the group leader paired us up.<eos> And what did the defendant say to you?<eos> He talked about this girl who died, Amy Meyers, and that he was pretty messed up about it.<eos> And then he said,<eos> "I did it, you know."<eos> Meaning kill Amy Meyers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Slater.<eos> What did you say after he said that?

The law is very clear on this.<eos> Your Honor, if patients feel as if they can't divulge problems in a protected session, - for fear of future prosecution...<eos> - I agree.<eos> However, the conversation in question, while at the behest of the psychiatrist, did not occur in his presence, and therefore is not privileged.<eos> The motion to suppress the confession is denied.<eos> - Your Honor...<eos> If we get that far. Now go.<eos> Plea is still on the table, Sadie.<eos> Mr. Wilson was brought to Battery Park Medical in August of 2013 by the police.<eos> And how would you characterize his mental health?
And how would you characterize his mental health?<eos> Lester suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.<eos> He has command auditory hallucinations, which are voices that comment in a vicious way and encourage him to harm other people.<eos> On medication, the voices are controlled.<eos> Off medication, he's very volatile and can be easily provoked to violence.<eos> Provoked by what?<eos> Typically, schizophrenics who are symptomatic are triggered by religious symbols, eye contact, loud noises.<eos> - Laughter?<eos> - Possibly.<eos> Mr. Wilson, as you know, has a fairly well-developed delusion that he's a karate champion.

No, no, it's 1:00.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Control your client, Counsel.<eos> And, yes, why don't we take lunch?<eos> Your lunch is at 1:30 at the Boathouse with your daughter.<eos> The smart one or the other one?<eos> The other one.<eos> And that's not nice.<eos> The kid finally bailed?<eos> You're looking for dirt on Michael Slater?
Then we're all good.<eos> See you in court.<eos> Calvin?<eos> What's going on?<eos> We found the murder weapon.<eos> What happened was, um, this train is coming and... it's like... sensory overload and... it feels like, um, switches going on in my brain, flipping on and off, and I pushed her.<eos> And I-I don't mean to, but it happens, and then the lady falls onto the track, and then I went into shock, horror.<eos> Lester, did somebody tell you to push Susannah Fiorita onto the tracks?<eos> You feel like something is entering you.<eos> Everything melds into one, you know, intangible entity, and then... it's like this overwhelming urge to push.

Which is what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Well, I gave Jerry a chance to redeem himself and had him investigate you.<eos> You spent the past five years in Otisville for passing counterfeit money and bad checks.<eos> While you were there, you got a law degree through an online inmate program.<eos> But you must know that the New York Bar is not going to admit you until you get someone to hire you and vouch for your character.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Well, how am I gonna do that?<eos> I don't know the first thing about your character.<eos> I was young and stupid and I made some mistakes.<eos> But I don't expect you to take my word for it.
Billy, I told you...<eos> That this isn't real, I know.<eos> And that I don't have feelings for you, but you're wrong.<eos> And I'm gonna prove to you, and to everyone, that I'm innocent.<eos> And not with a hair strand or a cheek swab.<eos> I want there to be no doubt.<eos> I want to give my blood.<eos> Let me.<eos> You know it when you see it. You're on a subway.<eos> You see someone talking to themselves, maybe they're a little disheveled, and you think to yourself,

What happened?<eos> You went to jail when I was two, and robbed me of a mother.<eos> That's what happened.<eos> I met a guy, Mom.<eos> And he's kind and smart and funny.<eos> And he's the first guy that I've ever felt like I could really talk to, and that he might understand my screwed-up life.<eos> But I can't.<eos> It's so complicated, and I don't know what to do, and I need my mother.<eos> I need you.<eos> You know the rules, Rice.
Get him away from us.<eos> Damn, dude. I just wanted to tell you I didn't kill him.<eos> Byron, come on. Let's go.<eos> Danny didn't do anything to that boy.<eos> Except look different.<eos> Most Americans will not tolerate the murder of an innocent boy.<eos> We should go.<eos> Monday morning, around 1:45 a.m., we found the body in an abandoned building on South Kimbark.<eos> He was already deceased when we arrived.<eos> You didn't just happen by the building, I assume.

What condition was Danny Nasiri in when you found him?<eos> He was dead.<eos> He had been beaten to death with a tire iron that we found in an adjacent dumpster.<eos> Is this how you found Danny Nasiri?<eos> It is.<eos> - And this?<eos> - Yep.<eos> What initially led you to suspect the defendant, Byron Welch?<eos> We learned from campus police there had been a prior altercation between him and Danny Nasiri.<eos> And why did you eventually arrest Byron Welch?
It is.<eos> - And this?<eos> - Yep.<eos> What initially led you to suspect the defendant, Byron Welch?<eos> We learned from campus police there had been a prior altercation between him and Danny Nasiri.<eos> And why did you eventually arrest Byron Welch?<eos> We found a sweatshirt that was stained with what turned out to be Danny Nasiri's blood.<eos> It had been shoved into the back of Byron's closet under his dirty underwear.<eos> Dude, knock it off.<eos> You think this is some kind of joke?
You know you're gonna tell me eventually.<eos> You do know there's free porn on the Internet now.<eos> Whoa, Nagel, I didn't say anything about porn.<eos> Stale beer and something nasty.<eos> That's called hormones.<eos> We're investigators from the State Attorney's Office.<eos> What's that?<eos> Like, better than cops?<eos> It's, like, different.<eos> You're here about Byron, right?
It's, like, different.<eos> You're here about Byron, right?<eos> Look, there's no way he killed that guy.<eos> He's a good dude.<eos> As in he's a good beer pong partner?<eos> Yeah. That, too.<eos> All right, so, what was his problem with Danny Nasiri?<eos> Yeah, why don't we all just get along?<eos> Are you saying Byron didn't like Muslims?<eos> You know what the school does
When I was in uniform, me and McKay, we would drive past a mosque every day.<eos> And every day when they saw us, the people would scatter.<eos> One day, McKay buys an extra coffee... He gives the extra cup to this old dude, Ameer, before he can get away.<eos> Next day, we drive by... Ameer's there with a box of donuts.<eos> The day after that, Ameer brings his wife, Fadi, and his cousin Saad.<eos> Donut diplomacy.<eos> Why does Byron have a Koran?<eos> Maybe he wants to get to know the enemy.<eos> "From Addie." Who is Addie?<eos> You knew Danny?

Who is Addie?<eos> You knew Danny?<eos> He was a good friend.<eos> Actually, I'm the one who convinced him to drop his complaint against Byron.<eos> Why would you do that?
Byron felt really bad after he beat up Danny.<eos> He came to a meeting.<eos> That's when I met him.<eos> - And you gave him the Koran?<eos> - I wanted him to see there's nothing in there about blowing up Westerners.<eos> The truth is I'm sure Byron didn't kill Danny.<eos> Because he read the Koran?<eos> Because he was with me... all night.<eos> He's about to go on trial for murder, Addie.<eos> You didn't maybe think to tell someone?
Who writes a whole book on one equation?<eos> Same filing system I used.<eos> It's a receipt to a local dry cleaner.<eos> Dated three months ago, addressed to Jafar Boustani.<eos> Maybe Danny did have a roomie.<eos> Maybe he knows something.<eos> Danny and I were roommates for six years.<eos> Admissions put us together when we were freshmen.<eos> One Muslim's got to get along with another, right?<eos> Did you and Danny get along?

We lived in the dorms for four years.<eos> And then we got an apartment off Ellis Street when we started grad school.<eos> You didn't really answer the question.<eos> Yes.<eos> We were great friends.<eos> We're both studying theoretical physics.<eos> Like the Schrodinger equation?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Danny never quite got the hang of that.<eos> So, why'd you move out?
Yeah.<eos> Danny never quite got the hang of that.<eos> So, why'd you move out?<eos> A girl.<eos> I moved in with her.<eos> Then we broke up.<eos> I wanted to move back in with Danny, but he decided he liked to live alone.<eos> Now I wish I would've insisted.<eos> Sorry, but we have to ask:<eos> Where were you...
Then we broke up.<eos> I wanted to move back in with Danny, but he decided he liked to live alone.<eos> Now I wish I would've insisted.<eos> Sorry, but we have to ask:<eos> Where were you...<eos> The night Danny was killed?<eos> Studying.<eos> In the stacks.<eos> Like every night.<eos> You're gonna convict Byron, right?
Studying.<eos> In the stacks.<eos> Like every night.<eos> You're gonna convict Byron, right?<eos> You know Byron Welch?<eos> I was there the first time he attacked Danny.<eos> It would've been a lot worse if I hadn't stopped it.<eos> Your name wasn't on the police report.<eos> I didn't want any trouble.<eos> I mean, you don't know what it's like on campus.
Yeah.<eos> We met a couple of guys like that.<eos> So, you didn't like the guilt by association?<eos> I'm dating a guy from Egypt now.<eos> Did Jafar ever mention Danny Nasiri?<eos> Does all the time count?<eos> He was convinced that Danny was plagiarizing his research...<eos> Some science stuff nobody cares about.<eos> Anyway, he said that if Danny did it again, he'd hurt him bad.<eos> You do know that Danny was murdered?

You guys eliminated plagiarism as a motive.<eos> Yeah, Jafar lied to us.<eos> And Danny's blood is on Byron's sweatshirt.<eos> In a case against Jafar, that is reasonable doubt.<eos> That blood could've come from their first fight.<eos> No way to prove it either way.<eos> I'm not trying to be difficult here, but we'll need more if we're gonna try...<eos> Because Jafar's Muslim?<eos> Because we already indicted someone else.<eos> You didn't happen to find Danny's phone in his apartment, did you?
Bingo.<eos> Now all we have to do is get it.<eos> That is why everybody loves a fireman.<eos> - It's dead.<eos> - Yeah, not my department.<eos> I'll take it to the communications lab.<eos> Let's separate and canvass.<eos> Somebody might have seen something.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Maybe you heard something
- It's dead.<eos> - Yeah, not my department.<eos> I'll take it to the communications lab.<eos> Let's separate and canvass.<eos> Somebody might have seen something.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Maybe you heard something<eos> - outside.<eos> - Look, I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, guys, have you ever seen this man?
- Yes.<eos> He's handsome.<eos> You're sure?<eos> It was dark.<eos> And right under the street light.<eos> It's so bright it keeps me up at night.<eos> Was this the other boy?<eos> No.<eos> I think he was Muslim too.<eos> So, you got a good look at him?
Excuse me.<eos> This will just take a minute.<eos> Stop!<eos> Police!<eos> Hey!<eos> Jafar!<eos> Jafar, what are you doing?<eos> What the hell, dude?<eos> Hey.<eos> Jafar Boustani, you're under arrest for the murder of Danny Nasiri.

Jafar Boustani, you're under arrest for the murder of Danny Nasiri.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> Danny was the star student, Jafar the also ran.<eos> We think Jafar killed Danny out of jealousy.<eos> And Danny's DNA was on Jafar's shoes.<eos> "Finally, someone putting those Muslim..."<eos> I'll skip the next two words, but they begin with M and F...<eos> "In their place."<eos> Why do you read that crap, Mark?
"In their place."<eos> Why do you read that crap, Mark?<eos> Don't kid yourself.<eos> As goes the Twitter-verse, so goes the jury.<eos> Truth be told, Jafar is a better defendant than Byron.<eos> A Muslim?<eos> If you get the right jury.<eos> All due respect, but I can't believe what I'm hearing.<eos> Well, with a jury, there's a lot more than the law and facts that have to be considered.<eos> As long as you know that what you're both saying is...
Well, good luck to you.<eos> And you, miss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That eyewitness of yours.<eos> The Miss...<eos> Kalila Rafiq.<eos> The names in this thing are just killing me.<eos> I noticed she did not testify at the Grand Jury.<eos> She was out of town.<eos> And yet you still got an indictment?
The right to practice his or her religion.<eos> The court cannot force Ms. Rafiq to do something her religion forbids.<eos> - She's necessary to your case?<eos> - She's an eyewitness, Judge.<eos> Rock and a hard place.<eos> You can appeal if you like, Mr. O'Boyle, but I'm going to allow her to testify, niqab and all.<eos> I was reading in my bedroom when I thought I heard a scream.<eos> - And what happened then?<eos> - I went to my window.<eos> - And what did you see?

- Is there a question?<eos> - Yes, there is.<eos> As I was saying, I couldn't see your hands because your... your...<eos> What... what do you call that?<eos> That's a... a... hijab?<eos> It's a niqab, sir.<eos> And your husband makes you wear that, does he?<eos> It's required by custom.<eos> Well, that's what I meant.<eos> I mean, if you were to go to the beach...

I'm getting there, Judge.<eos> I promise.<eos> Do it quickly.<eos> So, walking to the market or to the post office...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ms. Rafiq, you...<eos> You don't get a lot of sun, do you?<eos> I ask the court to admonish Mr. O'Boyle for making light of the witness's religious customs.<eos> "Making light." That's very funny, Mr. Stone.<eos> Ms. Rafiq, are you aware that almost the entire body's intake of vitamin D

That's very funny, Mr. Stone.<eos> Ms. Rafiq, are you aware that almost the entire body's intake of vitamin D<eos> - comes from direct sunlight?<eos> - No.<eos> Did you know that women who wear the full niqab are chronically deficient in vitamin D?
Nothing further.<eos> - Redirect, Your Honor?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Ms. Rafiq, do you have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes?<eos> - Type 1.<eos> - That's also called juvenile diabetes, isn't it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - When were you first diagnosed?<eos> When I was three.<eos> And when did you start wearing a niqab?
- Yes.<eos> - When were you first diagnosed?<eos> When I was three.<eos> And when did you start wearing a niqab?<eos> When I was 16.<eos> Deputy Corcoran, could you please raise some fingers?<eos> Can you see how many fingers the deputy has raised?<eos> Yes.<eos> Three.<eos> And are you wearing contacts right now?
He's putting Jafar on the stand.<eos> Good.<eos> He'll hang himself.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Six years... we were together since we were freshmen.<eos> - You were friendly?<eos> - We were.<eos> And then something happened to change that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And that's why you moved out?

And then something happened to change that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And that's why you moved out?<eos> Yes.<eos> And why did you move out, Jafar?<eos> Danny started watching videos of Anwar al-Awlaki.<eos> I'm unfamiliar.<eos> He recruits Americans to jihad.<eos> Order.<eos> Whoa, whoa. So you're saying that Danny was a terrorist?
Yes.<eos> And why did you move out, Jafar?<eos> Danny started watching videos of Anwar al-Awlaki.<eos> I'm unfamiliar.<eos> He recruits Americans to jihad.<eos> Order.<eos> Whoa, whoa. So you're saying that Danny was a terrorist?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Well, are you saying that you actually witnessed him watching these videos on his computer?
- Thank you, Jafar.<eos> Then there is no reason we shouldn't see what's there.<eos> This is a good time to break.<eos> We'll have a look.<eos> My brothers and sisters...<eos> Come to jihad and feel the honor and happiness we are feeling.<eos> What prevents you from attaining martyrdom and the pleasure of our Lord?<eos> That's the video you saw Danny watching?<eos> One of them.<eos> And how did you react to those videos?
That's the video you saw Danny watching?<eos> One of them.<eos> And how did you react to those videos?<eos> I told Danny he was being crazy.<eos> He wouldn't listen.<eos> He said that Christians have been oppressing Muslims for 1,000 years, and that jihad was the only weapon the weak had to conquer the powerful.<eos> Well, I thought Islam was a religion of peace.<eos> Not to Danny.<eos> He quoted the Koran to me.<eos> Sura 47:4. "So when you meet those" who disbelieve, strike their necks "until you have inflicted slaughter on them."

"So when you meet those" who disbelieve, strike their necks "until you have inflicted slaughter on them."<eos> - Well, that's harsh.<eos> - He took it all out of context.<eos> So then what happened when you decided to move out?
There was something different about Danny.<eos> One day, he asks me for money.<eos> What did he want money for?<eos> He went to the gardening store.<eos> He bought a 100-pound bag of fertilizer.<eos> He lives in an apartment.<eos> What then?<eos> He went to several electronics stores.<eos> He bought cell phones, wires, timers, things like that.<eos> You thought he was making an explosive?
I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.<eos> What I want to know is how Nasiri slipped under everybody's radar.<eos> That's the funny thing about freedom.<eos> It gives our enemies the freedom to destroy us.<eos> Cut a deal.<eos> O'Boyle said Jafar is not interested in a deal.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He suckered you into picking his damn jury for him.<eos> - So, you're a good American?
O'Boyle said Jafar is not interested in a deal.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He suckered you into picking his damn jury for him.<eos> - So, you're a good American?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - And a hero?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't killing Danny have been sufficient?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, you strangled Danny until he was dead.

- Not that I know of.<eos> - Did he have a car?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, that's interesting, because my investigators have been to his apartment, and they, they didn't find any... any fertilizer, any cell phones, or any timers.<eos> I don't hear a question, Your Honor.<eos> What's the Fleishman Prize, Mr. Boustani?<eos> It's an award given out by the physics department.<eos> - To the best student?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How many times have you won it?
- To the best student?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How many times have you won it?<eos> None.<eos> How many times did Danny Nasiri win it?<eos> Four or five.<eos> Ooh, that must have pissed you off.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> You didn't kill Danny because of his politics, did you?
- Yes.<eos> How many times have you won it?<eos> None.<eos> How many times did Danny Nasiri win it?<eos> Four or five.<eos> Ooh, that must have pissed you off.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> You didn't kill Danny because of his politics, did you?<eos> You killed him out of jealousy.
"If you see something, say something."<eos> Well, Jafar...<eos> He saw something.<eos> But he took it one step further.<eos> He did something about it.<eos> He did it so you don't have to.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> When I selected this jury, I was being a clever lawyer.<eos> Perhaps too clever by half.<eos> I selected you, ma'am, because you went to church.
So you don't have to.<eos> When I selected this jury, I was being a clever lawyer.<eos> Perhaps too clever by half.<eos> I selected you, ma'am, because you went to church.<eos> Christ Chapel of Bucktown.<eos> And your son... he's matriculated at Liberty University.<eos> That's Evangelical, if I'm not mistaken.<eos> You have a son in the Marines and a daughter in the Army.<eos> I selected each one of you for a very specific reason.<eos> You're patriots.

Now, my mistake at the time was I forgot that that's not what great Americans do.<eos> Great Americans look to the law that binds us together as a people.<eos> They ignore what their gut tells them is right, choosing instead what we as a civilized society have collectively determined is the right thing to do.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's the only way a great country stays great.<eos> "Someone had to do something about Danny Nasiri before he did something unspeakable," says our guts.<eos> "Someone had to murder him in cold blood," without a trial, without a verdict, without the Constitutional guarantees that Mr. O'Boyle's nephew is risking his life for every day.<eos> "That's the right thing to do," says our hearts.<eos> But our heads...<eos> All I'm asking of you is that you continue to be great Americans...

It's our nature.<eos> Everybody wants to be tolerant.<eos> A white guy goes into a church in Charleston, blows away a black Bible study class.<eos> What do we do about it?<eos> We ban the Confederate flag.<eos> A Muslim murders 49 kids at a nightclub, and we admonish each other not to blame the entire religion.<eos> We are naturally racist.<eos> But at the same time, we feel guilty about it.<eos> Was Danny really a terrorist?<eos> Well, you mean: Do I believe my client?
You sent a couple of scrubs out there!<eos> Actually, he sent the Director.<eos> And I brought an elite ert unit with me.<eos> We've been out there for the past 15 hours.<eos> - Director Webster.<eos> - Olivia.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't mean any offense, obviously.<eos> Is it obvious?<eos> Have you found anything at that cabin to tie this woman's death to Cyrus Beene?

Confess to the killing of President-elect Vargas, and we'll repay that honesty by taking the death penalty off the table.<eos> You'll live a long and healthy life as a ward of the United States Federal Prison System.<eos> What do you say?<eos> If I could just confer with my client for a moment.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Can you read that okay?<eos> It's a less polite way of saying go have sexual intercourse with yourself.<eos> Nelson.<eos> It's Mr. Mcclintock, as in my parents came to America before yours did, David Rosen.<eos> If you think I'm gonna confess to a crime I didn't commit, You are sorely, sorely mistaken.
- Sit down.<eos> - I am not...<eos> Sit... Down.<eos> You too.<eos> - You two need to talk.<eos> - About?<eos> Ways to avoid the implosion of the United States of America.<eos> We are at a crossroads, and the fact that no one knows Who will be sitting in the oval in January isn't exactly helping,<eos> So I'm gonna need the two of you to come up with a way, A plan, a compromise to get us out of this mess.<eos> You think you can do that?
He's a busy man, running the country and all.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> - Don't do what?<eos> Allow you to bother my boss with a matter that's already been taken care of?<eos> Like I said, he's a busy man.<eos> This most certainly has not been taken care of, Abby.<eos> Not when the White House has decided to pin Frankie Vargas' assassination on the wrong guy.<eos> Mcclintock confessed to everything... to planning his attack for months to gaining his access to forged press credentials<eos> - He confessed.<eos> - Because you forced him to sign some ridiculous paper.
Thank you.<eos> And keep the change.<eos> - Dr. Harris.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Summer, thanks for bringing him in.<eos> - Oh, hey, buddy! - Whoop.<eos> Okay, now. Here's the diapers and bunky.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, you're sure Dr. Reid's okay with this.
Okay.<eos> Mrs. Kilbride, your son is in what we call chronic rejection.<eos> He'll need a new liver as soon as possible.<eos> He was so much better after his transplant.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - His liver's lost function.<eos> We're unable to suppress the antibodies he's producing.<eos> Which is why we're working so hard to find him a new one.<eos> And given Colin's weakened immune system, the best match would be part of a liver from a living donor.<eos> But you tested us all...
Stat geek, hatchet man.<eos> Hooved spawn of Satan.<eos> He's just trying to live up to his billing.<eos> Yeah, by slashing my ER budget and turning ambulances away.<eos> He was named one of the most influential business minds under 35.<eos> Doesn't hurt that his uncle is head of the Hospital Association.<eos> Influential and connected.<eos> Great.<eos> Do me a favor and promise me you'll wipe the floor with this guy.<eos> Dr. Bell, you know how many hospitals there are in this city?
Dr. Bell, you know how many hospitals there are in this city?<eos> - 24.<eos> - 23, actually.<eos> St. Nathaniel is merging with Scarborough Regional at the end of the month.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I hadn't heard.<eos> Of those 23, we're one of four major trauma centers and one of five transplant hubs.<eos> Transplant and Trauma put Hope Zion on the map.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've heard of Easter Island, Dr. Bell?
Yeah.<eos> You've heard of Easter Island, Dr. Bell?<eos> Of course.<eos> It used to be on the map, too.<eos> Now, the theory goes it was a thriving civilization... quite advanced for its time.<eos> But their way of life wasn't sustainable.<eos> They used up their resources and... poof.<eos> All that's left now are some... you know, the big heads.<eos> So I'm one of the big heads in this scenario, is that it?<eos> You've done some great work here, Dawn.
this is the best one.<eos> I'll need you to transfer your pre-op patients to other hospitals.<eos> We'll make sure they're placed in the best possible care.<eos> Whoa, whoa... hey!<eos> What do you think you're doing with the good gloves?<eos> My patient has scabies.<eos> I'm using the good ones.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, you can use one of those gloves.<eos> Because you want me to get scabies?
We just need to prove to this pencil-pushing C-3PO-looking man-boy that we're the best damn ER in the country, got it?<eos> Great idea, Master Luke.<eos> Back when I was in the seminary, I, uh, used to get really tired of that question,<eos> "Why would God do this?"<eos> - Makes you wonder.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So you think we're really gonna find a match for this little guy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But it doesn't help anyone to give up.<eos> Excuse me, are you Colin Kilbride's doctor?
I don't want to hurt you.<eos> My name is Danny Kilbride.<eos> I'm here to help my son.<eos> How is Colin?<eos> I-I can take you to him.<eos> No.<eos> I want to help him.<eos> But this has to stay off the record, okay?<eos> I might be compromised already.<eos> What do you mean?
How is Colin?<eos> I-I can take you to him.<eos> No.<eos> I want to help him.<eos> But this has to stay off the record, okay?<eos> I might be compromised already.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Joanie contacted my handler, uh, a few weeks ago.<eos> And that might be enough for them to trace her number.<eos> Okay, so you're saying...

Okay, oh, no, no, don't touch it, don't touch.<eos> Nurse, uh, can I get a nurse?<eos> We need a nurse!<eos> You'll be just fine.<eos> Sekara, you're with me today.<eos> Uh, I was actually just about to report to the ER.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Three of these are in end-stage heart failure.<eos> Most of them are on a bridge to transplant.<eos> Well, I'm honored you asked me to help.
Most of them are on a bridge to transplant.<eos> Well, I'm honored you asked me to help.<eos> Oh, we're not helping.<eos> We're starting the process of transferring them out of here.<eos> Dr. Bell, is it Wednesday already?<eos> What happens Wednesday?<eos> Sally is the leader of our book club.<eos> Well, three is hardly a club.<eos> Dr. Bell blackmailed her boyfriend into hearing me go on about books.<eos> - You're welcome to join us, Doctor...

- You're welcome to join us, Doctor...<eos> - Sekara.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> "War and Peace."<eos> Still.<eos> "We can only know that we know nothing,"<eos> "and that's the highest degree of human wisdom."<eos> Very good.<eos> I like a well-read man.<eos> So, Sally, I need to assess that you are well enough to travel.
So, Sally, I need to assess that you are well enough to travel.<eos> Travel where?<eos> We're gonna be transferring you to Mississauga Memorial.<eos> They have a wonderful transplant program there.<eos> Dr. Bradley is a masterful surgeon.<eos> But I want to stay here.<eos> We understand that, but the...<eos> No, I just got settled.<eos> M-My books are here, you're here.<eos> You've been my surgeon for six years.

Okay, okay, listen, he's a vascular surgeon.<eos> He is your son's vascular surgeon.<eos> Please just, he... he needs to be here, too.<eos> Let him go. Let him go.<eos> Please?<eos> We cool?<eos> That depends, brother. That all depends on you.<eos> All right.<eos> We have good news.<eos> You and your son are a match.
All right.<eos> We have good news.<eos> You and your son are a match.<eos> Blood type and HLA, too.<eos> That means that part of your liver is gonna save his life.<eos> My conditions, though.<eos> Yeah?<eos> This stays completely anonymous.<eos> There's a lot of people that want to see me dead.<eos> You serious?
Okay, wait. Okay, wait, wait!<eos> There has to be an alternative.<eos> To operating in an operating room?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What... what about the skills lab?<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, it... it could double as an OR in an emergency situation.<eos> This is not an emergency, Doc.<eos> It could become one real quick.<eos> You mentioned that, yeah.
What about it?<eos> Well, it... it could double as an OR in an emergency situation.<eos> This is not an emergency, Doc.<eos> It could become one real quick.<eos> You mentioned that, yeah.<eos> We'll put John Doe on the chart, limit the staff, get Dawn to sign off on it, and prep the skills lab.<eos> What do you say, Dr. Palmer, want to save a life together?<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> He's getting worse by the hour.<eos> Please tell me you have good news.
Really.<eos> Who's the donor?<eos> I want to thank them.<eos> I-I need to thank them.<eos> Well, all donors are anonymous.<eos> I'll ask him if he wants to see you, but there are no guarantees.<eos> Him?<eos> - Mrs. Kilbride...<eos> - Wait.<eos> So you're telling me that... in the last hour, you've managed to find someone who's a perfect match for Colin?
Boom.<eos> Take care, son.<eos> You too.<eos> Dad?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Will you be here when I wake up?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> So we'll prep Colin while we harvest the other liver, and when it's ready, Colin's procedure will start.<eos> You really think this will work?
You too.<eos> Dad?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Will you be here when I wake up?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> So we'll prep Colin while we harvest the other liver, and when it's ready, Colin's procedure will start.<eos> You really think this will work?<eos> I do.<eos> Dr. Bell, what do you think you're doing?
So we'll prep Colin while we harvest the other liver, and when it's ready, Colin's procedure will start.<eos> You really think this will work?<eos> I do.<eos> Dr. Bell, what do you think you're doing?<eos> Putting the patient's scans up in preparation for her transplant.<eos> After I ordered her transferred to another hospital?<eos> Mrs. Ambrose's health is failing.<eos> It's my call for my patient.<eos> Her transfer has already been signed.<eos> If we operate on her, do you have any idea of the liability?

Stop.<eos> My patient is getting a new heart... today, right here.<eos> I am seeing this through.<eos> Then I expect your resignation as Chief of Surgery by tomorrow morning.<eos> Woman: Clear for takeoff, Dr. Bell.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I just need a moment.<eos> Dr. Bell?<eos> We were wondering if we could assist.<eos> Do you both understand the risks that you're taking?
I'm sorry, but it's just my head.<eos> I really don't feel so good.<eos> Oh. No, no, wait!<eos> Pestilence!<eos> See, this is Mrs. Gleiberman's wrist.<eos> She broke that while, um, roller-blading.<eos> I didn't even know people still did that.<eos> And that is Mr. Barnham's elbow.<eos> He shattered that stage-diving at the Mod Club, I think, when nobody caught him.<eos> You can see me?

No, you don't, actually.<eos> The minute you're done, you need to move the patient and hide him somewhere safe.<eos> Put him Gerontology.<eos> They have vents and the staff to monitor him.<eos> I'll have them clear a room.<eos> I'm sorry, but what the hell was that?<eos> Welcome to my world.<eos> Ice.<eos> Call OR 5, tell them to prep Colin, we're on our way.<eos> So, Dr. Bell, just out of curiosity's sake, how are you planning on explaining this to the board?
How do you know all this?<eos> Just page me if anything changes.<eos> Bree.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Oh, I'll let you know when the room stops spinning.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, Dr. Lin.<eos> Uh, actually, Bree, I found you a room for tonight.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> It's really close by, you can stay there for as long as you need to until you feel better.<eos> Why are you doing all this for me?
Just like your old man, you hear me?<eos> Just promise me you'll keep fighting.<eos> Okay, Dad.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> Dawn Bell is one of the most impressive surgeons and leaders that I've ever met.<eos> You think I made a mistake?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're putting your own career on the line to tell me that.<eos> I guess I am.<eos> Nobody understands what you're trying to do here.
Now puke?<eos> That's a different story.<eos> You know, maybe coming to class isn't such a bad idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> Cool.<eos> Are you allergic to money?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Allergic.<eos> Like, if you come into contact with too much, you'll break out in hives.

With all that fresh pistachio and honey.<eos> Remember, I used to say,<eos> "Grandpa, I don't want to finish dinner.<eos> I only want baklava."<eos> And you'd say,<eos> "You're sweet enough already, little bird."<eos> Wake up and we'll go eat an entire box together.<eos> Willa?<eos> Arthur needs Holden.<eos> In all that time you two are spending together,
Charlene Singer!<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Charlene is my father.<eos> Call me Charlie.<eos> Perhaps you thought you could hide or mark cards here.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> My team is the finest in the world.<eos> Yeah, they seem outstanding.<eos> What do you want with me?<eos> You cleared 1.7 million in winnings.

- Oh.<eos> Please.<eos> Oh, it is so nice to finally meet one of Holden's friends.<eos> Now I know where he's sneaking off to.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> He's been on my case about having dinner with you all and I... I keep bailing.<eos> - But he finally wore me down.<eos> - Oh, well, good.<eos> When Holden puts his mind to something, you'd better watch out.<eos> I'm happy you two found each other.
Here. Your father and I figured that you needed an upgrade from the bike in case you want to go somewhere on a rainy day.<eos> Wait, thi... this is mine?<eos> - Wh... Thank you! - Oh-ho-ho-ho!<eos> - Mom!<eos> - I put new gaskets in her, new filters, she still needs new brake pads and tires.<eos> Probably a new fan belt, water pump.<eos> I thought we could fix her up together.<eos> You know, be our new project.<eos> - You okay with that?<eos> - -Dad, I drive a glorified bike and you just gave me a truck!
I'm Willa.<eos> We emailed about your time working with Arthur.<eos> Um, Dr. Foreman and Dr. Frost.<eos> I volunteered for testing.<eos> The breakup was very ugly.<eos> Arthur repudiated everything.<eos> But the whole idea of using science and technology to reach the afterlife, Dr. Frost was simply taking Arthur's idea to the next level.<eos> Oh, it was Arthur's idea?<eos> Didn't your grandpa tell you?<eos> How do you...

Greatest book I've read in ages.<eos> A masterpiece.<eos> It's as if you're writing about me.<eos> No empty glasses<eos> No empty glasses.<eos> This is from my personal stock.<eos> Good evening, everyone.<eos> I'm Harold Ober.<eos> The greatest literary agent an an author could ask for.<eos> It's easy when you represent such remarkable authors.
Oh, I've never been much of an Edna.<eos> And no one would call me a saint.<eos> Well, I've read all your poetry.<eos> I'm sure I'm one of your biggest fans.<eos> "My candle burns at both ends;<eos> "It will not last the night;<eos> "But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends...<eos> It gives a lovely light!"<eos> Oh, it's just gorgeous.<eos> How lovely, you memorized all four lines.
However, the Biltmore also awaits.<eos> Payment for a certain room?<eos> 1815?<eos> So perhaps a story for, say, "Collier's" or "McCall's."<eos> Every magazine is clamoring for your next short story.<eos> It's your bread and butter.<eos> Who's bread and butter?<eos> Submit a story that they've already rejected.<eos> See if the name Fitzgerald means something to them now.<eos> And as to the advance, you realize that it's meetings like this that take up all my writing time.
But Broun hates me.<eos> Only until he hears you read.<eos> Well, they just keep coming and going.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?<eos> Anything you ladies would like to try on, we're at your service.<eos> Zelda?<eos> No, no.<eos> Now, this.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Now, Zelda, where would you wear at thing like that?
Your dear husband is just going to lose his mind when he sees you in your new suit.<eos> - Ladies?<eos> - Waldorf salad, thank you.<eos> Could the kitchen make me some tomato finger sandwiches?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, what's the point of a dress if it doesn't send a man straight to the asylum?<eos> God bless Scott for knowing something clothing.<eos> I swear, I could wear a burlap sack and Harold wouldn't even blink.<eos> When did you and Scott talk about fashion?

Thankfully people read the paper for other reasons.<eos> Door was open.<eos> You're missing the reading.<eos> And so are you.<eos> There'll be others.<eos> Drink?<eos> "Youth is like having a big plate of candy."<eos> "Sentimentalists... "...think that they want to be in the pure, simple state "they were in... before they"...<eos> - "They don't"...<eos> - Could you speak up lease?
If you wore this... you'd be the snazziest bird at the Ritz.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much.<eos> I know you're an author, not an actor.<eos> Good God, Ober, is that the best you got.<eos> In this case, yes.<eos> It will no doubt be immortalized by... There's the little prick now.<eos> Goddamn bottom feeder.<eos> Fitzgerald, I don't think this is the time.<eos> Mr. Broun.<eos> I think I understand why you became a critic.
Fitzgerald, I don't think this is the time.<eos> Mr. Broun.<eos> I think I understand why you became a critic.<eos> You understand everything, I imagine.<eos> I can smell it on your breath.<eos> People like you don't have to sweat and toil to create something for the ages.<eos> Come on, Fitzgerald, let's go.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why don't you run along? No.<eos> All you do is you sit around and you wait for a man braver than yourself to attempt greatness, and then you rip him to shreds.

No.<eos> All you do is you sit around and you wait for a man braver than yourself to attempt greatness, and then you rip him to shreds.<eos> There's no need to take this to a personal place Mr. Fitzgerald.<eos> I reviewed your book, not you.<eos> Lucky for you, I wrote one.<eos> 'Cause without it, all you'd do is sit around and fiddle with your dick.<eos> Scott!<eos> I can see you're upset, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Off into the great abyss of the forgotten.<eos> That's exactly why I didn't like your writing.<eos> You have such a gift for cliché.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Hello, madam. Hello.<eos> I'm meeting the Bankheads.<eos> They're in the back.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Will you look at that?
- Oh, thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Will you look at that?<eos> - Gorgeous.<eos> Darling.<eos> I love your suit.<eos> Je l'aime bien!<eos> I'm shocked she got out of bed this morning.<eos> I would have slept till I was dead.<eos> What are you two going on about?
Her hemlines don't help.<eos> The real crime is her hair.<eos> Who let her cut it all off?<eos> She says she did it to be "modern."<eos> I heard it was a nasty case of ringworm.<eos> She rarely bathes.<eos> Is that why she's been wearing a turban?<eos> A happy accident.<eos> At least the turban gives her a look.<eos> Mrs. Fitzgerald, do you have a thought?
Well, darling, it's not like the lady is here.<eos> And it's not like the lady's a lady.<eos> Maybe she is dreadful. I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry she stole your beau, Vincent.<eos> You seem terribly broken up over it.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I'm finding it hard to breathe.<eos> Miss!<eos> No!<eos> Your hair!<eos> What are you doing?
- You want us to act in it? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - That's absurd.<eos> - I've already spoken to my colleagues at United Artists about it.<eos> You spoke to them about Paradise?<eos> Yes, because I would adapt it, obviously.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Well, who else would you want to write it?<eos> I mean the point is UA loves the idea.<eos> It makes sense to them.<eos> You're both already in the public eye.
- Sure, sure.<eos> Listen, we're gonna take a minute, sweetheart, and change the lens, come in for the close-up.<eos> Should I offer to smoke or something?<eos> - I've been practicing...<eos> - Oh, no need.<eos> No, just... just be yourself, Zelda.<eos> Standing here all alone, I... And these lights are so hot.<eos> I didn't realize.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Okay, you ready, sweetheart?
My desk beckons.<eos> Where are we?<eos> About two feet above the floor.<eos> Let's stay.<eos> It's like a museum.<eos> Zelda, we gotta get home.<eos> - They're finally awake.<eos> - Harvey.<eos> - So, this is your place.<eos> - You broke my elevator.
Uh, Mr. Fitzgerald.<eos> - Oh. - Do you have a moment?<eos> - Mr. Fitzgerald. - Mm.<eos> - Moment of your time, sir.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We have something to discuss.<eos> We'll keep it down.<eos> It's a writing day today.<eos> But tonight's a different story.<eos> Let's see how fast you can get it to 8.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, and...<eos> There is a baby that has been squawling for an hour.<eos> Please do something to make it stop.<eos> I don't hear a baby, sir.<eos> You don't?<eos> Well, it's off and on.<eos> It...<eos> It's maddening.<eos> Well, you could play some music, sir.
There's nothing more glorious than Princeton in the spring.<eos> There's such a magnificent laziness about the place.<eos> Which you contributed legendarily.<eos> Princeton.<eos> Scott Fitzgerald has returned.<eos> Princeton!<eos> I have returned!<eos> Princeton, take cover.<eos> Ludlow, always good to see you.<eos> Bunny, I hear you're climbing the ladder of a serious publication.
Monty's chairman of Cottage Club, class of 70...<eos> I'm told your book was an overnight success.<eos> And it's all about this beloved institution.<eos> Yes, he was, uh, a young man that was a student.<eos> Well, kudos.<eos> Princeton rarely offers speaking engagements to people who...<eos> How shall I say politely?<eos> Who left before graduating.<eos> Well, I had malaria, uh, you see.<eos> Well, I see you've recovered.

How shall I say politely?<eos> Who left before graduating.<eos> Well, I had malaria, uh, you see.<eos> Well, I see you've recovered.<eos> Everyone says you're nothing if not persistent.<eos> And you, sweet girl, are...<eos> Gloria Seymour, Scott's mistress.<eos> I'm much younger and lovelier than the old bat he keeps at home.<eos> Yes, it's, uh... it's an arrangement that works for everyone.<eos> You must excuse us, Monty, but I'm struck with this sudden and ferocious need to copulate.
And you'll do it again.<eos> I thought there, uh... might be a display.<eos> History.<eos> Fiction.<eos> Voila!<eos> Oh, Gloria.<eos> Yes?<eos> I, too, find myself stirred.<eos> I'm sorry, I was just...<eos> Ah, and who are you, young man?
I don't know what you're talkin' about, Goofo.<eos> You're the best selling author of the year, and no one's taking that away from you.<eos> Lawrence, tell us what you like most about Scott's book.<eos> Well, uh... - it captures youth. - Mm-hm.<eos> And it takes a hatchet to everything else.<eos> Unlike all the books they make us read here.<eos> Here, here.<eos> I made myself a summer reading list.<eos> Mackenzie, Wells.<eos> All the authors Professor Bailey said you borrowed from.
Just to be judged and humiliated?<eos> Professor Gauss invited you.<eos> He believes in you.<eos> Here. Here.<eos> Sign this for Lawrence.<eos> Another writer's book?<eos> Mackenzie inspired you, and you inspired Lawrence.<eos> Isn't that right, Lawrence?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - You can't do that.
We're ready for you.<eos> Should we wait for the rest of the department?<eos> Oh, uh, no. I believe we're all here.<eos> There's a baseball game this afternoon.<eos> I wrote.<eos> I wrote this novel.<eos> But it's not a book that any of you will ever assign or value. Or even understand.<eos> No book of mine will ever be.<eos> And all the writing I've done, and will do, is in spite of you.<eos> You teach with two goals:

With your designs taking off and me selling my software to Lucas.<eos> We bought the loft.<eos> I'm gonna get ready for the party.<eos> You're not even going to say hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I was getting worried.<eos> I thought maybe you changed your mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So... how do you feel about Thai takeout for dinner?
- My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...<eos> 'Cause that would be weird.<eos> We thought we'd spent a night in Provence with you guys.<eos> We're just jealous that you're going to France and we're not.<eos> This Italian city off the coast of Venice is known for its glassmaking.<eos> - Murano?<eos> - Yes!<eos> My God!<eos> So are you nervous?

- Thanks.<eos> - I could use your help.<eos> How many people does it take to make mojito?<eos> Two.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You and Caleb are sitting so far apart that you could be in different time zones.<eos> Mona's living with us.<eos> I'm her sponsor.<eos> - What?<eos> Why would you do that?
- What?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> - She doesn't have anyone else.<eos> I'm not trying to take Caleb's side here, but...<eos> Then don't.<eos> I'm the one who made her play the game.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> Hanna, do you know the Greek myth about the girl who tried to escape from hell?<eos> There's only one rule.<eos> You don't look back.
This is our first time out in months.<eos> Exactly, which is why you and I should go back to our room.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> - Subtle.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Babe, we should go too.<eos> Guys, yeah.<eos> Call it a night too.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> You tired?
- Subtle.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Babe, we should go too.<eos> Guys, yeah.<eos> Call it a night too.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> You tired?<eos> No, not really.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> You're partner at your mother's law firm...
Babe, we should go too.<eos> Guys, yeah.<eos> Call it a night too.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> You tired?<eos> No, not really.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> You're partner at your mother's law firm...<eos> As a paralegal.<eos> And you're going to law school fulltime.

Yeah, I am.<eos> Melissa and I are finally getting along and my mom and I are so close.<eos> And it's real, and it's solid and...<eos> I never knew how badly I wanted that until I had it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the leaves of a shrub that you chew like tobacco.<eos> Okay.<eos> Still reading the dictionary for fun?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You know I'm here for you, right?

Everything okay?<eos> You know I'm here for you, right?<eos> What?<eos> Just want you to know that you're always our family.<eos> Why are you getting so sentimental, all of a sudden?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I'll stop.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm trying to create a vibe here and it definitely is not sweet.<eos> So, have you made any other major life decisions that might affect me or should I just wait to be surprised?

Can we not do this right now?<eos> You're stressing me out and it's bad for my body.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> Well, can it wait half hour?<eos> I'm trying to get pregnant.<eos> That is exactly why we need to talk about this.<eos> Fine.<eos> Talk.<eos> But, can you do it at a low volume?<eos> You're scaring my ovaries.
Talk.<eos> But, can you do it at a low volume?<eos> You're scaring my ovaries.<eos> Hanna, I'm a passenger in our marriage.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> - Well, it feels like it.<eos> With Sylvia Plath as our new roommate and even my sex drive is dictated by your ovulation app.<eos> Hold on, Mona and "Trying to have a baby" are two very different things.<eos> Maybe they're not.<eos> I mean, if you don't care how I feel about one then maybe you're not ready to do the other.
Hold on, Mona and "Trying to have a baby" are two very different things.<eos> Maybe they're not.<eos> I mean, if you don't care how I feel about one then maybe you're not ready to do the other.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Aria?<eos> My God, what's wrong?<eos> I can't marry Ezra.<eos> I know it's hard, but you have to tell him.
Are you sure?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Aria?<eos> My God, what's wrong?<eos> I can't marry Ezra.<eos> I know it's hard, but you have to tell him.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Our rehearsal dinner's tomorrow.<eos> Are you sure you wanna go through a ceremony holding on to something like that?
I can't do that.<eos> Our rehearsal dinner's tomorrow.<eos> Are you sure you wanna go through a ceremony holding on to something like that?<eos> This isn't up for debate.<eos> But Aria is hiding this from him.<eos> We'd be crazy not to use it.<eos> - It's not part of my plan.<eos> - Well, I don't know your plan.<eos> I'm in the dark.<eos> I mean, you asked me to put on the Melissa mask and then you don't even want me to use it.

- I was late.<eos> II thought I was pregnant.<eos> - Aria...<eos> - I can't have kids.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Mona?<eos> Mona?<eos> Great.<eos> She skipped out on you.<eos> - Caleb, who are you calling?
It's alright.<eos> Mona?<eos> Mona?<eos> Great.<eos> She skipped out on you.<eos> - Caleb, who are you calling?<eos> - The cops.<eos> I told you this would happen.<eos> How was the party?<eos> - Didn't you hear us? - No.

No, thanks. I ate.<eos> I've missed you, sweetheart.<eos> It's been weeks since your last visit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I missed you, too, mom.<eos> We're gonna get through this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Tomorrow's supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives.<eos> It will be.<eos> You still plannin' on marrying' me tomorrow, right?
I'm sorry.<eos> Tomorrow's supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives.<eos> It will be.<eos> You still plannin' on marrying' me tomorrow, right?<eos> Then nothing's changed.<eos> I love you and we are going to have a family.<eos> We will... adopt or we get a surrogate.<eos> We'll do whatever we have to.<eos> Okay?<eos> How are you doing?
Then nothing's changed.<eos> I love you and we are going to have a family.<eos> We will... adopt or we get a surrogate.<eos> We'll do whatever we have to.<eos> Okay?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Everyday is a challenge.<eos> But I try and keep my spirits up.<eos> I try not to lose hope.<eos> You can say it.
Okay?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Everyday is a challenge.<eos> But I try and keep my spirits up.<eos> I try not to lose hope.<eos> You can say it.<eos> Hope breeds eternal misery.<eos> Well, the old Spencer would have agreed with you but...<eos> I don't believe that anymore.<eos> How are you holding up?
You can say it.<eos> Hope breeds eternal misery.<eos> Well, the old Spencer would have agreed with you but...<eos> I don't believe that anymore.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> Mona, I didn't know you would be coming tonight.
I need your help.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> Mona, I didn't know you would be coming tonight.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> Well, we thought it was a good opportunity for Mona to come here and reconnect with everyone.<eos> Drinks?<eos> I'm not allowed to have alcohol but I could go for a cocktail wiener.<eos> - Hanna, what were you thinking?

Please, for one night, can you just fake it?<eos> I can do that.<eos> What is this?<eos> This is a 40yearold single malt scotch.<eos> It's a wedding present from my grandfather and I've hidden the bottle in the back.<eos> Wow, this is, um...<eos> Cheers.<eos> Aah!<eos> I never asked for your blessing.<eos> Well, if that's what's happening now, I gotta say you've left it down to the wire.

You remember how we got out of there?<eos> You know, Pam didn't drink for a year after that.<eos> - Forget I brought it up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> So, when do I get to meet the girls?<eos> Anytime you wanna babysit.<eos> With four girls in the house, we could use a nanny.<eos> Hey, call it whatever you want just know I'm always here for you.
Is this about Addison?<eos> Because she is nice to me.<eos> And I don't wanna be on the other side of that.<eos> Your aunt had a real confidence to her and that's what I loved.<eos> Maya was kind.<eos> She picked me.<eos> It wasn't the other way around.<eos> And you don't say no to someone like Addison.<eos> I mean, she'd have to be, like, dead first.<eos> - You're takin' off?

Somehow I got roped into being my mom's designated driver.<eos> What are you doing on Sunday?<eos> I'm going riding.<eos> You want company?<eos> I told you I'd give it a try.<eos> Yeah, that was like six years ago.<eos> Well, maybe I just took some time to get used to the idea.<eos> I meant to congratulate you on winning the game.<eos> We never finished it.<eos> You did while I was asleep.
- We have to...<eos> We have to make a couple of extra stops.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hi, Toby.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I call shotgun.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but... don't take for granted the people who love you the most just because they sometimes let you.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> You're my daughter and I will always be on your side.

Marin, will you get in the car?<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Love you, mom.<eos> Pile in.<eos> It's finally happening.<eos> This is a little surreal.<eos> I know.<eos> We're actually getting married.<eos> Hey, Aria.<eos> It would be really encouraging for me if every time we bring up the topic of our wedding you don't look like you're about to burst into tears.
We have options.<eos> I remember a friend of the family.<eos> She's a fertility specialist.<eos> After this weekend's done, we'll go to her.<eos> We'll get a second opinion...<eos> This was a second opinion.<eos> In fact, it was the third opinion.<eos> I went to two other doctors and they said the same thing.<eos> They did?<eos> How, how long have you known?

Yes.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can.<eos> I'm sorry, I'ml'm just tired and it's been a very emotional day.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come upstairs, let's talk.<eos> No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.
No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> But it's not really the same thing, is it?<eos> What, are they still sleeping?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've barely said two words to me all night.

I mean, it was pretty loud in there.<eos> She put something in your purse.<eos> What was it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Breath mints?<eos> I mean, your mom's pretty passive aggressive and there were onions on those sliders.<eos> My mom avoided me all night.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Ali, we're not going to sleep until you tell me what's in that purse.

Tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor.<eos> The secret is cooking at a high...<eos> Hey, you're awake?<eos> Yeah, I'm not tired.<eos> - What are you watching?<eos> - I can't tell.<eos> It's either a really bad comedy about chefs or a really good infomercial about deep fryers.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't know what else to say, Hanna.<eos> The decisions you make don't just affect you.
Actually, let's not talk.<eos> Hanna.<eos> I hear you, okay?<eos> I'm gonna tell Mona that it's not gonna work out.<eos> I'm not sayin' you can't help her.<eos> I'll help you help her.<eos> - We just need our own space.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'll tell her first thing in the morning.<eos> You can deal with Mona until then, right?
I'll help you help her.<eos> - We just need our own space.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'll tell her first thing in the morning.<eos> You can deal with Mona until then, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> How much damage can she do in one night?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> You wanna make a baby?
How much damage can she do in one night?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> You wanna make a baby?<eos> - Now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You could just leave the cart outside.<eos> Coffee?<eos> At this hour?<eos> You'll be up all night.
- Yeah.<eos> You could just leave the cart outside.<eos> Coffee?<eos> At this hour?<eos> You'll be up all night.<eos> Toby, is that you?<eos> Mona.<eos> Deja vu, bitch.<eos> Boo!<eos> We didn't think you'd wake up so soon, Spencer.
Mary?<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> I really need your discretion on this.<eos> Clearly, it was very last minute.<eos> Um, so if you could just keep it quiet?<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> - Ezra.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?
And if Mary Drake does try to reach out to you...<eos> This has to be a joke.<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, our friend's getting married today.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us. II promise we'll let you know immediately.<eos> You should know she's probably not alone.<eos> She needed help to get out.<eos> So you and your friends should stay vigilant.<eos> Well, you missed breakfast but mum's planning a special lunch.

You know, first her, then you, then her, then me.<eos> Yeah, it's a lot to process.<eos> Would you like a sedative?<eos> Is Wren a part of this?<eos> The threats, the torture, your twisted board game?<eos> After Charlotte died, I needed closure.<eos> I wanted it on my own terms.<eos> Wren let me come to Rosewood alone 'cause he knew that I would come back to him.<eos> And after I found out who killed Charlotte that's just what I did.<eos> Yet here you are.

- You've got this.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I think I'm dying here.<eos> - No, I won't let that happen.<eos> Toby, can I kiss you?<eos> Just one last time.<eos> Just to say goodbye.<eos> Like mother, like daughter.<eos> That's what you and Mary were arguing about.<eos> She pretended to be Jessica to sleep with my father and now you're pretending to be me to sleep with Toby?

I'm honoring her.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> I get everything about you.<eos> And I miss you.<eos> I miss us.<eos> Ezra!<eos> God.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I don't think you've ever met Wren Kingston.
- Hello.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> I made good on my promise to Wren that night.<eos> And when the game was over, I went back to London.<eos> But I just...<eos> I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.<eos> About how good you have it.<eos> About how much your friends love you.<eos> And it was just driving me mad and, and Wren saw it happening.<eos> Alex, you mean everything to me.

You have Charlotte's money now.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> This isn't about money, okay?<eos> This is about having a home and parents and friends who risk their lives for each other.<eos> Even when they make mistakes even when they make huge mistakes they still love each other. I just...<eos> Please, I want to know what that feels like.<eos> - So you tell them the truth.<eos> - Come on.<eos> And when they hear your story, they'll understand.<eos> You're joking, right?

After everything I put them through.<eos> - You're joking.<eos> - Alex, come on.<eos> I can never be one of them.<eos> Not as Alex.<eos> Wren, do you love me?<eos> Till death do us apart.<eos> Come on!<eos> Alex!<eos> If you love me, then shoot me.
With Wren.<eos> But no matter what, he always thought of me as Alex and I just, I didn't wanna be her anymore.<eos> So you, you broke up with him?<eos> No.<eos> No, I can never do that.<eos> But he is always close by.<eos> I turned his ashes into an eternity stone.<eos> Because diamonds last forever.<eos> Sorry, I've got to go get ready.<eos> Um, hey, how are you planning on wearing your hair for the wedding?
That was the state police.<eos> Still no leads on Mary.<eos> How could that happen?<eos> Look, somebody had to have helped her.<eos> Well, my mom hired extra security for today, so I don't think that we should be telling Aria until after the wedding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I agree.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Hashtag Aria's wedding dress.<eos> Em, are you crying?

Well, I couldn't have imagined this day without you guys.<eos> Let's take a selfie before the photographer gets here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Sorry, girls.<eos> She's a little muzzy, so I thought I'd bring her in to see mommies.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Hi.<eos> Aria, you look so beautiful.

I'm a wanted convict for Archie Dunhill's murder.<eos> A crime I didn't commit, remember?<eos> I took the blame for you and your friends so I think I deserve a little trust.<eos> I thought we could have lunch together.<eos> I took a lover in Peru who owned a little restaurant that made the most exquisite saltado de pollo.<eos> I'm the only person he ever shared the recipe with.<eos> So where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She gave me something to sleep and the next thing I knew, I woke up here.<eos> But you're safe, Spencer.

But you're safe, Spencer.<eos> She promised me.<eos> And in time, you'll earn her trust and she'll let you out of your room.<eos> Why didn't you ever tell me about her?<eos> Until a few weeks ago when she came to visit me I didn't know where she was or if she was even alive.<eos> Nurse, hurry.<eos> Coming now.<eos> What your parents didn't know was that there was a second child.<eos> Dr. Cochran arranged for Alex's adoption in exchange for half of the money.<eos> You sold her?

The irony hasn't been wasted on me.<eos> Apparently, Alex had some issues.<eos> And when she was still young enough to forget them her parents left her at an orphanage.<eos> They couldn't risk tarnishing their names so they, they even took that back and she was given her birth name.<eos> Alex Drake.<eos> She ran away from the Ambrose Home for wayward children on her tenth birthday.<eos> A year before I found out she was there.<eos> Can you imagine how alone she must have felt?<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> There is nothing more that I would love than to hold you, Spencer but she would never forgive me if you got out.

He let you down.<eos> And after we make sure that he's okay I'm going to wring his neck.<eos> - Should we tell the guests?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Should we?<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Aria, you should probably try calling him again.<eos> Ezra, I know that you're there.
Aria, you should probably try calling him again.<eos> Ezra, I know that you're there.<eos> Please pick up.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Why isn't Ezra here?<eos> - Ezra sent Aria a text.<eos> - He's not coming.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, can you hear me?<eos> Are you okay?
Please pick up.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Why isn't Ezra here?<eos> - Ezra sent Aria a text.<eos> - He's not coming.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, can you hear me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Ezra?<eos> I was making the reservation you suggested and when I thanked her for the information she seemed confused.
- He's not coming.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, can you hear me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Ezra?<eos> I was making the reservation you suggested and when I thanked her for the information she seemed confused.<eos> Like she didn't know what I was talking about.<eos> So out of concern, I followed around and when I pressed her for answers, she just turned and just gave me this death stare.<eos> And that was the last thing that I remember.<eos> - Are you okay?
Sorry, sarcasm is my brain's selfdefense mechanism for whenever I'm about to be murdered.<eos> That was Spencer.<eos> She's gonna swing by the apartment and get you something to wear.<eos> My mom's sleeping over, so we're gonna stay with you, okay?<eos> Aria.<eos> Ezra.<eos> Still no word?<eos> Hello, sister.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you don't have to do this.
Ezra.<eos> Still no word?<eos> Hello, sister.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you don't have to do this.<eos> Can we have some privacy, please?<eos> Wait, wait, no, no.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look, we both understand why you became A.D.
Stop.<eos> Look, we both understand why you became A.D.<eos> You and I actually met once.<eos> Ezra?<eos> I don't think you've met Wren Kingston.<eos> Wren was almost my brotherinlaw a couple of times.<eos> Have a drink with us.<eos> No, stop, stop!<eos> Look, he's right.<eos> You don't have to do this.

Okay, they'll forgive you just like we forgave Mona.<eos> So what?<eos> This isn't just about you wanting my friends.<eos> It's about Toby, isn't it?<eos> He settled for Yvonne.<eos> We both know that.<eos> And now he's free to be with his one true love.<eos> Me.<eos> So then what's gonna happen now?<eos> You can't just keep me here forever.

See, Charlotte left me everything.<eos> So Jenna wanted money?<eos> Well, she was desperate for one last chance to stay.<eos> She doesn't know who I am, but she offered to help me and I kept my promise.<eos> I paid for her surgery.<eos> She's still as blind as a bat and useless to me.<eos> What about Sara Harvey?<eos> Was she looking for you too?<eos> Well, Charlotte told Sara that she hid her greatest treasure in The Radley and Sara thought that she was talkin' about some pot of gold.<eos> But what she meant was that fall you found.

No, I do not.<eos> Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.<eos> And I'm not going to wait three days.<eos> I'll ring you tomorrow.<eos> Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - Yeah, her plane just landed.<eos> She's waiting for you in the bar.<eos> And how do you know that she's my sister?
I'll ring you tomorrow.<eos> Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - Yeah, her plane just landed.<eos> She's waiting for you in the bar.<eos> And how do you know that she's my sister?<eos> Her name's Alex Drake, just like the birth certificate you found in your mom's Radley file.<eos> I found 12 Alex Drakes and I'm not related to any of them.<eos> Yeah, wait till you see her.
He adored her.<eos> So he was on the A team too?<eos> No, that stunt that he pulled with Alison?<eos> No, that was all him.<eos> He found Mary and convinced her it was what Charlotte would have wanted and it probably was.<eos> She loved him.<eos> Before she came back to Rosewood, the four of us<eos> Charlotte and Archer, Wren and me we did everything together.<eos> But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?

I wanna meet her.<eos> No.<eos> You are to stay as far away from the Hastings as possible.

I wanna meet her.<eos> No.<eos> You are to stay as far away from the Hastings as possible.<eos> They're terrible people.<eos> Are you sure you're not just keeping her for yourself?
I'm gonna miss my flight.<eos> No, I'll drive you.<eos> It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> I love you, Alex.<eos> I'll always take care of you.<eos> She never came back to London.<eos> And the next time I saw her, I was visiting her grave.<eos> Alex, why do you think she never wanted us to meet?

Story time's over.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> So I'm still alive because I'm your sister but what's gonna happen to Ezra?<eos> Well, he's not family, so...<eos> Enjoy his company while you can.<eos> I think that you and I are gonna be the closest of all.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?

Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Easy.<eos> Are you okay?
Well, Ezra's booked us yesterday to take him and his wife up to kick off their honeymoon.<eos> When yesterday?<eos> Morning around, 10 o'clock through The Radley concierge.<eos> Why would Ezra book you on a hot air balloon ride if he wasn't planning on marrying you?<eos> Do you think it'll help because she needs to be stopped?<eos> If nothing else, just the threat of a civil case could be enough to force her parents to accept some responsibility for Addison's actions.<eos> Thank you, Veronica.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're just a rock star, that's all.

Yeah, you're just a rock star, that's all.<eos> Well, you've never called me that before, but I'll take it.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Thank you for setting this up, Spencer.<eos> Yeah, I hope we can help.<eos> Is that a new perfume you're wearing?<eos> It's called horse hair.<eos> I was at the stables this morning with Toby.<eos> Well, maybe you can convince him to stay for a while.
Well, maybe you can convince him to stay for a while.<eos> Yeah, I think I'd like to try.<eos> - Thanks again.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Call Toby.<eos> Toby, um, I know this may sound weird... but I don't think Spencer's Spencer.<eos> I hacked into all of his credit card accounts.<eos> Ezra hasn't spent a dime since he sent the text to Aria.<eos> He didn't buy gas, he didn't rent a room or buy a plane ticket.<eos> So you think he's still in Rosewood?
If Spencer had a twin... that would make her Charlotte's half sister.<eos> And someone with the motivation to be A.D.<eos> Okay, are we really saying that A.D. is back?<eos> Yeah, that she's Spencer's evil twin?<eos> That who's doing this to us?<eos> I mean, out of all the insane theories we've jumped to Spencer having an evil twin has got to be the most insane.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - My head is gonna explode.<eos> It's time for plan B.<eos> You need to tell me who you are and where you are.
It's time for plan B.<eos> You need to tell me who you are and where you are.<eos> - I won't let you do this.<eos> - Shut up, mom.<eos> - I'm begging you, please.<eos> - Come on, Spencer.<eos> Ezra, I have done this before.<eos> - I've got this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Alex, you promised me that you wouldn't hurt her.
It'll be painless.<eos> We can leave now and still get away.<eos> Let's take a motherdaughter trip to Europe.<eos> No!<eos> I'm not going anywhere without Toby.<eos> Right, I see it in his eyes he's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with Spencer, not you.<eos> Well, I am Spencer now!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know what it's like to want something so badly that you start to believe that it's true.

So you lied to me?<eos> You're still playing the game with her.<eos> No, Hanna.<eos> I'm playing to beat her.<eos> - And now I know where she is.<eos> - Where is that?<eos> North 39.5752. West 71.2857.<eos> That's here in Rosewood.<eos> 492 Hart Street.<eos> Wait, Toby, isn't that your house, the one you built?
I'm your sister, just like Charlotte.<eos> I'm sorry that you got the wrong end of the deal.<eos> I'm sorry you got the wrong end of the deal.<eos> It's not too late to be a family.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Ezra!<eos> Toby, it's me. Spencer.<eos> Don't listen to her!<eos> Look at me, you know me.
Yeah, it is.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Ezra!<eos> Toby, it's me. Spencer.<eos> Don't listen to her!<eos> Look at me, you know me.<eos> You guys, come on, seriously.<eos> After everything that we've been through.<eos> My God.<eos> You really do believe what you're saying.

You really do believe what you're saying.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me your favorite poem from the book you gave me?<eos> I called 911.<eos> Mary Drake's already in custody.<eos> We caught her a few blocks from here.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Well, no one can call you loser Mona anymore.<eos> You don't know the half of it.
I don't need tissues.<eos> Em, today you do.<eos> I, Ezra, take thee, Aria to have and to hold from this day forward... for better, for worse for richer, for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> If anyone can show a just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> By the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Fitz.<eos> I was looking online and your first class seats are bigger than our bedroom.<eos> And you have to get the duck.
By the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Fitz.<eos> I was looking online and your first class seats are bigger than our bedroom.<eos> And you have to get the duck.<eos> If they're flying it in from Peking, it has to be...<eos> Han, that's how the duck is prepared.<eos> It's not actually from Peking.<eos> Okay, you don't know that for sure, Spencer.
It's not actually from Peking.<eos> Okay, you don't know that for sure, Spencer.<eos> Yes, I do because Peking is now Beijing.<eos> Well, then they should call it Beijing duck.<eos> I'm gonna get the duck, Han.<eos> We heard Toby's sticking around.<eos> Yeah, um, Jason said that he's got that veteran's program in Philly.<eos> Yeah, if it works out, they should, um get a lot of homeless people off the streets.<eos> Yeah, and Toby is gonna keep climbing into your sheets.<eos> Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?
Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?<eos> - No! I'm, I'm happy for you.<eos> - We all are.<eos> I've always loved you two together.<eos> Is it actually possible that all of us are happy at the same time?<eos> My God, don't say that out loud, it's a jinx.<eos> Well, then I guess I can't say this other thing.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> No, I promised Caleb I wouldn't say anything.<eos> Okay, just because you're married doesn't mean you can have secrets.

You're okay with that, right?<eos> Hanna, of course.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Besides, we're right behind you.<eos> When we get back from our trip we're gonna meet with an adoption agency.<eos> - Just don't say anything.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> It's Ezra.<eos> The car is here.<eos> Well, you're gonna send us a ton of photos, right?
What stars are the eyes of the angels.<eos> Who looked after us.<eos> But when my mother was ill, none of them helped.<eos> Then I realized that no one was there.<eos> Silence.<eos> Emptiness.<eos> And cold.<eos> All right, let's go. (Dog barks)<eos> Quiet.<eos> Charl, what are you looking at?
Let's go to!<eos> Subtitles:<eos> Bonnie.<eos> (Teacher)<eos> - At all times, meteor showers frightened people.<eos> Understand that for the guests visited the earth's atmosphere.<eos> It was possible relatively recently.<eos> And earlier cosmic stones, strongly associated with "God's punishment".<eos> Well, how are you?<eos> Well, Che did not you tell that?

Ah, America.<eos> You beacon of composure and proportionate response.<eos> You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.<eos> What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?
- Glen.<eos> - Pat.<eos> Great to see you. You know Dick Waddle, of course.<eos> - Dick.<eos> - Glen.<eos> Ray Canucci.<eos> - Ray.<eos> - Glen.<eos> Grab a seat, boys.<eos> I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.

I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.<eos> Okay, fine...<eos> That's fair.<eos> My apologies.<eos> - Have you settled in, Glen?<eos> - No, Pat, I haven't.<eos> Seems to me that too much settling in might somehow be at the heart of the problem we have here.<eos> Small talk.<eos> Should've gone with the weather.<eos> Glen, the president wants you to get the lay of the land here.

Now, given your reputation and your formidable drive, our hope is that you're the man who will get the job done.<eos> First things first.<eos> We want you to make an assessment of the situation here.<eos> Travel the country, talk to people.<eos> At the end of that assessment, you'll tell us what needs to be done, how you're gonna get it done and what you need in order to get it done.<eos> - So, now...<eos> - To that end...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Oh, you go.<eos> - I thought you were finished.

I've seen the country.<eos> To get inside the mind of Glen McMahon, you really need first to get a handle on the madness of modern American war.<eos> Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.<eos> Welcome to Kandahar, sir.<eos> Nice to meet you, Frank.<eos> I'm here to get the lay of the land.<eos> Counterinsurgency.<eos> In the good old days, wars were fought against conventional armies from nation states.<eos> Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.<eos> When, however, you've just gone and invaded a place that you probably shouldn't have, you end up fighting against just regular people in regular-people clothes.

Yeah, they could grow cotton.<eos> Cotton would grow here.<eos> - Why don't they grow cotton then?<eos> - Because the United States Congress will not allow any United States aid and development funds to be directed towards the cultivation of a crop that will end up on the world market in competition with US farmers.<eos> - Which pretty much rules out cotton.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - So we're growing heroin instead.<eos> - Right.<eos> I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.<eos> You build infrastructure.
- Sure.<eos> - So we're growing heroin instead.<eos> - Right.<eos> I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.<eos> You build infrastructure.<eos> Roads, schools, stuff like that.<eos> What kind of presence does the Taliban have here?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The Taliban.<eos> In short, you get off your bases and you go make friends with the people.
So we just have to sit tight.<eos> Why don't you do that SNORPP thing you did in Iraq?<eos> You know, get your systems in place, get everybody talking together.<eos> The time will fly, you know?<eos> Get everybody excited.<eos> You know, you're the best in the business at this stuff.<eos> We've been operating at an extremely high optempo.<eos> In the last week, we've conducted six air assaults into previously denied territories.<eos> We're also in final coordination with RC South to develop an ops box in the seams existing along the provincial border.<eos> You got that Lexus?
They all look alike to me.<eos> I'm pretty sure they're the same people, sir.<eos> I understand it can be tough, son, but that's the job.<eos> I have another question.<eos> I hear now they're giving out medals for heroic restraint.<eos> Do I have that right?<eos> Courageous restraint.<eos> And that is right.<eos> Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.<eos> It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.

Traction?<eos> We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.<eos> - I gotta get me some traction.<eos> - You need cut through.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Cut through.<eos> You need to get me some goddamn cut through.<eos> I can handle that for you, sir.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?
Cut through.<eos> You need to get me some goddamn cut through.<eos> I can handle that for you, sir.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?<eos> I'll quieten this whole situation down.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.<eos> And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.<eos> But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?<eos> Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.
You've spoken to the president once in, what, 70 days?<eos> That's right.<eos> You're the leader of US forces in Afghanistan, and you have spoken to the president once in 70 days?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I'm guessing he's very busy.<eos> Probably.<eos> What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen?<eos> Are you out of your mind?

Here we go.<eos> Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.<eos> They wanna know if you can spare time for a meeting on Air Force One tomorrow morning.<eos> The president wants some face time.<eos> Now he wants fucking face time.<eos> Fucking dick.<eos> So can you do that, boss?<eos> Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.<eos> The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.<eos> Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.

He's good.<eos> - He sends his love.<eos> - Okay.<eos> He's got a new girlfriend now.<eos> Yeah, I like her.<eos> Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.<eos> Yeah, she's sweet.<eos> You'll like her.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, I think it's just great you're getting to see the president, honey.

I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.<eos> I'm allowing for four solid hours with the president.<eos> If it's less than that, we should be fine to go via the hotel.<eos> I am just contingency planning for the possibility we may be running tight on time.<eos> - Can we move the École Militaire back?<eos> - Not really.<eos> Gonna be a lot of people there.<eos> We have the gala dinner right after.<eos> We don't have any wiggle room here.<eos> You should wear the fatigues to the thing this afternoon.

- Yeah.<eos> - It's very good.<eos> - I like that.<eos> Well, just make sure Willy has my fatigues on standby.<eos> Talking points for the president.<eos> How you doing, Glen?<eos> This one is a bitch, right?<eos> Nothing about war is easy, Pat.<eos> Right on.<eos> Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.<eos> Right on.<eos> Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.<eos> A soldier leading soldiers.<eos> Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.<eos> Just a nice bubble of soldiers.<eos> Just ordered. Right?<eos> 'Cause it has to be.<eos> War is chaos, so then the army has to be the opposite of chaos.<eos> But now you find yourself in the real world.
'Cause it has to be.<eos> War is chaos, so then the army has to be the opposite of chaos.<eos> But now you find yourself in the real world.<eos> Now you're dealing with civilians, and civilians don't make sense.<eos> Not making sense is a luxury I can't afford.<eos> Lives depend on it.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And you can't live in the bubble forever.
Simple.<eos> We either win it or we lose it.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that, Glen.<eos> All the winning we were ever gonna do, we did in the first six months.<eos> And since then, we've just been making a mess.<eos> And that's all it was ever gonna be.<eos> You're not here to win.<eos> You're here to clean up the mess.<eos> You'll get your 40,000 troops.

Tom Howard, sir.<eos> What do you think this dinner is for, Tom Howard?<eos> General, this dinner is to honor you, sir.<eos> Wrong.<eos> This dinner is for Afghanistan.<eos> We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.<eos> And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room<eos> - off my goddamn table?<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.

I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.<eos> Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war, I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.<eos> But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, and I am...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't say that to make you feel bad.<eos> - Why are you thinking about it?
I know.<eos> I know, and I am...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't say that to make you feel bad.<eos> - Why are you thinking about it?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not thinking about it, I promise.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You're calculating days.
I know, and I am...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't say that to make you feel bad.<eos> - Why are you thinking about it?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not thinking about it, I promise.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You're calculating days.<eos> You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.
Yes, you are.<eos> You're calculating days.<eos> You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But I just did that because...<eos> I did it because I was proud of you, honey.<eos> I'm proud of me too. You know?<eos> Yeah, I'm proud of me too.<eos> Do you know?
Yeah.<eos> We can't do Iraq.<eos> He's loud and clear now that we can't do Afghanistan.<eos> We can't do Gitmo.<eos> Where the fuck else we gonna put all these motherfuckers?<eos> That's a great orator.<eos> Right there.<eos> He's sold us on, like a double negative.<eos> Yes, we can not do things.<eos> You know?

This isn't exactly a situation that I've been in before.<eos> Okay, bear with me on this one.<eos> I think I might have just solved our problem.<eos> I really can't tell you why these guys got so loose in front of me.<eos> Or why Glen let them get so loose.<eos> I can only put it down to hubris.<eos> These guys thought they were the most important guys in the world... with the most important jobs in the world.<eos> Maybe they assumed I thought they were as amazing as they did.<eos> What are you writing?<eos> What are you writing?
And I also have a job to do.<eos> And I am trying to do mine.<eos> As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.<eos> You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.<eos> And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.<eos> - This is the great moment of your life.<eos> - Well...<eos> It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious.<eos> It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else.<eos> - Honey, you okay?
I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.<eos> Apart from nothing.<eos> You see this map, Frank?<eos> This one, hmm?<eos> This here is the mess I'm having to clean up.<eos> Now, we've been kind enough to plan this operation in such a way as to not make it look like the Americans are here to get done what you couldn't.<eos> But that is what's happening.<eos> So, Frank... while your input is greatly appreciated...<eos> It is.<eos> I wouldn't want you to think that it isn't.

I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.<eos> You have my approval, General.<eos> We both know it was never really mine to give.<eos> But...<eos> I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.<eos> Good luck tonight, Glen.<eos> Who told you about tonight?<eos> I just mean... whatever you happen to find yourself doing tonight, good luck with it.
Carry that knowledge with you!<eos> Carry it with pride!<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> That's right.<eos> Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Let us pray!<eos> Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.<eos> As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.

Get off the walls.<eos> Now!<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Over there, twelve o'clock!<eos> Cole!<eos> Cole!<eos> I need to see a weapon.<eos> He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.<eos> Fuck, man!<eos> You think this nigga on his morning jog?
The rest of you guys stay put.<eos> Copy?<eos> Copy.<eos> Comin' up!<eos> We got movement, twelve o'clock.<eos> About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.<eos> - Are they armed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's a simple fucking question, Trey.<eos> Do you see a weapon?
Fuck, yeah!<eos> Good job, Cole.<eos> Nice shooting, boys.<eos> - Farrenberg, you hit?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Are you hit?<eos> - No. I'm good.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Fuck this shit!<eos> - Cole, where the fuck are you going?

The fuck...<eos> Cutter's fucking shit up outside.<eos> - All right.<eos> What's the deal here?<eos> - He's saying he didn't know the bad guys.<eos> They just commandeered his house, and there was nothing he could do about it.<eos> Well, that's fucking bullshit.<eos> We did leaflet drops and shit.<eos> He shouldn't still be here.<eos> Why are you still here?
I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.<eos> But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?<eos> It's hip.<eos> And you guys...<eos> You guys are the operators.<eos> You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in like a totally non-square way.<eos> Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.<eos> This was always a terrible idea.<eos> Why you would unnecessarily court attention like this is...<eos> - Simon, can you shut the fuck up?

- Why the fuck not?<eos> Because you're acting crazy!<eos> You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!<eos> You think this is crazy, huh?<eos> - You think this is me being crazy?<eos> - Peter!<eos> Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!<eos> Duckman!<eos> I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.

I'm not gonna be a fucking game show host.<eos> This could be serious money for you, and right now, you need serious money.<eos> I don't have to like you.<eos> You don't have to like me.<eos> - Not to worry.<eos> - I'm excited about this.<eos> Yeah, I know you are.<eos> When I read the thing, I was like,<eos> "Oh, my God, they're making our show."<eos> No, actually, the show Bev and I are doing is vastly different from that thing you and I kicked around.
How could I not, being stuck in a box with young Kathy Bates?<eos> All right, we'll check back in with you soon.<eos> "And Moses said..."<eos> - Danika.<eos> - Hi, Matt.<eos> So, 46 advantages.<eos> More than anyone in the game so far.<eos> - Yay me.<eos> - Everyone's dying to know.<eos> Are you gonna use 'em to do something even worse to Jonathan?

Are you gonna use 'em to do something even worse to Jonathan?<eos> Although I don't know what that could possibly be.<eos> Or are you gonna buy something incredible for yourself?<eos> - I think...<eos> - Wait, wait, don't answer yet.<eos> We'll find out when we come back.<eos> Right after this.<eos> Camera four.<eos> And we're out.<eos> - You are killing it.
And we're out.<eos> - You are killing it.<eos> - Just saying the words.<eos> - It's so fun.<eos> - Such a good show tonight.<eos> What do you think she's gonna do with her advantages?<eos> I don't fucking care.<eos> Ah, and look who's here.<eos> Hey, twice in one week.<eos> Are you kidding?
- Liking those numbers, huh?<eos> Liking 'em?<eos> They're what I think about when I'm screwing my wife.<eos> Whoa, what a great crowd!<eos> I'm gonna show you all a little something that's gonna be hitting the newsstands tomorrow.<eos> Guess who's on the cover of this week's People magazine?<eos> Matt Le Box!<eos> Come on over here.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> You're right up there with JonBenét and some girl who lost 80 pounds.

More important, what do you got for me?<eos> Well, you received a very generous offer from Celebrity Wife Swap.<eos> I'm not doing Wife Swap.<eos> Celebrity Wife Swap.<eos> I'm not even fucking married.<eos> It's a good offer.<eos> - Hey, Matt!<eos> - Ugh, I'm talking about acting.<eos> Look, everybody loves you.<eos> You know that.
It's a nice box.<eos> It's a box full of money.<eos> Matt, 20 seconds.<eos> Can't you just look at it as reinventing yourself?<eos> As a shittier version of me?<eos> We're back in ten, people.<eos> Cue music.<eos> - So, Danika, 46 advantages.<eos> - Yep.<eos> If you really wanna get back at Jonathan, you've got...
If you really wanna get back at Jonathan, you've got...<eos> Honey and feathers.<eos> Hideous stench.<eos> And finally, 200 live frogs ready to drop.<eos> There's a reason they were a plague in the Bible.<eos> I'm sure Gilbert could tell us something about that.<eos> Don't interrupt me.<eos> It's gettin' to the fun part.<eos> It's not looking good for Lot's wife.<eos> Or you could buy a luxury item for yourself.

I love this fucking show.<eos> Hello.<eos> Tim, it's Beverly.<eos> I'm afraid I can't come in today.<eos> Sean is dead.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I know.<eos> But what can you do?<eos> You can't come to work when your husband's dead.
I know.<eos> But what can you do?<eos> You can't come to work when your husband's dead.<eos> There really is no excuse better than that.<eos> Sean is dead?<eos> - As a doornail.<eos> - What?<eos> So, who knows when I'll be back.<eos> I've got all kinds of widow-y things to do, and then there's the trauma.<eos> In all likelihood, you and I will never, ever see each other again.
Any other thoughts on page 19?<eos> 19?<eos> 19?<eos> 19?<eos> No?<eos> Page 20.<eos> I really think we need to cut this whole bit with the boat.<eos> - What?<eos> No!<eos> - No, you can't do that.

The scene needs the whimsy.<eos> All right, scary.<eos> No need to get fractious.<eos> You know what?<eos> We can decide this after lunch.<eos> We... no, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I have a surprise.<eos> I made my famous Vietnamese noodles.<eos> At least something good came out of your little war.<eos> I thought you said we could take off for lunch today.

- It does smell delicious.<eos> - I hope you're joking.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> In this new way where we don't have to be funny.<eos> See?<eos> You follow it in the air, and then it shows you where it lands.<eos> It's just like playing on a real course.<eos> You know what's even more like a real course?<eos> - A real course.<eos> - Yeah, but this way you can play anywhere in the world.

I was picturing Tim's head.<eos> I don't know why you're still workin' with that douchenozzle.<eos> We have no choice.<eos> We don't.<eos> It's still our show.<eos> We have a financial stake.<eos> We can't let him destroy it completely.<eos> But you're there, like, every night.<eos> Because the twat has no life.<eos> Look, you're the one who said to go for the money.
- I'm golfing.<eos> - So golf.<eos> I still think you're wusses.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Tim again?<eos> Actually, that was you that time.<eos> Coming.<eos> So, if Mohammed won't come to the mountain, the mountain will come to Mohammed.<eos> With bagels.<eos> Ah... did you get poppy?
With bagels.<eos> Ah... did you get poppy?<eos> No, the mountain could only get sesame and plain.<eos> Mm, Mohammed is pissed.<eos> Even in your kitchen, I'm not comfortable with this conversation.<eos> So... how are you?<eos> Great.<eos> I am.<eos> I am.<eos> Oh, good, you got the chive cream cheese.
Oh, good, you got the chive cream cheese.<eos> Oh, and there's, uh, half a pound of nova.<eos> Not really a smoked fish person.<eos> Really?<eos> Mm. I just assumed.<eos> - What?<eos> - You know, being...<eos> - What? - Jewish.<eos> No?<eos> You thought I was Jewish?
- You know, being...<eos> - What? - Jewish.<eos> No?<eos> You thought I was Jewish?<eos> Well, you know, Rance.<eos> And, I don't know, show business.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm not Jewish.<eos> Well, you don't have to say it like that.<eos> - I'm Jewish.<eos> - You're Jewish?
Well, you know, Rance.<eos> And, I don't know, show business.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm not Jewish.<eos> Well, you don't have to say it like that.<eos> - I'm Jewish.<eos> - You're Jewish?<eos> Or like that.<eos> Yes, I'm Jewish.<eos> How did I not know this?<eos> You don't look Jewish, and I mean that as a compliment.
- I really think we should move away from the whole "looks Jewish" arena.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> - It's just the...<eos> - No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Aren't you gonna toast it first?<eos> - No.<eos> - Or is that just a Semitic thing?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Are you stoned already?
- Or is that just a Semitic thing?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Are you stoned already?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not even 9:15.<eos> What?<eos> It's not like I have to be somewhere.<eos> Okay, I realize this is - a difficult time, but... - I'm fine.<eos> Will you stop saying you're "fine"?

Get a job?<eos> I am poison in this town.<eos> God knows what Helen's saying about me.<eos> So who's gonna give me a recommendation?<eos> Castor?<eos> I don't even know if they've released him yet.<eos> But all those years of building "relationships."<eos> Surely someone can help you.<eos> You had friends at the network.<eos> Are you kidding?

Anyway, so...<eos> Uh, I just got tickets for Madonna tonight.<eos> - Wanna come? - Mmm.<eos> - Madonna, really?<eos> - They're free.<eos> - What time?<eos> - And they're her seats, so they're probably really good.<eos> - Whose seats?<eos> - Madonna's.<eos> How'd you get Madonna's seats?
- Wanna come? - Mmm.<eos> - Madonna, really?<eos> - They're free.<eos> - What time?<eos> - And they're her seats, so they're probably really good.<eos> - Whose seats?<eos> - Madonna's.<eos> How'd you get Madonna's seats?<eos> - She called me.<eos> - You know Madonna?
- You know Madonna?<eos> Yeah, I know Madonna.<eos> Why can't I know Madonna?<eos> - How?<eos> - For, like, 30 years.<eos> Since she was like a virgin.<eos> I met her at The Factory.<eos> - What Factory?<eos> - Andy Warhol's Factory?<eos> - You knew Andy Warhol?
Perfect.<eos> - You've got it.<eos> - Perfect!<eos> Sold.<eos> - Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> - So then, - Mrs. Carlson says...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Is there something funnier than "cookie"?<eos> Oh, I think it's funny enough.<eos> It is, as you say... a comedy.
- "Fudgy's" not funny.<eos> - No.<eos> "What does a man have to do to get a damn fudgy around here?"<eos> I love it.<eos> We are crazy if we don't go with that.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ah, moving on.<eos> Hand me one of those crackers, would you?<eos> Hm? Did you say "crackers"?
- Yes.<eos> Ah, moving on.<eos> Hand me one of those crackers, would you?<eos> Hm? Did you say "crackers"?<eos> Instead of "cookie"?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, I was just asking Bev for...<eos> No, no, no, you're... you're right.
No, no, no, you're... you're right.<eos> I like... uh, "cookie's" so expected, but what kind of cracker?<eos> - Mm. - Ritz?<eos> - Triscuit?<eos> - Saltine?<eos> - Triscuit?<eos> - Wheat Thin?<eos> - Cheez-it?<eos> - Triscuit?<eos> You saw...
Remember to follow us live online 24 hours a day, and be back here tomorrow night... - Six. - when we'll be one step closer to finding out<eos> - Jessica. Good night!<eos> Show's over.<eos> Thank you very much, folks!<eos> - Good job, Matt!<eos> - We love you, Matt!<eos> Hey, Gilbert, listen.<eos> Thanks so much for doing this.<eos> Jesus Christ, it smells like a vagina's vagina in there.<eos> You gotta let these people bathe.
Hey, Gilbert, listen.<eos> Thanks so much for doing this.<eos> Jesus Christ, it smells like a vagina's vagina in there.<eos> You gotta let these people bathe.<eos> That one got to take a shower.<eos> Well, next time, put me in her box.<eos> And I mean that in the biblical sense.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> You hear me?
I don't have a window.<eos> Why should you get a window?<eos> Because I'm the star of the fucking show.<eos> Yeah? Well, Mr. Ed was the star of Mr. Ed, but he still had to shit in a barn.<eos> The title's overrated.<eos> Remember when I screwed your wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's it.<eos> Just wanted you to remember.<eos> You are so never getting a window.

Yeah.<eos> That's it.<eos> Just wanted you to remember.<eos> You are so never getting a window.<eos> Oh, I'm gettin' a window.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're an actor.<eos> Act like there's a window.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're a producer.
I'm sorry to call so late, but, um, we kind of have a situation here.<eos> Uh, Matt LeBlanc is down on the stage.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Yeah, he's, um... well, he's kind of having a sex thing with, uh... with Danika.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> Let me turn on my feed.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Don't worry, none of it has gone out.<eos> So long as I stay off Danika's camera, nobody can see it, but I thought you should know.<eos> No, no, no, no, I'm glad you called.
It all goes back to that incident on Orientation Day.<eos> And at the root of it was Madeline Mackenzie.<eos> You have nothing to be nervous about.<eos> Your sister loved going there and so will you.<eos> In fact, you should be excited.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because this is the very first day of the rest of your life.<eos> Okay, woman.<eos> I am not 100% sure about that tone, young lady.<eos> And could you please turn it down, please?
You're going to d...<eos> Oh, this is just...<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> They're dead.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You must stop.<eos> You're gonna kill yourself for some...<eos> - Mom?<eos> - What is your problem?<eos> Abigail, what are you doing?
I work in community theatre 20 hours a week, so I'm definitely an "under."<eos> What do you do?<eos> Oh, just bookkeeping, so... most definitely an "under," too.<eos> When I grow up, I'm gonna run a massive label.<eos> Do you have plans?<eos> No.<eos> He's a little nervous.<eos> Relax, he's walking in with Chloe.<eos> That's like walking in with the golden ticket.<eos> What kind of music do you listen to?
- It's so pretty.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - Madeline, hello!<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> You guys go play. - Hi. - How are you?<eos> Pregnant again?<eos> Of course.<eos> When am I not? You look fantastic.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Did you...?
Well, joined the board at PayPal.<eos> What was I thinking, adding one more thing to my life?<eos> But, you know... oh! Hold on, these are my "Hamilton" tickets. - I've seen it four times.<eos> Yes? - Mm. Okay.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Here, come meet my best friend.<eos> Hey, Bill.<eos> How you been?<eos> - Madeline!<eos> - When did you get to town?
Yes? - Mm. Okay.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Here, come meet my best friend.<eos> Hey, Bill.<eos> How you been?<eos> - Madeline!<eos> - When did you get to town?<eos> Oh, late last night. - You didn't call me.<eos> - No, I'm sorry.<eos> And how did you get more beautiful?
I think she just moved to this area for your delicious coffee.<eos> Oh.<eos> So, do you mind getting... would you like one?<eos> - Yeah, please.<eos> - Three, please. And will you throw in something chocolate that won't make my ass look fat? - You got it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Everybody moves here for the education.<eos> Basically, it's private school at a public school price.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna love it.<eos> Do you surf?
What do I know of Jane Chapman?<eos> Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.<eos> You okay?<eos> Nobody knows nothing about anybody.<eos> You can write that down, Detective, and underline it.<eos> - What is it, honey?<eos> - It's weird.<eos> Sometimes when I'm in a new place, I get this sensation.<eos> Like, if only I were here.<eos> - But you are here.
- It's weird.<eos> Sometimes when I'm in a new place, I get this sensation.<eos> Like, if only I were here.<eos> - But you are here.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's like I'm on the outside looking in.<eos> Or like... you know, like, I see this life and this moment, and it's so wonderful, but it doesn't quite belong to me.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?
- But you are here.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's like I'm on the outside looking in.<eos> Or like... you know, like, I see this life and this moment, and it's so wonderful, but it doesn't quite belong to me.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?<eos> And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.<eos> - That's true. - Oh, stop. And I'm not saying that to embarrass you at all, but it is true.<eos> You are, and so are you, and...
- That's true. - Oh, stop. And I'm not saying that to embarrass you at all, but it is true.<eos> You are, and so are you, and...<eos> I agree.<eos> You guys are just right.<eos> You're exactly right.<eos> And for some reason, that makes me feel... wrong, I guess. - It's crazy.<eos> I know I sound crazy.<eos> - It's not crazy.<eos> I mean, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But if you were crazy, you'd fit in perfectly in this town.
And I'm coming with you.<eos> You think she should keep all her emotions bottled up inside?<eos> - Who does that serve?<eos> - "Am I missing the math?"<eos> Bitch.<eos> Can't she see that it has nothing to do with you?<eos> None of us really see things as they are;<eos> we see things as we are.<eos> Come on, Bonnie, give me a break. The kids are in the same class together.<eos> Madeline's eventually gonna discover how smart you are. And when she does, shit's gonna hit the fan.
♪ Otter in the bay ♪<eos> - Hi, baby!<eos> - Look at him.<eos> He's so happy.<eos> Hi.<eos> - How was it? - Fun!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I made friends.<eos> You made friends?<eos> You already made friends?
Okay.<eos> I just want to introduce you to Juliette.<eos> This is my Amabella's nanny.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> - Pleased to meet you. She's French.<eos> Good for them to learn a language, you know?<eos> I just thought it was nice for the nannies to get to know each other and have your own little support system.<eos> Renata, Jane is not a nanny.<eos> She's a mom, just young.<eos> Like you used to be?

- What was his name?<eos> Maybe she doesn't want to say.<eos> Well, um, Mrs. Klein, my problem is that the children don't know one another's names yet, so Amabella cannot tell me who...<eos> We're not just gonna let this go.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> Mrs. Klein, I'm so sorry...<eos> - Is she okay? - I don't know.<eos> They're gonna find out. Just give her a second.<eos> - Did you see what happened? - No.
- This boy?<eos> - No, him.<eos> - This boy?<eos> - Yes, he tried to choke me.<eos> - What? - It wasn't me.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> Ziggy, sweetie, we just need you to say "sorry."<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Are you sure that it was this little boy, sweetie?
- Renata!<eos> - Stay out of it.<eos> I can't make him apologize for something that I know he didn't do.<eos> We will schedule a meeting for another time.<eos> We can handle this later.<eos> Okay, this is unacceptable.<eos> Let's go, baby.<eos> Um, all right, everyone, thank you.<eos> Not that there's a right little girl to strangle, but he picked the wrong little girl to strangle.<eos> Ziggy... do you see her neck?

Hi.<eos> Jane just didn't fit here.<eos> Kind of like a dirty old Prius parked outside of Barneys.<eos> - Welcome to Monterey. - Thank you.<eos> It was a mistake to let people compete, but that is not what got someone killed.<eos> Hi, Celeste. How is Perry?<eos> Oh, uh, he's good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - If it'll help...<eos> - You didn't ask me how Ed was.
There was a 4x3 stellate, full-thickness scalp laceration located on the superior occipital portion of the scalp.<eos> We also discovered a full-thickness scalp contusion and associated gall and subgaleal haemorrhages, and a putrefied and liquefied brain.<eos> So, it was a lot of blood.<eos> Chloe.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The teacher couldn't have handled it worse.<eos> "Point out the suspect, Amabella"?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I take it this Jane's kind of damaged.<eos> Why do you say that?
Mmm, being choked, maybe?<eos> Bruises heal, stigmas can last a lifetime.<eos> You don't think assault victims bear lifetime emotional injuries?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is there a recent study you'd like to illuminate the family about, Abigail?<eos> - All right.<eos> - All right, what?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Well, it's not nothing. It's something.<eos> You said, "All right." Would you like to assign meaning to that or was it just a nervous tic?
- Well, it's not nothing. It's something.<eos> You said, "All right." Would you like to assign meaning to that or was it just a nervous tic?<eos> Guys, Mom had a day. - And don't you start.<eos> - I'm on your side, woman.<eos> - I'm gonna go with a nervous tic.<eos> I think his "all right" meant "let's not fight at the dinner table."<eos> Were we fighting?<eos> I didn't realize we were fighting.<eos> We were about to.<eos> You said I probably read some study on women assault victims, and I would've responded with, "No,
I think the angry beaver is gonna get you, Mom. Yeah.<eos> Is he?<eos> - Oh, I hope not. That...<eos> - The angry beaver is back!<eos> And he is hungry!<eos> Hungry for Mama's beaver. Just stop!<eos> Oh, she his delicious!<eos> Mmm, have a bite of this. Mmm!<eos> - What happened?<eos> You're not going to Vienna?
- Yes!<eos> It's their first day of school tomorrow. I can't miss that.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I kind of agree with Thea...<eos> People over 40 shouldn't be gushy. It's not cute.<eos> I mean, last week, she came home and peeled potatoes at a homeless shelter, and she couldn't stop talking about what a beautiful experience it was to contribute.<eos> I mean, she whines if I ask her to set the table, but peel one fucking potato with Bonnie...<eos> Well, Bonnie is a positive influence.<eos> What, you'd rather Abby be out with her friends, smoking pot?

For some reason, Abigail would love me more. He hasn't paid in the slightest for any of it.<eos> And now he's got Bonnie, and she's younger and sexier and prettier. She probably gives mint-flavoured, organic blowjobs.<eos> And Abigail likes to hang out with them and be buddies.<eos> And he got it all.<eos> He won.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna have a pretty big fight - about what you just said. - No, no, no.<eos> But not tonight. Not tonight.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and don't you for one minute think anything else.
I'm not liked.<eos> What was that?<eos> I said I'm not liked.<eos> That simply isn't true, honey.<eos> It's one thing to be demonized for having the temerity of a career.<eos> But... but look at this.<eos> Look at our life.<eos> What kind of person chooses to work?<eos> Certainly not a mother, by any acceptable standards.<eos> You should've seen the way they looked at me today.
Certainly not a mother, by any acceptable standards.<eos> You should've seen the way they looked at me today.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And on the one morning that I chose not to go to the office... - Yep, yep, yep. - And join my daughter for her orientation.<eos> And, yes, I reacted.<eos> - Humanly, like any mom would.<eos> And then, I'm met with utter contempt.<eos> Look, I'm sure there are those, women especially, who would resent you.<eos> I mean, look at you. Come on.<eos> You're beautiful, hugely successful, financially independent, on the school committee, the... the board of the aquarium.

You all want to be the envy of your friends, but God forbid you garner too much of it.<eos> The mom was awful, but the girl seemed fine.<eos> So, what's gonna happen?<eos> Um, I don't know. I think the teacher said that we should just let it go, move forward, so I guess that's what we're gonna do.<eos> I still don't understand why you chose to move there.
Hello?<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love...<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Sorry I woke you up.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Hey, you trust me, right?
I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love...<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Sorry I woke you up.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Hey, you trust me, right?<eos> And I trust you.<eos> Did you touch that little girl, baby?
She probably just got it wrong.<eos> Am I going to have any friends?<eos> Of course you are, my love.<eos> You're gonna have so many friends.<eos> Come here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Honey? - Yeah.<eos> I think we need to talk about the SAT tutor.<eos> Mom...<eos> I know what you're gonna say, but your scores just aren't good enough right now, honey. - You know, the whole college thing, it's kind of a racket, especially liberal arts.

Ed didn't go and he's doing all right.<eos> Yeah, but Ed studied computer engineering.<eos> Do you want to be a computer engineer?<eos> And Dad... he never went and he seems perfectly happy in life.<eos> Career-wise.<eos> Okay, well, let's just finish that analogy.<eos> Let's not leave Bonnie out of this.<eos> Her little cup just runneth over with happiness, doesn't it?<eos> With no college degree at all.<eos> I'm sorry that you hate Bonnie and that I'm unable to.
My superpower...<eos> I actually get it from Mom.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> What did we have for dinner tonight with the... with the steak?<eos> Um, Mom's spinach salad?<eos> Mom's spinach salad.<eos> Top secret, okay?<eos> "G is for George, smothered under a rug.<eos> H is for Hector, done in by a thug."<eos> You startled me.
Well, no one witnessed it, but she was pretty distraught. She had marks on her neck.<eos> Which boy?<eos> Oh, this new boy, Ziggy.<eos> I mean, he seemed really sweet, and...<eos> I met his mom and she couldn't be nicer, so...<eos> Well, to be safe, we should tell Josh and Max to keep their distance from him.<eos> I don't think that's gonna be necessary.<eos> Honey, if the kid is violent...<eos> No, he's not violent.<eos> How do you know he's not violent?
What, because he seemed sweet?<eos> - First off, he could be innocent.<eos> - Or he could be guilty.<eos> We don't want the boys to be getting mixed up with the wrong crowd.<eos> - They're six.<eos> - They're not to associate with him.<eos> You're being ridiculous.<eos> The boys will stay away from that kid.<eos> Take your hand off me.<eos> If I can't be here to look out for them, I need to know that you do.
The boys will stay away from that kid.<eos> Take your hand off me.<eos> If I can't be here to look out for them, I need to know that you do.<eos> I asked you to remove your fucking hand.<eos> Is that a song from your puppet show?<eos> Yes, but it's really more than just a puppet show.<eos> The play means a lot to you, right?<eos> I'll tell Bonnie to start a new petition in favour.<eos> Mom, are you okay?<eos> You're not, like, dying or anything, are you?

Mom, are you okay?<eos> You're not, like, dying or anything, are you?<eos> No, I'm not dying.<eos> What would make you ask me that?<eos> You seem a little wobbly.<eos> Are you having one of your massive periods?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What people don't tell you is that... you lose your children.<eos> As beautiful and wonderful as you are now, the little girl whose curly hair I used to detangle, the one who had bad dreams and would crawl into my bed, she's gone.
What people don't tell you is that... you lose your children.<eos> As beautiful and wonderful as you are now, the little girl whose curly hair I used to detangle, the one who had bad dreams and would crawl into my bed, she's gone.<eos> And I guess that's why I'm feeling a little bit...<eos> Compounded by the fact that your little sister's going to first grade.<eos> I'm losing my babies.<eos> Which has been clinically compared to a massive period, I think.<eos> I'll always be your baby.<eos> Bonnie's like a friend, you know.<eos> Maybe even a best friend sometimes, but...<eos> I'm your daughter and you're my mother.
Not another one.<eos> You go back to bed!<eos> I love that song.<eos> Do you want to play it together?<eos> We're treating the matter as a homicide.<eos> We have no suspects as of yet.<eos> I will say that we do believe we have spoken to the person or persons involved.<eos> Ziggy.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> You're sleepwalking again, baby.
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.<eos> I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me.<eos> What do you look at in the ocean?
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.<eos> I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me.<eos> What do you look at in the ocean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You spend a lot of time staring at nothing.
Monsters?<eos> Dreams.<eos> Sunken treasure.<eos> It's the great unknown.<eos> That's what the ocean is.<eos> I don't wanna go, Mom.<eos> I know you don't, but you have to.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> But they all think I choked that girl.<eos> Yeah, but you know that you didn't and I know that you didn't.
- Mom, why did we move here?<eos> - Ziggy.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't have time for this this morning.<eos> Please put your shirt on.<eos> Why did we move here?<eos> - Why? - That's enough.<eos> You can finish that in the car. Let's go.<eos> I don't mean to do your job, but it begs the question... is she running from something?<eos> You cannot be serious, Joseph.

Let's go.<eos> I don't mean to do your job, but it begs the question... is she running from something?<eos> You cannot be serious, Joseph.<eos> What?<eos> No. No.<eos> This makes us look like cowards.<eos> If you roll over on this, it sets a precedent... He basically laughed.

He basically laughed.<eos> Do not yell at me.<eos> You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please?<eos> Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?
Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.<eos> You can go fuck yourself on the head.<eos> Right on the head?<eos> I'm sorry, but he's trying to shut down "Avenue Q."<eos> He says it's too controversial.<eos> Well, what's he want to replace it with?<eos> Don't tell me "Cats."<eos> You remember your first day of school?
Well, what's he want to replace it with?<eos> Don't tell me "Cats."<eos> You remember your first day of school?<eos> I do, actually.<eos> I got asked out on a date by a second-grader, no less.<eos> Did we accept?<eos> He wore white Docksiders.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> The idea of a bully in the class...<eos> I don't think he's a bully, but you're probably right. We should err on the side of safety.

I would love to, but I have a job interview.<eos> Wow.<eos> Don't worry about him, honey.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Get laid, bitch.<eos> See you later.<eos> Maybe it was inappropriate, handing out invites on the first day, but Renata's a planner.<eos> Renata was sending a message.<eos> I was thinking you could do it.

Back corner.<eos> - You've got to be kidding me. - Shh!<eos> Don't shush me.<eos> She has her own yoga studio. - What's she even doing here?<eos> - Shh!<eos> Okay!<eos> We do have a session where the rules are more relaxed, you know?<eos> Our perimenopausal class.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Okay, you will never believe what she just said to me.
Why, yes. Harry loves hugs.<eos> I mean, look, let's face it.<eos> Amabella picked that Ziggy out of a lineup and she was unwavering.<eos> The kid was off.<eos> I'll leave it at that.<eos> I thought your flight was at 5:00.<eos> Well, traffic might be bad.<eos> It's 11:30. Thank you.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Are you serious?
Good to know.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I changed my flight so I could be here on their first day of school.<eos> And then I don't even get to go in the building.<eos> I understand, but I just...<eos> And for you to just dismiss my being upset about it?<eos> I didn't dismiss anything.<eos> - I just don't want to be blamed...<eos> - Yeah, you know what I think?<eos> You didn't want me to be there for orientation.

Call "The Wall Street Journal"<eos> and tell them we make a deal now with these guys, or they're never gonna have anybody by them.<eos> No, this is ridiculous!<eos> Juliette?<eos> Because my daughter's got to get picked up.<eos> Sorry, I'm distra... yes.<eos> You need to get in the car right now and pick up... hold on one second.<eos> I thought you were picking her up.<eos> No, I'm doing an interview here!<eos> Turns out it's actually harder to have a part-time job versus a full-time job because in addition to doing all that work, you're out there scouring for another job.

I mean, it's just unacceptable. Thank you, honey.<eos> This looks delicious.<eos> Abby, are you dating the fridge?<eos> Chloe, I set up a standing playdate with you and Ziggy on Thursdays.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> - Why would it not be?<eos> We don't know for a fact that he's innocent.<eos> Maybe the benefit of the doubt should run in Chloe's favor instead of Ziggy.<eos> Are you suggesting I might be putting my daughter in harm's way?

Chloe!<eos> Barbies aren't allowed anyways.<eos> Sylvie Baker's gave Joey Proccacini a boner.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, Abigail, I am super impressed with your emerging social conscience.<eos> - I really am.<eos> - Shall we leave it at that?<eos> Or is now the time to pile on Bonnie?<eos> I just have a very low tolerance for injustice, which is exactly what's going on with Ziggy and his mom.<eos> You fled the table when Abby brought up Bonnie.
When I was married to him, he wouldn't so much as go for a walk.<eos> And when he finally did, he never came back.<eos> - Remember that big fight I promised? - Yeah?<eos> - I think now would be a good time.<eos> - Why?<eos> Is Nathan the one? - What?<eos> What do you... what do you mean?<eos> - The one.<eos> For every person, there's the one.<eos> Case in point, you're my one.

He could help you put something together.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It's all good. No, I would.<eos> Do you have any clients?<eos> Can I ask what brought you here?<eos> The schools are great, to build a better life for her son.<eos> - That's all you'll get.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Yeah, Ziggy, I did come here with dreams of a certain life.<eos> You are right.
Hopefully a better one.<eos> Mom.<eos> The chocolate one?<eos> Okay, but I'm eating some.<eos> We are looking at the victim's relationships with every parent who attended Trivia Night.<eos> "Is Nathan the one?"<eos> Of course not!<eos> That he doubts my love for him?<eos> And Ed's not a neurotic guy, so maybe it is me.<eos> You once said that you two don't have sex very often.
- Hi, Renata.<eos> I was over there with my girlfriends, getting our drink on, and I saw you two.<eos> - Do you have a second?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Did you know that they're thinking about closing down the local V.A. hospital?<eos> It means that vets are having to drive all the way to Sacramento for their services, which is so upsetting.<eos> I've really dedicated a lot of my life to vets, specifically PTSD, so I'm gonna hold a little, you know, fundraising dinner party and help defray costs and keep the facility open. It would be so great if you and Perry could come.<eos> - Yeah, sure. - And... and, um, you and Ed, of course.<eos> It would be so nice.<eos> You're such a kind person, Renata. - Thank you.
What a cunt.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Why don't you get fucked? Wow.<eos> The war is on.<eos> You know, this really isn't fair to Chloe.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Last year, Amabella had a jumping castle and a magician.<eos> This year only figures to be better.<eos> Please.<eos> For you to summarily say she can't go, then use her as a tool to get other kids not to go...
For you to summarily say she can't go, then use her as a tool to get other kids not to go...<eos> I am not doing that.<eos> You know, one minute it's Nathan or Bonnie. Now Renata, not to mention the parking monitor, the girls in the car. I can't even keep track of all the fights you start.<eos> Somebody needs to invent an app.<eos> Well, maybe you could have my back in some of them.<eos> What is it about this Jane?<eos> What is she, a long-lost sister or something?<eos> - Just a cause in lieu of... - In lieu of what?<eos> In lieu of a life?<eos> Is that what you were gonna say?
- Just a cause in lieu of... - In lieu of what?<eos> In lieu of a life?<eos> Is that what you were gonna say?<eos> Jane's a single mom.<eos> Do you need an app to put two and two together?<eos> When Abigail was a little baby, Nathan was not around and I was a single mom, Ed.<eos> And I'm still angry about it.<eos> It's not my love for Nathan that lingers after 15 years, it's my resentment.<eos> There's a big difference.<eos> Did you hear me?
Chloe, get in the car.<eos> Chloe, get in the car right now.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Now.<eos> I'm not having sex, I promise you.<eos> What are those pills?<eos> They're just for in case, you know, the day comes.<eos> Not that it's coming any time soon, but I just have them.<eos> You are 16 years old.<eos> Where did you get them?
- Dr. Ennis?<eos> She wrote you a prescription without calling me? Not her.<eos> I went to Planned Parenthood.<eos> Please don't make a big deal about this.<eos> I'm not sexually active, okay?<eos> Who took you there? - What?<eos> - Planned Parenthood.<eos> Did you take a car, an Uber? Did somebody give you a ride?<eos> It's in Seaside.<eos> How did you get there?
If I were you, I would just let it go.<eos> I would, with Bonnie, Abigail.<eos> I'd ride it out.<eos> No, I love my grudges.<eos> I tend to them like little pets.<eos> All right. I'm just saying.<eos> I do the same thing.<eos> I'm not into forgiveness either.<eos> Really?<eos> Who do you not forgive?
- And me.<eos> - And you guys.<eos> Marv Herman.<eos> He runs the muffler shop on Kentner, and I hear that he's in need of some bookkeeping assistance.<eos> Great. Thank you.<eos> And, actually, maybe some legal assistance, too,<eos> - if the zoning board stays on him.<eos> - I'm retired.<eos> Unless you're defending the First Amendment.<eos> You never give up.
Um, hey, thanks for meeting me.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I just want to discuss this whole thing with, like... that happened with Bonnie and Abby.<eos> Sure.<eos> You know, as far as I can tell, there was no undue influence or interference.<eos> Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions about Planned Parenthood, Bonnie answered them.<eos> Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there.<eos> There was no parental usurps of any kind, I promise you that.<eos> But I can discuss that whole thing with Maddie. What I wanted to take up with you is...<eos> I think you can probably appreciate that it's a bit of a delicate balancing act with my ex.

Maybe I'm talking out of turn here.<eos> No, I was young, you know?<eos> Maybe a bit of a shit.<eos> But I made some real mistakes with both Maddie and Abby, but should I be required to make the same mistakes with Bonnie and Skye?<eos> No, but, you know, doesn't hurt to be mindful of other people's feelings sometimes.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Mr. Sensitive.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, actually, I meant that as a compliment.<eos> You're kind of like today's standard-bearer for the evolved man.

That's why I'm bringing it up with you.<eos> Well, that sounded like a threat, Nathan.<eos> Are you threatening me?

Sixth grade.<eos> And I always turned the other cheek, thinking that was the more mature thing to do.<eos> Some 30 years later, it still haunts me that I didn't beat the shit out of that kid.<eos> So much so, I find myself fantasizing that somebody will come along one day and say or do something to me that'll offer me the chance to redeem myself.<eos> You've always treated me quite well, Nathan.
Joseph, we have worked so hard for this, and we are being victimized by the small-mindedness led by the likes of Renata Klein.<eos> Understood, but we need to pick our battles, and this is just...<eos> And sometimes our battles pick us.<eos> We can't quit.<eos> We just can't.<eos> Is this about the play or winning?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's a little bit about both.<eos> But I get sick and tired of the morally superior in this town stepping all over everybody else.<eos> And you said you wanted to be brave with your artistic direction.

No one takes responsibility for anything.<eos> And Chloe's involved.<eos> Not to mention their health and well-being.<eos> I mean, if I had a dime for every boy that I tried to kiss when I was six years old...<eos> I mean, I can't even tell you. There were so many.<eos> They're children, for Christ's sakes.<eos> They're supposed to be doing things like kissing each other.<eos> Jane?<eos> What's wrong, honey?<eos> You okay?
I love you.<eos> Take her out of school if you're that concerned.<eos> She's the one that has to leave?<eos> She didn't do anything.<eos> I just don't think legal action is the answer, all right?<eos> Let's see how it goes. I'm guessing it'll all sort itself out.<eos> I do not feel supported here.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't suppose I could argue with your feelings.<eos> Ziggy, why are you awake?

I don't suppose I could argue with your feelings.<eos> Ziggy, why are you awake?<eos> You're supposed to be asleep.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I saw you crying at school today.<eos> I was just stressed out.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> At pick-up I heard one of the mothers say I was a little monster.<eos> What?<eos> Baby, you're not a monster.

That day?<eos> Yes, that one.<eos> Can we talk about it first?<eos> Sure.<eos> 'Cause I actually think I could be helpful.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have a lot of girlfriends, as you know, and never has any one of them ever said to me,<eos> "Gee, if only I had had sex sooner in life."<eos> This is awkward now.<eos> So, Nathan said that you threatened to beat him up.

So, Nathan said that you threatened to beat him up.<eos> Of course not.<eos> He wanted me to get you to back off Bonnie a little bit, it led to a discussion, and... I never threatened to beat him up.<eos> I did let him know I wouldn't be intimidated by him, which I think was his intent.<eos> So, how did you two leave it?<eos> We left it... he's got Bonnie's back and I've got yours.<eos> My He-Man.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I just say one thing?<eos> You never leave it at one thing.
Of course not.<eos> He wanted me to get you to back off Bonnie a little bit, it led to a discussion, and...

No, you can't.<eos> You won't be able to find me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Wait!<eos> It's not real!<eos> Not real!<eos> It's not real!<eos> It's not...<eos> All right.<eos> You heard a voice coming through the radio, and now you're convinced that it's the voice of...
Claudia's Jeep.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah. But if you had...<eos> - Enough, Scott!<eos> Enough.<eos> You saw a carousel?
I keep calling the number for City Hall, and no one answers.<eos> The only map I can find it on is 30 years old.<eos> So far, the only thing I know about Canaan is where it is.<eos> That's all we need to know.<eos> Scott, Malia and Lydia are going out to Canaan.<eos> He said to go through with the plan as long as it doesn't destroy his house.<eos> What plan?<eos> Your plan.<eos> I don't have a plan.<eos> Well, you said you had all these ideas about how to catch a Ghost Rider.
I wonder why Stiles would send us here.<eos> This is the place I saw in the mirror.<eos> Uh, tell Doctor Geyer they wanted to do a few more tests before surgery.<eos> If he even asks.<eos> He probably won't.<eos> But if he does ask, tell him that.<eos> Mom?<eos> Kylie?<eos> Is that your adoptive family?<eos> I know what you're thinking.
Go after him!<eos> I think we both know that this medication isn't gonna work, either.<eos> So I'm open for suggestions.<eos> I had an idea, but it's asking a lot.<eos> Asking more than risking my job by losing a patient in this hospital?<eos> It's the Nine Herbs.<eos> They counteract nine supernatural venoms.<eos> If the herbs are combined in the wrong way, it increases the venom's power.<eos> So if I screw up...<eos> You'll kill me.
Hmm, of course.<eos> It's prescribed for anxiety.<eos> Most of these herbs are used in modern drugs.<eos> So, between raiding the hospital pharmacy, the homeopath downtown and the salad bar, I think I can find them all.<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna be back as soon as I can.<eos> You try to stay awake.<eos> Mil...<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Mil... You have to add...<eos> You have to add...
Instead of a conduit, maybe we can find a person to absorb the lightning.<eos> I don't even think Kira could do that.<eos> Josh could.<eos> He ate electricity.<eos> Josh is dead.<eos> Yeah, but his power didn't die with him.<eos> May as well have.<eos> We can't get to it.<eos> We don't know that. Not for sure.<eos> What are you saying?

They all just disappeared?<eos> I didn't say they disappeared.<eos> I said they left.<eos> Did they leave in a cloud of green smoke?<eos> They just left!<eos> We didn't mean to upset you.<eos> We'll go now.<eos> No one is leaving.<eos> No one is leaving Canaan ever again.<eos> I think the last thing that you were trying to say was my name.

Caleb, can you help us find a way out of here?<eos> You have to stay because Mommy said so.<eos> No, we can't stay.<eos> We have to go home.<eos> This is home. This is home.<eos> Scott?<eos> Come here for a sec.<eos> Look at the date.<eos> Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?
No, we can't stay.<eos> We have to go home.<eos> This is home. This is home.<eos> Scott?<eos> Come here for a sec.<eos> Look at the date.<eos> Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?<eos> 1976.<eos> And when did you die?
Come here for a sec.<eos> Look at the date.<eos> Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?<eos> 1976.<eos> And when did you die?<eos> Why didn't you leave too?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Is that an accusation?<eos> Are you accusing me of something?
And when did you die?<eos> Why didn't you leave too?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Is that an accusation?<eos> Are you accusing me of something?<eos> How come you're the only one left?<eos> Did you hide?<eos> Did you fight them?<eos> Fight who?<eos> Who are you talking about?
Mel<eos> - Celtic for honey.<eos> Not an herb, but it is a binding agent and a natural antibiotic.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Bite down on this, It'll help.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Am I having another hallucination?<eos> If you are, I'm having the same one.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> I know you're not gonna beat an eight-year-old's ass, but I will.
I know why they didn't...<eos> You think I helped them because they brought back my dead son.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Theo!<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.<eos> We're the ones that brought you back.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?
We're the ones that brought you back.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I'm gonna kill you, too.<eos> I'm gonna kill all of you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Send him back.<eos> You know what this does?
Send him back.<eos> You know what this does?<eos> We need your power to help us.<eos> Then you can kill whoever you want.<eos> But if you do kill us, you're gonna end up worse off than ever.<eos> There's nothing worse than what I've been through.<eos> You ever hear about the Ghost Riders?<eos> What makes you think this is gonna work?<eos> You took Josh's power.<eos> You can do it.
That was only one billion joules.<eos> Only?<eos> Well, how many joules are in a bolt of lightning?<eos> Five billion.<eos> Well, I'm fine, by the way.<eos> Thank you for your concern.<eos> You don't have Josh's power anymore, do you?<eos> Or Tracy's.<eos> Guess I'm back to Classic Theo.<eos> Maybe you should try some remorse, since you killed them for their powers.
Hold on.<eos> I can help.<eos> I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> I also know about things I'm betting you don't.<eos> I'm with Ms. Romero on this one.<eos> Send him back.<eos> Who's making decisions around here?<eos> Where's Scott?<eos> Where's Stiles?<eos> You remember Stiles?
You didn't know what was happening, did you?<eos> You only saw them at the very end.<eos> They were all around me but they didn't take me.<eos> It's because you're a Banshee.<eos> Like me.<eos> How long has it been?<eos> Almost 30 years.<eos> Breathe, Malia, you have to breathe.<eos> Lydia!<eos> What are you doing to us?
How long has it been?<eos> Almost 30 years.<eos> Breathe, Malia, you have to breathe.<eos> Lydia!<eos> What are you doing to us?<eos> You're drowning.<eos> Just like me.<eos> Now we can be friends forever.<eos> You won't be taken.<eos> You'll be safe.
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?<eos> Mommy says you can go now.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> You know you can still come with us.<eos> I couldn't leave Caleb.<eos> Lenore, you know he's not real.<eos> I couldn't leave Caleb.<eos> You know all about the Ghost Riders.
Unless...<eos> Unless what?<eos> Unless they're stuck.<eos> You guys think Stiles sent us here to warn us?<eos> Maybe Beacon Hills is gonna be the next ghost town.<eos> If we don't stop it, yes.<eos> We need to get them to leave.<eos> We can't.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You're gonna help us.

Because I saw what happens to the people they've taken when they leave.<eos> Do they all die?<eos> No. It's something worse than death.<eos> I felt it in Lenore's memory.<eos> It's like their souls hollowed out.<eos> They became something else.<eos> I think they became Ghost Riders.<eos> And then, they were gone.<eos> Somehow I don't think we're gonna hug this out.<eos> Are you okay?
I'm fine.<eos> Okay, I was thinking about Lenore.<eos> There's myths about the Wild Hunt and the Morrigan.<eos> They left Lenore behind.<eos> I thought Lenore was a banshee?<eos> The Morrigan was a banshee.<eos> So when the Wild Hunt moves on from Beacon Hills... I'll be like Lenore.<eos> Left behind.<eos> Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.

Keep talking, I like the way that sounds.<eos> You know, someone should write a medical paper about how you beat frontal temporal dementia.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> I'll never stop until we get everyone back.<eos> What if this was his room?<eos> What if this means we had a son?<eos> Mr. Douglas ate his pineal gland.<eos> What are you doing?
Made up of the dead, you say?<eos> With power you have never seen.<eos> Tell me, how would you control this unstoppable army?<eos> How do you stop the unstoppable?<eos> How is your Kampfgruppe going to stop them?<eos> Tell us.<eos> How are you going to perform this miracle?<eos> With German efficiency.<eos> - Synced and corrected by SOMNATH YADAV - - - Join me on instagram @somnath66 --<eos> You're going to bite Stiles?

Malia, look around.<eos> We're the only ones left in Beacon Hills.<eos> If they take us, Lydia will be the only one left to haunt the place.<eos> That's why I'm the only person that's going in.<eos> Liam and Hayden will stay here with Mason.<eos> As long as somebody is left in Beacon Hills, the Wild Hunt can't move on.<eos> I like your plan, Scott.<eos> I really do, especially the part about turning Stiles.<eos> - But it can't work.<eos> - How do you know?
Logic.<eos> Life experience.<eos> Liam, what are the odds that he'll get taken?<eos> What if Stiles isn't there?<eos> What if there's no Beacon Hills for you to come back to?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's called, "run like hell."<eos> So, leave in five?<eos> You promised you'd help us.
You run.<eos> His tracks outside lead north from here.<eos> This one's gone, too.<eos> Why take a Ghost Rider's pineal gland?<eos> So I could use this.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not our pineal gland, I hope.<eos> We're still using them.<eos> I want you to help me find a Hellhound.<eos> You were tracking him.
It means he's not dead, Mason.<eos> And that there's still a chance.<eos> He only has pictures of us.<eos> There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.<eos> We need to get him back.<eos> When you were here before, how long until the Ghost Riders showed up?
What's a rift supposed to look like?<eos> If it's a tear in the fabric of our world.<eos> Theoretically it could look like anything from a microscopic black hole to a free-floating Einstein-Rosen bridge.<eos> I really hope it's not up there.<eos> Let's split up.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> The rift's not above us.<eos> It's below.<eos> So we should stay here.<eos> Is that what you're thinking?
He's going to tell us from in here.<eos> I'm still going to need some incentive.<eos> He's a Lowenmensch.<eos> What the hell is a Lowenmensch?<eos> It's part-wolf, part-lion.<eos> He was a part of the Ahnenerbe,<eos> Himmler's personal project to use the Occult to win the war.<eos> Hauptmann, you should stay away.<eos> All of us, we should stay away.<eos> You've seen them, Grenadier?
Just crack the whip.<eos> Yeah, Liam, come on. We gotta hurry.<eos> We can still find him.<eos> No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.
We can still find him.<eos> No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.
I don't know how it happened, but it happened.<eos> Everything Lydia has been trying to tell us?<eos> It's all true.<eos> His bed, the clothes he never folds, his crime board.<eos> He's on the lacrosse team.<eos> I mean, he's terrible, but he's on the team.<eos> Claudia, we have a son.<eos> And we can find him and get him back.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> You gotta come in the room, baby.

If he doesn't kill anyone.<eos> Else.<eos> If he doesn't kill anyone else.<eos> All that matters right now is getting through the rift.<eos> Then you're out of luck.<eos> The rift burns anything that tries to pass through it.<eos> Perhaps not everything.<eos> Jordan.<eos> If the Hellhound can open the rift, we all go together.<eos> You're the bad guy.
We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did.<eos> I remember.<eos> No, baby.<eos> We didn't.<eos> I took this picture on your last good day.<eos> Stiles refused to leave your side.<eos> I was sick.<eos> But I started getting better.<eos> You were yourself all day.
The medication had started to work.<eos> Stiles couldn't stop talking about school, all the trouble he'd gotten into.<eos> He tried so hard to stay awake.<eos> When he finally fell asleep, it was in your arms.<eos> The doctors couldn't explain it.<eos> We started making plans, started dreaming again.<eos> We just sat together<eos> and watched each other.<eos> We didn't need to talk.<eos> But, when you finally closed your eyes,
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> The Ghost Riders, how do we stop 'em?<eos> We can find a person to absorb the lightning.<eos> Whatever happens will be your responsibility.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> You killed her, remember?

- Except Liam's the one with the sword.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Malia...<eos> Can you give me a second alone with Theo?<eos> - Why?<eos> - So I can kill him.<eos> Okay, look, I know that there's mixed feelings all around.<eos> But I might be your only option to stop the Wild Hunt.<eos> Let's kill him.<eos> What, you don't trust me?

No.<eos> But I think we can use him.<eos> Remember who he is.<eos> He got into your head and you tried to kill me.<eos> And when that didn't work, he did kill me.<eos> And Tracy, and Josh, and his sister.<eos> But this might be our only chance to get Stiles back.<eos> Can't we just try to find somebody that we at least trust?<eos> This might be a mistake.<eos> But you don't know that yet.

No, I don't.<eos> We're really gonna do this?<eos> Trust him?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> I've got an idea.<eos> It may not be better.<eos> But at least it's not him.<eos> Noah.<eos> Come out of there.<eos> Did you know about this room?
People do crazy things.<eos> What if this was his room?<eos> What if this means we had a son?<eos> Noah...<eos> Claudia, this could be the proof we're looking for.<eos> There are so many simple explanations for why this is here.<eos> But we had a son we've forgotten is not one of them.<eos> Aren't you curious?<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> You're making yourself crazy.
It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.<eos> I told you how it works.<eos> I don't need to be there when it all blows up.<eos> It's not going to blow up.<eos> They ride the lightning.<eos> We can use that to catch one and keep him there until we figure out what they want.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> You're trying to catch a Ghost Rider.

But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You guys want me to leave you alone?<eos> Oh, that's right, I can't.<eos> We better hurry.<eos> You did it.<eos> Of course we did it.<eos> This thing can transmute the energy from a lightning bolt.<eos> Even successive strikes.<eos> Mason, are you sure this is gonna work?
As long as everything goes perfectly and he doesn't escape and kill us all.<eos> And your transformer works and the whole place doesn't catch on fire.<eos> And there isn't a catastrophic solar flare.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> He has third degree burns over 90% of his body.<eos> I should be telling you to say your goodbyes.<eos> It's Peter.<eos> I don't need to say goodbyes.<eos> I need you to fix him so we can find out what he knows about the Wild Hunt.
I need you to fix him so we can find out what he knows about the Wild Hunt.<eos> Remember who we're dealing with.<eos> Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a devious plan to hurt everyone around him.<eos> What happens when he gets up out of that bed?<eos> You got a plan of your own?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I don't know if it's devious.<eos> At least it's a plan.<eos> I can't promise this will work.<eos> You said he was dying anyway.
I have a plan.<eos> I don't know if it's devious.<eos> At least it's a plan.<eos> I can't promise this will work.<eos> You said he was dying anyway.<eos> What does he have to lose?<eos> I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.
You said he was dying anyway.<eos> What does he have to lose?<eos> I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.<eos> She helps you, you help me.

To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.<eos> Mom...<eos> What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling a void?<eos> What if he's filling it with Claudia?<eos> You think Claudia's dead?<eos> No, I... I just saw her.<eos> So many things don't make sense.<eos> She had a fatal disease, but then she's fine.<eos> She says her Jeep was stolen 20 years ago, but it's Stiles'.<eos> Oh, you should have seen the look on her face when I peeled back the wallpaper.
Lydia, if Claudia isn't real, you don't want to be the one to tell him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Keep closing it.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> It worked.<eos> We did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We did.<eos> You knew about it, didn't you?
Yeah.<eos> We did.<eos> You knew about it, didn't you?<eos> God, it was on the blueprints.<eos> It was here when we moved in.<eos> That was 18 years ago.<eos> Lydia?<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I don't understand how you knew this was here.

He's a walking corpse.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Why'd he stop trying to get out?<eos> Did he just call for backup?<eos> When Corey made the Ghost Rider visible at the party, another one showed up.<eos> We have to figure out how to talk to him.<eos> Or else get the hell out of here.<eos> Where's Corey?<eos> He's over there.<eos> How did you know?

On your knees.<eos> On your knees.<eos> We need Parrish.<eos> So, wait a sec.<eos> So, this woman "Lenore,"<eos> she conjured up her dead son?<eos> She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.<eos> And you saw this kid?
Tell us how we get everyone back.<eos> What was that?<eos> Did he say something?<eos> He said "Hellhound".<eos> Is that a good thing?<eos> Take the next left, cut over to the highway.<eos> And then don't stop.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> I'm not leaving without Stiles.<eos> You're so very loyal, Malia.

I'm comin' for my friends.<eos> I'm comin' for everyone.<eos> I won't stop.<eos> I'll never stop until we get everyone back.<eos> Parrish?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Scott...<eos> What is he doing?<eos> He's gonna set him free.<eos> I think you need to admit that you have an unhealthy attachment to Stiles.

Would you please try to behave like a human?<eos> I need Stiles for that.<eos> Why?<eos> Is he your human crutch?<eos> He's my anchor.<eos> I'll get you a new anchor.<eos> He's not comin' back.<eos> He was hunted.<eos> He got caught.<eos> You don't believe that.

- Same here.<eos> How do you think it's going?<eos> I bet it's working.<eos> Hey, hey, Parrish, Parrish, stop!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, we need to do something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> On three.<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Have you been here the whole time?
I bet it's working.<eos> Hey, hey, Parrish, Parrish, stop!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, we need to do something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> On three.<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Have you been here the whole time?<eos> How could I stay away?<eos> Maybe you should tell them who you really are.
Have you been here the whole time?<eos> How could I stay away?<eos> Maybe you should tell them who you really are.<eos> Hauptmann?<eos> It's them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And judging by the sound, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> For what?<eos> For you to run.<eos> You're leaving me?
But if we can hear them, it must be close.<eos> There'll be another chance.<eos> Go now.<eos> Malia, run!<eos> Go!<eos> Break the barrier.<eos> Break the barrier, or I'll rip you in two.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> Don't follow me.<eos> What did you do?
We have to remember everything.<eos> The tunnel gate's locked.<eos> Everything's locked.<eos> Think it'll hold them off?<eos> - Probably not.<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> You guys aren't hoping I'm gonna be the optimist, are you?<eos> So, how cold does this thing get?<eos> Cold enough for a Hellhound.<eos> It's not the same as the ice bath you gave Isaac but, it can lower your core temperature past anything a human can survive.
Right here.<eos> Up and down.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Sheriff, we need him.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> What?<eos> Tell you what?<eos> What are you talking about...<eos> Tell me about my son.<eos> Tell me one thing about Stiles that you remember.
Two of us.<eos> Keys, keys!<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Here.<eos> - Give me another.<eos> - Which one?<eos> Any of them.<eos> Come on!<eos> There's a lot of keys here!<eos> I really feel like you're not even trying right now, Liam.
- Come on!<eos> - Okay, here, take this one.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Yes! Go, go, go!<eos> Okay, it's doing something.<eos> You ready?<eos> Remember, this will get cold enough to kill you.<eos> So if something feels wrong or like, it's not working...<eos> It's going to work.<eos> I hope you're not saying that because you think I know what I'm doing.

Try to picture him in your head.<eos> Think about what he looks like, things he said.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Wait.<eos> Give it a few more seconds.<eos> I'm getting him out of there.<eos> Wait!<eos> Scott...<eos> Can you hear me?

It's not sleep.<eos> I think you're losing consciousness.<eos> And if you do that, I think we're gonna lose you.<eos> Scott, stay awake.<eos> Scott!<eos> You kissed her, Scott.<eos> You kissed Lydia.<eos> Stiles, please let me out.<eos> It's the full moon, I swear.<eos> You know I wouldn't do any of this on purpose.
Why?<eos> What's he gonna do?<eos> - He's gonna remember.<eos> - Remember what?<eos> Stiles.<eos> He has to remember Stiles.<eos> What if he can't?<eos> Then the rest of us...<eos> We get forgotten.<eos> You think you attacked the driver.
What if he can't?<eos> Then the rest of us...<eos> We get forgotten.<eos> You think you attacked the driver.<eos> Scott.<eos> Try to find him.<eos> Okay, why is it starting to feel like you're Batman and I'm Robin?<eos> Try to find him in your memories.<eos> You have something, Scott.<eos> Whether you want it or not, you can do things that nobody else can do.
Try to find him in your memories.<eos> You have something, Scott.<eos> Whether you want it or not, you can do things that nobody else can do.<eos> Find him in any memory.<eos> Good or bad.<eos> Scott, there's got to be something else, okay?<eos> We always have a plan B.<eos> This is just a dream.<eos> You're dreaming.<eos> Why can't you trust anyone?

I think he is.<eos> I think maybe it's too much information.<eos> Like, he's getting buried under all the memories.<eos> Being overloaded by them.<eos> So what do we do to help him?<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott, do you hear me?<eos> You have to try to focus!<eos> That's it, there's no going back.<eos> Seriously don't understand how you survive without me.
You have to try to focus!<eos> That's it, there's no going back.<eos> Seriously don't understand how you survive without me.<eos> Frontotemporal dementia.<eos> I'll do something.<eos> Liam, come on.<eos> We don't have much of a lead on them.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Don't! Don't turn it off.<eos> You want to bring them all here?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Don't! Don't turn it off.<eos> You want to bring them all here?<eos> Every single one of them?<eos> That's exactly what I want to do.<eos> 'Cause if the Ghost Riders are here, that means they're not trying to get to Scott.<eos> So you don't care if they get to you?<eos> They're gonna get to all of us eventually.<eos> You!<eos> You're going first.
I'm on your side as long it helps me.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> Theo.<eos> Theo?<eos> Theo?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just, just thought I was somewhere else for a second.<eos> Where?<eos> In a bad dream.<eos> You said you knew where to hide.
I think we have to treat this more like actual hypnosis.<eos> They use images to guide you through memories.<eos> Like, a stairwell.<eos> The steps take you down through one year of your life to the next.<eos> That's how they regress you back.<eos> I get it.<eos> So he needs to imagine something.<eos> What do we tell him?<eos> Scott?<eos> Can you hear me?

Imagine this. Imagine you're in the high school.
Scott?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Scott, listen. Imagine this. Imagine you're in the high school.<eos> Visualize yourself in the high school, in the corridor where all the lockers are.<eos> Just try to imagine standing there.<eos> That's where your memories are.<eos> They're all in the lockers.<eos> They're locked away behind each one.<eos> Every memory of Stiles is in a separate locker.<eos> Scott, you're there.

I'm not getting in one of those.<eos> Me neither.<eos> You should've left me in the holding cell.<eos> I should've left you in the ground.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Yeah. Really.<eos> What do you think I was doing down there?<eos> Just hanging out with my dead sister?<eos> Having a good time catching up on childhood memories?<eos> I think you were rotting down there.

Listen, I remember something.<eos> At the start of the year, Stiles was trying to find a place for you guys to live after graduation.<eos> He said you were getting an apartment together?<eos> And I remember saying something to Stiles. Something like it's not always a good idea to live with your friends.<eos> Even your best friend.<eos> But Stiles said it wouldn't matter because you weren't just friends.<eos> You guys were more like brothers.<eos> Brothers. Brothers.<eos> Scott, just listen to me, okay?<eos> You're not a no one.

And I need you.<eos> Scott, you're my brother.<eos> All right, so...<eos> So if we're gonna do this, then, I think you're just gonna have to take me with you.<eos> What, what's wrong?<eos> Why'd you bring me out?<eos> Your heart rate dropped.<eos> You were gonna die.
But then, but then nothing happened, did it?<eos> It didn't work.<eos> - I'm going back in.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> It was working.<eos> Something was happening.<eos> I could feel it.<eos> But nothing was happening out here.<eos> Nothing, Scott.<eos> All we saw was you freezing to death.

We're not.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> I have plenty of memories of Stiles, too.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Not as dangerous as doing nothing.<eos> She'll probably handle the cold better than me.<eos> If it's all about connection, then Stiles was the first person I connected with in a long time.<eos> She'll need a visual.<eos> Okay, I think I have an idea.<eos> But Malia, if your heart rate goes down like Scott's, or if we think you're going to freeze to death...

Are you in the library now?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm in the library.<eos> Can you see the books?<eos> I see them.<eos> Concentrate on them.<eos> The books on the shelves are your memories.<eos> Everything that's ever happened to you.<eos> Find the shelf that has all of your memories of Stiles.<eos> Try to find a memory where you made some kind of connection with him.

Sti...<eos> Did you find something?<eos> I definitely connected.<eos> I'm not gonna run. 'Cause I don't think you're gonna hurt me.

'Cause I don't think you're gonna hurt me.<eos> And I think that maybe you're so afraid of hurting me because of what you did to your family.
You want to help me?<eos> Find a way to change me back.<eos> You want to go back?<eos> To being a coyote?<eos> Find something else.<eos> I heard you almost got killed.<eos> I hate this.<eos> Malia.<eos> I gotta leave for a few, okay?<eos> Where are you going?

Yeah, I'd never leave you behind.<eos> Malia?<eos> Malia, open your eyes.<eos> Malia, can you hear us?<eos> Open your eyes, Malia.<eos> Scott, look.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> - Hide with the dead?<eos> - It was worth a try.<eos> What are you doing?
There's a huge difference in being a vivid memory and an actual corporeal human being.<eos> I know. Which is why I think it should be you.<eos> I won't last two minutes in there.<eos> Then think of something else.<eos> Malia's right.<eos> It's all about the connection.<eos> When I was remembering him, I was also remembering the two of you together.<eos> I don't think anyone had a connection like you guys.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> You have to try, Lydia.
When I was remembering him, I was also remembering the two of you together.<eos> I don't think anyone had a connection like you guys.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> You have to try, Lydia.<eos> Then we have to do it the old-fashioned way.<eos> We're going to have to actually hypnotize me.<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> Good.<eos> Really?<eos> You really need me to remind you that getting captured by the Ghost Riders isn't gonna help you save your friends?
They're everywhere.<eos> Good.<eos> Really?<eos> You really need me to remind you that getting captured by the Ghost Riders isn't gonna help you save your friends?<eos> We're both getting caught.<eos> You can do it while you're running.<eos> I'm going down fighting.<eos> My mother had a hypnotist who helped her quit smoking.<eos> She had me see the same one when I was 10.<eos> You smoked when you were 10?
You smoked when you were 10?<eos> No. I bit my fingernails.<eos> Just find a lighter or a candle, please.<eos> Too much?<eos> I got one.<eos> What's that?<eos> An induction script.<eos> One of you is going to talk me through this.<eos> So I just read?<eos> Well, you have to soften your voice.
So I just read?<eos> Well, you have to soften your voice.<eos> Keep it relaxed but not monotone.<eos> Go for clarity, not volume. Try it.<eos> "Take a deep breath and look at the candle."<eos> "Take a deep breath and look at the candle.<eos> "Feel the muscles in your body begin to relax.<eos> "Your hands relaxing.<eos> Your eyelids relaxing.<eos> "As you relax, imagine you're sitting in front of a TV."

You wanna dance?<eos> Pass.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let me try that again.<eos> Lydia, get off your cute little ass and dance with me now.<eos> Interesting tactic.<eos> I'm gonna stick with "no."<eos> "Try to find a memory of Stiles.<eos> "A memory where you felt a connection with him."<eos> I'm the only one who knows how smart you really are.
Nobel doesn't have a prize for mathematics.<eos> Fields Medal.<eos> Find another memory.<eos> Keep looking for Stiles.<eos> Find another memory.<eos> Is anyone gonna get me a coat?<eos> Turning out to be like a perfect combination.<eos> My face just has, like - I'm not a psychic. - You're something!<eos> Let's go!<eos> What are you doing?
Okay, well, maybe we could just... We could go over there and...<eos> What?<eos> It's from Isaac.<eos> What is it now?<eos> She took him.<eos> She's got all three now.<eos> There's still time.<eos> We still have time, right?<eos> Stiles?<eos> You okay?
Uh, friends, family...<eos> Uh, I mean, not family.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Okay. Uh, just... Try and slow your breathing.<eos> I can't... I can't.<eos> Shh. Shh. Stiles, look at me.<eos> Look at me. Shh. Stiles.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh... I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.
Shh. Shh. Stiles, look at me.<eos> Look at me. Shh. Stiles.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh... I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.<eos> I did?<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> That's when it happened.<eos> When what happened?<eos> Lydia, what do you mean?
Lydia, what do you mean?<eos> When what happened?<eos> When I kissed him.<eos> That's when it all changed.<eos> Lydia, look at me.<eos> I saw him.<eos> I was there.<eos> I was the last person to see him.<eos> Where?<eos> When did you see him?
Lydia, look at me.<eos> I saw him.<eos> I was there.<eos> I was the last person to see him.<eos> Where?<eos> When did you see him?<eos> The Ghost Riders, they...<eos> When they took him.<eos> Look at me. Look at me.<eos> You're gonna forget me.
We didn't see anyone.<eos> No.<eos> He was here.<eos> I know it.<eos> Stiles was here.<eos> Liam...<eos> But everyone else is gone.<eos> All of them.<eos> They're all gone.<eos> - Look, you have to come with me.
I have to show you.<eos> Uh, all right.<eos> You guys stay here.<eos> Just in case.<eos> In case Stiles Ecomes back?<eos> If there's any hope, you need to keep trying.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott.<eos> Scott?<eos> What are you doing?
If there's any hope, you need to keep trying.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott.<eos> Scott?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're gonna go find Stiles.<eos> Scott told us to stay in case he shows up here.<eos> Stiles isn't coming here.<eos> If he was, he would've, and he hasn't, so he's not.<eos> You still think it worked, right?
Scott.<eos> Scott?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're gonna go find Stiles.<eos> Scott told us to stay in case he shows up here.<eos> Stiles isn't coming here.<eos> If he was, he would've, and he hasn't, so he's not.<eos> You still think it worked, right?<eos> I know I saw him.<eos> And you're never wrong about these things.
We have to tell Scott.<eos> We should probably tell Scott about that, too.<eos> He can't take both of us?<eos> No way.<eos> Hollenhund.<eos> Parrish.<eos> Parrish, you don't wanna do this.<eos> The train is coming, boys.<eos> There's no stopping the Wild Hunt.<eos> You'll make a fine Ghost Rider, Scott.
Corey.<eos> How many rooms does this place have?<eos> Beyond the 57 we've already searched?<eos> Probably enough for all of Beacon Hills.<eos> We're never gonna find him.<eos> Just keep looking.<eos> Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in 19 minutes.<eos> Okay, we're running out of time.<eos> - Mason. You always know where he is.

You always know where he is.<eos> - Yeah, except for right now.<eos> But you find him eventually.
- What are you looking for? - Ah! This.<eos> And him.<eos> Grab him.<eos> Grab him now.<eos> Okay.<eos> - God, ow!<eos> - Liam, you're fine.<eos> God, that doesn't feel good. You know?<eos> Stiles?<eos> What are you doing here?
What if that's how Douglas is doing it?<eos> What if Corey's the key?<eos> Interesting theory, okay? Solid logic.<eos> It is, but he's in there and we're out here.<eos> So the only way to save everyone now is to just divert the train.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> How?<eos> I'm going into the Hunt.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Liam, I think you're confused, we're trying to get people out of the Hunt.
How?<eos> I'm going into the Hunt.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Liam, I think you're confused, we're trying to get people out of the Hunt.<eos> He can get taken by a Ghost Rider.<eos> It's just... That's not a pleasant option.<eos> I'm speaking from experience.<eos> I don't need to get taken to get into the Hunt.<eos> Okay. Seems like you got an idea, let's disc...<eos> Where are you going?
You wanna split up?<eos> Never again.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I hate horses.<eos> Nice horse...<eos> Hey, you made it out!<eos> Yeah, barely!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.<eos> You're kidding, right?
Hey, you made it out!<eos> Yeah, barely!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> I went through all this to keep you from being taken.<eos> You need a hand?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Then go already! Go!<eos> You know how to ride a horse?
Are you sure it's him?<eos> I know his smile, I know his touch...<eos> And I know that that's his voice.<eos> It has to come from somewhere.<eos> Mason. We have to go.<eos> Just give me a minute, I can find it...<eos> We don't have a minute.<eos> They're coming.<eos> Liam?<eos> When did you learn how to ride a horse?
It can be this easy.<eos> - For once, let's do easy.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Or not.<eos> Nope, not easy at all.<eos> Attention, all passengers, the train will be arriving in 12 minutes.<eos> Me?<eos> You want me to stop them?<eos> You know how many there are?
- It's impossible.<eos> - We can try.<eos> Where do you get this implausible optimism?<eos> Definitely not from my father.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We need someone to just hear us.<eos> I think we already did.<eos> Stiles?<eos> Damn! Man!<eos> Are you okay?
The train will be arriving in nine minutes.<eos> Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in eight minutes.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Scott, I can't fight this guy.<eos> I didn't say it back.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> God!<eos> They're all sealed shut.<eos> Bet you wouldn't mind having a werewolf around right now... to rip them off their hinges.
They're all sealed shut.<eos> Bet you wouldn't mind having a werewolf around right now... to rip them off their hinges.<eos> Like to have one around for another reason right now.<eos> Get back.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I gotta get me one of these.<eos> Argent!<eos> - What was that for?<eos> - That was so hot.<eos> I'd almost say you enjoy this, Scott.
Argent!<eos> - What was that for?<eos> - That was so hot.<eos> I'd almost say you enjoy this, Scott.<eos> The pursuit of utterly futile endeavors.<eos> Step back from the diverter.<eos> Or I'll make you step back.<eos> Now that's the German way of doing things.<eos> You would've made an excellent Nazi Youth.<eos> Maybe you didn't hear me.

Stiles, that's not your mom.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know her voice.<eos> No, that's the Wild Hunt.<eos> They're tricking you.<eos> Stiles, please believe me.<eos> The Wild Hunt brought her back, but she's not real.<eos> What do you mean "brought her back?"<eos> Stiles.<eos> I know what you've been through.
I know who it is.<eos> I know her voice.<eos> No, that's the Wild Hunt.<eos> They're tricking you.<eos> Stiles, please believe me.<eos> The Wild Hunt brought her back, but she's not real.<eos> What do you mean "brought her back?"<eos> Stiles.<eos> I know what you've been through.<eos> I know how much you love your father.
But I love him more.<eos> Okay, we need to unplug him.<eos> We need to just get him out of this thing.<eos> I'll start with the big one.<eos> I'll pull it quick.<eos> It'll hurt, but Corey can heal.<eos> We can't.<eos> Not until Scott diverts the train.<eos> If we stop the merging, Scott won't be able to find the diverter.<eos> You wanna just leave him like this?
We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Even in the face of insurmountable odds.<eos> I don't know if it's suicide or stupidity.<eos> Maybe both.<eos> Either way, I'm getting to that diverter.<eos> You of all people, Scott, should know what happens to a lone wolf.
You of all people, Scott, should know what happens to a lone wolf.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> He's got a pack.<eos> And Theo's not in it.<eos> But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack.<eos> But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.
But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack.<eos> But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.<eos> Yeah, worming is one of my skills.<eos> That thing is conjured from your dad's pain.<eos> If he remembers you, he can't believe in her.<eos> That's why you have to go.

Or don't they listen to you?<eos> I am your leader.<eos> Obey me.<eos> Kill them.<eos> All of them.<eos> Riders don't bow.<eos> They have no leader.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you fix this?
Well, there's the whole graduation thing.<eos> I've gotta go to summer school or I can't do the whole graduation thing.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> No. Come on, wait...<eos> Guys?<eos> This can't be it.<eos> I can't believe we're not in high school anymore.<eos> Kind of feels like nothing's really changed.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> Okay! So, Liam, since you're the new Alpha...
Let's do it.<eos> No. Come on, wait...<eos> Guys?<eos> This can't be it.<eos> I can't believe we're not in high school anymore.<eos> Kind of feels like nothing's really changed.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> Okay! So, Liam, since you're the new Alpha...<eos> I'm not an Alpha.<eos> Right, but, you know, Alpha-in-training.
- Here you go.<eos> Love you guys.<eos> Right.<eos> I leave you with this.<eos> You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.<eos> You sure you won't need it?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Lydia's gonna drive me down to D.C.<eos> She wants to help me move into my dorm, so...<eos> You know she's starting MIT as a Junior?
I leave you with this.<eos> You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.<eos> You sure you won't need it?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Lydia's gonna drive me down to D.C.<eos> She wants to help me move into my dorm, so...<eos> You know she's starting MIT as a Junior?<eos> - How do you even do that?<eos> - I... She's a genius.<eos> Real question is how'd you get into UC Davis?

- I... She's a genius.<eos> Real question is how'd you get into UC Davis?<eos> How did you get into George Washington?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, your dad.<eos> The, uh, big FBI pops made a call to the little pre-FBI program.<eos> Pre-FBI.<eos> Well, I guess we're not the same kids running around the woods looking for a body.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> You know, you can keep the Jeep.
These aren't the keys to the Jeep.<eos> Well, that's one to your house, another to your room, uh, it's the master key to the school,<eos> Animal Clinic, key to the Sheriff's station.<eos> Just figured you should have all the copies I secretly made. So...<eos> Yeah.<eos> They still need us.<eos> They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I...<eos> I need you.<eos> You know that.
They still need us.<eos> They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I...<eos> I need you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I need you too.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> No, really, I need you though, uh...<eos> I lost my license in the Hunt.<eos> So you have to drive.
- Morning, Ollie.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Uh, I wouldn't give Mr. Richards Methotrexate, if I were you.<eos> Allergies, Sam.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You try working 30 hours straight.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not the one who wanted to be a doctor.<eos> You want to go out to dinner tonight?<eos> How about I just come over after dinner?<eos> You always come over after, but there's never any before.
- That's right.<eos> - Until about 11:00 p.m.<eos> Until 11:00 tonight, and, of course, you all remember that awful tornado that swept through...<eos> There's a mix of 50s and 100s in there.<eos> 50s are yellow.<eos> Just don't mix them up, Em, please.<eos> I told you to stop doing this.<eos> And I told you to stop lifting with your back and go to the doctor.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You went to see her, didn't you?

I'm fine.<eos> You went to see her, didn't you?<eos> Kare.<eos> It's all right.<eos> She wouldn't have written to you if she didn't want you to know her.<eos> I'm sure that's why she moved back here.<eos> - I don't know her. - Hard to from your truck.<eos> Yeah, well, nothing gets better in my truck, but nothing gets worse.<eos> Dorothy she's your mother.<eos> You're my mother.
Pleas.<eos> Hello, hello, hello?<eos> Oh, God, what's happening?<eos> Bad dog.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't understand you.<eos> Where am I?<eos> I don't know where I am.<eos> good dog<eos> These are the Tribal Free Lands.<eos> You are trespass.
I don't know where I am.<eos> good dog<eos> These are the Tribal Free Lands.<eos> You are trespass.<eos> Excuse me, I-I don't know how I got here.<eos> If... if you could just point me to the nearest road... look, I could just get a ride from there.<eos> Pleas?<eos> You..<eos> You... you found her.<eos> You know this woman?

Witch.<eos> You killed the Mistress of the Eastern Woods,<eos> The Most Merciful and Stern.<eos> I told you, it was an accident.<eos> Only a witch can kill a witch... or The Beast Forever.<eos> You are no beast.<eos> And I'm no witch.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> I am Ojo of the Tribal Free Lands.<eos> You are trespass.
I'm no one.<eos> I really... I really am no one.<eos> I don't mean anything, I don't- I<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> Pleas!<eos> She has sisters... in the West and in the North.<eos> And the Wizard of Oz... you will most certainly have to answer to the Wizard of Oz.<eos> What's happening?<eos> A decision has been made.<eos> You are to be exiled from the Tribal Free Lands, never to return.

Your toto looks hungry.<eos> My toto?<eos> "Toto" is "dog" in our language.<eos> Medicine..<eos> For my head.<eos> Are you a healer?
Ugh. Your toto looks hungry.<eos> My toto?<eos> "Toto" is "dog" in our language.<eos> Medicine..<eos> For my head.<eos> Are you a healer?<eos> I guess.<eos> I like to help people... when they're not trying to drown me.<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that the beast you were talking about?
The Beast Forever drowned this and hundreds like it.<eos> So the beast is a flood?<eos> Beast Forever takes many forms...<eos> Floods that meet the sky, fires that water cannot extinguish, monstrosities that slither and soar.<eos> So how do you stop it?<eos> Who stopped it before?<eos> A wizard... with those.<eos> Eternal Warriors... they formed a wall around Emerald City to keep The Beast Forever from flooding our entire world.<eos> Yeah, definitely not Kansas.<eos> Why do I get the feeling, Isabel, when I stop playing, you're gonna deliver some horrible news?
What is this place?<eos> A prison.<eos> Prison of the Abject.<eos> Most secure.<eos> For anyone who violates the Wizard's law against magic.<eos> Who's that?<eos> My wife.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You should be.<eos> You killed the witch that put them here... maybe the only one who can free them.
Well, you should have sent someone else.<eos> So many soldiers here...<eos> we tend to lose a few, especially when they're afraid.<eos> There's rumors of magic.<eos> If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?<eos> The rip in the sky?<eos> No.<eos> No magic here.<eos> I found a new line of work, thanks to you.<eos> So poppy business up, whores exhausted, blood in the sky, and you perambulating around the people with Glinda's girls.
I found a new line of work, thanks to you.<eos> So poppy business up, whores exhausted, blood in the sky, and you perambulating around the people with Glinda's girls.<eos> It has begun.<eos> - First true sign.<eos> - It is.<eos> There is no doubt. - [Groans.<eos> You may know everything there is to know about The Beast Forever.<eos> I'm sure my sister in the North only picks the best and brightest for the Wizard's Council.<eos> Mistress West...<eos> But you were a baby the last time it came.

You have a deep wound here.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know. I don't remember.<eos> - How about your name?<eos> - [stammers. What's your name?<eos> No!<eos> I'm just gonna check your head.<eos> I'm a healer.<eos> I think you're too late.
It's getting dark.<eos> We should try and find some food.<eos> Am I coming with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you?<eos> Wizard's Guard approaching!<eos> The girl is gone.<eos> But the Witch of the East remain.<eos> That looks good.<eos> Could you, um...?

Huh. So Lucas is home?<eos> Mmhmm. All right.<eos> Well, Lucas it is.<eos> Doroth.<eos> Doroth.<eos> Doroth.<eos> Prison..<eos> Prison of Abject.<eos> I woke with the strangest taste in my mouth...<eos> Do you know who I am?
Doroth.<eos> Prison..<eos> Prison of Abject.<eos> I woke with the strangest taste in my mouth...<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> [groans. Witc!<eos> S-S-Ste n.<eos> Merciful and Stern.<eos> Steel won't help you, swordsm n.<eos> Unless you want to open your neck and end your hurt.

I don't know how, but I did.<eos> In Oz, nothing good ever comes from the sky.<eos> So, when something does, we try to send it back in pieces.<eos> Put that down.<eos> Put it down. It's dangerous.<eos> I'll be the judge of that.<eos> I'll be the judge of everything.<eos> Don'!<eos> Or what?<eos> Or you'll die again and forever.
Or what?<eos> Or you'll die again and forever.<eos> My, my... so pretty and so stupid.<eos> Only a witch can kill a witch.<eos> What does it do, and how does it work?<eos> Let him go, and I'll say.<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> Fine, I'll tell you.<eos> I'll tell you. I'll tell you.<eos> You're pointing it the wrong way.
To the Wizard of Oz.<eos> And he can probably take me home.<eos> Find out who or what fell from the sky.<eos> Make sure it doesn't come back to Emerald City.<eos> So I say "who's there," even though I know it's you.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Why? Let's just try itagain.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Why are you knocking?

Do you remember anything from here?<eos> Anything you recognize or makes you feel something?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> You.<eos> How long have you been saving that?<eos> A few miles.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?

'Cause they don't know them.<eos> The Bowler said he he'd never seen a wound like it before.<eos> A hole... carved neatly out of our sister's head.<eos> She was to see me when it happened.<eos> Matters of great import.<eos> Any idea what?<eos> You look terrible.<eos> It's been 20 years.<eos> Time ravages.<eos> How would you have me look?

Time ravages.<eos> How would you have me look?<eos> Like you didn't just crawl out of a poppy field.<eos> Where I crawl is none of your problem.<eos> It is, actually.<eos> The Wizard has granted my request to open our sacred temple.<eos> But it won't make any difference if your tongue's not right.<eos> My tongue is perfect.<eos> We are the last Cardinal Witches, you and I.<eos> If you cannot sing your sister properly and right her to rest, then she will be the last.
Eamonn!<eos> We shouldn't be here.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Cesspool of witches.<eos> And look at him.<eos> Wizard's right-hand man.<eos> Gonna get us all killed hunting for some girl who fell from the sky.<eos> So I'll tell you what... we break south, find the girl ourselves, ride back to Emerald City with her head, then we'll have the Wizard's loyalty.<eos> No, Eamonn's not gonna let us break off.<eos> Yeah, you're right.

You must really want to get home.
Yeah, you're right.<eos> Guess we'll have to kill him.<eos> We'll cut him into bits.<eos> Make it look like lions did it.<eos> Do you want me to slow down?<eos> Ha.

People.<eos> Ah. - Someone you laid with.<eos> - What?<eos> Laid with?<eos> You know, someone who-<eos> - Uh, I know what you mean.<eos> - So? I'm not having this conversation with you, Lucas.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I don't know you.<eos> Well, you saved me, so how does that work?
Medicine, uh... doctor, pharmacy.<eos> For him.<eos> - Apothecary?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, an apothecary.<eos> Where can I find one?<eos> She don't take to visitors.<eos> Look, sir, I'm begging you... please.<eos> I just need to know where she is, otherwise he's gonna die.<eos> What are you up to, boy?
- Jack?<eos> - I've been waitin' forever!<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> She went to the butcher's.<eos> - What?<eos> - She went to the butcher's!<eos> - Well, how long is that?<eos> - I don't know, not long.<eos> I can't take it anymore, Jack.<eos> You've got to find a way in.
Yeah, yeah, Vessel, solace, truth...<eos> I spend half my life waiting to walk in and out of rooms.<eos> Glinda.<eos> It's been some time.<eos> The North is always open to you.<eos> Isabel?<eos> This is Anna.<eos> She'll be true and chaste, without distraction of body and mind. To better serve you.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> You stay. Stay.

Mistress East and I, we had a partnership.<eos> The Prison of the Abject.<eos> Yes, an unfortunate name.<eos> An unfortunate prison.<eos> It wasn't my creation.<eos> We can't unlock it, if that's what you want.<eos> So whatever magic she used to open it, I give you my permission to re-create it.<eos> I wish we could, but a witch's spells are her own.<eos> And there are a thousand variations.<eos> Normally, East would've had an apprentice to pass along the fruit of her tongue, but... you put an end to all that, didn't you?
And there are a thousand variations.<eos> Normally, East would've had an apprentice to pass along the fruit of her tongue, but... you put an end to all that, didn't you?<eos> If there's nothing else, we have preparations to make.<eos> You feeling all right, Mistress?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Jack!<eos> - There's no way through!<eos> - No, there has to be!<eos> Look, it's too hard.<eos> - Mate, you can't give up.
Bring him inside.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - That's very kind of you.<eos> - I've got just the thing for him.<eos> You're having one of your days.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> It's all right, boy, I know... it must be hard sometimes, just being cooped up in here.<eos> Who would want that?<eos> But with your condition, to be exposed to... all that's out there...<eos> At least with this, you're still alive.

He's telling the truth.<eos> When I found him in Nimbo, he was barely alive.<eos> So it was you.<eos> He couldn't even remember his name.<eos> I know what Wizard's Guard did at Nimbo.<eos> Burned and tortured.<eos> I was there.<eos> I saw.<eos> No, what they did to those people, they did to me, too.<eos> And yet you carry their sword.

No!<eos> Go.<eos> Who's up there?<eos> Uh, I think it's time for you and the Wizard's Guard to leave.<eos> Why did they write that?<eos> Tell me or I'm gonna go get help.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> It's just a... a sweet, sweet boy.<eos> Who's prone to hysterics.<eos> Who you keep locked up.

It's to protect him.<eos> From what?<eos> From everything.<eos> I may not be his mother, but I feel what all mothers feel.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Fear.<eos> All the time.<eos> In everything.<eos> From the minute they are born into the world, the world tries to take them right back.<eos> Well, you can't protect him forever.

Anna, is it?<eos> Where are the others?<eos> They're preparing for the funeral.<eos> Not the best circumstance for your inaugural time.<eos> It gives me a chance to familiarize myself with your science.<eos> Must be overwhelming.<eos> On the contrary, it feels... like second nature.<eos> Numbers and patterns and theorems... they're beautiful.<eos> As beautiful as magic.<eos> Would you like to join me for the funeral?

It doesn't feel like me.<eos> Keep the sword, if it puts your mind at ease.<eos> Do you know what would put me at ease?<eos> Us getting out of here.<eos> Lucas.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lucas...<eos> Lucas, you've been poisoned.<eos> So I need you to put your head to the side and open your mouth.
Stay with me, Lucas.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> It's just charcoal.<eos> It'll soak up the poison.<eos> You have to drink it all.<eos> Swallow, Lucas, swallow.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Did you get them?
Tip!<eos> Tip!<eos> I order you!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, Lucas.<eos> Come on.<eos> What have you done with him?<eos> Where's the child?<eos> He's gone.<eos> You have no idea what you've done!
Lucas?<eos> Lucas, stop.<eos> Lucas, stop! Stop it, Lucas!<eos> Stop!<eos> We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.<eos> Why'd she have it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.<eos> You all right?
What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?<eos> How is your sister?<eos> Alive, no thanks to you.<eos> What she does, she does to herself.<eos> What she does, she usually does in private.<eos> For a ruler expecting The Beast Forever, you spend the goodwill of your friends freely.

The Witch of the East is dead.<eos> Squeeze the trigger.<eos> A hole carved neatly out of our sister's head.<eos> I found our sister's killer.<eos> We are the last cardinal witches, you and I.<eos> How is he?<eos> Please, my friend needs help.<eos> Who's up there?<eos> - It's a boy.<eos> - Who you keep locked up.

It's me, Jack.<eos> Something's happened.<eos> Lucas?<eos> Lucas!<eos> You shouldn't have that.<eos> I don't think anyone should.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> What's it called?<eos> A gun.<eos> When you kill someone with a sword, at least you got to work at it.
I don't think anyone should.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> What's it called?<eos> A gun.<eos> When you kill someone with a sword, at least you got to work at it.<eos> - Some of us.<eos> That woman was going to kill you, so I acted on instinct.<eos> - And that's what scares me.<eos> - Well, maybe it should.<eos> Look, whatever's inside me... I'll discover it soon enough and so will you.
Here.<eos> What is that?<eos> That's the Witch of East's keep.<eos> The Mistress of the Eastern Wood, Most Merciful and Stern, is dead.<eos> She controlled the weather.<eos> Now it mourns for her.<eos> How'd she die?<eos> Murdered.<eos> Tip?<eos> Have you made your mind up?

Then we go to Ev.<eos> We find more medicine.<eos> Whatever happened, we'll fix it.<eos> We'll turn you back to you.<eos> Why have we stopped?<eos> Wizard's Guard blocking the road.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> Not butcher anyone.<eos> What if it's me they're looking for?<eos> Lucas, they think you're dead.
Before they realize I'm not.<eos> Come on.<eos> No.<eos> The Wizard's Guards can take me to Emerald City.<eos> I... I guess this is where we say good-bye, then.<eos> Then I guess it is.<eos> - Bye.<eos> They're in the back.<eos> In the last car.<eos> Toto, I know what you're thinking.

- No.<eos> They're possessed by magic.<eos> What're they doing now?<eos> Speak!<eos> It's a ritual.<eos> For what?<eos> Suicide.<eos> What did I ever do to this Wizard?<eos> Why would he want to kill me?<eos> Well, maybe you're more dangerous than I am.

Until The Beast incinerates us all.<eos> If I may?<eos> Um... Since I am new and lacking in wisdom and therefore useless to your aid, can I be spared to help The Wizard?<eos> I mean no disrespect, but the field pattern is not a sign of The Beast Forever.<eos> Elizabeth is wrong.<eos> The death of Mistress East leaves the weather in chaos.<eos> That field is heavy with dew-frost.<eos> It's going to snow tonight.<eos> That's all it means.<eos> You're here for a few days, you're contradicting my most talented councilwoman.
And there's no need for an autopsy to determine where these women came from.<eos> Mistress West.<eos> The Wizard of Oz has demanded an audience with you.<eos> When I was 12... my mom sat me down.<eos> She told me she wasn't my mom.<eos> That my dad wasn't my dad.<eos> My real mom's name was Karen Chapman.<eos> My whole life, I imagined what it would be like, and... the moment I did finally meet her, I was taken here.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> You can't just control a tornado.

- No.<eos> We... we come for shelter.<eos> To loot.<eos> To steal.<eos> No, we... we wouldn't do that.<eos> Your lives I must take in my Mistress' stead.<eos> Faith and fealty to the end.<eos> No, please!<eos> Dorothy...<eos> You wear the elements.
No, we... we wouldn't do that.<eos> Your lives I must take in my Mistress' stead.<eos> Faith and fealty to the end.<eos> No, please!<eos> Dorothy...<eos> You wear the elements.<eos> My Mistress' gauntlets.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Are you my new Mistress?
My Mistress' gauntlets.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Are you my new Mistress?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I am your new Mistress.<eos> Tip, we're here.<eos> That's what Ev looks like.<eos> Come on.<eos> What you waiting for?
I am your new Mistress.<eos> Tip, we're here.<eos> That's what Ev looks like.<eos> Come on.<eos> What you waiting for?<eos> Move it, boy!<eos> What?<eos> You don't like it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You've eaten the same food your whole life.
When you are finished with the rituals of purification, you will dress for the Ceremony of Elements... and settle the weather.<eos> You will find everything to your liking, my Mistress.<eos> Servants' quarters, down the hall.<eos> They're empty.<eos> Swordsman must surrender his sword.<eos> I am the Mistress' blade now.<eos> Lucas.<eos> Just give him your sword.<eos> Listen to me very carefully.<eos> If you can't do what he's asking, he's gonna kill you.
Three dead girls... your girls... hanging in the square!<eos> Tragic, I know.<eos> I'll need to find replacements.<eos> If you're looking for a career change...<eos> Magic!<eos> That I banned from Oz.<eos> Here in Emerald City!<eos> Should I awake my giants to make an example of you?<eos> You think I had something to do with this?<eos> I'll have my councilwomen determine whether you're guilty or innocent.

How amusing.<eos> Know what?<eos> Your mother worked here.<eos> Before you were born.<eos> And after.<eos> But she wanted a better life for you, so she gave you up, sent you far, far away.<eos> Only to have you return.

She was succulent.<eos> Tasted her, myself.<eos> So did he.<eos> Don't worry, she's not yours.<eos> You can taste her, too.<eos> Wanna get purified?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Right.<eos> So what says "settle the weather, or get killed by a psycho"?<eos> Um, you look...
I wasn't noticeable.<eos> Not like you.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because that was my past.<eos> Because I took my past and I obliterated it.<eos> People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it.<eos> Crushed anyone who denied me the name.<eos> Your past does not define you.<eos> Your mother does not define you.<eos> All that matters... is who you wish to be.
I'll give it a try.<eos> Mom.<eos> Do all the girls take poppies?<eos> Most of take them every once in a while.<eos> Just for fun.<eos> And those women who jumped, what can you tell me about them?<eos> They were just like the rest.<eos> Except they wake the old men.<eos> Men who couldn't...<eos> "raise the flag," if you get me meaning.
- I didn't do it.<eos> - That's for Anna to decide.<eos> However, your punishment will be my decision.<eos> I am a Cardinal Witch.<eos> The last of our kind.<eos> I have powers you can't even fathom.<eos> And I own a run-down brothel.<eos> Because I hate magic even more than you.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm glad you banned it.
Come this way, please.<eos> I can't make you your medicine, love.<eos> Which is to say, I won't.<eos> No one will, not anywhere, and you shouldn't ever ask again.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you could hang for it.<eos> It's a black elixir, it's magic.<eos> It disturbs your true nature.<eos> My true nature?<eos> What you are right now, what's under those clothes, that's not a side effect of the medicine wearing off.
And then what?<eos> The Beast that comes will not take the form of fire.<eos> It will be far, far worse.<eos> Those girls who leapt to their deaths, their magic did not come from Mistress West.<eos> It came from The Beast itself.<eos> This is a Beast who knows you.<eos> Knows me?<eos> Exploits your greatest fears, reveals your greatest weakness.<eos> I have no weakness.<eos> Except that you've lost control of your Giants.
This is a Beast who knows you.<eos> Knows me?<eos> Exploits your greatest fears, reveals your greatest weakness.<eos> I have no weakness.<eos> Except that you've lost control of your Giants.<eos> Haven't you?<eos> The Beast chose those women because of the men they served.<eos> Men who were impotent.<eos> Just like the Eternal Warrior, The Beast knows everything.<eos> Well, you also thought that it would snow during sun season.
You went to the wrong place.<eos> You picked the wrong object, Mistress.<eos> The remnants will not settle the weather.<eos> Those objects belong to Interlopers who never belonged in Oz.<eos> No, I-I... I know this person.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> That belongs to the Interloper.<eos> The Wizard of Oz brought Interloper here, himself.<eos> To send her back.<eos> How could you have seen this person?

No, it wasn't.<eos> That's why I have the gauntlets.<eos> There is no acolyte, the weather will not be settled.<eos> It's over!<eos> I'm really sorry, just please don't hurt him.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on!<eos> Toto!<eos> Toto?<eos> You were right.
My mother was in Oz, Lucas.<eos> My mom was in Oz.<eos> We'll find you answers.<eos> No.<eos> My answers were here, and now they're gone because of me.<eos> The Wizard brought your mother here.<eos> He'll have your answers.<eos> The Wizard wants me dead.<eos> Well, how much are those answers worth?<eos> Where are you going?
There is no doubt that The Beast Forever will reveal itself as a hailstorm of fire.<eos> It will blaze through Oz until it has obliterated that which fell from the sky and everything else that stands in its path.<eos> And only your Eternal Warriors can stop it.<eos> An army of stone which fire cannot consume.<eos> On behalf of the High Council, we advise you to animate your Stone Giants immediately.<eos> Before we all burn.<eos> Tip!<eos> Tip!<eos> Tip.<eos> Why did you run off like that?
Tip!<eos> Tip.<eos> Why did you run off like that?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> Everything.<eos> My whole life.<eos> Me.<eos> Everything.<eos> What do you mean?
This is me.<eos> This.<eos> These.<eos> Her.<eos> I've always been this.<eos> I was born this.<eos> No, that's... crazy.<eos> Why would Mombi...<eos> Why does anyone do anything?<eos> You're still Tip!
I've always been this.<eos> I was born this.<eos> No, that's... crazy.<eos> Why would Mombi...<eos> Why does anyone do anything?<eos> You're still Tip!<eos> Really? Am I Tip?<eos> Because Tip thought if he ran away, if he just got clear of that place, then maybe he could find a life.<eos> - We can still do that.<eos> - You can.
It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stop doing that.<eos> It's not okay, it's not gonna be okay!<eos> Someone took me, someone stole me, and the worst part is, I'm still here!<eos> No.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> - I stole it for us.<eos> We can sell the emeralds.<eos> We can stay together, no matter what.<eos> What are you doing?
Previously on "Emerald City"...<eos> My mother, her was in Oz.<eos> Find the girl.<eos> She must die.<eos> How long have you been in The Wizard's Guard?
Find the girl.<eos> She must die.<eos> How long have you been in The Wizard's Guard?<eos> I know what The Wizard's Guard did at Nimbo.<eos> Beast Forever takes many forms.<eos> - So who stopped it before?<eos> - A wizard, with those.<eos> I don't think you ever controlled the Giants.<eos> I think their power is locked inside the Prison of the Abject.<eos> What you are right now, that's what happens when the medicine itself wears off.

Well, then maybe I do have a place for you.<eos> We should be on the brick road.<eos> The Wizard's Guards are on the brick road.<eos> Yeah, well, we're moving too slowly.<eos> This rate, we're never gonna get to...<eos> Or we might just keep you alive.<eos> Your dog's doing that thing again.<eos> His name's Toto.<eos> Does he know that?<eos> Are you sure that coat belonged to your mother?
His name's Toto.<eos> Does he know that?<eos> Are you sure that coat belonged to your mother?<eos> Yes.<eos> K. Chapman.<eos> Karen Chapman.<eos> Yes, but K could be for anything.<eos> It could be for Katherine or Kordelia.<eos> Cordelia stars with C.<eos> Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat.

- Couldn't determine the weather, could you?<eos> - and determine if this is magic or...<eos> I'll go myself.<eos> Well, I should at least be by your side.<eos> You still need counsel.<eos> Yes...<eos> Just not yours.<eos> Are you putting me to death?<eos> To work.<eos> Can you hear me?

What are you doing?<eos> The first thing you'll need is a proper bath.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> A clean orphan is a good orphan.<eos> I'm not an orphan!<eos> Isn't that right, Mum?<eos> Baptize her.<eos> I'm Dorothy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Are you alone?

She doesn't understand you.<eos> Well, she may not understand me, but she seems to know you.<eos> Well, at least somebody does.<eos> - But we have to go.<eos> - We can't.<eos> Lucas, I'm not abandoning her.<eos> What happened to seeing The Wizard?<eos> What happened to getting home?<eos> There's a village a walk back, maybe she's from there?<eos> You walk into that village, The Wizard's Guards will kill you...
Think about her parents.<eos> Wondering where she is, if she's dead<eos> - or if she's alive...<eos> - Dorothy.<eos> - She's ever gonna come home.<eos> - Dorothy.<eos> She's not you.<eos> We have to move.<eos> No.<eos> If you want, you can stay here with Toto.
- She's ever gonna come home.<eos> - Dorothy.<eos> She's not you.<eos> We have to move.<eos> No.<eos> If you want, you can stay here with Toto.<eos> Stand guard.<eos> But I'm taking her home.<eos> Hello, Jack.<eos> Did you sleep well?
But I'm taking her home.<eos> Hello, Jack.<eos> Did you sleep well?<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Jane.<eos> Where's Tip?<eos> - Tip?<eos> - My friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were quite alone when we found you.
Who are you?<eos> My name is Jane.<eos> Where's Tip?<eos> - Tip?<eos> - My friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were quite alone when we found you.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> She wouldn't have left me.<eos> Well, she might have thought you were dead.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If I may?<eos> You may.<eos> Always.<eos> I thought you were displeased with me.<eos> I was.<eos> Was I wrong to challenge you?<eos> I'm taking you to Nimbo because you did.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If I may?<eos> You may.<eos> Always.<eos> I thought you were displeased with me.<eos> I was.<eos> Was I wrong to challenge you?<eos> I'm taking you to Nimbo because you did.<eos> You were right.
I have studied all the data, I have pored over all the facts, and I believe... I feel...<eos> This Beast will come from the sky.<eos> It will have a brain and a heart.<eos> It will be possessed of relentless strength.<eos> Then I'm already dead.<eos> No, don't you...<eos> Don't you see?<eos> If it has a heart, you can kill it.<eos> I can't!<eos> You have to work the limbs, Jack.

You should have left me in the street.<eos> Like Tip.<eos> You had no right to help me!<eos> I take on many special projects for the Royal Army.<eos> This is what they pay me to do.<eos> So that's what I am?<eos> A project?<eos> We're all projects, Jack.<eos> All of us with missing pieces or damaged parts.<eos> You should be grateful I replaced yours.

That's where you're wrong.<eos> Today, I offer you a future.<eos> A future of hope.<eos> Of service.<eos> A chance to better yourselves.<eos> Under my tutelage, you shall join The Wizard's High Council and protect Oz against threats from without...<eos> No!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> It's all right, my child, no one wants to harm you.<eos> You're safe here.
- And from within.<eos> - I ain't taking no bath!<eos> I don't belong here!<eos> - That man lied to me!<eos> - I'm sorry, Mistress.<eos> This one's just a little...<eos> Touch me again, I'll break your arm!<eos> It's all right, child.<eos> We only want to help you.<eos> You're alone in this world, yes?
- I'm sorry, Mistress.<eos> This one's just a little...<eos> Touch me again, I'll break your arm!<eos> It's all right, child.<eos> We only want to help you.<eos> You're alone in this world, yes?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Without options.<eos> Without purpose.<eos> I can give you all that you seek.
It's all right, child.<eos> We only want to help you.<eos> You're alone in this world, yes?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Without options.<eos> Without purpose.<eos> I can give you all that you seek.<eos> I can give you a family.<eos> Which is clearly overrated.<eos> You've come to poach for your cause, I've come to poach for mine.
Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> - Seen a girl?<eos> - None by here, no.<eos> Anything amiss at all?<eos> No, no, I ain't seen anything.<eos> Nothing unusual we've seen.<eos> Seen nothing.<eos> You shoot that, and everyone will mark you for a witch.<eos> Do you understand?
- None by here, no.<eos> Anything amiss at all?<eos> No, no, I ain't seen anything.<eos> Nothing unusual we've seen.<eos> Seen nothing.<eos> You shoot that, and everyone will mark you for a witch.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - I can take care of myself.<eos> - But you won't, will you?<eos> Because ever since we met, you rush into things without a care whether or not you live or die.
Do you understand?<eos> - I can take care of myself.<eos> - But you won't, will you?<eos> Because ever since we met, you rush into things without a care whether or not you live or die.<eos> But some of us do care.<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> What?<eos> You have no business being here.<eos> On the contrary, empowered young women are my business.<eos> And you just happened to pick the exact same orphanage at the exact same time?

- Me?<eos> - Leave her out of this.<eos> Why?<eos> She's exactly what I'm looking for.<eos> Strong, spirited, vigorous.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You'll be treated with the utmost respect.<eos> Respect, yes.<eos> Love, no.<eos> You'll be untouched.
Forever and always.<eos> And I offer you the chance to feel something.<eos> To make others feel something.<eos> To be worshiped as a courtesan.<eos> So you're saying my only choice as a girl is nun or whore?<eos> Did I mention we sleep in?<eos> Boo!<eos> Jane?<eos> No.<eos> Are you like me?

Seriously?<eos> Who will I be today?<eos> A jackass?<eos> That was Tuesday.<eos> Perhaps I should be pretty?<eos> People like pretty.<eos> I think people generally prefer nice.<eos> - Mice?<eos> - Nice!<eos> Because from down there, you might see plenty.
- Nice!<eos> Because from down there, you might see plenty.<eos> Ha!<eos> Bravo.<eos> One for the freak.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Takes one to know one.<eos> It's a privilege, sir.<eos> Just lead on, Captain.<eos> You burnt our homes!

There's no magic here.<eos> Anna?<eos> Guards!<eos> Anna?<eos> Anna?<eos> Anna.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Sylvie?<eos> My God.<eos> Did you do this?
Close 'em.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> Be difficult to feel any worse.<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> I don't know what I would have done.<eos> You have others to counsel you.<eos> I've never met anyone like you.<eos> Not just that, but also...<eos> Don't.<eos> You must think me the fool.
Don't.<eos> You must think me the fool.<eos> Never.<eos> But I...<eos> I chose this path.<eos> Service over pleasure.<eos> And I cannot stray.<eos> There may be other villages like this.<eos> People like the Alderman, who refuse to follow you.<eos> Are you suggesting I kill him?
Service over pleasure.<eos> And I cannot stray.<eos> There may be other villages like this.<eos> People like the Alderman, who refuse to follow you.<eos> Are you suggesting I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> You'll only make him a martyr.<eos> Then what?<eos> You must turn him.<eos> You're new, right?

I just want to disappear, I just want to forget... forget everything.<eos> Maybe Glinda can help you.<eos> Give you a new life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I trust her even less than her sister.<eos> Wait.<eos> West wanted you, too?<eos> I don't think she's that discriminating.<eos> But she is.<eos> And if all you want to do is forget, she can show you how.

Was she cruel?<eos> Cruel?<eos> Definitely strange, but... kind of interesting strange.<eos> Who is she?<eos> Her name is Langwidere.<eos> Is she a friend of yours?<eos> A client.<eos> I brought you some clothes.<eos> We're going on an outing.<eos> You're moving well.

Your new world awaits.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> In the water.<eos> I knew it was you the whole time.<eos> You weren't fooling anyone.<eos> I've heard enough from my sister.<eos> I don't need any more from you.<eos> Was anything you said to me true?<eos> Every word.<eos> All you need to do is work for it.

Excellent question.<eos> For the crime of murdering the Mistress of the eastern wood... by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz...<eos> I commit you to d...<eos> This sword.<eos> I knew the man who carried it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I've been hunting the owner of this sword for a very long time.<eos> If he's alive, you will deliver him to me.

That will be all what?<eos> I must leave, Jack.<eos> I'm not staying here, am I?<eos> I'm afraid you don't have a choice.<eos> In case you weren't aware, you are walking and talking at the expense of our kingdom.<eos> The least you can do is offer your gratitude.<eos> Was that the deal?<eos> Build me, then sell me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd rather hoped you'd want to stay in my care.

Previously on "emerald city"...<eos> Come on. We're getting you out of here.<eos> - We?<eos> - Us. Jack.<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> Saved your life, of course.<eos> This is lady ev.<eos> The Princess owns you.<eos> - You ready to work?

No!<eos> - Roan?<eos> - Stay back, all of you.<eos> Roan!<eos> - Stay back.<eos> - Roan!<eos> Stop.<eos> Dorothy, that man, he knew me.<eos> So...<eos> Are you a good witch... Or a bad witch?
Stop.<eos> Dorothy, that man, he knew me.<eos> So...<eos> Are you a good witch... Or a bad witch?<eos> I must say, the wizard has outdone himself.<eos> Because he wants something from you.<eos> Well.<eos> Cynical girl.<eos> Cynicism is just an unpleasant way of telling the truth.<eos> Who are you?

Who are you?<eos> Jack.<eos> We met at the palace.<eos> And how do you know my langwidere?<eos> Well, I'm her... Property.<eos> He's indentured to me for the cost of his metal.<eos> How sweet.<eos> You know, you really ought to keep your hands to yourself.<eos> Father.<eos> Are you all right?
Ro.<eos> It's okay, indra.<eos> Get the girl some food.<eos> Of course, father.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find Dorothy soon, I promise.<eos> Hi.<eos> Come.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Why are you helping me?
Come.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> - Roan, you...<eos> - I don't know who roan is.<eos> It's you.<eos> A soldier?<eos> My soldier.<eos> The best I've ever known.<eos> But you don't remember that, do you?
My soldier.<eos> The best I've ever known.<eos> But you don't remember that, do you?<eos> All I know is, I was found in nimbo, left for dead by your men.<eos> There was an insurgency.<eos> Witchcraft.<eos> A lot of my soldiers were killed.<eos> Could I be responsible?<eos> Then I'd be a traitor.<eos> You didn't kill those men.

If those men find you, they will finish the job for sure.<eos> Eamonn!<eos> Eamonn!<eos> I need to get you help.<eos> Stay here.<eos> That is an order.<eos> Help!<eos> Not much for conversation, is she?<eos> This is the woman who killed your sister.<eos> I trust you will be fair.

Can your magic do that?<eos> My magic... Can do a great many things.<eos> Come back tomorrow and your wife will be waiting.<eos> Mistress.<eos> Tea!<eos> Where were we?<eos> Good witch... Or bad witch?<eos> There's no wrong answer.<eos> Unfortunately, there's no right one, either.<eos> You're wrong about all of this.
Mistress.<eos> Tea!<eos> Where were we?<eos> Good witch... Or bad witch?<eos> There's no wrong answer.<eos> Unfortunately, there's no right one, either.<eos> You're wrong about all of this.<eos> I didn't kill your sister.<eos> Liar!<eos> I will suck the lies out of you like marrow from a bone, or you can speak the truth now and save yourself the hurt.

I didn't kill your sister.<eos> Liar!<eos> I will suck the lies out of you like marrow from a bone, or you can speak the truth now and save yourself the hurt.<eos> By what magic did you kill my sister?<eos> My bag.<eos> Look in my bag.<eos> That.<eos> What kind of magic is this?<eos> Magic strong enough to kill a witch.<eos> So this is how you killed her.
So this is how you killed her.<eos> Please.<eos> It was here.<eos> Please.<eos> Right here.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> This may come as a surprise, but I'm not easily loved.<eos> Please.<eos> And you murdered the only person who was able to.
We can... We will defeat it.<eos> You say you have "expert knowledge."<eos> Tell me, what expert knowledge would this be?<eos> Anna?<eos> We know that this beast will come from the sky.<eos> Where not even the giants can reach.<eos> It will have a heart and it will think, and it will feel, and because of that, it can be killed.<eos> You disagree? We both read the signs differently.<eos> But one reading must be right, and the other must be wrong.<eos> Are you the dumb one, then?
Are you the dumb one, then?<eos> - Langwidere...<eos> - So she's the dumb one?<eos> Child, show some respect.<eos> I believe Anna has misread...<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> No, my signs are clear.<eos> My dear wizard... It seems you have an abundance of expert council.<eos> The only problem is, they don't seem to agree.<eos> What do you want?
Where is she?<eos> Napping.<eos> We had a strenuous conversation.<eos> Don't do anything until I arrive.<eos> I'll do with her as I please.<eos> And make a mess of it, no doubt.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> Tea!<eos> You don't have to yell, my ears haven't changed.<eos> Were you this insolent as a boy?

Sewer.<eos> Were you thinking about a swim?<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Remind me to teach you the proper way to wake someone up.<eos> Lu-cas?<eos> Right, it's... It's a name that Dorothy calls me.<eos> Dorothy here.<eos> Here?<eos> Are you sure?

I'm not lying!<eos> I'm not lying!<eos> I don't know her!<eos> Your own mother?<eos> Even dogs know their bitch from whence they came.<eos> My mother, the mistress of the south, birthed over a thousand children before she died.<eos> She gave life to every witch in oz, and even she found the time to care for me.<eos> Nurture me.<eos> But your mother couldn't care less about one baby girl?<eos> How rotten do you have to be for that?

Those were hers.<eos> My sister's.<eos> So, August, can I count on you to build my arsenal?<eos> I'm prepared to make a very large, very substantial offer.<eos> You'll have to name your price.<eos> I want my dog back.<eos> Randall.<eos> He died last year, you know.<eos> I think it was last year.<eos> If you can bring Randall back to me... That would be splendid.

I'm just an insolent child.<eos> Isn't that what you said?<eos> I need your help.<eos> You need mine.<eos> I was too young to remember the last attacks.<eos> But I grew up in its wake.<eos> The rebuilding of our kingdom.<eos> Yes, it was a marvel of innovation.<eos> We had no choice.<eos> When the beast forever came, you saved emerald city... And left my kingdom to drown.

I want to see emerald city laid to waste.<eos> And I want to see you drown in its suffering!<eos> And when the beast returns, I shall have my wish.<eos> Help me, please.<eos> - She's gonna kill me. - Yeah.<eos> As soon as she recovers.<eos> I have to get to the wizard.<eos> Can you give me that key?<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't recognize me, do you?

You don't recognize me, do you?<eos> I was the boy you saved.<eos> From mombi.<eos> Tip?<eos> How?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Tip, I... i helped you when I had nothing to gain.<eos> And I helped you because you asked me to.

Lead the way.<eos> If Dorothy's here, we'll find her.<eos> Listen to me, don't do this!<eos> I don't deserve to be here!<eos> If it's any consolation, I don't belong here, either.<eos> Dorothy?<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Mom?<eos> Dorothy...<eos> How did you get here?
Dorothy.<eos> Mom?<eos> Dorothy...<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Same as you.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> It's my fault you're not sure.

My sister with a secret...<eos> My sister with a secret.<eos> Glinda.<eos> She was trying to tell me about glinda.<eos> Mom?<eos> Thanks for the memories.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> We're going to miss the festival.<eos> I said hurry up.<eos> Why should I do anything you say?
Glinda.<eos> She was trying to tell me about glinda.<eos> Mom?<eos> Thanks for the memories.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> We're going to miss the festival.<eos> I said hurry up.<eos> Why should I do anything you say?<eos> Because I'm a Princess.<eos> You're the worst human being I've ever met.

How?<eos> I don't know, by thinking of them before yourself.<eos> Trying to be helpful, encouraging, or just... Doing things together.<eos> Like going to a festival?<eos> I guess.<eos> So... this one girl felled my best soldier.<eos> I don't know what kind of power she used.<eos> But one moment I was up, and the next, down.<eos> It was this.<eos> Do you know what it is?

But she's been quite revealing.<eos> - I told you to wait for me.<eos> - Don't worry. I'm certain she has more secrets to spill.<eos> Secrets?<eos> The ones our sister died with.<eos> If secrets were kept, they were kept from me, too.<eos> And what of your own?<eos> I harbor no secrets.<eos> Especially from you.<eos> You're the only family I have left.

Let time not be our enemy, as well.<eos> You hadn't seen her in years?<eos> Why?<eos> Did the girl tell you differently?<eos> The girl said all kinds of things.<eos> Mistress!<eos> - The prisoner!<eos> - Where is she?<eos> Escaped!<eos> You couldn't have listened to me this one time?
- Where is she?<eos> Escaped!<eos> You couldn't have listened to me this one time?<eos> I will find her!<eos> Your incompetence has cost me enough.<eos> I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me.<eos> Who is "they"?<eos> Her!<eos> - Where is the girl?<eos> - Ma'am? - Tell her what you did.
- Where is the girl?<eos> - Ma'am? - Tell her what you did.<eos> - What I did?<eos> I walked in on her helping the prisoner!<eos> They ran at me and slammed the grate on me!<eos> Is this true?<eos> Ma'am, I've been preparing your tea all morning, just like you asked.<eos> Liar!<eos> She's lying!<eos> Did you... Help the girl out of spite?
Something so powerful... That it can kill the beast forever.<eos> And then we'll really have something to celebrate.<eos> And from the belly of the beast came the serpent.<eos> From the deepest, coldest, darkest part of the... run!<eos> Why do you hunt me?<eos> Why do you hunt me?<eos> - Nimbo!<eos> - Why? - I can't...<eos> - Tell me!<eos> There was a wagon you drove, all right?

You really want to be a hero?<eos> Well, you're gonna have to try a little bit harder than that.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Leave him alone this instant!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I command you!<eos> Ooh, she commands me.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please.<eos> You're going to kill him!

I've seen enough!<eos> Roan.<eos> Release him!<eos> No.<eos> Your men were right about me.<eos> I killed them.<eos> All of them.<eos> - Mistress.<eos> - Not now!<eos> You said tomorrow.

Previously, on "Emerald City"...<eos> I haven't seen our eastern sister in years.<eos> If secrets were kept, they were kept from me too.<eos> What kind of magic is this?<eos> Magic strong enough to kill a witch.<eos> What is it?<eos> A bullet more powerful than magic.<eos> Sylvie, did you do this?

We... yes.<eos> We can generate enough wind to create clean, efficient energy.<eos> - Morning, Frank.<eos> - Morning, Dr. Chapman.<eos> Will you call me Karen, for goodness sake?<eos> You've busted your butt all these years to earn that title.<eos> I'm gonna continue to address you like that.<eos> - Here you go. - Oh.<eos> Well, aren't you the gentlemen.<eos> You never help me with my lab coat.

- Karen? - Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah, well you do so much around here,<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Jane?<eos> Okay, let's fire her up.<eos> Let's put some energy on the grid, shall we?<eos> - Frank?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Are you taking notes?
Jane?<eos> Bring it down.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> It's not working.<eos> I'm locked out.<eos> Heat shield's gonna melt.<eos> - I'm shutting it down manually.<eos> - No!<eos> - No, Roberto! - Just monitor me there.<eos> Roberto, you can't...
Override's not working.<eos> Roberto?<eos> Roberto!<eos> We've got to get him out of here.<eos> Answer me.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I've known you since the day you were born.<eos> Here. In Oz.<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> You've been trying to kill me since I got here.

I would never hurt you.<eos> You've been trying to kill me since I got here.<eos> Yes, but how could I know it was you?<eos> That you were no threat?<eos> And what makes you think I'm not?<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> To kill me? To take me back home?<eos> Your mother wouldn't approve.<eos> I loved your mother very much.<eos> - You loved her?

I've told you.<eos> The memory of it is lost to me.<eos> And you think torture will see it returned?<eos> I believe this is what I deserve.<eos> I, too, did terrible things when I was a young man.<eos> A different man.<eos> But I wasn't tortured for my sins.<eos> I was rewarded for them.<eos> My punishment... my punishment is that I remember.<eos> As will you.

Anna just confirmed it.<eos> His memory's intact. But it is protected by magic.<eos> You want to earn my trust?<eos> You need to let me see him.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I need you to lie to The Wizard.

The girl you call Dorothy, the girl we've been searching for, the first true sign of The Beast Forever, is in your custody and you won't let us read her?<eos> No woman in the High Council is to touch her.<eos> But we're running out of time.<eos> - The two moons grow closer and...<eos> - Dorothy is not the problem.<eos> The soldier with the magic upon his head is a problem.<eos> Ev not building our weapons is a problem.<eos> You want to be of service to me, then you'll solve one of my real problems.<eos> I was hoping that we'd have a moment alone.<eos> I want you to take over for Elizabeth as head of the High Council.

But he's not.<eos> He's protected by magic.<eos> And the Wizard hates magic.<eos> Can you break it?<eos> I'll obliterate it.<eos> But it won't be pleasant.<eos> Hey, hold on.<eos> I can talk to the Wizard.<eos> I can stop this.<eos> No, I don't want you to.

If this is what you want.<eos> Let's see what lowly witch has cast a spell on you.<eos> That's Glinda's magic!<eos> What secrets is she hiding behind those pretty eyes of yours?<eos> Come along now.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Jack?<eos> Jack, it's me.<eos> It's Tip.<eos> - You're alive.

But you didn't.<eos> I can fix everything now.<eos> Please let me... No, we can't be fixed.<eos> I can't be fixed.<eos> Jack, don't go.<eos> I love you!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what to say or how to say it right.<eos> All I know is, is you're my best friend.
Jack, don't go.<eos> I love you!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what to say or how to say it right.<eos> All I know is, is you're my best friend.<eos> I was your only friend!<eos> Who's this, Jack?<eos> It's no one.<eos> Are you a no one, girl?

Have you seen him?<eos> Father.<eos> I-I heard him barking in my dreams, but when I woke, he...<eos> The dog is dead.<eos> Father, he died when I was a child.<eos> No, no, I heard him!<eos> He's here.<eos> I heard him.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.

- Girls! Run!<eos> What's he got?<eos> Don't let him swallow it!<eos> It can't be.<eos> I need that gun.<eos> You could just take the weapon from the girl.<eos> I could've killed you, Eamonn... when I took this city from your king.<eos> But I spared your life.<eos> And gave it a new purpose.<eos> Because you are more valuable as my ally.
I saw young witches.<eos> Only she can make them.<eos> And the spell that held the secret was Glinda's.<eos> But Glinda, she watched the last of the witches get slaughtered by The Beast.<eos> What good would new ones be?<eos> Sober up, you fool!<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.<eos> What did you think Glinda would do?<eos> You imprisoned every witch who practiced magic and repressed the ones who didn't.

They've all betrayed me.<eos> I should return the High Council in pieces, her little errand boy, too.<eos> The soldier.<eos> When he surrendered, there was a child with him, a young girl.<eos> A witch.<eos> Find her.<eos> All my soldiers on the hunt.<eos> I killed men.<eos> Taking their skulls to Nimbo.<eos> You don't think me a monster?

He works for Glinda?<eos> You know me?<eos> There is a wagon in the load-out that'll take you north to Calcedon,<eos> Glinda's castle... she's ordered me to free you.<eos> There's, um... there's one of the witch girls in the city.<eos> - I have to find her.<eos> - There is no time.<eos> You must leave before The Wizard locks the gates.<eos> I'll go find her.<eos> You're on The Wizard's side of this.
We are lost.<eos> We need your help.<eos> My name is Dr. Jane Andrews.<eos> I'm the leader of this group.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Toto!<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?
I'm the leader of this group.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Toto!<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Not you.<eos> I'll bring her safely to Glinda's.<eos> If you can get past my guards.
If you can get past my guards.<eos> There's your wagon, Sylvie, but there's too many guards.<eos> You have to stay here.<eos> I'm gonna go get help.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Keep her safe, Toto.<eos> Trust you.<eos> Good boy.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> When you come back home, I'll make you a big fire.

Were my instructions not clear?<eos> He's gone.<eos> He must've wandered.<eos> I can't find him anywhere.<eos> Frank?<eos> Frank.<eos> Almost didn't recognize my own name.<eos> I need your help.<eos> And I need yours.<eos> There's still a lot that you don't know about me.
She's gonna send us home.<eos> How?<eos> She controls the weather.<eos> She can summon her own tornado.<eos> But we're going home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're going home!<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> We all are.<eos> No, you can't decide things here, not for me.
We all have to leave, that's the deal.<eos> Well, I'm not leaving.<eos> I brought us here.<eos> It was... it was a mistake.<eos> My computer malfunctioned.<eos> No.<eos> I locked you out to destroy your machine.<eos> Frank... What?<eos> She treats me like I was nothing.<eos> Like... you treat me like I'm stupid.
I can do things.<eos> I'm smart, yeah?<eos> I found this new world here.<eos> Didn't I? Me.<eos> I'm not leaving it.<eos> What?<eos> I did!<eos> I did this.<eos> Roberto, what about him?<eos> You killed him, Frank!
You killed him, Frank!<eos> His name was Roberto.<eos> Your father.<eos> He was a smart man, a kind man.<eos> He died in the accident that brought us here.<eos> I'm sorry, Dorothy.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> Look at you.<eos> The way you dress, the way you act.

What is this?<eos> All the power in Emerald City is generated from underneath us.<eos> I was brought to Oz in a vortex chamber.<eos> This one here... can send you home.<eos> Now?<eos> I just have one thing to ask of you first.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> You were born in Oz...<eos> Oz brought you back.<eos> Have you even asked yourself why?
I'll do anything.<eos> You were born in Oz...<eos> Oz brought you back.<eos> Have you even asked yourself why?<eos> Destiny.<eos> Your destiny.<eos> Just like mine a long time ago.<eos> You were brought back to Oz to save us all.<eos> I'm no savior.<eos> Then what are you?
