They only see me.<eos> A barber's chair?<eos> With my own modifications.<eos> I need to look into their eyes, you see.<eos> Mirrors to the soul.<eos> What?<eos> Lily.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'll have to bring her here?<eos> Into this awful place.
As she was.<eos> But before I bring her to this place... show me what you can do.<eos> ...and without my God I feel utterly alone.<eos> I don't even know who I am meant to be.<eos> Filthy habit.<eos> I've been trying to quit.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes, Mr. Renfield?<eos> Oh, your next appointment has been waiting.<eos> In a moment.
Filthy habit.<eos> I've been trying to quit.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes, Mr. Renfield?<eos> Oh, your next appointment has been waiting.<eos> In a moment.<eos> Look at me, Miss Ives.<eos> We will find our way through this.<eos> But today, right now, I want you to do something that you believe might make you happy.<eos> Even for a moment.
Hunting a man is no great thing.<eos> They are slow and predictable.<eos> They can be found always where their appetites lead them...<eos> To eat, to sleep, to fuck.<eos> Man is no great thing.<eos> And Mr. Chandler?<eos> Or Talbot, as you'd call him?<eos> His appetites lead him elsewhere.<eos> Where?<eos> Night.
I thought it crueler to let him live.<eos> Have you ever hated a man so much you wanted him to suffer alongside you for all your days?<eos> So you could watch it.<eos> Such was your anger from what they had done to you and your family.<eos> Yes.<eos> A woman.<eos> What happened between you and this woman?<eos> In time, we stopped wounding each other.<eos> The anger became something else, equally powerful.<eos> Love.
Why?<eos> This room.<eos> The opulence dazzles you.<eos> As it did me when I stood there...<eos> A feral animal raised on the streets, forced to my knees when I was a girl, servicing any man with two bob and a hard back to his hand.<eos> And there I would have stayed and there I would have died... but for a strange working of fate<eos> that allowed me a new life.<eos> Will you do the same?<eos> Yes.<eos> No matter the cost?
Tell them.<eos> What good does that do Simon?<eos> Clary, it's all connected.<eos> The vamps want the Cup.<eos> Why?<eos> It makes new Shadowhunters.<eos> Nobody wants Valentine forming an army loyal to himself.<eos> Plus, it controls demons.<eos> They'll propose a trade.<eos> Simon for the Cup.
It's pretty much a catch-all term.<eos> Izzy can tell you all about them.<eos> She's got a thing.<eos> We've all got our things, don't we?<eos> Okay, I can't listen to this.<eos> Simon's been kidnapped by vampires.<eos> I guess I'll just take care of it myself.<eos> Clary, you're gonna get yourself killed.<eos> Clary.<eos> Simon, too.
That's because you have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.<eos> You're hiding from yourself, not me.<eos> You have feelings, whether you like 'em or not, Alec.<eos> This is not the time or the place, Izzy.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Looks pretty smooth so far.<eos> This must be the way.<eos> Well, not that smooth.<eos> Any day now.
So what do we do?<eos> It's called police work.<eos> WOMAN: Oh, my God, is he okay? MAN:<eos> Mister?<eos> Mister?<eos> You all right?<eos> Get over here.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> So, your uncle died.<eos> Uncle...
It'ssobeautiful.<eos> Ken, I can't really talk right now.<eos> I'msorry.<eos> I'msosorry.<eos> Themessof ourlives.<eos> It's all me, and I can't clean it up.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I'm just so...<eos> I did love you.<eos> And Emma, our sweet girl.
How'd you know?<eos> Great minds.<eos> But that you don't satisfy me in bed because you have a very small penis.<eos> Wait, that's your cover?<eos> It worked, okay?<eos> I don't think he trusts you, -but he doesn't want to kill you or me...<eos> -(COUGHING) ...so I'm sorry.<eos> Can we get the check?<eos> Waiter?<eos> Napkin. SAM:
One of your customers collapsed on the street yesterday afternoon.<eos> Possibly this stomach bug.<eos> Sadly, she died in the night.<eos> You're not laying that at our door, I hope.<eos> But when going through her effects, she had a substantial amount of Green Shield Stamps in her bag.<eos> They're proving very popular.<eos> I'm no expert, but she seemed to have many more stamps than her purchases seemed to warrant.<eos> All done, Dad.<eos> Where do you want them?<eos> Out back, please.
Morse, a word.<eos> Good news, Mr Mukamba. Um...<eos> Richardsons don't want to take the matter any further... this time.<eos> What swung it?<eos> The sea view?<eos> I got most of it in the other day.<eos> Thanks for the help.<eos> Do you fancy a drink?<eos> Can't tonight.<eos> Next time though.
A problem with the "manufacturing process".<eos> I've been after Leo Richardson all afternoon.<eos> He's keeping tight-lipped.<eos> - Is he?<eos> - What's the real story?<eos> I've been looking into the company. It was founded in 1843.<eos> They even had a refreshment stand at the Great Exhibition.<eos> - Maddox and Richardson?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Why? Oh, nothing.
- The dogs are no use now.<eos> So, which way?<eos> We'll go this way.<eos> - Down there.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Lads, up there.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Do you think we'll find her?<eos> - We'll find her.<eos> Alive?
The poisoning, the broken glass and Verity Richardson's kidnap.<eos> The kidnapper had a Norfolk accent and Hallward's family were from Norfolk.<eos> - Rather elaborate.<eos> - Not if we were meant to take it at face value, sir.<eos> Ingenious, really.<eos> A sort of homemade time bomb.<eos> With the door locked, Hallward didn't stand a cat in hell's chance.<eos> - If it works.<eos> - It'll work.<eos> Any second... now.
Well, the sign says "All are welcome".<eos> All are welcome.<eos> To worship.<eos> It's not my first time in a meeting house, Mrs Maddox.<eos> I know what is and isn't welcome.<eos> I was raised in Quakerism.<eos> So far as my father would allow.<eos> I wanted to ask you a few questions about the Richardsons.<eos> A happy family, would you say?<eos> No more or less than any other.
You exploited a vulnerable young girl.<eos> - If I had my way, you'd answer for it.<eos> - Sir!<eos> Sir! She was ill-used!<eos> We were going to found an orphanage in Africa.<eos> Use the money for something good.<eos> So One-eye'd Jakes will no longer be a lone ranger.<eos> He's reached his High Noon and found his Darling Clementine.<eos> So the way I look at it, we're not so much losing a Detective Sergeant as gaining a cowboy.<eos> - The happy couple.

As is murder.<eos> As is making an FBI agent mysteriously disappear, creating lots of extra work for everyone in that agent's office.<eos> Okay, I made that last part up.<eos> What were you doing in here?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Not much.<eos> Just heard you muttering.<eos> Thessalian, right?<eos> You know ancient Greek dialects?<eos> A few.
How you are alive, sitting here, is a miracle to me.<eos> You're lucky that your government intervened ... that Interpol was brought in at all.<eos> For something as serious at this?<eos> Three highly decorated members of the Russian government, murdered in cold blood, on Russian soil, by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<eos> In another time, we would have found you three feet below the ice ...<eos> if we found you at all.<eos> You must have something to say for yourself.<eos> I'd like a cheeseburger, medium, with cheddar cheese, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, and tomato.<eos> And some curly fries.<eos> Crispy.
- Here they are!<eos> Stand still! - Hands up!<eos> Well, that's one way to infiltrate the premises.<eos> Please, don't shoot.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> We are so sorry.<eos> We were just looking for the main road.<eos> Out for a spot of mushroom picking.<eos> Y-Y-You see?<eos> Mush-rooms?
- He was just doing his job.<eos> - So was Stalin.<eos> _<eos> What'd he say?<eos> Where'd you get the hardware?<eos> We ran into some company.<eos> Left them tied up in the forest.<eos> - Um, are those mushrooms?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> For soup.
- You're with me.<eos> Remember our mission protocol.<eos> Low profile, in and out, no one gets caught.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going to ask you some very basic questions - to establish a baseline.<eos> - Of course.<eos> State your full name for the record.<eos> Amadeus Ravenclaw Hunter.<eos> - How long were you married?<eos> - Which time?
- Yuri Krupin.<eos> He's the Russian Prime Minister's personal attaché.<eos> What are the chances he just tripped and fell and wrapped himself in a nice, comfy tarp?<eos> We need to get this to Coulson and Simmons.<eos> - You're killing me, Mack.<eos> - Look, I'm not siding with Hunter.<eos> I'm just saying,<eos> I don't remember you two taking a little vacation.<eos> - What?<eos> Not even a honeymoon?
Was this Jamie's?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> He wasn't religious.<eos> So do you know why he stayed with the Reverend Haleford over Christmas?<eos> Church just down the road from you.<eos> Oh... We... We thought he was at the fairground.<eos> - Oh, I thought you kept in touch.<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> It's just, you know, the church is, what... half a mile from your home and he didn't even call in to see you?<eos> Not even for Christmas dinner?
- About ten... eleven.<eos> He arrived in this old car and went wandering into the woods.<eos> - Was he on his own?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No.<eos> We shouted out, but... he just ignored us.<eos> - Bit of a weirdo, to be honest.<eos> - Definitely Sunday night?<eos> Not Monday?

Sorry.<eos> So let's go back to Brendan.<eos> Here's what I think happened.<eos> 12th April last year, Brendan storms out of his home and lo and behold, he turns up at the funfair and your paths crossed.<eos> No.<eos> And on that same evening, 12th April, you were admitted to Newcastle AE with a broken arm.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> - How did you break your arm?<eos> - I fell over at the fairground.<eos> Oh. Only, funnily enough, round about the same time,
Mr Pevensey!<eos> I'm sorry, love.<eos> When Harris broke his arm last April, how did he get to hospital?<eos> - Hang on.<eos> Why?<eos> - Did you drive him, love?<eos> - No.<eos> - Then who did?<eos> He knocked on our door, said he'd had an accident, so Morven drove him in.<eos> And Tuesday morning...
He was coming to catch me.<eos> Come on, grandpa, you can do it.<eos> Yes" yes" goal.<eos> Oh no!<eos> Come on, Ronnie. Once again.<eos> No, grandpa.<eos> You don't know how to play.<eos> Can I go play on the ground?<eos> No, play here.<eos> Not on the ground.
Don't stay up too late.<eos> Merry Christmas, John.<eos> She turned 16, an hour ago.<eos> She was born on this day"<eos> Christmas eve.<eos> That's why we named her Angela.<eos> Angel..<eos> Angela.<eos> I will pray for her..<eos> and for you too.
You may have stopped wearing the uniform, but" ..you still sound like a policeman.<eos> Whom are you trying to deceive ? Your God ..or your own self..<eos> Father Martin"?<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you get proof of life?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I want to talk to Ronnie.<eos> You will get your chance.<eos> But right now, collect your parcel from the entrance.<eos> Parcel?
I don't know.<eos> Did you ever feel that your father could do..<eos> He loved Ronnie a lot.<eos> I just can't believe this.<eos> Why will he do such a thing?<eos> Honestly, I've seen stranger cases than this in my career.<eos> But are you sure he's the one?<eos> Because I just don't get it.<eos> Although..since I got here, everyone pointed out.. ..that he's been missing from the moment you came here.<eos> Just a minute.
Sarita.<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> You stay there.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> Sarita.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We haven't found Ronnie yet..<eos> We're making a mistake.<eos> What mistake?
In that situation, you would've found.. ..many fingerprints on the phone.. ..and you would've wasted precious time in finding a single match.<eos> And yet you wouldn't have found your suspect.<eos> When we caught him, he was trying to.. ..throw the bag of money on the other side of the wall.<eos> Why?<eos> After taking such a big risk to get this money" ..why would he would throw the bag on the other side? He would only do it if..<eos> Your theory about the partner might be right.<eos> But his story about locking him up and threatening him..is bullshit.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> He repeated his 8 years old plan again.<eos> And this time..to perfection.
And that is me.<eos> So you fled with the money.<eos> But you weren't sure whether she's dead or not.<eos> That's why you erased all the evidence.<eos> You just removed.. all evidence.<eos> It was clever of you to borrow Kumar's black van.<eos> The van couldn't have led anyone directly to you.. "because many people would hire it.<eos> But.. ..one day" ..you ran out of luck<eos> Your trunk was found.<eos> Then the pen.

Look, man, I've had Michael, Tito, LaToya, Marlon, and Janet since they were eight weeks old.<eos> They're not licensed.<eos> I don't know what that even--<eos> Lisa and Lisa, what is going on?<eos> There's feces everywhere, Kevin.<eos> - So?<eos> - One of them is foaming at the mouth.<eos> They could bite our kids.<eos> Give them rabies.<eos> Kids?
How dare you blaspheme the name of Bianca.<eos> How dare you!<eos> Good, God, Fiona.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Good morning.<eos> "Good morning to you too, Fiona."<eos> Friend Nick is still here, huh?<eos> Yup.<eos> How long you planning on staying, Nick?<eos> A while.
Mr. Sean, can I have Sunday off for my daughter's baptism?<eos> Ask Fiona.<eos> She does the schedule now.<eos> In fact, that goes for everyone.<eos> Fiona's setting the schedule around here from now on.<eos> Yes, Melinda.<eos> That is exactly what it looks like when I'm doing it.<eos> Yo.<eos> Listen, I'm- - I'm sorry about the, uh...<eos> What?
You looked at me the way Bianca did.<eos> Bianca had cancer.<eos> That's the only reason she looked at you that way.<eos> Didn't you ever ask yourself why someone with her success, beauty, and education would be interested in you?<eos> All the time.<eos> Face it.<eos> You and Bianca were together because of cancer.<eos> Not just any cancer.<eos> Stage four.<eos> Terminal cancer.
It's what they say.<eos> Well, that's a drag.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, fuck me.<eos> Breast.<eos> Curable.<eos> Colon.<eos> Curable-ish.<eos> Testicular.<eos> No dudes, no dudes.
So now I got to add this to my list of crap to worry about?<eos> No, listen, you don't have to worry about this at all.<eos> Of course I have to worry.<eos> No, this is my thing.<eos> I've got it handled.<eos> Handled?<eos> You found a bag of smack, and you shot up.<eos> - That's handled?<eos> - Do you know how many bags of smack I've found that I didn't shoot up?<eos> Then why this time?

- To you?<eos> Why does everything always have to be about you?<eos> Because I'm finally almost free from raising you kids, and I don't intend to do it again.<eos> - Nobody's asking you to.<eos> - Of course you are!<eos> There's absolutely no way in hell that you're going to be able to raise a baby, and I am going to get stuck doing it!<eos> Oh, don't worry, I would never let you near my baby.<eos> I don't want you fucking it up like you fucked us up!<eos> - I'm going to Florida.<eos> - Florida?
Gotta treat witnesses like mushrooms.<eos> Feed 'em shit, and keep 'em in the dark.<eos> That scum's on a need to know.<eos> So fill us in.<eos> Who's bankrolling this guy?<eos> Who does he work for?<eos> The DA's office says the shooter's independent.<eos> Vigilante type, targeting different crime families.<eos> And not in a... a Daredevil way.<eos> In a Death Wish way.
- Five minutes.<eos> Sending in Grote in five.<eos> This is the frigging wire you want me to wear?<eos> Why don't I just carry a video camera with me and a guy with a boom mic?<eos> Relax, Grotto, you'll be fine.<eos> Look, either you are the luckiest man in Hell's Kitchen, or someone up there thinks you're worth saving.<eos> - I really hope that's true.<eos> - We're all set on our end.<eos> Well, good for you, lady.<eos> Me?
What's that?<eos> I'm having it removed.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> I liked it.<eos> Hmm, time to move on.<eos> From what?<eos> From the me that needed a tattoo.<eos> I don't have much time.<eos> When do you have to be at the Capitol?<eos> Less than an hour.
We're not going to get anywhere if you're not willing to negotiate.<eos> Well... then I believe we're finished.<eos> And I believe you're right.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> Put Milkin in a secure location.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> Mr. Milkin.<eos> I need you to come with me.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> A detainment facility.
No doubt she stole them from someone.<eos> The Underwoods never cease to amaze.<eos> Mother...<eos> I'm going to need some money.<eos> For the clinic?<eos> Isn't...<eos> A million five for LeAnn and some on top of that.<eos> Well, I thought your campaign was dead.<eos> It is, but I still need her to work for me.<eos> But, what for?

You know, it's on a morning like this, in a church like yours, that I'm very proud to be a South Carolinian.<eos> "How many of you drove to church?<eos> Let me start by asking, how many of you drove to church here this morning?"<eos> How many of you drove to get to church here this morning?<eos> And how many of you drove together?<eos> Well, I can appreciate that.<eos> Gas prices right now are putting a strain on everybody's pocketbooks.<eos> Isn't that true?<eos> I think maybe more here in Gaffney, at least I feel it here in Gaffney more than anywhere else.<eos> "Especially here in Gaffney.
Sir?<eos> Listen, I am not gonna negotiate a bailout if he won't budge on privatization.<eos> If he wants to let his own people starve, so be it.<eos> He may look for relief from Beijing, and that would...<eos> The only thing he hates more than us is China.<eos> He won't kowtow.<eos> But if Petrov does cave to them, that puts the global energy...<eos> Look, Cathy, I have to call you back.<eos> - When?<eos> - About 30 minutes ago.
Don't let it out of your sight.<eos> As far as I know, there's only one photograph.<eos> Meechum says it's still at the bank.<eos> Sir, it's just me.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Well, you keep an eye on him.<eos> I want emails and phone records of everyone in the White House.<eos> Including yours.<eos> Mine?
And so will I, with or without you.<eos> So no, I will not have this conversation.<eos> I will not indulge you any further.<eos> You have to let this go.<eos> I can be a part of your campaign, or I can end it.<eos> I'll do whatever it takes, too.<eos> Just like your father.<eos> But I will not let this go.<eos> I'll need a car to the Greenville Airport.<eos> To Dallas, yes.
Please, have a seat, LeAnn.<eos> I'm delighted you've agreed to come on board.<eos> It's my understanding there is a condition attached.<eos> Well, yes.<eos> And she understands that condition?<eos> You've spoken with her?<eos> Oh, my apologies, sir.<eos> I wasn't clear.<eos> I meant our condition, not yours.<eos> On Super Tuesday.
Hey, Flanders. Gas up your leaf blower much?<eos> Chickens?<eos> Since when do you have chickens?<eos> Oh, about six months.
The rest'll be coming now, so stay alert.<eos> You ever use one of these before?<eos> - An assault rifle?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> Obviously, you have.<eos> Talk me through it.<eos> If it moves, shoot it.<eos> And try not to shoot yourself.<eos> Or me.
If it moves, shoot it.<eos> And try not to shoot yourself.<eos> Or me.<eos> I'll clear the entryway.<eos> You follow.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Hey, stay... step away from the door.<eos> How many shooters did you see upstairs?<eos> Just the one.
I know you can't miss a workout.<eos> Let me see the list.<eos> - Oh, gotcha! Gotcha. - Oh!<eos> You can't leave now. You're skipping class.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> Look, it's not even snowing.<eos> Was that a possibility?<eos> Have a good day. I love you.<eos> $585.<eos> For two black cotton T-shirts?
- Oh, señor, no...<eos> Yay.<eos> It really is my b-day, and your present is to spend the rest of today with me.<eos> I needed that job, Lissa.<eos> Well, I know a place always looking to hire cute boys.<eos> I went as my favorite author.<eos> Matty went in his favorite hoodie, but who cared if he didn't wear a costume?<eos> We were together, so this Hallow's Eve felt like heaven.<eos> - Joan Didion!<eos> - Yes!
You don't need to.<eos> And even though we always seem to find a way to mess things up when we're together...<eos> I love you.<eos> No, Matty!<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> And more than anything in the world, Jenna, what I want is to tell you to choose me over him...<eos> But I'm not gonna do that because the one thing that I want more than that is for you to choose yourself.<eos> Okay, not... not me.<eos> Not him.<eos> You.
Well, you know me.<eos> I seize opportunity.<eos> This state-of-the-art prosthetic contains some hardware manufactured by you here at Transia ... the nerve-wire interface, to be precise.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm aware your company's been working on an exoskeletal limb-assist prototype for the Defense Department using this same technology.<eos> So...<eos> I'd like to buy it.<eos> Buy one of our leading patents.<eos> No, no.<eos> The company.
I'll give you anything!<eos> I did! I'm too young to die!<eos> God! Oh, no!<eos> I know you've had people killed.<eos> You've even considered shooting someone.<eos> But to drain a man's life with your own hand, to feel the life go out inside him... as Mr. Coulson did with me.<eos> That look in his eyes.<eos> A feeling so powerful, it scared him... enough to leave that hand behind.<eos> But you don't fear anything, do you?<eos> Reset.

Jordan.<eos> How did you...<eos> I got the key from your mom. I wanted to surprise you.<eos> I thought the magazine was going to print tomorrow.<eos> It is but the cops wanna talk to you and that trumps work for me.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm better now that you're here.<eos> Champagne?<eos> What are we celebrating?<eos> Us.
What if the Khan wins the Kurultai?<eos> Back to the original plan?<eos> Killing him once seemed fulfilling.<eos> A blade.<eos> Poisoned dart.<eos> Did you know Mongol burial dictates that the deceased be left in the open air, torn apart and churned in the stomachs of wild animals and then turned into shit on the steppe?<eos> There's something attractive about that.<eos> But it's too simple, just killing him.<eos> Better to take everything from him first.<eos> His Empress.

And it's all due to you.<eos> So thank you, Master Polo.<eos> When I returned from Xiangyang, I looked for you.<eos> I came for you.<eos> And thankfully, I was already gone.<eos> Enjoy your lunch with the Khan.<eos> - I don't wish to be a pessimist...<eos> - But...<eos> Somewhere within these walls, a young boy's being dressed for the day ahead.<eos> A young boy.
Still don't drink?<eos> As Genghis said,<eos> "Find me a man that doesn't drink, and that man will lead my armies."<eos> Are you following Genghis or running from your father?<eos> Would it help you if I told you this wasn't wine but the blood of Christ?<eos> All the more reason for me to respectfully abstain.<eos> It is difficult for the faithless to understand the faithful.<eos> I have faith, Nayan.<eos> In the sun, in the sky, in the animals I roast.<eos> My children.
"We"?<eos> Much has changed.<eos> Has the Khan spoken of me?<eos> He might have preferred you'd lost that wrestling match with Khutulun.<eos> Do you?<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> Yours.<eos> -I didn't think bloodshed your aim.<eos> -It is not.<eos> Or civil war.
May I ask how you knew my husband?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I am Bolormaa.<eos> I am Nergüi.<eos> Do you work in the stables?<eos> No.<eos> But I pass them frequently.<eos> I didn't know your husband well... but you could tell he was kind.<eos> By his eyes.<eos> Even on the darkest of days.
My father?<eos> He's the most powerful man on earth.<eos> Tell me about your mother.<eos> What do you remember of her?<eos> Everything.<eos> The lines on her face as she smiled.<eos> Her oils.<eos> Lavender.<eos> The cool of her hand as she stroked my cheek when I slept.<eos> And... the lull of her voice.
-A lesson on how to conquer the world.<eos> A lesson in the power of Mongol unity.<eos> Is there any difference?<eos> A fundamental difference.<eos> Between stability and chaos.<eos> Expansion is chaos?<eos> It was Genghis and your very own Ögödei who dreamt of the taking of China.<eos> I only succeeded where they failed.<eos> They did not foresee the peril to our nomadic way of life.<eos> What peril?
Kendra isn't a lab experiment.<eos> She's a person.<eos> I know.<eos> You need to have confidence this will work.<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> I can't save her.<eos> Based on what evidence?<eos> Are we not empirical thinkers, Dr. Palmer?<eos> Exactly how many people have you lost?<eos> One.
Let's try this again.<eos> Back for more.<eos> Where's Savage's fortune?<eos> Now, I'm particularly interested in this thing called the "vessel".<eos> The vessel is my master's most treasured possession.<eos> Excellent, and where can we find it?<eos> The Greyhill Building.<eos> There's a gathering tonight in celebration of it.<eos> And clearly you want us to go so we can get ourselves killed.<eos> - Clearly.
He was, quite frankly, he only student in all my years of teaching who ever made me feel inferior.<eos> That student... was you.<eos> You were exceptional.<eos> And suddenly, just like that, you remember having me in your class.<eos> I always remembered.<eos> I just enjoyed taking you down a peg or two.<eos> And why tell me now?<eos> Because I cannot for the life of me reconcile hat cocksure student I remember with a man who believes he doesn't have what it takes o save Ms. Saunders' life.<eos> Who did you lose, Raymond?<eos> My fiancée, Anna Loring.
I followed you across an ocean and across a continent.<eos> I will follow you to Hell.<eos> I'll lead the way...<eos> Wolf of God.<eos> You sit there with your gramophone and your questions... judging me, refusing to believe me when I say...<eos> I know you!<eos> You have been my friend.<eos> - My ancestor, you mean.<eos> Joan Clayton.<eos> You!
You couldn't do it.<eos> But I can.<eos> You were always myopic when it came to your discipline.<eos> We need not live on the fulcrum.<eos> We can be angel or beast fully.<eos> I can make that happen.<eos> How?<eos> Electricity has unlocked her secrets to me.<eos> By combining your work with mine... we'll create a choir of angels.<eos> One in particular.
Branded and deeply scarred.<eos> Speaking in tongues.<eos> This means something to you.<eos> She's a witch.<eos> A servant of the devil.<eos> She's with Ethan now.<eos> We must find him.<eos> We must slaughter anyone who stands in our way.<eos> If we cannot save our son, a terrible end awaits us.<eos> All of us.
Go.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> So bummed out right now.<eos> Why?<eos> What'd I do?<eos> No. It's what you didn't do.<eos> What is this?<eos> They told us to change into bikinis.<eos> Yes, but, no, no, no.<eos> Not this one.
You know what to shoot.<eos> Get a pair! Walk with purpose.<eos> I'm going with Chet!<eos> 'Course you are.<eos> Okay. Hey, Bill!<eos> It's Barry.<eos> Barry. Right.<eos> You have a kid in college.<eos> Actually, it's preschool.<eos> Whatever.
Screw their friends?<eos> Go big and go home, baby.<eos> - Rachel.<eos> - Yes?<eos> You're Rachel, right?<eos> Wow. You are totally cute, and can I just say, thank God.<eos> Everyone keeps saying how much we look alike.<eos> Yeah, that's not exactly what they're saying.<eos> - Hey, Rach.<eos> Hi. Just one second.
Oh, come on, Gary. This is totally unnecessary.<eos> Do you have any idea how much money I've made for you over the years, huh?<eos> What you've made, Chet, is a well-oiled machine that needs someone strong at the helm.<eos> Look, either you get on board, buddy, or you go home, because he is the one in charge now.<eos> All right? I leave it with you.<eos> - Hi, guys.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Look, I'm excited to get to work here.<eos> Hey. Hey. Uh, Chet.<eos> One second.
You're sleeping with a contestant.<eos> And you could get kicked off for this, by the way, young lady.<eos> Right.<eos> After you slept with the suitor all last season?<eos> You did what?<eos> What's behind your back?<eos> Should I come take a look at it?<eos> I think I should. Let me see it.<eos> Hand it to me right now.<eos> Yep, right through my eye.
Did they mention specific episodes or scenes or anything?<eos> No, nothing specific.<eos> More of a global discussion.<eos> Anyway, I'm gonna bring on a visual consultant to kind of course-correct the department.<eos> - A visual consultant. - Mm-hmm.<eos> That sounds... That sounds a lot like a new D.P.<eos> Am I getting fired?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> In the meantime, though, for a little while at least, I'm gonna have you move to the insert unit.<eos> The...
Okay?<eos> Okay, no pressure.<eos> Hey, just get me a quick shot of this, and then we're done, okay?<eos> We don't have to do anything.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Okay?<eos> - But I am going to open that.<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> Please do that.<eos> Wait. Hang on.<eos> Just in case.
Darius, please.<eos> It's gonna be too much work disappointing you every day, Ruby.<eos> I can't believe I trusted you.<eos> Jay, I did everything I could.<eos> Ladies, uh, that concludes our elimination ceremony this evening.<eos> Good night.<eos> Well, did you, uh, see everything you needed to see?<eos> Not quite.<eos> You, uh... You want to come home with me?<eos> Uh, which home?
Going to Vegas, baby!<eos> Easy there, Amy Winehouse, all right?<eos> This is for the executives we're buttering up.<eos> All right.<eos> I want to make a toast.<eos> We are thrilled that we have you under exclusive contract, and we cannot wait to see what brilliant shows that you dream up.<eos> Thank you for 13 years of slave labor to get an overall deal.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - To season 15.
I am the show runner on "Everlasting."<eos> What?<eos> Look, I already told the little skinny brother no, okay?<eos> You need to leave.<eos> I'm sorry, but he just didn't have all the information.<eos> What information is gonna make me drop out of college to go be on a racist, misogynist reality show I don't even watch?<eos> 16 million viewers a week for your political platform when your Twitter fame's about to expire like bad milk.<eos> Black girls only last a couple weeks on those shows, and they don't get any airtime.<eos> I thought you said you didn't watch.<eos> - Whatever.
- Sorry, we were just talking about the kill list, Hot Rachel.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Uh, Ya...<eos> Yazmine.<eos> Who?<eos> Yael?<eos> It's a Hebrew name.<eos> - Yeah, what about her?<eos> - Whatever.
- He does. - Ew! Ew!<eos> - Madison, you're such a little slut, seriously.<eos> - You are a slut, you have issues.<eos> Control yourself.<eos> - Wag?<eos> - Can we not talk about balls?<eos> You see "hairy balls" yet?<eos> - Demanding, man.<eos> - Here, sir.<eos> Right in the middle, okay.
But see, this season, our suitor is more well-known, more prominent than ever.<eos> And in order to get our ladies to be surprised, we had to make them wait until now.<eos> Ladies, are you ready?<eos> Ugh, it looks like "My Little Pony" threw up.<eos> Too much pink.<eos> All right, well, then, prepare yourselves because this season, this man is not only handsome, wealthy, and smart, But he is also a national hero.<eos> So I urge you, ladies, open your hearts to your suitor.<eos> All right, let's get ready to see some panties drop.<eos> What?<eos> What the... ?
You want to talk to him, you got to deal with me.<eos> - What the hell, Rachel?<eos> - What?<eos> Chet has the suitor?<eos> How did you let Darius out of your sight?<eos> You should've had a P.A. superglued to his ass.<eos> - I did...<eos> I had Madison on it.<eos> - Really?<eos> Transpo!
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the girls are gonna be like...<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> Looking super. - Chet.<eos> Chet.<eos> This right here is a man with a $50 million insurance policy on his body.<eos> He can't even play a game of pickup basketball.<eos> Pickup basketball?
Let's make America great again.<eos> Sometimes I like to emphasize my lips.<eos> It just brightens my whole face, don't you think?<eos> Have you considered working in politics?<eos> Let's try these eyelashes.<eos> Okay, no. Really.<eos> Thanks. That's enough.<eos> No, no... that's not even close to enough.<eos> Look. You want to skip the lashes?<eos> Fine, whatever.
Listen.<eos> I don't know what happened to you.<eos> You know, foster care is a nightmare.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> But this kind of thing...<eos> İt just makes you seem, well, crazy.<eos> I am not crazy.<eos> The other girls don't feel safe around you.<eos> If you could just let me out...<eos> Just for a minute.
I'm still waiting to open her up, see how fast she goes.<eos> What, do you actually want to watch Quinn turn into Naomi Campbell, because she's seriously gonna beat the crap out of me.<eos> Don't worry about Quinn.<eos> - You've outgrown her.<eos> - Note taken.<eos> Entertainment Weekly's here, by the way.<eos> Nice. All right.<eos> I'm gonna go pull some clips for them.<eos> Meet me inside in five?<eos> Three.
- Thank you.<eos> I think I should not play football in a suit.<eos> We should probably take it off.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> I won! I won!<eos> Are you okay, Darius?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Darius, are you all right?<eos> Help.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> I won! I won!<eos> Are you okay, Darius?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Darius, are you all right?<eos> Help.<eos> We'll get you some help right now, okay?<eos> Guys!<eos> Somebody...
She's basically gonna say that, um, you've been lying to your team this whole time.<eos> That'll kill my career, my sportscasting gig, all of it.<eos> I know.<eos> The media is gonna be all over this.<eos> You're gonna be a guy that hates women and lies about his injuries.<eos> Rachel, you got to make this go away.<eos> Look, I'm trying to, but I'm gonna need you on board, like, 100%.<eos> I have a doctor that will give you...<eos> He'll give you an epidural.<eos> An epidural?
- He says what?<eos> - He says it's not worth the risk.<eos> Is he the one that's risking his life every week?<eos> But he's always had my back.<eos> Always has.<eos> I'm just saying that if you finish the season, you're a bona fide star.<eos> You just have to ask yourself at the end of the day, what do you want?<eos> What do you want, D?<eos> I support a lot of people, Rachel.<eos> A lot of people.
I-I could be that guy.<eos> - No, you can't, Chet.<eos> - I can...<eos> If you could have, you would have.<eos> - I am going to be that guy.<eos> - Okay. I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna be that guy.<eos> I'd like to introduce Dr. Wagerstein's "Mirror of Truth."<eos> What, is she like trademarking?<eos> I came up with it.<eos> Whatever.
I'll talk to you later.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Jay! Jay!<eos> Come with me.<eos> I just want to talk through the process of what I've got going on here.<eos> So, these are the things I think I'll need.<eos> - Coleman, I'll be back in a minute.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, so listen. This is what I need.<eos> What the...?
Okay, I'm gonna listen to Rachel.<eos> I think she knows what she's doing.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry that I bothered you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, everyone!<eos> How you doing?<eos> I just wanted to say a few words.<eos> Hey, "B" cam, move into position near the back.<eos> mostly to Darius.
I mean, if you turn me in,<eos> I guess I'd have to turn you in, too... unless you want to work together.<eos> My editor says if I win this thing, this piece will be unstoppable, and you could help me.<eos> You can't deny there's a huge story right here.<eos> I think you need to get out of here right now.<eos> Coleman, we have to do something.<eos> This place... what they do... it'll blow your mind.<eos> I'm so bored.<eos> I want to play a game.<eos> Cricket.
All right, let's go, ladies.<eos> Up and at 'em.<eos> I want you shaved, saddled, and ready to ride because "Everlasting" is back in business.<eos> So let's go.<eos> Hip-hop.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - As cancer.<eos> There is a big date tonight with our boy in the city... drinks, dancing, the works.<eos> - Yes! Let's do this.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I need tension, competition.<eos> So, I might need to throw Chantal into play.<eos> And besides, my boyfriend really likes her.<eos> He bet 60K on her to win.<eos> "Boyfriend." What is this, eighth grade?<eos> I told you to go find Darius.<eos> Find my suitor!<eos> - Where's Darius? - Hi.<eos> Uh, we're just...<eos> Not a word about my sperm.
I mean, what the hell, Chet?<eos> You said you were handling this.<eos> I don't really know what the problem is.<eos> I mean, Darius has some great choices, too, which happen to be my girls, so I might actually win this thing my first season as a producer.<eos> So, go, Maddy, go, Maddy.<eos> It's not about you, Madison, though I understand a girl who puts her boss's penis in her mouth is definitely looking for the shortest, fastest way to get ahead, so there you go.<eos> Ladies, I have counted all of your votes, and I'm sorry to say, but, Tiffany, your journey ends here tonight.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Like hell it does.<eos> What the...
So let's get away from all these cameras and see what's there, see what we can have together for real, just you and me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Come here.<eos> Now, that is true love.<eos> True love...<eos> Who gets that?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, that's love.<eos> All right, guys, let's... Let's head outside, okay?<eos> Quinn, are you okay?<eos> Not a chance, man.
No, you had to, because you're a good person, and...<eos> I... Listen, we have to erase this.<eos> There's no erasing this, Rachel.<eos> - I need...<eos> - This isn't going anywhere.<eos> I-I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I'm not gonna, like, take down the show.<eos> - I'm not doing that to Quinn.<eos> - Rachel.<eos> No way.
- Thank you, Rachel.<eos> - Anytime.<eos> Okay, what's up with you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You were way too happy, Rachel.<eos> What is your sneaky, little ass up to?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I'm just, like, producing a TV show, Number Two.<eos> Living the dream.<eos> - To a wonderful evening.
- Anytime.<eos> Okay, what's up with you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You were way too happy, Rachel.<eos> What is your sneaky, little ass up to?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I'm just, like, producing a TV show, Number Two.<eos> Living the dream.<eos> - To a wonderful evening.<eos> - To a first date.
I'll explain on the way.<eos> We're in the dark, but right now, Ward and this thing-- They're not afraid to take what they want or kill who they want.<eos> So what's our advantage?<eos> They're not afraid.<eos> Dad, what's going on?<eos> I've seen something.<eos> There was an inhuman, and when I touched him, I saw a vision of the future.<eos> Really?<eos> What did you see?<eos> My death.
Few weeks after I got there, Jiaying caught him breaking into her private archives and banished him.<eos> What was he doing in there?<eos> Stealing, mostly.<eos> He made a big scene, ranting about the second coming of some ancient inhuman who could raise the dead.<eos> Huh. Well, something tells me he won't be jumping at the chance to help us.<eos> He was pretty bitter, not getting powers.<eos> We'll need to be careful and keep our eyes open.<eos> You're saying these organisms ate these people?<eos> Well, most of them.<eos> In a remarkably short space of time.
- Not exactly fair, is it?<eos> If we can agree to charge what they charge in Dragør, it's not a bad idea.<eos> If that's what it takes, I guess that's how it'll have to be.<eos> We should get moving.<eos> He's running a temperature.<eos> We need to find a doctor.<eos> There...<eos> And again.<eos> Good.<eos> One more time.
I made you a round for the coach.<eos> Cheese and pickle.<eos> Come here, then.<eos> Cheer-oh, Fatty.<eos> Jump to it.<eos> Don't cheek the RSM or you'll find yourself in the Glasshouse quicker than you can say knife.<eos> I won't.<eos> - And see you write your mother.<eos> I mean it.<eos> A letter a week at least.
Nervous.<eos> Shy.<eos> Er... Hopeful.<eos> Yes, I suppose I was.<eos> All of those things.<eos> Frightened, mostly, that's my abiding memory.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of being found out.<eos> Found wanting.<eos> Not for a moment.
Anonymous tip-off, sir.<eos> There's a raid taking place at the Wessex Bank on Cross Street.<eos> He's had his 20 minutes.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Madam?<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> All units from Information Room.<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> One moment.
Is there anyone who can tell me if she was here or not?<eos> Uh... Mr Bryden, I suppose.<eos> 5C.<eos> I suppose you want me to show you.<eos> If it isn't too much trouble.<eos> I've had these run off from her passport.<eos> When did she go missing?<eos> Not too sure, sir.<eos> Dr Lorenz last saw her heading off to night school.<eos> What night school?
Sex case.<eos> Attacked on the way home from work, half-strangled, head injuries, been in a coma since.<eos> You think there's a connection?<eos> Her route home from work would've taken her past Applehurst Road Night School, this au pair's last known destination.<eos> Unsolved, presumably.<eos> Sandra was in my Joan's year at school.<eos> Everything to her parents.<eos> Awful thing, to lose a daughter.<eos> Or as good as.<eos> Any child.
I sometimes get one or two maybe doze off and miss the bell, but not Monday night.<eos> So what did the policeman want?<eos> Someone I know slightly, she's gone missing.<eos> Oh, someone you know slightly.<eos> All the lingo, now, eh?<eos> Proper English gentleman.<eos> Don't get ideas, boy.<eos> I see how you look at her.<eos> You know bloody well who.<eos> Whom.
I know what I heard.<eos> There was someone else out there in the woods.<eos> Come on.<eos> First you'd never seen her.<eos> Then when we find out she was in your car, you admit you'd given her a lift.<eos> You told us you dropped her off and drove home.<eos> Now you tell us you got out of the car and looked for her, with a shovel.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> You went after her with your shovel as you didn't plan on making the same mistake you made with Sandra Jordan.<eos> What mistake?
I should have seen it coming.<eos> He's not been right since Blenheim Vale.<eos> Hodges has put his hands up to it.<eos> And admits attacking Sandra Jordan.<eos> What about Ingrid?<eos> The FME is getting him patched up now.<eos> Why?<eos> He was laughing at us.<eos> I've had 30 years of bastards like that grinning and getting away with it.<eos> Well, not this time.
No.<eos> It was when I followed him to Goggins.<eos> Something snapped when I saw that the tiger was still alive.<eos> You broke into the lab, took the tigress musk.<eos> Doused Lorenz's handkerchief with it.<eos> I thought the next time he went to Goggins' place... ..that Brutus would attack him.<eos> But the tiger broke free.<eos> There was no way you could control it.<eos> I just wanted him to see what it was like.<eos> Just for a moment.
Hell is other people.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> It's a quote from a play that I-I read in prison called "No Exit."<eos> Dan, you weren't into escapist fare, were you?<eos> The three characters in the play were in hell.<eos> Forced to be together, just be together, in a room for eternity.<eos> And that was their hell.<eos> Well...<eos> Like I said last night, Dan, you don't have to be here.<eos> Certainly not for eternity.
Previouslyon "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> It was snatched up by this ancient.<eos> They called him Alveus.<eos> Designed by the Kree to command the Inhuman army for them.<eos> Well, this priceless artifact is yours.<eos> Just give me the damn crystal.<eos> I saw a vision of the future.<eos> - What did you see?<eos> - My death.
They wouldn't have a choice.<eos> It's like an infection.<eos> _<eos> I swear that's what I'm doing, Yo-Yo.<eos> - We saved your asses, and you come at us?<eos> - Lincoln.<eos> - Why didn't you tell us?<eos> - Daisy, stand down.<eos> First, we get everyone in quarantine, and then we can talk.<eos> Not everyone.
Hanna, the police didn't ask us to stick around to exfoliate.<eos> There are gonna be questions.<eos> Aria doesn't know where Ezra went after she left him.<eos> Yeah, but she knows that he was in a dark place.<eos> Just 'cause you're depressed doesn't mean you pick up a weapon.<eos> Okay, you guys, my mom gave us these passes as a gift.<eos> We're here to chill, not spill.<eos> It's just so twisted.<eos> She hasn't even spoken to Fitz in, like, five years and now if he did this for her they're gonna be bound together forever.<eos> Not because of the tape.
And we're readin' an unfinished novel by somebody who may have killed...<eos> Emily, don't.<eos> He said he went home.<eos> Okay, well, tell me why Sara Harvey won't... go home?<eos> Everywhere I go, she's been shadowing me like some dark cloud.<eos> I'm afraid that she might know something.<eos> I mean, was she sitting in that lobby that night?<eos> Wait.<eos> Can't Hanna's mom just kick her out of the hotel?<eos> For what?
He's not bent on making Ali's friends look like...<eos> Friends?<eos> Have you heard from Ali since that dinner?<eos> Have you?<eos> Alison is not looking to make any more friendship bracelets.<eos> I thought you said Lucas was gonna help.<eos> You're worried he won't come through?<eos> I'm worried about everything, Emily.<eos> My mom losing her job, my boss firing me because I didn't send the right laxative to Tokyo.<eos> Everything!
Just a walk down the hall to the ice machine.<eos> Was it down the hall?<eos> 'Cause according to my records, Radley doesn't have an ice closet on the third floor.<eos> Melissa, what's wrong?<eos> I am an idiot.<eos> I totally botched things with that reporter from Hollis.<eos> With Damian?<eos> You talked to him?<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it talking.<eos> More like nervous blurting.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I don't know about the others but I know you feel guilty, Emily.<eos> Guilty?<eos> I have nothing to feel guilty about.<eos> Should I take these gloves off?<eos> Sara, I couldn't have done anything, okay?<eos> None of us could.<eos> It all happened so quick...<eos> Who are you trying to convince?<eos> Me or you?
Finish the formula, and these little games of ours can stop.<eos> You'll never trick me into giving up my research.<eos> And since you also cannot kill me and destroy any hope of creating a Soviet Firestorm, I would like a hot shower and a change of clothes.<eos> And I thought I gave a good speech.<eos> I'm sorry. Have we met?<eos> 11 years ago, you bought a nuclear warhead off me in Norway.<eos> And then you and your time-traveling friends tried to kill me.<eos> Just like me, you haven't aged a day.<eos> I have a good hairdresser.<eos> In my long life,
Stop stalling.<eos> It's a shame I-I never got to see it before the collapse.<eos> What sort of nonsense are you talking about?<eos> In 1991, your economy fails, and your empire crumbles.<eos> But the truth is the world is better off.<eos> In my time, crooks and thieves rule your country, desperate to hang on to power and the riches they divide amongst their cronies.<eos> My country is by no means perfect, but at least we are free to criticize our government, vote in fair elections, and love whom we choose.<eos> I, uh, hate to break this to you, Dr. Vostok.<eos> You are on the wrong side of history.<eos> For now.
We haven't had one since Ms. Jansen got sick It's been almost a year.<eos> Things are workin' just fine as is.<eos> I'm doing the work of a Supervisor.<eos> Well. That's NASA, for ya.<eos> Fast with rocket ships. Slow with advancement.<eos> Get those trajectories calcs worked out.<eos> We need 'em for the Redstone test.<eos> Mach 1 tunnel test, T-1 minute.<eos> No shoe is worth your life<eos> One.. One moment!
Absolutely.<eos> And she speaks.<eos> Yes, sir. I do.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Both.<eos> Geometry and speaking.<eos> Ruth. Give me that.<eos> Do you think you..<eos> You think you can find me the Frenet frame for this data, Using the GramSchmidt...<eos> With Orthogonalization algorithm.
We just wanted to say goodnight.<eos> You've been gone for 300 hours.<eos> I work a full-time job now. You all know that.<eos> I have to be mommy and daddy.<eos> I miss your father just as much as anyone<eos> He's with his angels.<eos> Yes.<eos> He's with all his angels.<eos> And he's watching over us.<eos> Every minute. OK?
But..<eos> I'm going to do what I can help those brave men get there. Yes, I'm.<eos> You could fly up to space if you wanted to, Mamma.<eos> You can be an astronaut.<eos> - Did you draw this?<eos> - Yes, mamma.<eos> Is that me?<eos> You see this?<eos> Oh, my goodness, I love you, baby.<eos> - Me too
You know what I think is a good idea?<eos> Darker ink.<eos> I think darker ink is a good idea.<eos> Ruth, could pass it along?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank you, Katherine<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> This interrogation is over<eos> You can probably get to the moon and back with this.<eos> Just not the bathroom.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Get the Cape on the line.<eos> Shepard's trajectories need to be updated.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> Everywhere I look you're not where I need you to be.<eos> And it's not my imagination.<eos> So where the hell do you go everyday?<eos> To the bathroom, sir.<eos> The bathroom
I'm not paying any of you!<eos> - Me?<eos> - Temporarily.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need the IBM for Glenn's launch.<eos> The Lead Engineer says you're good with the cards, programming and such.<eos> What about the girls here?<eos> Human computers can't calculate an orbital flight in the time we have.<eos> - They'll stay put for now.<eos> - What about after "now"?
You have until midday to dismantle it.<eos> But if I try to remove any of the individual pieces, the mechanism I designed will deadlock the door.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> If you try to blow it open with gunpowder, you'll bring down the roof.<eos> Drilling at it might take a week.<eos> Open the vault, or she dies.<eos> Slowly.<eos> I will have to make a new key.<eos> How long?<eos> Some time.
- Call Becca.<eos> - Calling Becca.<eos> Becca!<eos> - That's not funny!<eos> - Really?<eos> What about this?<eos> - Is that funny?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Why?
The badass that shot Piper Shaw in the head?<eos> Technically, not the one who shot her in the head.<eos> We both go to George Washington, but you don't know me.<eos> Can I get a pic?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - It's lame, I know.<eos> It's just...<eos> You really impress me, dude, and I hate everyone.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Sure.
You only get that mad when you know that I'm right.<eos> Shut up and walk me through the murderboard.<eos> And we're back.<eos> That text at school today was your most recent contact, right?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Okay, here's that text. _<eos> And, over here, I've included the comments of the third prankster from my podcast.<eos> Note the parallel verbiage, the repeated phrases.<eos> Uh, bad-ass, killer, bloodletter.<eos> Too close for coincidence.
Yeah, no shit.<eos> Beau...<eos> Drop the weapon!<eos> - Fascists!<eos> - I'm unarmed.<eos> I'm unarmed! I'm...<eos> Give me your arms!<eos> Give me your arms!<eos> Stay still!<eos> On the ground! On the ground!
They're not connected to any terrorist cells? - No, sir.<eos> - So, who are they?<eos> He's an ad executive and she's a graphic artist.<eos> Come on. We're going in there.<eos> You're Geronimo? - Proxy...<eos> - Snyder.<eos> That's right.<eos> The two of you are Geronimo?<eos> - Who were you working for?<eos> No one.
Thanks for stopping by.<eos> Hey, Gracie.<eos> I got something for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Markers?<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> From a friend.<eos> So now you can make some more blue tigers.<eos> - Thanks, Bram.<eos> - Sure.
It's software with a keyboard terminal.<eos> I think I could figure it out.<eos> Good, 'cause we're gonna need it to run down this cell.<eos> We?<eos> Does that mean you no longer think I'm Mata Hari?<eos> Want a drink?<eos> She's got booze stashed in there.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'll have some.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To Phyllis.
Ah, presidential suite!<eos> Well, Donna's mother died.<eos> But we should probably head out to find the last episode of that Korean soap opera.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's Peter?<eos> Oh, he went to get plastic surgery.<eos> He did?<eos> Yeah, Korea's the plastic surgery capital of the world.<eos> Nobody here thinks you look good unless you have big, round eyes and a tiny little nose and chin.<eos> Hey, guys.
We're through.<eos> Can't believe Quagmire isn't coming back with us.<eos> Donna's mother?<eos> It was suicide.<eos> You guys want to check out Brazil while we're out?<eos> We just got to accept that Quagmire has made his decision.<eos> There's nothing we can do about it.<eos> Yeah, I guess as far as Quagmire's concerned, he's totally Korean now.<eos> Guys, there's only one way to get through to a Korean.<eos> Through their music.
It's, uh...<eos> Kevin, it's personal.<eos> You see these legs?<eos> I used to press 900 pounds with these legs.<eos> Now I drag them around like limp sausage.<eos> And that yuppie lawyer scum who did this to me, he lives right around the block.<eos> Really sucks.<eos> Help me kill him.<eos> What?<eos> And his family.
Now I drag them around like limp sausage.<eos> And that yuppie lawyer scum who did this to me, he lives right around the block.<eos> Really sucks.<eos> Help me kill him.<eos> What?<eos> And his family.<eos> I'm gonna set his house on fire.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Hell, no.
But he did once tell me--<eos> Kevin, it is bad enough that you talk to that Greek psycho, but now you're gonna make me relive it?<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just reassure me.<eos> I did, like 20 times.<eos> We all talk shit, but most people, even the crazy Greek ones, don't follow through.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Other job.
- Public Restroom.<eos> That's what it's called and they serve tapas.<eos> I mean, who goes to a place called Restroom and is like, "You know what?<eos> I think I want to order some food"?<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Yeah, I'm here.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you so much for all your help, Peter.<eos> I'll let you know how it goes.<eos> - Holy shit.
Chris!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So you got the loan, but you're a few bucks short on the deposit.<eos> Lip and Ian had 450.<eos> I had 2 saved.<eos> No way I'm taking Carl's cartel money.<eos> Debbie's saving up for baby Huey, so...<eos> I pawned the engagement ring that Gus gave me because I'm a horrible person.<eos> What'd you get for it?<eos> 1,900.
You want to do this now?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Now.<eos> Right.<eos> You're really building it up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... yeah.<eos> I, uh, went to prison in my 20s.<eos> I figured with all the ex-cons you hire.<eos> For drugs?
He was pretty smart for one of them.<eos> Mr. Grant told us in history class that they have what's called squatter's rights.<eos> Said we tried to kick them out a long time ago,<eos> - but two people died. - It wasn't that long ago.<eos> Your uncle and I were like Caleb's age.<eos> It wasn't two people that died neither, sweetie.<eos> There were three.<eos> Man, he's out like a light.<eos> Well, he can stay here tonight then.<eos> - Just like every night.
So?<eos> If things get out of hand, I can take care of it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You tell her anything?<eos> No.<eos> Not a word.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, check this, boys.<eos> Ah. This, you ain't seen since you was a little bitty kid.<eos> My fa's.
I did what you wanted.<eos> I made it work!<eos> Barbara Kathleen Gordon, what the hell have you done?<eos> So, you and yoga guy?<eos> Yeah, a few nights ago.<eos> Girl, you've been holding out.<eos> How was it?<eos> - Not so good?<eos> - No, it was fantastic...<eos> Like fireworks.
Look, tomorrow you bury your old lady in luxury.<eos> Tonight, you're with us.<eos> Get the picture?<eos> I'm going to count to 10.<eos> One, nine...<eos> I swear to God, man, he ain't been around.<eos> Swear to me!<eos> You! I swear to you.<eos> When he escapes, it ain't long till he comes around, recruiting, you know?<eos> But not this time.
Throw the book!<eos> Throw the book!<eos> Throw the book!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Throw it!<eos> Throw it!<eos> Throw it!<eos> Throw it!<eos> Throw the book!<eos> Right on target.
You know what that means?<eos> It means that despite all your sick, cruel, vicious little games, he's as sane as he ever was.<eos> So, ordinary people don't crack.<eos> Maybe it's just you.<eos> No!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> Kick the hell out of me and get your standing ovation.<eos> Come on!<eos> No, not this time.
For the love of God, let us in.<eos> Yeah, let us in!<eos> Sergeant!<eos> That will be your only warning.<eos> They built a wall around Eden, too, and it done no good.<eos> Serpent was already inside.<eos> So true.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Just worrying about your reputation, sir.<eos> My reputation?
I've only become more capable.<eos> Give me time.<eos> You will see.<eos> I can do so much.<eos> Can you?<eos> Then do just one thing for me.<eos> Name it.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Absolutely right.
It isn't your earnings I want a share of.<eos> But let's talk about that later.<eos> You will never have to deal with your uncle again.<eos> I promise.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Still snoring in his drunken sleep.<eos> Are you familiar with Cat's Cradle?<eos> I used to play Cat's Cradle when I was a girl.<eos> Let's play.<eos> One...
Previously on Penny Dreadful...<eos> You chase this son of a bitch from London to here in the middle of the Devil's asshole because it's your duty?<eos> I think there's more to Mr. Talbot than meets the eye.<eos> There's the tragedy of it.<eos> The serum only lasts a matter of hours... and then they revert.<eos> I believe I can increase the duration of the change, perhaps even render it permanent.<eos> We'll create a choir of angels.<eos> One in particular.
The boy's name was Apache.<eos> All Chiricahua are named after him.<eos> This is the story of how the world was made.<eos> Or a prophecy of how it ends.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> If I die, I die.<eos> If I do not survive this night, something you need to know.<eos> After my people were murdered or banished to the reservation... after my son abandoned me...<eos> I came to this land.<eos> My land.
You are my chosen one, Renfield.<eos> Feed.<eos> Miss Ives!<eos> What a transcendent surprise!<eos> Come, come.<eos> Do have a seat.<eos> Do wait while I send someone for the seat.<eos> Are you leaving, off on an expedition?<eos> An expedition, heaven forfend!<eos> Just a jaunt over to Cairo.
Immortals.<eos> What has she to stand alongside me?<eos> She has the soul of me.<eos> The very heart of who I was before I was this.<eos> She has the anger... and the hate.<eos> And the loss.<eos> And are you no more than that?<eos> Sometimes that is all I am.<eos> I remember every man who ever used me.<eos> Every filthy alley.
And the man you see?<eos> No less.<eos> And you?<eos> Have you found something like happiness?<eos> That's like a strange tune, unknown to me.<eos> I'm trying to sound out the measures.<eos> Join the dance.<eos> We both should.<eos> We have been unhappy long enough.<eos> No matter the consequences?
We must be bloody or nothing else!<eos> And now you must prove your commitment to our great cause.<eos> Go now.<eos> Every one of you.<eos> Rise up.<eos> Rise up!<eos> Go into those dark streets you know so well, those foul alleys and secret back lanes and find me a bad man!<eos> A faithless husband.<eos> A cruel lover.<eos> A rich despot.
Have I lied?<eos> You met a man who marvels wide-eyed at the miracles of nature.<eos> So I am.<eos> You met a man who has known pain and tragedy.<eos> And so I am.<eos> You met a man who wanted to possess you for his own ends but, instead,<eos> he fell in love.<eos> That's the man I am, and the monster.<eos> Even now you twist at me.<eos> All the years.
The End of Days.<eos> Keep him safe.<eos> Won't you dance with me, Dorian?<eos> Another time, darling.<eos> I'm afraid I've some housekeeping to tend to.<eos> You'll let me know how you get on here, Doctor?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> One last kiss, darling?<eos> For old times' sake?
You're going to die if you stay.<eos> Shut up and let me save your life.<eos> Stiles saved me.<eos> What?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> We should have taken my car.<eos> Several times.<eos> It's a new car.<eos> It was new to someone.<eos> About twenty years ago.
Tell me later.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Sorry.<eos> - Slow it down.<eos> - ‭Sorry. Ms. Martin, sorry.<eos> Hey, have you seen, uh, Liam and Hayden?<eos> Actually, forget that.<eos> Have you seen my dad?<eos> Who?<eos> My dad.
I've got some food for you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Watch this.<eos> Come on ...<eos> Fucking awesome shit!<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> - Don't you want to feed it?<eos> Hell no!<eos> - How big animals can it eat?<eos> - A nice, fat rat.
- Since when?<eos> - Since the last general meeting.<eos> - Which you didn't attend.<eos> - You're harsh.<eos> - For the third time running.<eos> - 85,000 could buy me a car.<eos> We were just talking about Bolivia, and now we wanna sell the apartment?<eos> - This is something we have together.<eos> - Hey, you're the ones leaving.<eos> Only for six months.
I-I-I'm not the type to sell you some bill of goods.<eos> And that reminds me of a story that I think you'll particularly dig, 'cause it's absolutely...<eos> The hell?<eos> You talk too much.<eos> We don't want to have to hurt you.<eos> We want you to join us.<eos> Hang tight, Lincoln.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> Coulson.<eos> On my way.
Perhaps it will serve you, as well.<eos> I can take it to the doctor.<eos> Respectfully, it's for Dr. Radcliffe.<eos> Or no one at all.<eos> Wait in the bar area.<eos> If the doctor expresses interest, I will find you.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> Alisha never would've killed herself.<eos> She feels all of it.<eos> Every death.
- Right, huh? So, where were you? - Hey, hey, hey...<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Okay, all right, all right.<eos> Your dad's not the only one who got hurt.<eos> Oh, you'll heal.<eos> I'm not talking about me.<eos> Everything's going to be all right, Lydia.<eos> We're going to get you the best medical care.<eos> The best doctors.
Eventually. I think.<eos> Good.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To find my sister and make sure she's okay.<eos> You're going to just leave me here?<eos> You pulled me off a cliff.<eos> I'm lucky I healed.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> This time.
I feel like I lost something.<eos> Then maybe you start by forgiving someone else.<eos> Someone like Scott.<eos> If Theo's got his own pack now, then we need ours.<eos> Skinwalkers are powerful shapeshifters.<eos> They'll find us.<eos> Kira, take out your sword.<eos> She's frightened.<eos> But she's not frightened of us.<eos> Of herself.
He doesn't even know what's coming.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What's coming?<eos> Seems to be a lot of discussion over here.<eos> Can't imagine you've already solved the mystery, have you?<eos> No.<eos> Get to it.<eos> You want to go out again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. No way.
It was just the way you were looking at me that night.<eos> You know, you're standing there with a wrench in your hand, you're looking at me like I just bashed you in the head with it.<eos> You know, like I'd broken your sacred rule and that's it, there's no going back.<eos> I know the difference.<eos> What?<eos> I know what self-defense is.<eos> Our names are gone.<eos> Our initials.<eos> Not just you and your friends.<eos> Everyone.
I know where she is.<eos> She's here.<eos> She's in Beacon Hills.<eos> I need you to tell Scott something for me.<eos> Yeah, uh, why me?<eos> Because I can't right now.<eos> You gonna do it or not?<eos> Uh, he's not really talking to me.<eos> You should get someone else.<eos> Literally anyone else.
I think dying did something to him.<eos> It did something to me, too.<eos> But none of it was good.<eos> What if it happened again?<eos> What if you got hurt?<eos> What would you want me to do?<eos> Now that you know everything.<eos> Starting to question where your loyalties lie?<eos> Or maybe you're starting to understand your role.<eos> What role?
What?<eos> Hey, Coach, it's Scott and Stiles.<eos> Coach, You're in rehab.<eos> You didn't have a lobotomy.<eos> Coach?<eos> Don't you touch it.<eos> I've got Nurse Gonzalez by the balls of the last three moves and she knows it.<eos> Let it go.<eos> You're checking out of this place now.<eos> Not a chance.
Not a chance.<eos> Okay, Coach. But, we know you're fine.<eos> I have a debilitating disease.<eos> It's called "I'm not going to take another arrow to my stomach-phobia."<eos> Look it up.<eos> Nobody's shooting arrows at anyone, okay?<eos> We just need you to coach the charity game.<eos> Okay.<eos> Charity?<eos> Not a chance.
Nobody's shooting arrows at anyone, okay?<eos> We just need you to coach the charity game.<eos> Okay.<eos> Charity?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> How exactly have you been conning them into letting you stay here?<eos> I, uh... I have relapses.<eos> It's... It's serious.<eos> I've had seven of them.<eos> So once a month?
Whatever happens next... I want to be with you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I don't think Malia's got all the vans.<eos> Then we'll get her more time.<eos> How the hell are we going to do that?<eos> We'll even up the score.<eos> Once again... How the hell are we going to do that?<eos> Just get me the ball.<eos> Set.
A demon.<eos> What kind?<eos> Sebastien...<eos> What kind of demon?<eos> A Demon-Wolf.<eos> Open the door!<eos> For God's sake, open the door!<eos> Please!<eos> Open!<eos> Help!
Malia. Come down.<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> I'm not going to stop, Malia.<eos> I'm taking back what you stole from me.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> But you did.<eos> And I don't care if you were a willing participant or not.<eos> Talia Hale spent nine months trying to convince me of the miracle of childbirth.<eos> You know what it really felt like?<eos> A parasite.
Another arrogant youth.<eos> A contender to steal my name?<eos> You think you can take it from me?<eos> I just want your power.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You and Scott...<eos> That's right, Theo.<eos> The whole time.
Scott!<eos> Help me!<eos> Hayden, I've managed to stabilize the injury.<eos> But considering you're a Chimera, I don't know how, or if, you'll heal.<eos> We can still take you to the hospital.<eos> I've already died there once.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> I know.<eos> You saved their lives.<eos> Mason. Malia.
So there's one thing I wanted to mention.<eos> Mm, I heard, Sheriff, that our colleague's son was sold some Moonshine from the Farrell clan.<eos> Did you know that young man was number two in his class?<eos> It is just so, so sad.<eos> Farrell wine, I think they called it.<eos> I can't really discuss that.<eos> Oh, no. Of course not.<eos> I just thought you might wanna know in terms of what it might mean regarding public perception.<eos> - Perception of...<eos> - You.
Throwing those people off that mountain's not gonna win you any popularity contests.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> Now what if there was something else in that jug?<eos> Such as?<eos> PCP?<eos> Methamphetamine?<eos> Maybe the Farrells are cooking something nasty up there.<eos> And if that were true, not too many folks around here would oppose your eviction of them... or, for that matter, your reelection.<eos> Sundry apologies, cousin.<eos> For what?
Those weren't for me anyway, right?<eos> They were.<eos> I didn't realize roses were so flammable.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Well, it's the... it's the thought that counts.<eos> And, you know, and proper fire safety management, that... that counts most.<eos> - Yes. I have spent most of my life feeling very unlucky.<eos> Yeah, and now?<eos> Feels like I've been struck by lightning twice.<eos> Help!
Okay, interesting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, I just, you know, I can't get enough of art.<eos> Anyway, there's this event at the Central City Museum tonight.<eos> They're showing this really famous painting that I've always loved.<eos> Actually, I don't know anything about art, but what's the saying?<eos> I know what I like, and I like you, so count me in.<eos> All right, great.<eos> I'll see you at 8:00.<eos> 7:00!
- Yeah.<eos> No, I just, you know, I can't get enough of art.<eos> Anyway, there's this event at the Central City Museum tonight.<eos> They're showing this really famous painting that I've always loved.<eos> Actually, I don't know anything about art, but what's the saying?<eos> I know what I like, and I like you, so count me in.<eos> All right, great.<eos> I'll see you at 8:00.<eos> 7:00!<eos> - Or 7:00.
She's alive.<eos> Right.<eos> No!<eos> You have a really weird look on your face.<eos> Do I look weird?<eos> - No, no.<eos> You... look... like a dream.<eos> You look very handsome.<eos> I can't wait to see this painting.<eos> What painting?
Right.<eos> No!<eos> You have a really weird look on your face.<eos> Do I look weird?<eos> - No, no.<eos> You... look... like a dream.<eos> You look very handsome.<eos> I can't wait to see this painting.<eos> What painting?<eos> The painting. Yeah.
Relax?<eos> Breathe in and feel yourself relaxing.<eos> Malia.<eos> You need to calm your breathing.<eos> Maybe try some positive self-talk.<eos> I'm positive I don't want to be here.<eos> Remember, school is a safe space.<eos> Let's breathe together.<eos> Just one deep breath.<eos> Little deeper.
Help me!<eos> The coroner found damage to both of Mazzara's cerebral hemispheres, but assumed that it was sustained from the wound.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mazzara's pineal gland is missing.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Shoot him, Parrish.<eos> Everyone down, now.<eos> On your knees.

Hey, Sheriff. We never should have gone there to see your father.<eos> No, no, it's... It's okay.<eos> I should have been clearer about who he is.<eos> And maybe a part of me just didn't want to have to, um, admit it.<eos> This is my dad, Scott.<eos> He pushed me through a glass table going after my mom.<eos> There's still tiny pieces of glass in there.<eos> The doctor told my mother that they'd probably be in there for the rest of my life, workin' their way out.<eos> Small price to pay to keep him away from her.<eos> That time.
It's a point of impact from a lightning strike.<eos> Usually you'd find charred spots like that on the ground after a violent thunderstorm.<eos> That's how the Ghost Rider got in.<eos> He rode lightning.<eos> If they can use lightning to get past the mountain ash...<eos> No place is safe.<eos> What about the others?<eos> It's my fault they're marked.<eos> We'll find a way to protect them.<eos> All of them.
Can you think of a better, less-seizure inducing way?<eos> Don't any of you get it?<eos> We are never leaving this place.<eos> Jayden.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Before they get in here, they got to go through us.<eos> What if that's not enough?<eos> No one is getting through that door.<eos> Nathan's missing.<eos> On your knees.
Run!<eos> Stay close!<eos> I can still see them!<eos> Liam!<eos> We can't stop 'em!<eos> Protect Gwen!<eos> You want what?<eos> You want what?<eos> Claudia's medical records.<eos> Just for a minute.
Well, but she had...<eos> Frontotemporal dementia.<eos> There must be a mistake.<eos> How long ago?<eos> She seems fine now.<eos> Ten years?<eos> I'm surprised she's still alive, honestly.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Everyone from the bunker has been taken.<eos> Everyone?
I just wanted to go home to him.<eos> Even though I had my doubts, I started to round up deserters.<eos> It all went so wrong so fast.<eos> Did you ever take responsibility for the incident?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You and Henry covered it up and never spoke of it again.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Maybe it's time to give yourself up.<eos> Why?<eos> For what?
He's on route 29.<eos> You go.<eos> I'll take care of her.<eos> Heh. Ha! Damon.<eos> You're alive!<eos> I was half expecting the, uh, cute witch or the, uh, pregnant blond, but...<eos> Well, you're just gonna have to settle for the ornery brother.<eos> Right.<eos> What's that putrid smell?<eos> Ah. That.
Do you, Henry?<eos> Then follow my lead, Wattles.<eos> I'm gonna get this right.<eos> Hello, beautiful.<eos> What a great smile you have.<eos> I'm gonna need you, your daughter, and grandma to come out here on the porch with private wattles, soldier's orders.<eos> Come on out, ladies.<eos> That's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right here, just right there on the porch.
I got to get her back.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Damon, Damon, Damon, Damon.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> It's me. You're safe.<eos> It's ok.<eos> It's ok.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> One more time.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Damon, Damon, Damon, Damon.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> It's me. You're safe.<eos> It's ok.<eos> It's ok.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> One more time.<eos> One more time.
Hilarious.<eos> A dead girl leaving soon-to-be dead flowers at her dead brother's grave.<eos> It's just another pointless ritual in a pointless life.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I... look.<eos> As pointless as you think your life is, there are people out there right now, right now...<eos> Davina, Kinney, hell, even Klaus... who know better.<eos> Well, you don't need to give me a speech.<eos> I called you here because you've been a friend, and I figured you wouldn't be judgey no matter what I choose.<eos> No way.
- How do you feel?<eos> - Amazing.<eos> The Serratura creates an impenetrable boundary.<eos> Nothing living or dead can pass through.<eos> May the ghosts of our fallen keep you company.<eos> Aya. Aya!<eos> Tristan de Martel guided this organization for centuries.<eos> He was a radical thinker, a decisive leader, and to each of us here tonight, both mentor and friend.<eos> He was, in a word, irreplaceable.<eos> To Tristan de Martel.
Let go of me.<eos> You can't just force her to stay here, Klaus.<eos> Finally, someone who's on my side.<eos> Oh, don't get me wrong.<eos> I remember when I turned, and you, for sure, shouldn't have a box of witch crap right now, but you can't hold her hostage, either.<eos> Let me talk to her.<eos> I hardly thing now is the time for a women's empowerment meeting.<eos> She died, Klaus, because she got caught up in the Mikaelson world just like me, just like Jackson, so, yeah, she and I have ‭a few things to talk about.<eos> Niklaus...<eos> A word.
I'll end it right now.<eos> You had to punch your hand through my chest.<eos> Oh, for the love...<eos> Marcel, I was in character.<eos> The moment took me.<eos> Besides, between that absurd contest<eos> And your master class performance...<eos> Thank you.<eos> They were beautifully distracted from this whole white oak business. So...<eos> To the new Grand Poobah.
Oh, I don't know why I didn't think of that.<eos> Hormones.<eos> Okay, well, can you keep them in check for ten minutes?<eos> This is work.<eos> - Morning, Claudia.<eos> - I'm out of gum.<eos> Charity is so stressful.<eos> You know I like to chew when I'm stressed.<eos> Yeah, I put a whole case in your desk.<eos> Uh, peppermint, not wintergreen.
Uh, peppermint, not wintergreen.<eos> Wet nails.<eos> I'll smudge.<eos> Ask your manicurist to look in the bottom left drawer.<eos> - Do you need anything else?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Umm, call Wilhelmina 'cause I wanna switch out all the models for tonight.<eos> Tell them I want Asians.<eos> Only Asians.<eos> Very into Asians.
How long has it been since your father made an effort?<eos> Or Jason?<eos> You're right.<eos> My friends are the closest thing I have to family now.<eos> You've been my rock.<eos> I have more vacation days.<eos> I can take them if you need me to.<eos> I appreciate that, but I'm home.<eos> Time to get back to work.<eos> Back to normal.
- Okay.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Bye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sara.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I didn't realize you worked here.<eos> - I'm looking for Room 19.<eos> - In the East Wing.<eos> Across the courtyard on the left.
A lot of politicians came to power on the backs of rich donors.<eos> They like it when you're confused and cynical.<eos> Yvonne's right.<eos> For them, the less you know, the less you care.<eos> So they get to make a lot of the big decisions for you.<eos> But we do have access to information and we wanna help you find it.<eos> We're on opposite sides of this campaign but on this issue, we stand together.<eos> If you don't vote, you don't have a voice.<eos> Are you okay with opening this up to questions?<eos> Absolutely, Spencer.
Well, maybe you will.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Things have changed though.<eos> Personal dynamics are different.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> If you have to go...<eos> Yeah, actually... there are some things I need to take care of, so...<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> It's good.<eos> Next time.

That's not her.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Montgomery, did you forget something?<eos> Is your eyewitness Sara Harvey?<eos> We don't reveal the identity of witnesses.<eos> Otherwise people would be scared to speak up.<eos> Oh, I'm sure that she couldn't wait.<eos> The person that you should be questioning was on your side of the glass!<eos> Just a minute.
- Oh.<eos> Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me check on his...<eos> I believe we picked him up on a DV, but I'll have to check.<eos> I'll have one of my guys call you back.<eos> Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.<eos> Now.<eos> Would you like to fill out the complaint form?<eos> A complaint form?
Well, have you, have you made up your mind about me?<eos> Don't make this about something that it isn't.<eos> And what about you?<eos> I'm not the only person here who has plans.<eos> You know, you were, you said that you wanted to quit the force and you said that wanted to go back to school.<eos> That was your idea, not mine.<eos> And it was only because being with a cop isn't good enough for you.<eos> I have never said that, okay?<eos> I just, I don't know, I thought that maybe you wanted...<eos> More?
No, I felt fine.<eos> All of a sudden, my feet were there but the stairs weren't.<eos> - I'm so sorry, Ali.<eos> - It was just a stupid accident.<eos> Do you like my honeymoon lingerie?<eos> You look great.<eos> Hey, what are the doctors saying?<eos> They want me to stay because of the concussion but they'll spring me tomorrow.<eos> - Back to the bridal suite?<eos> - Back to Rosewood.
You look great.<eos> Hey, what are the doctors saying?<eos> They want me to stay because of the concussion but they'll spring me tomorrow.<eos> - Back to the bridal suite?<eos> - Back to Rosewood.<eos> Elliott got a call for a conference in Chicago.<eos> They want him on the panel.<eos> You're gonna be in Rosewood by yourself?<eos> I don't mind.<eos> For the first time...
Elliott got a call for a conference in Chicago.<eos> They want him on the panel.<eos> You're gonna be in Rosewood by yourself?<eos> I don't mind.<eos> For the first time...<eos> That house really feels like mine.<eos> God, all these flowers.<eos> Did you fall down some stairs or enter the Rose Parade?<eos> Elliott sent them.<eos> All of them?
Are you mad?<eos> I'm due to be married tomorrow.<eos> Yes, I'm mad.<eos> I can't be sane when I'm with you.<eos> My father is deeply indebted to Lord Hellion.<eos> If this marriage doesn't take place tomorrow, he'll be ruined and my family dishonoured.<eos> Cut!<eos> Is it too much to ask for you people to learn your damn lines before stepping onto my set?<eos> You're costing me a fortune.<eos> Principles to their dressing rooms now.
What a woman!<eos> Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> What happened?<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Per istam sanctam unctionem et suam...<eos> If you're praying for his soul then you're wasting your time.<eos> Sir.<eos> Did no-one tell them it's the day of rest?<eos> To Vivian.
Rex is new Director.<eos> There now.<eos> Wasn't that easy?<eos> At least the killer was good enough to leave a signature.<eos> Any idea on this Arulus?<eos> The victim's been receiving death threats.<eos> "Your fate approaches.<eos> Apocalypse 20:10."<eos> How's your Bible knowledge, Sir?<eos> Hazard a guess.
Oh, dear. I think somebody is lying.<eos> When you're ready, Miss Fontaine.<eos> I opened my dressing room door to put my shoes out for wardrobe and somebody was going into my husband's office.<eos> Isn't that right, Miss Swain?<eos> Is this true?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you lied because...?<eos> Because it was confidential.<eos> I was signing a contract for my part in his next movie.<eos> What part?
Check the gate!<eos> Thank you very much, Paulette, that was a thing of beauty.<eos> Gate clear!<eos> Print it!<eos> Mrs Wolsey.<eos> I have a warrant to search your husband's personal files.<eos> I take that to mean you are no closer to finding his killer.<eos> I wouldn't say that, Madam.<eos> Set up for scene 14!<eos> To my leading lady.
I hope you're taking this down.<eos> 'If you ever leave the Priesthood, I see a future for you as a writer.'<eos> 'But this isn't a work of imagination.<eos> 'I'm sure that if the police fit this to the mask 'they'll find it exact...'<eos> 'What are you doing! ? ' Let's go, Sergeant.<eos> Erm, where to, sir?<eos> Am I psychic?<eos> !<eos> Get every available man and spread out till we find them.<eos> Help!
You're going through this, that's on me.<eos> But do you really think Damian Darhk gives a damn about you?<eos> He believes that the world needs a reset.<eos> And honestly, John, after what we witnessed in Afghanistan, can you tell me otherwise?<eos> Ok.<eos> All right, so you and Darhk are burning the village in order to save it.<eos> I get that.<eos> Malcolm Merlyn was talking the same tune.<eos> But Andy, Darhk hurt a friend of mine.<eos> A close friend.
Any luck?<eos> Working some leads.<eos> Tell me you haven't gone off the rails.<eos> Well...<eos> I just... I can't help but think that... The reason that Darhk is winning is because I haven't been willing to go far enough and that if I was, if I had, maybe you wouldn't be in here right now.<eos> And I don't know what the point... of what I'm doing as Green Arrow is if I can't protect the people that are closest to me.<eos> Well, what's the point of doing it if you lose yourself in the process?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's something else we need to talk about.<eos> The doctors...
Maybe part of him still is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Get down.<eos> The damage to her spinal cord, it's permanent.<eos> She's never gonna walk again.<eos> If we don't get home soon, the sitter's gonna charge us an extra hour.<eos> We should have taken the car.<eos> Sitter's what, another 15 bucks for half an hour?<eos> It's a bargain at twice the price.<eos> Lyla.
What are you gonna do about Andy?<eos> Still haven't made a decision on that.<eos> You mean, even though he just saved you life?<eos> Yeah, well, you guys had a whole lot to do with that, but you're right.<eos> This is the first time in 8 years I've seen shades of my old brother.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> Already got my cut.<eos> Eh, it's a token of appreciation from the boss.<eos> Traded the opium for something else.<eos> Like what?
Step aside.<eos> No. You're coming with me.<eos> Am I?<eos> We're under attack!<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> Run!<eos> Go! Get inside.<eos> Cowards just like their master.<eos> Sorry, Nyssa.<eos> For what?
No. You're coming with me.<eos> Am I?<eos> We're under attack!<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> Run!<eos> Go! Get inside.<eos> Cowards just like their master.<eos> Sorry, Nyssa.<eos> For what?<eos> For that.
Whose shocking return can we look forward to next?<eos> Oliver, I'm gonna ask this just to ask it.<eos> Are you sure hat it was--<eos> It was Roy.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Or maybe it was just somebody who's able o make themselves look like Roy.<eos> Don't act like it's he craziest possibility after everything hat we've experienced.<eos> What's crazy is Roy stealing from tech companies.<eos> What did he take his time?<eos> A triode capacitor bomb.
You need to forgive yourself for what you've done.<eos> Unfortunately, you're gonna have to be a little more specific.<eos> You had the chance o leave this island, o return to your family.<eos> They miss you erribly.<eos> I can't go back o my family.<eos> Not the way hat I am now.<eos> Then it's time o start changing.<eos> The only way out is through, Oliver.<eos> That's what Amanda Waller said.<eos> Through what?

Taiana.<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Whatever it is, it can wait until you've had some water.<eos> I lied to you.<eos> When I said that Conklin killed your brother, hat was a lie.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I have this darkness inside of me hat I've been trying o escape for the longest time.<eos> And I think that I found a way, but first I need o earn your forgiveness.<eos> For what?
Is everything ok?<eos> Yeah. We got to, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, ha ha! Where you going?<eos> Duty calls. Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ahem. Is everything ok?<eos> So Alex got a phone call from one of the lawyers doing research on the opposition, and it looks like they might have found something.<eos> On Ruvé?<eos> On you actually.
Andy did a little digging on the Dark Web, found out the demolition team uses a specialized acid that can weaken building structures.<eos> Only one warehouse in the city stocks it.<eos> Text me the address.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No. Just it's-- it's a long shot at the best.<eos> Ok.<eos> Thea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
And while you were held hostage--<eos> Damien Darhk-- or whatever he calls himself-- was there calling the shots the entire time.<eos> Pass the witness.<eos> This, uh, holiday party, were you, uh... were you there as a guest?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I work security-- personal security for Mr. Oliver Queen.<eos> And I have been for the past 3-plus years.<eos> Even after Mr. Queen lost his job as CEO of Queen Consolidated?<eos> I mean... how much does he pay you, 10 cents an hour?<eos> Objection.
Oliver Queen.<eos> We took his radio?<eos> I know you're still down here, Mr. Queen.<eos> You should have studied those maps more closely.<eos> The only way out of these tunnels is back the way you came, which means going through me.<eos> You can either return of your own accord or you can force me to come find you.<eos> But don't bother trying to fight your way out of this.<eos> After all, I'm the only one of us who has men and guns.<eos> Well, last August, Darhk asked me for the vacation plans for the chief of the fire department.<eos> Objection.
But don't bother trying to fight your way out of this.<eos> After all, I'm the only one of us who has men and guns.<eos> Well, last August, Darhk asked me for the vacation plans for the chief of the fire department.<eos> Objection.<eos> Darhk.<eos> Bender.<eos> Whatever he wants to call himself.<eos> I told him where Chief Reynolds was staying.<eos> The next day, the place blows up.<eos> Objection.
He wanted me to break in to a federal server farm to install a computer virus.<eos> And I did that.<eos> He wanted me to give him information on the City's leadership.<eos> And I...<eos> I did that.<eos> And 3 days later, the City leadership were all dead.<eos> You did all of these things for the defendant?<eos> The defendant and the organization he works for.<eos> He called it HIVE.<eos> Objection.
What is that?<eos> Whoa! Oh, my God!<eos> Eww! Don't worry.<eos> I won't tell anyone you screamed.<eos> Oh, right!<eos> Thank you.<eos> You never, never have to thank me.<eos> Agh! If I can't walk, you can't live.<eos> Who should I kill first,<eos> "A" or "Bee"?
Laurel, I failed him.<eos> I came back from that island with another chance.<eos> It was a chance to help people.<eos> It was...<eos> It was a chance to make this city better...<eos> And I couldn't, and now Tommy's dead.<eos> Oliver...<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> You'd blame me, too, if you knew the truth.<eos> What truth?
Yeah, maybe before but not this time.<eos> I'm sorry, Dinah.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She's never coming back.<eos> She's...<eos> Mr. Queen has requested to say a few words.<eos> This, uh...<eos> This doesn't seem right.<eos> Uh, I knew Laurel Lance for...<eos> Almost her entire life.
A father would do anything to protect his daughter from the dark.<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Looking for something?<eos> Oh, jeez, man!<eos> Do you know how to knock?<eos> Any luck finding Merlyn?<eos> No, but I think you already knew that.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Surveillance.
And let slip the Dogs of War."<eos> What happened?<eos> It was rec hour. The prisoners were out of their cells.<eos> He's holding the guards hostage.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Doesn't matter how many.<eos> We have to put Darhk back in his cage.<eos> Let's gear up!<eos> Oliver, I can't prosecute him without getting him into custody first.<eos> One last time.
What happened at the, uh--at the prison?<eos> Uh, you punched out a lieutenant.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, after that.<eos> Did they keep those inmates from escaping?<eos> Too many of them, and one--Darhk-- he hurt one of them.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Who--who'd he hurt?<eos> The vigilantes.

It's a long story.<eos> I was gonna give up being the Black Canary, but I realized I didn't know how I could because going out there and fighting alongside you guys, it's what makes me feel alive inside...<eos> And I love you guys so much.<eos> We love you.<eos> We love you. We love you.<eos> We should probably let you get some rest.<eos> We'll be right outside, ok?<eos> Ok.<eos> You should probably get some rest, too.<eos> No chance.
I love you, baby girl.<eos> Argus has a chopper waiting to take us to Coast City, so at least we'll all be together.<eos> If we can't stop the...<eos> The end of the world.<eos> In these situations, you're usually the one offering hope.<eos> I'm fresh out, Lyla.<eos> Because of what happened with Andy?<eos> It was self-defense, John.<eos> It was a clean kill.<eos> Lyla.
We survived the Outbreak, and somehow, someway, we will survive this.<eos> A friend of mine told me that living in Star City, it takes a special kind of tenacity, but we do live here, because this is our home.<eos> This is our home!<eos> It is our friend, our family, our lives, and we will not-- we will not throw those precious gifts away by descending into chaos.<eos> We will look to each other for hope.<eos> We will cling to each other for strength, and if we do that, no matter what happens, then we can all stand here united.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's here.<eos> That's terrifying...<eos> And also kind of great.
But I am ready for this.<eos> Good.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Put your left hand on the Bible.<eos> Raise your right hand and recite the oath.<eos> I, Oliver Queen, do solemnly swear to support the charter and laws of Star City and to faithfully and impartially perform and discharge the duties of the office of mayor according to the law and to the very best of my ability.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I didn't know you'd be here.<eos> You thought I was leaving, too?<eos> Not a chance.
They're not in their right minds.<eos> You mean the pills?<eos> We haven't taken any.<eos> Not even one.<eos> None of us have.<eos> We're here because we believe, because we know the world is evil and darkness.<eos> It's beyond saving.<eos> How can you believe that?<eos> Because we've lived it.<eos> Every day.
I'll kill her.<eos> Tell me.<eos> It was Machin.<eos> He's...<eos> Ruvé?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My daughter?<eos> We're still getting reports of survivors.<eos> We're locked out of Rubicon.<eos> Momentarily.

Hey, don't worry about it.<eos> It was a crazy party.<eos> We ran out of salsa.<eos> How do you run out of salsa?<eos> Anyway, we're good.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I-I-I was worried you'd be mad.<eos> Mad?<eos> At my buddy, Brian?
Then I'd have to go, and I'd have to dance.<eos> It would be weird to be best man and not dance.<eos> And I'd have to give a toast, and say that Bonnie's the best thing that ever happened to him.<eos> You know, she is the best thing that ever happened to him, but don't worry, Joe.<eos> I'll only refer to you as Bonnie's ex.<eos> You know, like, "Bonnie has an ex, but Brian marks the spot."<eos> Oh, Peter, that's good.<eos> Thanks, babe.<eos> I hope Brian and Bonnie are as happy as us.<eos> To Brian and Bonnie.
Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room, and then I'm done with my volunteer hours and we never come back here again.<eos> Mrs. Parkhurst?<eos> Look at you two, stealing from the elderly.<eos> You're worse than that Juliette Lewis who makes out with dogs.<eos> Wait, is that a real thing?<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> What are your sources?<eos> Listen, we're very sorry we stole from you, but you have it all back now, so we cool, right?<eos> You know I should call the police on you.<eos> The police?
Oh, my God!<eos> And apparently the girl...<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> ...he sent it to doesn't like him back, so she turned him in.<eos> Okay, I can see everybody's mad, but... what'd you think?<eos> Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Principal Shepherd.<eos> We'll make sure Chris apologizes to that little knob-tease.<eos> I'm sorry, Lois, but it's not that simple.<eos> When Chris sent that picture, he was technically distributing child pornography.<eos> Child pornography?
You're too special for this place and these people.<eos> The world's bigger than this mountain, G'win.<eos> You know that.<eos> You're too special for me.<eos> Wake up to yourself, Asa.<eos> You're not special.<eos> - You're just a man.<eos> - Okay, I got it.<eos> And I just wanna say from the bottom of my heart that I am so sorry.<eos> For what?
All right, I stand corrected.<eos> Oh, I better start doing some throwin' or I'll throw my breakfast.<eos> Okay, now that was funny.<eos> You just shut your mouth and throw, lostie.<eos> You, uh, you hear my boy's gettin' married?<eos> In the black, son.<eos> You take another drink.<eos> Yeah, that G'win.<eos> I gotta say, I always thought she'd end up with somebody else.<eos> Oh, in the black again.
And that infection, it's just gonna spread.<eos> And I can't let that happen.<eos> I'd like to pay my respects to my Bren'in, if that's okay with you.<eos> Your Bren'in is standing right here.<eos> So you show your respect by doing what he tells you.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Is this how you gonna lead, Foster?<eos> Over the barrel of a gun?<eos> No, not a gun.<eos> Guns.
Once she figures it out, what are you gonna do then?<eos> Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Stop all that clattering'!<eos> Why don't y'all gather 'round?<eos> I got something important to share.<eos> Some of you old ones, you were there the day my fa took the oak.<eos> And what a glorious day that was...<eos> But not only 'cause... 'Cause he took power, but because on that day, he chose my mother to be his bride.<eos> Now I've followed my father's footsteps in becoming your leader, so...<eos> So I think maybe I should, uh, follow him all the way and take myself a wife.<eos> But who?
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Got you, man.<eos> All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You have a good day.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> - Yeah, we'll have red beans and rice.<eos> - Homemade fries.
Deacon's gonna kill him there!<eos> Not before he tells us everything he knows.<eos> Those Messengers out there in the hoods...<eos> - what do they want?<eos> - The machine.<eos> We don't know where they went or when.<eos> 1944... that's where I think the Messengers went.<eos> _<eos> Glennis, the limo's here.<eos> One minute.
Mea culpa.<eos> We stopped their plan to release the virus.<eos> Whatever's going on now, he's got nothing to do with.<eos> And what about 1944?<eos> What about it?<eos> Nice tux.<eos> This is a relationship I will never understand.<eos> You should hear what you just said.<eos> Oh, you sore about us?<eos> Hey, guys.
Look, they went back and killed Crawford.<eos> We have to stop them and find out what they were up to.<eos> Could be his research.<eos> It might be their plan B for the virus.<eos> They might know something.<eos> Crawford lived decades before anyone understood the basics of RNA propagation.<eos> His work would have been useless to the Monkeys.<eos> Maybe he was ahead of his time, and they killed him before he got a chance to prove it.<eos> We should go.<eos> To 1944?
Match coordinates.<eos> Follow sequence.<eos> You all right, miss?<eos> Miss?<eos> Did you hit your head?<eos> Quickly, inside.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Air raid.<eos> Probably just a drill, but one can never be sure.<eos> This way, into the theater.
We need a plan to get into a secure military function during wartime.<eos> And I got us on the guest list with a generous donation to the Columbia Alumni Society.<eos> I'm on top of it.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Try to have some fun.<eos> This isn't a vacation.<eos> Mr. Cole?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Telephone.<eos> - For me?
One of these eggheads might just help us win the war.<eos> Ahh. I got to hit the john.<eos> Whiskey sour.<eos> Uncle Sam rationing razor blades now?<eos> The beard.<eos> This is New York City, not the Appalachians.<eos> You walk two blocks, you'll run into at least three barbershops.<eos> I'm going someplace cold.<eos> Someplace cold?<eos> Like the North Pole?
Previously, on "12 Monkeys"... 1944, that's what the Messengers wanted.<eos> Monkeys are coming for me.<eos> The Messengers, they need me dead.<eos> Primary.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We are time.<eos> My herb, they don't work unless the leaves are red.<eos> Gives you pictures in your head you can't erase.<eos> No!
You have to stay in bed.<eos> You'll have plenty of time to recover.<eos> After surgery, okay?<eos> A few days, at least.<eos> I need to speak to James Cole.<eos> He's a guest there.<eos> - Mr. Cole?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Telephone.<eos> - For me?
Says the ant.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> A colony of ants all in a line.<eos> Hundreds, thousands.<eos> But one ant only knows of three.<eos> The one in front, the one behind, and itself.<eos> Until... It steps out of line, then it sees everything.<eos> You're looking wrong.<eos> Looking at what wrong?<eos> Time.
I have no doubt they bring you visions, Miss Goines, but they'll also bring you death.<eos> Hmm, have a little faith.<eos> Mr. Cole and Dr. Railly are lost in time.<eos> This anomaly is threatening to kill us all.<eos> I don't have the time to break on through to the other side with you.<eos> Jim Morrison, primary.<eos> Good day.<eos> Uncle Sam rationing razor blades now?<eos> I'm going some place cold.<eos> Like the North Pole?
Move.<eos> The very fabric of our existence is unraveling.<eos> Our best hope and our worst hope is lost in the past, and I have no idea what to do.<eos> No!<eos> We know nothing!<eos> You see?<eos> Nothing!<eos> What on God's green Earth happened here?<eos> Keep the hallway clear.<eos> Clear.
_<eos> Tick tock, witness blood on snow, 1944, the doctor heals...<eos> The voices will stop...<eos> Stop...<eos> Witness blood...<eos> Hi, um,<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I'm ready for them to stop now.<eos> The voices.<eos> For real this time.
The Foreman.<eos> What happened to the others?<eos> He got 'em.<eos> Rankin, Otero, he got 'em all.<eos> I barely made it.<eos> They... they came out of nowhere.<eos> Four of my guys, who are stronger, faster, and smarter than you, they got grabbed and you got away?<eos> I got lucky, man.<eos> You made a deal.<eos> No way, man.

People don't appreciate that.<eos> Not like we do, right?<eos> We're like two peas in a pod.<eos> Okay listen, bellboy.<eos> I get that that most of your clientele are one syllable shy of monosyllabic, but I don't come here to chit chat...<eos> Is that a new dress by the way?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> The pattern, very slimming.<eos> Information, spill it.<eos> Suite 607.
It's part of the Markridge Family Trust.<eos> Caroline Markridge.<eos> Daddy didn't make money.<eos> He married it.<eos> More opportunist than genius.<eos> What's in there?<eos> It's my room.<eos> The Witness.<eos> How long have you been drawing these?<eos> My whole life.
She thought I was gonna destroy the world.<eos> She was almost right.<eos> But you didn't, Jennifer.<eos> She was wrong, and so was I.<eos> I think I can help you now.<eos> The Foreman and his guys travel light.<eos> But if they are on the move, I want spotters in all four quadrants and I want a two-man perimeter, okay?<eos> Move.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Camping trip?

All right, all clear.<eos> Deacon.<eos> Foreman.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> That is good.<eos> You set me up.<eos> Respect.<eos> We had Whitley find one of his guys.<eos> Offered you up in a trade.<eos> For?
- Kyle Slade.<eos> Vietnam vet.<eos> Did three tours.<eos> Came home last year.<eos> Two weeks before you found your first victim.<eos> All right, pallies.<eos> We'll look into it.<eos> We want a ride-along. Be there when you grab him.<eos> - That way we get our exclusive.<eos> - No way.
I know.<eos> I wish to God that you'd stayed out of it.<eos> I thought I was gonna die in that fire.<eos> I was just waiting for the pain to stop.<eos> In those final moments, the only thing I saw was you, Cass.<eos> You were the only thing that kept me going and the worst part was thinking that I was gonna die without ever getting the chance to tell you...<eos> That I'm sorry.<eos> Sons of bitches!<eos> Guns down!<eos> On the ground, now!
What the hell did you do to him?<eos> I needed help, so I sent up a flare.<eos> Victoria?<eos> That's why she was the only identifiable victim.<eos> I knew that you would follow her through time right to me.<eos> I knew that you would come here to finish what I started.<eos> Take down our enemy.<eos> Once it's done, we can go home.<eos> - Home?<eos> - To the future, together.
_<eos> You're not safe here anymore, especially around me.<eos> You need to find someplace else to stay for a while.<eos> Someplace I don't know about.<eos> If The Witness can find me, he can find you too.<eos> Okay, please know that I appreciate the irony of what I'm about to say, but what if it was all in your head?<eos> We can't take that chance.<eos> It felt real.<eos> Then if it was real... that means he's scared, right?<eos> Of us!
Sneaking up on people is kind of what we do around here, Alfred.<eos> That's a joke.<eos> We are not amused.<eos> I'm not exactly in a festive mood either.<eos> How long has he been gone?<eos> Two weeks, one day, 15 hours.<eos> Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> But he's never been gone this long without notifying me in some way.<eos> Last night, the signal was up for an hour.<eos> Third time this week.
Dad!<eos> Except the ones we take to our graves.<eos> You dare to wear the mantle of the bat.<eos> Get to the transport.<eos> The boy.<eos> Ahhh! Electrocutioner, stop!<eos> You're gonna fry up real good, you stupid little...<eos> Come back and fight, you cowards!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Help!
You little bitch!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> After that night, I swore I'd never need Batman or anyone saving me again.<eos> My mother and sister were victims of the animals out there.<eos> Not me.<eos> I get that, Kate.<eos> But it doesn't mean you have to be alone.<eos> You made a big mistake coming here.<eos> I was trained to never make mistakes.<eos> Just like you.

So they're coming here to do what... clean up their mess?<eos> These are the only things that can defeat you.<eos> Those are your exact words.<eos> The Reapers are my greatest fear, but with your help, I believe we will... rip out their hearts.<eos> Those words are yours.<eos> That's really not what I meant.<eos> I fought a Kree before.<eos> They won't be easy to kill.<eos> These Reapers are even deadlier, which will make your task more difficult.<eos> My task?

Everything you have done to them, everything you've put them through...<eos> it's time to do some good.<eos> I did it.<eos> I told off the Archdeacon.<eos> You should have heard me.<eos> I was like...<eos> Marlon Brando.<eos> Oh, I feel giddy with it.<eos> Who is he, Daniel?<eos> Just a minute.
You're the one who gives all the sermons.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Geordie.<eos> Someone recently asked me why we were friends, seeing as we have so little in common - and he's old enough to be my father. - Ooh!<eos> And he has a terrible habit of beating me at backgammon.<eos> But the thing is, I don't think we ARE that different.<eos> We both want the world to be a less frightening place.<eos> You're a grumpy old sod, but er... well, I would be lost without you.<eos> - To Geordie!
I don't think planes were invented yet.<eos> - They continued their journey.<eos> Cow, cow, cow, cow.<eos> That's not a cow.<eos> That's a tire.<eos> - It was much easier for them to get to Vegas by taking the good ol' Mississippi river.<eos> We gotta catch that riverboat.<eos> I agree with you.<eos> You catch anything?<eos> Just this minnow.
I really, really did!<eos> Then, you sent the e-mail to Calvin Sarwar, that ruined Michael and Freya's lives...<eos> .. all in the hope that Asha would have to come back to Shetland?<eos> My mother... .. she was so beautiful... .. and she was so kind.<eos> I just want her back!<eos> What have you done?<eos> What have you done?<eos> What have you done...?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?

Have fun!<eos> Do you want a cup of tea?<eos> No, um... I'm going to get going.<eos> I phoned Mary last night, had a chat and, er...<eos> Well, I think I'm going to give it another bash.<eos> Good.<eos> Aye!<eos> Aye!<eos> I'm worried, though.<eos> About Cassie? No, no, no.
Could really use Mack's help.<eos> How is he?<eos> Well, stress fractures are healing.<eos> Broken ribs and fingers still need time.<eos> It's his broken spirit that worries me.<eos> He hasn't been the same since Daisy...<eos> Feels like everything's going to hell and all we're doing is slowing down the descent.<eos> Okay.<eos> That should keep her out for an hour.<eos> Or a minute.
We found Ms. Rodriguez in Colombia.<eos> She was being a real thorn in the side of the drug cartels, using her powers to clean up her neighborhood, to fight the good fight.<eos> Put me on your list, there will be a price on my head.<eos> Nobody would ever find out about it.<eos> Naive.<eos> - I think that means...<eos> - I know what she's saying.<eos> What are her powers?<eos> Elena, the general would like to see what you can do.<eos> Any time.
When good people begin to... doubt and run the other way instead of stand up and fight, you see it everywhere.<eos> In Colombia, we have a saying.<eos> Evil preys on the weak because it fears the strong.<eos> Guy in the black hoodie... that was him.<eos> We want him alive.<eos> Save all the fun till we're back at the base.<eos> This is exactly why we need the Accords.<eos> It's about protection.<eos> - Whose protection?<eos> - Everyone's.
Perhaps you should learn to embrace your desires so the two of us can finally be together.<eos> Did you lose something?<eos> I was wondering how long you could play out this little charade.<eos> Ah! You show up on my doorstep, and then my dagger goes missing?<eos> You must think me stupid not to suspect that your powers had emerged.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> An FBI agent moonlighting at the loony bin.<eos> I'm afraid both of you boys have some explaining to do down at the station.<eos> Who else have you brought to the asylum tonight?<eos> No one.
I just want to go over your statement, about last Friday night on the ferry.<eos> Friday night?<eos> I told you. I was in the bar.<eos> Until it closed, at midnight.<eos> - I need to know where were you AFTER that.<eos> - Why?<eos> If you could answer the question?<eos> At Puggie's.<eos> I was there all night, playing the fruit machines.<eos> All night?
Robbie Morton's.<eos> It was damaged and we're only getting numbers, not names on the call log.<eos> Trapped in here, he made a lot of 999 calls over the weekend.<eos> Those calls stop in the early hours this morning.<eos> Either that's when his phone battery died, or...<eos> Billy's going through the numbers, but what we do have is 36 calls in the last week from one number in particular, which we have traced.<eos> Craig Cooper.<eos> Right. OK.<eos> Thanks, Sandy.<eos> Help!
Michael Maguire's on the eight o'clock flight to Glasgow tomorrow morning.<eos> He's not booked a return.<eos> I've just had a word with one of the lasses at Beatson Estate agents.<eos> The lease on his flat's been terminated.<eos> He's not coming back, Rhona.<eos> There's a man here called Davy Neville, says he wants to talk to you about Michael Maguire.<eos> I was on the North Sea Princess last Friday night.<eos> - Well, Michael and me, we got to drinking at the bar -- bit of a laugh and a joke -- and about half 11, he came back to my cabin.<eos> We played cards.<eos> All night.
He's got connections to Glasgow.<eos> He knows the law and police procedure like the back of his hand.<eos> He's been in prison.<eos> He may well be violent.<eos> See, if he's gone after the people that are involved in this break-in, then that someone's in danger.<eos> Freya doesn't have any enemies.<eos> So, why would someone smash up her workshop?<eos> She's an angel.<eos> That's what I call her, my "angel".<eos> Not to her face.
- Same killer? - Mm-mm.<eos> - What about the girl... er, Leanne?<eos> - She's in a medically induced coma.<eos> They're keeping us posted.<eos> But this isn't just about us being kept in the dark historically,<eos> Rhona. We've got two murders and one near-fatal shooting and the chief suspect in which has got to be whoever Michael Thompson was going to testify against.<eos> Now, we can't be running into a wall of silence thrown up by some fiscal's office in Arbroath.<eos> - If they don't start co-operating with us...<eos> I hope this doesn't make things too difficult for you.<eos> Personally.
It's a huge area you've asked them to cover.<eos> Get back onto the co-ordinator.<eos> If they need more manpower, I'll see what I can do.<eos> Your phone's ringing.<eos> Hello?<eos> Erm, yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> His mum's away on a work trip.<eos> - Have you been in the wars, Logan?<eos> - Not for the first time.
Sandy, I telt Jimmy Perez already...<eos> I know what you said to Logan about me and his dad.<eos> Do you no' think Jenny's kids have got enough on their plates?<eos> I dunno what you're talking about.<eos> I never said nothing.<eos> "I never said nothing, I never did nothing, everybody's picking on me."<eos> How many times have we got to hear it?<eos> And how many times will you deny you were involved with Robbie Morton?<eos> Cos I know you were, and you're not getting rid of this one.<eos> - Not this time.
No, I was, er...<eos> I was thinking more minibar.<eos> Well, you wouldn't if you saw what was in it.<eos> It's supposed to be for a friend.<eos> I don't think he deserved it, anyway.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> We weren't straight with you today.<eos> My boss is too busy trying to cover his back.<eos> And mine.
You're a good friend.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> You're Greek for sure.<eos> So when are they gonna move you to rehab?<eos> I'm not going to rehab. I'm going home.<eos> I don't trust that Chink doctor or the girly man.<eos> I'm checking myself out of this hellhole today.<eos> You believe this shit, adelphe? Eight years I serve in the Marines, I walk away fine.<eos> I got these two kunas on the South Side of Chicago, I'm rolling out of here in a goddamn chair.<eos> - Who?
You better run, boy.<eos> And take Shaq with you.<eos> Go!<eos> - Ten, nine, eight...<eos> - I won't stop seeing you!<eos> - Dom, I won't stop seeing you!<eos> - ...seven, six five, four, three, two.<eos> Feel like I'm gonna throw up.<eos> - It's the hormones.<eos> - Not this time.
You know Ian used to wake up every morning, do 200 push-ups before going to school?<eos> Hard-core ROTC.<eos> Well, he wanted to be a soldier.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know, he thinks... being bipolar means he's doomed to be a piece of shit like our mother.<eos> Well, maybe it's true.<eos> Maybe it's not.<eos> Sing me a tiny little bit of that song.<eos> I'm saying please.<eos> - Never. - Aw.
There's nothing I have to offer Daisy that she wants or needs.<eos> - I know that now.<eos> - Is anyone gonna talk to her ... at least let her know we have Hive?<eos> That's not a great idea right now.<eos> We need to stick to the security protocols.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> - Should we stop him?<eos> - I don't think we can.<eos> We got him.<eos> - Hive. - Mhm.
Get away!<eos> - Daisy, it's okay. - No!<eos> Mnh!<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> I've only scratched the surface of the thumb drive that Radcliffe gave us, and I can already see that he was in way over his head.<eos> His enhancements rely on technology.<eos> These changes are pure bio.<eos> The Parasite in his formula actually attaches itself to strands of DNA.<eos> - We'll find a cure.<eos> - Possibly, in a decade or so.
Someone at the camping bod, they told me... about a walk.<eos> I caught the bus.<eos> He must have followed me.<eos> - Who?<eos> Michael? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Is that because he knew you'd smashed up his girlfriend's workshop?<eos> You weren't looking at him...<eos> Leanne, when you got off the bus, did you see anybody?<eos> No.<eos> No-one, no-one at all?
- Yeah?<eos> They've managed to clean up the message Michael left on Freya Galdie's answering machine.<eos> 'Freya, I wanted to commit to you.<eos> Too late now, Freya... '..<eos> Is there anything in there that you feel you recognise?<eos> No.<eos> He uses the word "burn".<eos> Could he be referring to anything that he might have given you, any documents or...?<eos> Birthday cards?<eos> One Valentine?
- Sandy?<eos> - 'Forensics came back on the tyre tracks.'<eos> We are looking for a small, two-wheel drive.<eos> Billy's checking for vehicle thefts and I've just done a trawl on the traffic reports.<eos> Now, the station at Brae is unmanned at night, but they had a phone message, left on the night of the shooting.<eos> A woman reporting an incident on the B9075 at Skellister.<eos> 'A close shave with some joker driving around at speed 'with one headlight out.'<eos> - I think that's worth following up.<eos> - 'Yeah.<eos> On my way.'
Kyle had suspected appendicitis.<eos> By the time they'd decided it wasn't, and we were away from the hospital, it was one o'clock in the morning.<eos> Idiot came out of nowhere, one headlight, can you believe?<eos> - On that stretch of road!<eos> - Did you see the driver?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I assume it was a man.<eos> But I didn't see.<eos> I couldnae honestly say.<eos> What about the car?
Just... words.<eos> Names.<eos> You know...<eos> The names women always get called.<eos> Do you know how far you drove?<eos> We could've been going in circles!<eos> I couldn't see.<eos> Right, when you got to the place inside... could you hear anything?<eos> Nothing like a road, or a railway, or planes...?<eos> - Myself!
Seriously!<eos> You cannot have the fairies calling you at work!<eos> Him?<eos> Him.<eos> A new identity, a new life?<eos> Never seeing my family or my friends again?<eos> Well, what kind of future is that?<eos> You could've said no.<eos> Where were you going to send him anyway?<eos> Canada.
Him?<eos> Him.<eos> A new identity, a new life?<eos> Never seeing my family or my friends again?<eos> Well, what kind of future is that?<eos> You could've said no.<eos> Where were you going to send him anyway?<eos> Canada.<eos> Montreal.<eos> Montreal? !
For a man who hated maple syrup and snow?<eos> Did Michael speak French?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Well, maybe he thought you could learn.<eos> - Oh, my God, the arrogance!<eos> He didn't take it for granted that you'd say yes.<eos> - He wa...<eos> He was scared.<eos> - I... Not him, YOU!
Well, then, why go to them in the first place?<eos> Kelly?<eos> I didn't have many choices back then.<eos> Needle or smoke.<eos> Tea or coffee.<eos> Who I said, "no" to.<eos> I said "no" to him and he broke my bones and he hurt me.<eos> What about Michael Thompson?<eos> He was good to me.<eos> Not just then but... for a long time after.
I could stay here, lie low.<eos> You've been a delight, darling.<eos> Now be a ghost.<eos> Your town car awaits.<eos> You watched me pack.<eos> No, I watched you fold clothes.<eos> Is that what you're gonna wear when you meet the princess?<eos> Don't concern yourself with my wardrobe, okay?<eos> You just get your head together so I don't have to worry about you anymore.<eos> Straight to the airport.
I'm sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> It's not... first-date material.<eos> No, please.<eos> I want to know.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> Reggie, we need to go tell Margot about this now.<eos> No, we need to get our story straight.<eos> Not our story, my story
Payton, listen to me.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> Agent Dao is in Los Angeles?<eos> We won't be going anywhere for a while.<eos> Well, we're gonna have to.<eos> The princess has decided she doesn't like L.A.<eos> I thought we'd follow her to New York, but if Dao is watching...<eos> - How long is she here?<eos> - Just overnight.
Danny: Mm, wherever it is, she doesn't plan to stay long.<eos> She has a staff meeting she confirmed via e-mail.<eos> Any other telltale e-mails?<eos> Nothing even remotely adultery-ish.<eos> So... is there any way that you want to talk about what's going on with you and Val?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> I did.<eos> For what?
[Cellphone beeps] Hello?<eos> Ben: You didn't like my present?<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> There are two very important things you need to know right now.<eos> First, that dress is amazing on you.<eos> Did I buy you that?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Are you here?<eos> Which brings me to the second thing you need to know.<eos> Just a sec.
- Really?<eos> - Where?<eos> - Hold still.<eos> It looks like I'm not the only one who kept secrets this year.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> So, who were they... the people shooting at us?<eos> You promised to tell me the truth.<eos> The Shives and the Gullahorns... two of the biggest crime syndicates in the country.<eos> And which one do you work for?<eos> Neither.
- Done.<eos> Why do you insist on giving away all our money?<eos> Did you not see the gun she left out in full view for maximum impact?<eos> You're going to have to tell the princess that you found a fleet of private jets for her to invest in or a château in San Simeon.<eos> She doesn't want any of that.<eos> She feels trapped by it all.<eos> And at the moment, I know how she feels.<eos> Then sell her that.<eos> Sell her what?<eos> Freedom.
She broke his heart? Mm.<eos> Oh, that's a publicist about the press launch.<eos> I'll just be a moment.<eos> Hello.<eos> You have to leave right now.<eos> You don't seem to understand, Michael.<eos> I have the power here.<eos> I can expose you to the princess.<eos> I can have you arrested.<eos> For what?
Well, we can't have that.<eos> Can we?<eos> We don't want to stick around to catch whoever did it?<eos> - That wasn't our assignment.<eos> - Plus, it's too dangerous.<eos> Even for you?<eos> Shawn?<eos> I see it!<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Aah! Oh, my G...
We won't be.<eos> But we'll stay close, recording the exchange in the van while the front man brokers the sale.<eos> Who do you have in mind?<eos> I thought we didn't like this guy.<eos> You know what they say. "Keep your friends close..."<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> They're here.<eos> Copy. I see them.<eos> Where's the man in charge?<eos> Money first.
They're just things.<eos> Well, you are a far better person than I am.<eos> There was a time in my life, perhaps even a week ago, where I thought buying all this would make me happy.<eos> Then I met you.<eos> And... now it has.<eos> This is just super-weird.<eos> I'm looking at my own tombstone.<eos> Am I making a huge mistake?<eos> You're getting a whole new life as Alison Aykle, Peace Corps volunteer.<eos> And if at any point
I don't think that Margot and Felicity would like that very much.<eos> Alas, poor Felicity is... on her way to India.<eos> And Margot says that you two are on your way to Miami.<eos> - Miami?<eos> - Yeah, didn't she tell you?<eos> Apparently, you're meeting up with somebody called Reggie.<eos> - Rhys, you know who Reggie is.<eos> - Do I? My partner?<eos> The point is everyone's leaving me.<eos> And in my hour of need.
That's every hour with you.<eos> Don't be mean.<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> There's a job.<eos> Ridiculous money.<eos> But it would mean me keeping you here in Los Angeles for a while.<eos> How would you feel about that?<eos> How does one man operating on his own outsmart us and Interpol and the FBI for three years across two continents?<eos> You think he's working with others?<eos> - Or for others.
Population 6,207.<eos> Did you... ever run away from home?<eos> No, that would require having a home to run away from.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You're blinking.<eos> Why would he destroy and hide his own phone?<eos> Joey really doesn't want to be found.<eos> What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> That.
See you tonight.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> I am glad to see you're not ring-rusty.<eos> On a gaming con?<eos> I'm offended it took you this long to call me in.<eos> I was convinced it was a three-person endeavor.<eos> It turns out I needed four.<eos> Who's the fourth?<eos> - You remember my brother?<eos> - No way!
That bastard was never drunk.<eos> Care to explain why you're not sleeping one off for once in your life?<eos> Early breakfast with a new friend...<eos> Mr. Graham Weatherby.<eos> You just had breakfast with the man who owns this hotel?<eos> And 45 others just like it.<eos> Although Graham is now just a co-owner... with me.<eos> You are now looking at the proud new co-owner of every Weatherby hotel in the country.<eos> And I have you to thank...<eos> Me?
Oh. I know Larry Sauls.<eos> Want me to call him and tell him to hire you?<eos> Would he listen?<eos> You'd do that?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I'd be happy to.<eos> Cheers.<eos> So happy to meet you.<eos> Maybe we can have dinner.<eos> Sometime soon?
What is this? The bank statement.<eos> Last month, you withdrew $4 million for the Tokyo penthouse.<eos> And the contract price was $2 million. Where did you get these?<eos> Yesterday, you withdrew $16 million for the Towers when the holding fee was $10 million.<eos> I can explain this, Princess.<eos> You can explain it to my brothers, who will meet you at the airport tomorrow when you return home.<eos> This is him. He is trying to discredit me.<eos> He is not even who he claims to be.<eos> Look at me, Qasim, not at him.<eos> Me.
Why is every crook in town after it?<eos> 'Cause it's worth a bloody fortune.<eos> Well, you already have a fortune.<eos> Several, including mine.<eos> - Now, now.<eos> - Ben's right.<eos> You didn't fly all the way from London for a piece of jewelry.<eos> What's it really?<eos> All right.<eos> - The truth? - Mm-hmm.
- You are not!<eos> - What?<eos> - It's true.<eos> - Since when do you listen to Mum?<eos> How can you not?<eos> She bangs on and on.<eos> - The woman never shuts up.<eos> - About what?<eos> About you.<eos> About us.
It's good to know for next time.<eos> There's not gonna be a next time.<eos> Now, you say that now...<eos> Is he here?<eos> Did you find Christopher?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> But we did find this.<eos> Hmm. We'll catch him next time.<eos> Here's to freedom.<eos> And to family.
Now, you say that now...<eos> Is he here?<eos> Did you find Christopher?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> But we did find this.<eos> Hmm. We'll catch him next time.<eos> Here's to freedom.<eos> And to family.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> To our Benefactor.
Is he here?<eos> Did you find Christopher?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> But we did find this.<eos> Hmm. We'll catch him next time.<eos> Here's to freedom.<eos> And to family.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> To our Benefactor.<eos> Former Benefactor.
I know all about you and Alice Vaughan.<eos> I suggest you stay loyal.<eos> You asked me to choose.<eos> I choose you.<eos> You're working with Dao?<eos> I am.<eos> As a C.I.... a confidential informant against Rhys Griffiths.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Rhys knows about you.<eos> About us.
You're working with Dao?<eos> I am.<eos> As a C.I.... a confidential informant against Rhys Griffiths.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Rhys knows about you.<eos> About us.<eos> He's been surveilling you, taking pictures.<eos> We'll get you out of here.<eos> No.<eos> Someplace safe.
We can't really speak about it.<eos> Thank you for trying to help, but I have people coming from all over the world.<eos> I have a Cardinal from Rome.<eos> And it's not the two of you.<eos> I love my gays.<eos> I was hoping maybe Morgan would be gay...<eos> No offense, Stephanie.<eos> But I can't just turn my son's wedding over to...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Who's wedding?
He's a person of interest in Interpol's ongoing investigation of the Kensington Firm.<eos> He arrived in Los Angeles 10 days ago.<eos> What do we know about him?<eos> The heir to a textile fortune.<eos> He runs a massive import/export business.<eos> Which would make a perfect front for the Kensington Firm.<eos> You never looked into this guy?<eos> I wasn't investigating the Kensington Firm.<eos> I was investigating Christopher Hall<eos> - for theft, fraud...
How do you know Greta Keller?<eos> - Who is Greta Keller?<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> Greta Keller was a kind of proto-Marlene Dietrich, you know, musically.<eos> Wow, I thought you were just a pop guy.<eos> I am.<eos> Rodgers and Hart is pop.<eos> It doesn't get much better than that.<eos> So, after he left you, after he took your money and disappeared, when was the next time that you saw him?<eos> The next day.
- The dog.<eos> You know how people are about their animals.<eos> - You remember Whiskers.<eos> - Oh, Whiskers.<eos> - I used to love Whiskers.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So, all you have to do is get Paul McCartney and hold him hostage and lock him up until she caves on her other demands, which she will.<eos> You are good, aren't you?<eos> Does this mean you're gonna come back to work?<eos> - For you?
- Leah Wells, are you in there?<eos> There's no adjoining room.<eos> FBI.<eos> Open up.<eos> Rhys.<eos> Rhys, put the gun away.<eos> FBI.<eos> Open this door.<eos> Can you open the door?<eos> Behind me.
! - Rhys.<eos> - We have very few details right now, but the victim has been identified as Jordan Hamlin, L.A.'s alleged crime kingpin.<eos> Local authorities have yet to identify key suspects in the homicide, but we are just getting word that it was Hamlin being<eos> - transported...<eos> - Margot.<eos> From the courthouse back to his holding cell - after today's hearing.<eos> You thieving bitch!<eos> You never learn.<eos> The most important thing is to know your mark.<eos> Exactly... my mark!
I mean, I've always thought you were cute, but last night you were...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> Like, Fifty Shades of amazing?<eos> Like, Pon farr amazing.<eos> I love it when you speak Vulcan.<eos> - Holy crap.<eos> - Simon... can I ask you something?<eos> Uh... sure.<eos> About us.
I don't know.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> Like, Fifty Shades of amazing?<eos> Like, Pon farr amazing.<eos> I love it when you speak Vulcan.<eos> - Holy crap.<eos> - Simon... can I ask you something?<eos> Uh... sure.<eos> About us.<eos> Us?
Really?<eos> - And you can?<eos> - I know who I am.<eos> I'm a guy who's about to be disowned when Dad finds out that Jace and Clary are still out doing God knows what.<eos> I think Dad's used to that by now.<eos> This is Jace you're talking about.<eos> He said he'd be an hour.<eos> It's been three.<eos> You don't think he and Clary are...<eos> At a time like this?
- Right.<eos> How exactly are we gonna get them?<eos> I doubt we can make it out of this closet without drawing attention, let alone Luke's desk and you are covered in runes.<eos> Don't worry. I've got a plan.<eos> - A good plan this time?<eos> - 90%.<eos> Just follow my lead.<eos> Oh, and I apologize.<eos> Apologize for what?<eos> The other 10%.
Okay, but he's not in his right mind.<eos> Well, if you want involuntary commitment, that's a six-week process, and that involves a court hearing and two signatures from family members, unless he's dangerous.<eos> Then I can... I can expedite something.<eos> I see.<eos> Norma, is he... is he dangerous?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Um, it'll be fine.<eos> I'm just gonna get him to sign the papers.<eos> Okay, when are they sending it?<eos> Uh, well, anytime.
You anticipated my move and had the foresight to stash the contract at a secure off-site location.<eos> Which begs the question, why did you bring it home?<eos> Well, I went to check on it, and contrary to what I'd been assured, Snot did not have a proper file cabinet.<eos> Where was it?<eos> Like, on his desk or something?<eos> Yeah, with... Other crap all over the place.<eos> Yes.<eos> And it's not like something was for sure going to happen to it. - It's just...<eos> - There's a right way to do things.<eos> - Exactly.
Isn't it?<eos> No, Alicia, it's not the Rapture.<eos> Something is off here.<eos> Everything's off.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> Hey, where you going?<eos> I got chores.<eos> You can help, you want to.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Maintenance.
The prefects of the various congregations are of course eager to see you with their own eyes.<eos> But I imagine that you would like to deal with this matter... later?<eos> No, now.<eos> First off, I want to meet the Prefect for the Congregation for the Clergy.<eos> At any rate, Holy Father, I understand your reluctance about the encyclical.<eos> Your predecessor always made me laugh when he said that... an encyclical is like Proust's "In Search of Lost Time".<eos> "Everyone quotes it, but no one reads it."<eos> Are you sleeping, Holy Father?<eos> No Your Eminence, I'm praying.<eos> For you.
Half of a duplex, with a private swimming pool.<eos> Come on now, tell me people's sins.<eos> Well... have I already told you about Voiello's impure thoughts about the Venus of Willendorf?<eos> Yes, yes you told me already.<eos> What else?<eos> No, nothing...<eos> Cardinal Aguirre did an imitation of you today, Your Holiness.<eos> - Everyone laughed.<eos> - Did you laugh?<eos> Yes, but to myself.
We'll set him free in the gardens.<eos> Do you intend to follow me even in my more private moments?<eos> I wasn't following you.<eos> I too enjoy communing with nature.<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> Just one day, and we've already discovered we have something in common.<eos> - Don't be funny with me.<eos> - I've never been more serious.<eos> And worried.<eos> About the Pope.
- They could be anywhere, Lenny.<eos> - I search everywhere, I pray everywhere.<eos> But I don't see God.<eos> Because I don't see my father. Because I don't see my mother.<eos> I, on the other hand, see everything.<eos> - What do you see?<eos> - God's plan. A complex architecture that depends on you, Your Holiness.<eos> Everything is so clear.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> No one.
I love myself more than my neighbor, more than God,<eos> I believe only in myself, I am the lord omnipotent:<eos> Lenny, you have illumined yourself!<eos> Fuck!<eos> We had a deal, Angelo!<eos> Me pope, you reconfirmed the Secretary of State.<eos> The perfect balance.<eos> But then you broke our agreement.<eos> You pulled that kid out of the hat.<eos> My own student.
We have a young Pope.<eos> Have you been reading the paper? !<eos> They're all asking, "what is the Cardinal Secretary of State doing?"<eos> I know what to do.<eos> What we need... is a dramatic gesture..<eos> Voiello, you need to hand in your resignation today.<eos> Excellent!<eos> That's what you'll do, Voiello.<eos> It's a genuine miracle that this assembly generated an idea.<eos> A first-rate idea.
Priorities?<eos> Your speech to our brother cardinals.<eos> In due time.<eos> Anything else?<eos> The Kurtwell case, Holy Father.<eos> The big hot potato.<eos> Exactly, Holy Father.<eos> Your predecessor didn't have time to put someone in charge of this delicate matter.<eos> But I will.<eos> In due time.
Cut it out.<eos> May God help us!<eos> You want to make the world pay for the wrong it did you.<eos> You'll be a terrible Pope, the worst and the most dangerous in modern times, and I don't intend to waste the few years I have remaining being an accomplice to a vindictive little boy.<eos> You are drunk.<eos> No.<eos> Not enough.<eos> I know that woman.<eos> That's Esther, the wife of Peter.<eos> A Swiss Guard.
Holy Father, I brought you a gift to improve our relationship a little.<eos> Thanks.<eos> These are supposed to be worse than real cigarettes.<eos> I was told that they're good for you.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's a substitute for the real thing.<eos> What I want, always, is the whole truth.<eos> Then you've come to the wrong place.<eos> Holy Father, don't call me repetitive, but when is your speech to the cardinals going to take place?<eos> - In due time.
Would you have blackmailed the Holy Father?<eos> Would you have gone so far as to give those pictures to the press, to insinuate a nonexistent sexual relationship between me and that young woman?<eos> You haven't figured out that your old methods only work on the old popes, who were afraid of losing consensus.<eos> They don't work with me.<eos> I am the young pope.<eos> I put no stock in consensus.<eos> Who told...<eos> Who told you all these things?<eos> You put on airs as a politician, you still haven't figured out you've run up against a politician far cannier than you.<eos> Me.
How could we let this happen?<eos> Such a key game...<eos> wasted like this!<eos> What the hell?<eos> !<eos> What kind of Naples' team is this?<eos> How can you possibly play such a crucial game this way?<eos> We let them overtake us like this!<eos> We let them overtake us like this!<eos> For the second time!
Are you depressed or suffering from amnesia, Michael?<eos> Before Pius XIII the Church was taking care of the poor.<eos> It was "also" taking care of the poor.<eos> But there's a bigger question.<eos> What is the Church doing on a more general basis?<eos> It's not doing anything anymore.<eos> It's killing time.<eos> We have a Church that's just killing time and has become infinitely marginal.<eos> That's exactly what the Pope wants: a marginal Church.<eos> Small and dead.
An opening.<eos> What do you mean by an opening?<eos> A speech about love and a pastoral voyage.<eos> I don't like to travel and you know perfectly well that I don't like to be seen.<eos> I never said that you have to let yourself be seen.<eos> As for traveling:<eos> everyone dislikes traveling until they actually go on a trip.<eos> Then they like it, don't they?<eos> Where are you thinking of dragging me?<eos> To Africa.
Hilal...<eos> I don't know.<eos> "For the LED 6500 series and higher"<eos> "make sure the HDMI cable is 14 mm thick, or less."<eos> "The energy-saving technology turns the TV off after four hours of no use."<eos> "See 'Automatic Standby' under 'Time Settings' for more information."<eos> There's no button.<eos> Ifs on the side.<eos> -"Turn on the power using the..." - Wait.<eos> Which one'?
But thank you.<eos> - Another load's in.<eos> - Mrs. Romero.<eos> - Oh, uh, yes.<eos> - We found this over by the dirt.<eos> Thought maybe you lost it.<eos> Is it yours?<eos> - I was wondering where this went.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - No problem.
- You don't need to whisper.<eos> There are no secrets here at Pineview.<eos> - All I want for you is for you to get better and get the help that you need.<eos> - I need?<eos> So I'm the only one that needs help, really, Mother?<eos> We're still playing that game?<eos> - Norman, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The only reason that you are here is because I don't know how to help you.<eos> - Well, I can't help anyone because I can't tell anyone the truth.<eos> - What truth?
Because I would have forgiven you then... just like I'm forgiving you now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> I don't know why this is so hard.<eos> I barely even know her.<eos> The facial recognition software at S.T.A.R. Labs didn't find anything either.<eos> No, but there's still more databases to check.<eos> We'll find his doppelganger.<eos> - Thanks, Barry.<eos> - Yeah.
I never meant to turn against you.<eos> - I never ...<eos> - I know.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> You weren't yourself.<eos> I am now.<eos> You never came to see me in my cell.<eos> I knew what you were going through and that you needed time to put yourself back together.<eos> D-Did I ruin this?<eos> Us?
you can't do this.<eos> Not like this.<eos> I can't just ...<eos> I can't just say goodbye.<eos> I ... I have too much I want to say.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Come to think of it, I just did.<eos> I mean, I tried, and we didn't even realize it.<eos> Realize what?<eos> A moment ago.
You changed.<eos> Yeah, I couldn't wait to get back in jeans.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> I have to go back to our apartment.<eos> Why?<eos> Because when we were unexpectedly picked up by a time ship, I was not carrying the ATOM suit.<eos> And not for nothing, but we spent the last two years together in that apartment.<eos> Is there anything you want me to pick up for you?<eos> Your favorite coffee mug?<eos> Our lucky water vase?

But your soul is divided by your ability to kill and your desire to show mercy.<eos> And there is no place for one so conflicted within the League.<eos> Ta-er al-Sahfer,<eos> I release you.<eos> You can reclaim your previous name and your past life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> In October 2008, please see that your daughter is off the coast of an island in the North China Sea...<eos> Lian Yu.<eos> Why would I send Talia on such a journey?<eos> Not Talia.
- Meeting Cosimo's friends !<eos> All for this sweet deal here...<eos> From that point ofview, Lucilla wasn't worried.<eos> - Lucky her.<eos> - That's why she has a fever !<eos> - I changed outfits 10 times that day.<eos> But apparently it went well, I feel like one of the gang now.<eos> - Who, you ?<eos> - One of the gang ?<eos> No way !
- What kind ?<eos> Well... every night at 10:00 a friend of mine...<eos> - She sends me...<eos> - A goodnight kiss ?<eos> Sort of.<eos> She sends me a photo.<eos> - She sends you a photo !<eos> - A photo.<eos> What kind of photo ?<eos> A photo of herself.
- Are you sure ? - Huh ?<eos> - Are we sure ?<eos> - Don't bust my balls.<eos> Why didn't you tell me ?<eos> - What ?<eos> - That you're in therapy.<eos> Why didn't you tell me ?<eos> - I haven't been going long.<eos> - How long ?<eos> About six months.
Especially if they got dumped.<eos> That's right.<eos> Bianca ?<eos> Bianca ?<eos> - Who broke it off ?<eos> - Me.<eos> Come on, take this photo.<eos> He's harmless, but it's the principle...<eos> Smile !<eos> One, two...
- You don'tjust call someone a jerk.<eos> In fact he's an oaf, he's bad-mannered.<eos> Would this oaf happened to be named Lucia ?<eos> - Don't be silly !<eos> - Such a cheeky co-worker.<eos> He's calling you.<eos> Answer it, then we'll know more.<eos> We'll find out why he's so angry.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Okay, on speaker, right ?
Sorry to keep you, Inspector.<eos> Business to attend to.<eos> How well do you know your workforce?<eos> Inside and out.<eos> Most of them had dads or grandads who were coopers here before them.<eos> You must get the occasional "bad apple"?<eos> They play up, they're out.<eos> Any recently?<eos> Well, one, yeah.<eos> Owen Brunt.
You do believe me?<eos> Why do you not tell Inspector Mallory you have an alibi?<eos> Better to be called an adulteress than a murderer.<eos> There has to be another way to prove it wasn't me.<eos> What if there isn't?<eos> I can't believe that you would rather hang than tell Inspector Mallory that you were with Sid.<eos> It mustn't come to that.<eos> Please.<eos> Harry wouldn't forgive me.<eos> Not for a second time.

That's not true.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking.<eos> Now Harry's gone...<eos> Oh, Sid.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Too many bad memories.<eos> Please stay.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm going to America.<eos> America?
Hide.<eos> During the day we keep the door of our hut tightly closed.<eos> And refrain from the slightest noise, lest anyone passing outside may hear it.<eos> Only the dark makes it safe for us to go down into the village.<eos> And administer to the faithful.<eos> Finally, they had priests to forgive their sins.<eos> Bless me Padre, for I have sinned.<eos> - Confession.<eos> - I have sinned!<eos> One more time?

Padre Ferreira?<eos> - Yes, do you know him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You've seen him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When?<eos> He made a praise for infant.<eos> - Baby.<eos> - Infant.<eos> And sick.
But it was from Kichijiro that I felt the greatest need.<eos> - You did not take the rosary.<eos> - I did not deserve it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you denied God?<eos> Yes.<eos> But only to live.<eos> My whole family, the Inquisitor wanted us to give up our faith.<eos> Stomp on Jesus with our foot.<eos> Just once, just (? ).
I thought something was wrong.<eos> But never mind, there is a stream nearby.<eos> You can drink as much as you like.<eos> Here.<eos> Padre!<eos> Forgive me!<eos> Padre!<eos> I pray for God's forgiveness!<eos> Will he forgive?<eos> Even me?
When will Inoue Sama be here?<eos> Oh!<eos> He's not coming today.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> He treats me kindly.<eos> Three meals a day.<eos> So that my body will betray my heart.<eos> It's your plan, isn't it?<eos> That's what you're waiting for.<eos> - Not at all!
What is it, Padre?<eos> The incense?<eos> The smell of meat?<eos> Have you had any meat, since you came to Japan?<eos> I don't much like the smell myself.<eos> Have you guessed yet?<eos> Have you guessed who's coming?<eos> This is Inoue Sama's command.<eos> And the others wish.<eos> The other?
And all of this.<eos> Though I've got our Alison and the kids at the flat.<eos> Tony trouble.<eos> You should see the state of the place.<eos> Got weeping angels and wooden ducks everywhere, which she's bought me as a thanks.<eos> The flat reeks of air freshener.<eos> She's got six different stinks.<eos> Woke up the other day, thought I'd been embalmed.<eos> So, when DID you get back?<eos> Er... Thursday.
Same colour, same logo.<eos> Great.<eos> We need to get Wendy to take a look at them.<eos> Mum's at the station picking up Taisie.<eos> She's asking if I want to pop down.<eos> Like it's mother-and-daughter day.<eos> Probably brought her selfie stick.<eos> Makes a nice change having your family arrested instead of mine.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> - My job.
Come on, Sizz, get the (BLEEP) off him.<eos> Ain't he a little too old for this kind of thing?<eos> Are you out of your (BLEEP) mind? You know what Harbaugh's gonna say to you?<eos> Hoo-hoo-hoo! That was way better than talking about derivatives.<eos> Fucking Sizzle.<eos> Oh, God damn it, I'm jacked up right now.<eos> Is this what the adrenaline thing is like?<eos> Man, I feel like getting hammered right now.<eos> Motherfuck me!<eos> Yeah, yeah, fucking fantastic, Joe.
- Hell, yeah.<eos> - All right, good man.<eos> There's a logo on there.<eos> There you go. Jackie and Tamika.<eos> Great meeting you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hey, stay away from football players.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, baby. Hey.<eos> One second.
Those people were coming after you.<eos> And if they find you, they're gonna torture you, and then they're gonna kill you.<eos> You want to stay alive?<eos> Then today I don't work for you. You work for me, got it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you... for saving me.<eos> - Just keep moving.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Someplace safe.
- Helena Goldwyn.<eos> She has the power to make this whole Charlie thing happen.<eos> How do we know you're not just saying this to get what you want?<eos> Come on, Katie, give me a little credit.<eos> This is family.<eos> I wouldn't lie about something like that.<eos> I promise you, I'm on your side, and I want to see this happen just as much...<eos> All right, okay, that's probably impossible, but I really want to help you get him back.<eos> I just need to make it out of this little predicament if I'm going to keep that ball rolling.<eos> In the bathroom.
He gave in to the pleas of the town elders, who couldn't bear to see their capital city destroyed.<eos> How'd that work out for them?<eos> Caesar took Avaricum for his own and slaughtered all of its inhabitants.<eos> The graveyards of history are littered with merciful men.<eos> As I recall, Caesar's dead too.<eos> War is about making hard choices.<eos> - I understand hard choices.<eos> - Then do the math.<eos> Since Katie joined us, we've lost our armory, our chance at Snyder...<eos> And most of our cell.
Zero degrees latitude, coming in from the east, it'd be Gabon, Congo at Makoua.<eos> Hey, for a bloke who's never travelled past Map 44, your geography's not bad.<eos> A pet is just what Jack needs.<eos> It's a fairly big pet, Harry.<eos> Who invited you to the picnic, Tregear?<eos> Heard the call on the radio.<eos> Thought you might need a hand.<eos> What, drove in from home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> On your night off?
It now belongs to the bank.<eos> What's the frog called?<eos> Anura rossomontana.<eos> Okay...<eos> Man! I can't see you!<eos> Are you in a tank?<eos> I'm behind the barn.<eos> In a pinch, go to the last safe spot.<eos> You going to the party?<eos> What party?
- I'm trying!<eos> Put the pedal to the metal, dude!<eos> Loose him!<eos> Drive! Drive!<eos> Go, Tschick!<eos> Lost him! Yeah! - Gimme five!<eos> We showed them!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We've got to get the Lada off the roads for a couple of days.<eos> Dude, Transformers!
Got anything to eat?<eos> - Do we look like we do?<eos> You look like retards!<eos> You're repeating yourself.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> There's blackberries back there.<eos> I thought you were queer.<eos> Because of the lipstick.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Wallachia.
Didn't you ever steal gas in Russia?<eos> No, I didn't, you racist.<eos> Why didn't it work for us?<eos> This has to be below the water level.<eos> Oh, below the water level.<eos> - Right.<eos> What water level?<eos> - Ask her.<eos> My name's Isa.<eos> - Good for you.
The Crescent wolves...<eos> They found Aurora.<eos> Lucien.<eos> Hello, gentlemen.<eos> I had planned on taking a different head tonight, but yours will do just fine.<eos> I am getting so tired of having that vile weapon pointed at me.<eos> Creator destroyed by his own creation.<eos> I suppose there's a certain poetry to that, wouldn't you say, Niklaus?<eos> Get...<eos> Klaus... out of here.
Elijah.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> Marcel has paid us a visit.<eos> The last remaining white oak in the world.<eos> Right here.<eos> Sister, if you would be so kind.<eos> No!<eos> Brother!<eos> Little witch has condemned me.<eos> To this.
I couldn't have been more safe.<eos> And now my sire link is undone, and those very foes will come for me like never before.<eos> It's only been a few days since the link was broken.<eos> Must you jump into crippling paranoia already?<eos> It's a default setting.<eos> And with good reason.<eos> Well, Niklaus, if it offers you any solace whatsoever, we've ransacked Aya's belongings, torched Aurora's hunting ground, and obliterated every last splinter of the white oak.<eos> I would be mad to believe that.<eos> Perhaps you should see a therapist.<eos> Every last splinter?
So the Strix have their own personal coven?<eos> I'll make certain you're granted the power to bring back your precious Kol.<eos> In exchange, you will become one of my sisters and find the weapon that can kill an Original.<eos> With the right witches, the correct spell, the precise binding agent, there is a means to eradicate our link to our sires.<eos> Davina is obstinate, but she will listen to you.<eos> You know what I've come for. Hand it over.<eos> With the weapon in the Aurora's hands...<eos> I wonder which one of us she'll kill first.<eos> What animal do you aim to hunt with bullets made of wood?<eos> A monster.
It's not his fault that Cami is waving the White Oak around like a kite, or that Aurora made a deal with one of your witches.<eos> Oh, yeah, it is.<eos> Quite capable of defending myself, thank you, Freya.<eos> What I cannot do is cast a spell to find Aurora.<eos> In that respect, we're alike.<eos> Aurora is cloaked, most likely by the very witch she killed.<eos> I have been working non-stop every day...<eos> Well, you've stopped now. Haven't you?<eos> Well, go on.<eos> On your way.
If you want the spell.<eos> Tread carefully, Davina Claire.<eos> Every negotiation has a moment where the lesser party must submit.<eos> You are very quickly approaching yours.<eos> Let the sisters help me resurrect Kol.<eos> He'll give us the missing ingredient, I promise.<eos> If not, you may never find it.<eos> I assume you know what this is. It's a Hand of Glory.<eos> A mystic candle, when lit, it will let me open any window.<eos> Even one to the afterworld.
If Marcel hadn't seen the possibilities, someone would've bulldozed it and turned it into some generic chain store.<eos> It's still a church.<eos> But it's also something more.<eos> I'm a hybrid, but I'm also a mom.<eos> And a widow.<eos> And an Alpha.<eos> You are a psychologist.<eos> And a bartender.<eos> And, yes, you have some insane family legacy that comes with a bunch of cool toys, but... if you don't embrace the fact that you're also a vampire now, you're gonna end up dead.<eos> For real, this time.
What happened to Davina, cannot go unanswered.<eos> Same stuff that made Lucien.<eos> I extracted it from Aurora's heart.<eos> New Orleans is our home, Marcel, and it's time we took it back.<eos> Say not in grief, that she is no more, but be thankful that she ever was... and though she was taken far too soon, may her enduring light show us a way through this darkness.<eos> Let us mourn... because we cannot move on until we do... and though the pain may at times seem like more than we can bear... make no mistake... we will move on.<eos> Yeah, even now the words of Ecclesiasticus are ringing in my ears.<eos> They're saying, "Vengeance,<eos> "as a lion, shall lie in wait for them."<eos> A while ago... forever ago,
It might just be that the truth is a curse, man.<eos> Maybe you should be more careful what you wish for.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to Cami?<eos> She died, and there was nothing that could be done to stop it, and that's it.<eos> People don't just die.<eos> They get sick, or they get into an accident, or somebody kills them.<eos> And all those things leave a trail.<eos> And hospital records, ambulance dispatches, somebody calls 911.<eos> But not this time.
Really?<eos> Hemlock?<eos> Old school.<eos> Respect.<eos> Give it to me now.<eos> I won't ask you again, Marcellus.<eos> My name... is Marcel.<eos> And I'm not giving you a damn thing.<eos> I can't allow you the means to destroy my family.<eos> Your family.
It doesn't matter what she wanted!<eos> She's gone.<eos> There's no time to sing dirges.<eos> We're at war.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good news, Freya, I think I found a spell that'll draw together all the serum that Aurora took.<eos> Now, it's gonna take a little while, but if I can concentrate it in her heart, we can extract it with this... destroy it, and make sure we ain't got no more of these<eos> - unkillable monsters on our hands. - Good.<eos> In the meantime,
The Ancestors hate me because of choices that I made.<eos> I'm not a kid.<eos> I'm not your responsibility.<eos> Honey, you will always be my responsibility.<eos> What were you supposed to do?<eos> Lock me in an attic and keep the world at bay forever?<eos> You didn't let me down.<eos> I just grew up.<eos> Thank you for saving me that first time.<eos> And for everything else after.
Oh, wow.<eos> A queen and a king, caught by a one time pawn.<eos> Thus the game comes to its inevitable end.<eos> What are proving by killing her?<eos> It's me you hate.<eos> Was I not clear when I murdered Finn and Camille?<eos> I don't care who dies.<eos> But since you do, indulge me.<eos> And I just might spare the mother of your child.<eos> Kneel.
Oh, come now, my darling sister.<eos> The Strix are the show.<eos> Well, the first act.<eos> Act two, Lucien's buried beneath 1,000 tons of cement.<eos> Act three... spoiler alert... you're a parking lot.<eos> Oh, even after 1,000 years, you've never managed to curb your hubris.<eos> You still wander through a smog of your own self-importance.<eos> I can kill anything.<eos> Even them.<eos> Even you.
Then I should probably get going.<eos> Matty, wait.<eos> I don't know why you and Jenna are giving each other the silent treatment.<eos> I mean, I get that breakups can be terrible, but yours just seemed, well, sad.<eos> Listen, uh, what Jenna told you about our breakup, that's not exactly how it went down.<eos> Oh, my God, did someone cheat?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did Jenna get pregnant?<eos> No, no, it was because I wanted to transfer to Wycoff, and Jenna said no.<eos> Wycoff?
- No.<eos> Tell her I don't get paid, I'm coming back tomorrow, dragging her by her hair out to the corner.<eos> I want my money.<eos> Who was that?<eos> It was nobody.<eos> It was just a neighbor.<eos> Why don't you get your stuff out of the truck?<eos> God damn it!<eos> I'm gone for an hour, and...<eos> Son of a...
There's about 40-second delay, so we should be fine.<eos> Wow, I sure would step over you if I saw you in the gutter.<eos> Hope that means you slept well, baby.<eos> How about those sheets, huh?<eos> 500 thread count.<eos> Just tell her you noticed.<eos> They're great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Only the best for my boys.<eos> Son of a bitch.
- Farrells.<eos> - Oh, the Farrells, of course.<eos> - I'll bring them in for you.<eos> Do you want the fat ones or the thin ones?<eos> You scared of 'em, Wade?<eos> Is that why you're making a joke?<eos> How dare you come here on this day?<eos> Hey, look, I'm sorry about your son, Foster.<eos> He be dead 'cause of you.<eos> You.
I-I heard stories about this, but no one ever seen it before.<eos> - It's beautiful, man.<eos> - Thank you, Butch.<eos> Um, me and my cousin...<eos> We, uh... we make it together.<eos> I can't tell you how, though.<eos> That's a secret.<eos> But we only make two batches a year, so...<eos> How much?<eos> $1,000 a jug.
There's demons afoot.<eos> Asa.<eos> We got somethin' to show you.<eos> My boy shot this out of the sky.<eos> G'winveer said that you might know what it be.<eos> Well, they can program these things to fly up here and take pictures.<eos> It's called a drone.<eos> Pic... pictures?<eos> Of what?<eos> Us.
I Ain't putting my neck out for you no more.<eos> I am sick of carrying you, ever since Andi-Rae died, and that was five years ago, Wade.<eos> Get over it!<eos> Get right with this shit!<eos> You be sober tomorrow, because I am gonna take you by the hand and lead you up that hill, and we are finding that tractor and we are going to the state and gettin' this done.<eos> Then you be ready to have a discussion about your future with the department.<eos> Because this shit... Is over.<eos> What is it, fa?<eos> I got a shit feeling about this.<eos> About what?
I-I can't help you, fa.<eos> I just need one thing.<eos> How many of y'all are up there?<eos> 60?<eos> More?<eos> It's not the number that matters.<eos> What matters?<eos> What we believe in.<eos> Which is?<eos> Our freedom.
I can tell you, we will be doin' a full investigation.<eos> Well, how the hell did he end up in West Virginia, anyway?<eos> How would I know that?<eos> You know something?<eos> You live for a while without tv and video games and all these distractions, you're not numbed out all the time.<eos> You learn how to listen to the quality of a person's voice, read their face.<eos> What I'm trying to say is, Wade, I know you're lying to me.<eos> My daddy...<eos> You know, he worked for the coal company.<eos> Not this one.
Hey there, fellas!<eos> When I made you all my sentry wards, I said I want my best men for the job.<eos> Did I get my best men?<eos> No.<eos> I got boys who are playin'!<eos> Well, I don't need boys playin'.<eos> Well, Foster, we was just having a little fun and... aah!<eos> Now...<eos> Maybe you'll remember when I tell you something.<eos> Anybody...
Well, Foster, we was just having a little fun and... aah!<eos> Now...<eos> Maybe you'll remember when I tell you something.<eos> Anybody...<eos> Anybody come up here that might have fire on them... and I don't want you thinkin'!<eos> I want you shootin'!<eos> You understand me?<eos> That sounds like a "yes" to me.<eos> Am I ever gonna walk again?<eos> Yes, just not for a few days.
All you would have to do is spread the word between you and your kin up on your hill.<eos> Word about what?<eos> Oh, we're building 20 condos, just like this one.<eos> Just for you and your family.<eos> And each one would be 100% free to any family of four or more that wants to move in.<eos> How much is it gonna pay?<eos> Well, you would get the place to live.<eos> Lady, I already got me a place to live.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about a starting salary of $200 a week?
It's a search, Dolan.<eos> Doesn't work if we walk together.<eos> Got it.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, my sweet lovin' Jesus.<eos> Where you been, boy?<eos> I told you I'll be back in a day or two to check on you.<eos> You have no idea what's been going on around here.<eos> I sold out the first day.<eos> Every jar.
You gotta think about your family.<eos> Next time I see you, we're gonna take this badge off and we're gonna see how things end up for you.<eos> Over here, amigo.<eos> Where'd you get bail money?<eos> The guys for sure didn't have it, so I went to see your boss, that miss Grimes girl.<eos> - You seen Pat or Jake?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I wanted to go up there with them, but they wouldn't let me.<eos> Where?<eos> Up on Shay?
A while ago.<eos> They'll be up there pretty soon.<eos> Hey, hey, we'll never catch up to them.<eos> Hey! Hey, you be careful!<eos> That's my mother's truck!<eos> You really think this belongs to the Farrells?<eos> Don't seem high enough.<eos> But we come all this way, I'm torching something.<eos> Yeah, let's send 'em a message.<eos> Sacred land, my ass.
- Asa, you can't stop this. Okay?<eos> You can't.<eos> Now, y'all listen to me.<eos> There are trying times ahead and we need a Bren'in who cares more about his people than he does about himself.<eos> Oh, we're done now, son.<eos> - All right, we good now, boys?<eos> - All set, Bren'in.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's continue.<eos> Here on this most blessed day...
I have not been pretending. Not for one second.<eos> Tomorrow, just before he's taking his vows, I'm gonna kill him.<eos> There are trying times ahead, and we need a Bren'in who cares more about his people - than he does about himself.<eos> - Asa, stop it!<eos> Caught one up.<eos> Please, on the lives of my kids, you'll never see me again!<eos> Guaranteed, I won't see you again.<eos> Don't nobody here say that this Bren'in don't protect this clan.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, just one sec.
No, no, no, see, nobody broke in.<eos> Window... window's wide open.<eos> Ain't nobody break in.<eos> Yeah, well, one of you just killed somebody, - so I'm taking you in.<eos> - Wait, wait, he didn't do... hey, hey, step back, miss.<eos> He didn't kill anybody, he was with me.<eos> You don't have to do that!<eos> Aah! Hasil!<eos> Whoo. What you got?<eos> - Hey! - About time.
- We both got screwed.<eos> - All right, easy, easy.<eos> So what are we gonna do?<eos> I'll tell you what we're gonna do...<eos> Jack squatly unless you got an army to go out there and attack those guys with.<eos> This here is what's known as a life lesson.<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Face down!<eos> Face down on the ground right now!
I don't give a feather if cousin Asa lives or dies.<eos> That's cold talk, woman.<eos> But it warms me up fine.<eos> I'm gonna talk to the boys, get his ass found.<eos> - Morning, Krake.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Good morning, G'win.<eos> Morning.<eos> I have apologies to give to you.<eos> For what?
Is there anything you want to tell me?<eos> McGintuk,<eos> Shay,<eos> Farrell, welcome here to celebrate this last dawn of summer, and to honor our home, as our ancestors have done for so many years before us.<eos> Summer is done.<eos> The harvest comes, followed soon after by the cold, quiet, death of winter.<eos> Through it all, we are sustained by our mother, our mountain.<eos> So let us give her all praise and glory.<eos> For life, for sustenance, for balance, we honor the mountain.<eos> For blessings, for riches, for your great, quiet majesty.

Split off.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> You're idiots.<eos> He was right under your noses.<eos> It's a miracle any of you can piss seeing as you gotta find your dick first.<eos> Do you wanna wait until he slits my throat in the night?<eos> I want him gone.<eos> Split up.<eos> Search everywhere.<eos> Every holler...
"How are we supposed to fight big Foster?"<eos> You heard me.<eos> Asa's your leader.<eos> So here you all are.<eos> Your minds poisoned by Asa.<eos> All in defiance of your Bren'in.<eos> Take 'em to the barn.<eos> Keep a guard on 'em.<eos> Any of them try to escape, you shoot them dead.<eos> Especially this one.
You're gonna drink it quickly.<eos> It's gonna taste awful, but it's gonna get the job done.<eos> - Believe you me.<eos> - Oh... just give it to me.<eos> Fa!<eos> Are you... Are you out of your mind?<eos> - I got him.<eos> - Storming here like that.<eos> I got him!<eos> The lostie.
- You can't... what are you...<eos> You can't walk down the mountain by yourself in the middle of the night.<eos> You're gonna fall and break your neck.<eos> - I'll take my chances.<eos> - Listen, hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> - You lied to me!<eos> - Hasil!<eos> Hasil.<eos> Just...
Shit.<eos> Your time of judgment has come, Krake.<eos> - You said it'd be a full day.<eos> - Get up!<eos> Well, your fellow jackals... They escaped and run off last night.<eos> And my urge to punish is too strong to contain.<eos> Get him out of there.<eos> - I ain't gonna beg you none!<eos> - Wouldn't help anyhow.<eos> Yeah, on your knees, scoundrel.
We're good friends. I didn't have a clue about your time in juvie.<eos> It was hard enough to do that time.<eos> I just never wanted to look back.<eos> So, you, uh... you find any of Kate's secrets in this mess?<eos> Nope.<eos> She had a baby she never mentioned.<eos> What?<eos> And she took a bunch of cash out of my savings.<eos> - Well, how much?<eos> - Six figures.
Why didn't you call me?<eos> Because you're married now and legally dead.<eos> Let's go over your movements the night Kate died.<eos> At any point, did you leave the party and return?<eos> I already gave you my statement.<eos> A lot of witnesses forget details or leave things out.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to remember.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I went outside for about a half an hour.<eos> - Not up to the roof?
I already gave you my statement.<eos> A lot of witnesses forget details or leave things out.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to remember.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I went outside for about a half an hour.<eos> - Not up to the roof?<eos> - Where'd you go?<eos> I went downstairs to smoke.<eos> You don't smoke, not even cigars.<eos> Weed.
Did you know about this?<eos> Who the hell was blackmailing you, and why?<eos> Blackmail is a felony.<eos> Did you pay it?<eos> I absolutely refused.<eos> This came in the mail?<eos> There's no stamp, no return address, so someone must have slipped this in the mailbox.<eos> I have no idea who sent this.<eos> Pay it.<eos> Hell, no.
We don't even know who this is.<eos> They could be desperate or even dangerous.<eos> We don't have to get close.<eos> There's tracking software.<eos> Eric, we need to control this information.<eos> It's my past.<eos> It's my decision.<eos> So Kate must have intercepted a second demand.<eos> They wanted 50 grand the first time.<eos> This time, $100,000.
Hey, what's going on?<eos> I'll tender my resignation first thing in the morning.<eos> Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> What can that woman say that could be so damaging?<eos> If any more of my past gets leaked, the firm goes down.<eos> If... if I get arrested, the firm goes down.<eos> Just let me put some distance between us so that you and the company are protected.<eos> I am your father.<eos> I protect you.<eos> Not this time.
It's over.<eos> It's all over now.<eos> You're safe. You're...<eos> You know what that is?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give that to me.<eos> I hate you!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Get to cover!<eos> Behind the wall!
Mr. Eichhorst.<eos> Help me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Help me.<eos> - Has anyone seen my son?<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Anyone, please!<eos> Help!
Don't jinx this.<eos> There's still a lot of road ahead.<eos> Let 'em through.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Alan, what's going on?<eos> - How you doing, Nolan?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Did you know the Chief Minister is coming to LA for some state of the union thing?<eos> - Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> - Thursday.
Let's go!<eos> You bitch!<eos> Okay, ma'am.<eos> Get your hands off of me.<eos> You going camping?<eos> Just taking inventory.<eos> It's good to be ready.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Bram, I have to go out tonight.<eos> To the Yonk?
This is important.<eos> If there's an emergency, you can call me on that number, but this is just between you and me.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, bear.<eos> Are you mad at Bram?<eos> No, we just had a disagreement.<eos> About Charlie?
If there's an emergency, you can call me on that number, but this is just between you and me.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, bear.<eos> Are you mad at Bram?<eos> No, we just had a disagreement.<eos> About Charlie?<eos> Charlie?
- Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Hey, what is your problem?<eos> He's my problem!<eos> He's just like Kirk Duplesse from high school.<eos> Do you remember him?<eos> Total jerk with the square jaw.<eos> Smelled like body spray, always bullying people.<eos> Why don't you do your own homework?<eos> Just once, yeah?
From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it. Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.<eos> He'll blend in.<eos> Hide in plain sight.<eos> - I don't know, it's seems...<eos> - Trust me.<eos> If Magnus is coming out of hiding, he's going to one of the biggest parties of the year.<eos> Never underestimate Magnus' hedonism.<eos> Or his greed.
Thanks.<eos> We must initiate a bond.<eos> Once this bond is sealed, it cannot be broken until the demon retreats.<eos> No matter what happens, we must not let go of each other's hands.<eos> You people are pathetic.<eos> I will lead the ceremony, and you all must do exactly as I say.<eos> The demon's name is Valak.<eos> And at some point, he will ask for payment in exchange for Clary's memories.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What kind of payment?
But your father's Valentine.<eos> Why JC?<eos> Because for 18 years, she told me his name was Jonathan Clark.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> But... whatever was in that box meant a lot to her.<eos> Maybe there's something inside that could help us track him.<eos> Where can we find the box?<eos> I think it's still back at the loft.<eos> Let's go get it.<eos> Absolutely not.
Yeah, but I already stabbed one demon with it.<eos> I'm sure it hurts a lot worse on a man.<eos> Hey!<eos> You need more training.<eos> And we gotta go.<eos> Now!<eos> What?<eos> Hey!<eos> - Where are you taking me?<eos> - Someplace safe.
I've given up everything!<eos> We'll find a way out of this.<eos> Screw the rules.<eos> Screw them.<eos> Screw all of this.<eos> Alec.<eos> So is this where you kill me and dispose of the body in some ditch<eos> - where no one will find me?<eos> - Tell me again. What does Clary see in you?<eos> My inner compassion.
You are my future.<eos> Vandal.<eos> Oh, I didn't expect you up and about so soon.<eos> My father wanted me to rest, but I wanted to resume my studies.<eos> Oh, good boy.<eos> So... where should we begin?<eos> Well, I was thinking Greek mythology.<eos> Do you know the tale of Oedipus Rex?<eos> He was a prince of thieves before his father exiled him.<eos> Why?
-Yeah, what do you do?<eos> What do you do?<eos> You act like it's a playground.<eos> You beat up the bullies with your fists.<eos> You throw 'em in jail, everybody calls you a hero, right?<eos> And then a month, a week, a day later, they're back on the streets doing the same goddamn thing--<eos> Yeah, so you just put 'em in the morgue.<eos> You're goddamn right, I do.<eos> -You ever doubt yourself, Frank?<eos> -Not even for a second.
You don't look so well.<eos> Dyadya, I want to return to work for you.<eos> To make up for what happened with Ivan.<eos> Here, diplomatic papers to insure no inspections.<eos> We can move a dozen containers in the next month.<eos> I won't take a cut for any of it, Dyadya, to make it up to you.<eos> What do you think of this idea, Mr. Donovan?<eos> I'd feel better if we were all friends.<eos> I'm so looking forward to the boxing match.<eos> Ringside seats.
He did.<eos> You're right.<eos> He slobbers on everything.<eos> Reminds me of me.<eos> Very loving, but he makes a mess everywhere he goes.<eos> What?<eos> Bridget got into NY-fucking-U.<eos> She's got her mother's smarts.<eos> Little Abby genes running around in there.<eos> Good for her.
Jesus.<eos> They want me to talk too.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You need to meet me.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Not on the phone.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> The body came in three days ago.<eos> No one's been allowed to identify her or touch her.<eos> Orders from above.
- Not on the phone.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> The body came in three days ago.<eos> No one's been allowed to identify her or touch her.<eos> Orders from above.<eos> Something, huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> I hate to part with it.<eos> But, you know, gotta make room on the walls for the...<eos> For the new shit.
I won't.<eos> - You have to.<eos> It's starting. - No.<eos> Look, please.<eos> I can't tell you what to do.<eos> But if you choose to live, I hope you learn to love yourself the way I'll always love you.<eos> It wasn't easy going from a revered Shadowhunter to a... werewolf.<eos> Suddenly, I was foraging for food, unable to control my own body.<eos> I lost my family... my friends.<eos> But not my mom.
You need me.<eos> I've given you everything you could want.<eos> All the riches.<eos> All the pleasures you could desire.<eos> By breaking the law.<eos> Which will only destroy us.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> If we just get rid of the body, this mundane means nothing.<eos> "Means nothing"?<eos> Over my dead body.
You're right.<eos> Did you just say I'm right?<eos> Don't get used to it.<eos> Look, maybe Luke can help you find Simon.<eos> Werewolves are really great trackers.<eos> Of course, yeah.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Just promise me you'll be careful, okay?<eos> Jace, we still have to talk about...<eos> Us.
That's what my life's about?<eos> Like I'm in a zoo?<eos> I'm... I am so sorry!<eos> Why are you so sorry, Raphael did this to me.<eos> Simon, it was my choice.<eos> You died.<eos> Raphael brought you to us.<eos> I had a choice.<eos> I could stake your heart or I could... bury you, and you could come back.<eos> Clary, why?
We have to stop them!<eos> That's the plan, Clary.<eos> Rescue and recovery.<eos> We get him from the guards, in and out, no one gets hurt.<eos> You want us to go up against the Silent Brothers, and an elite Shadowhunter guard unit?<eos> - Without any backup?<eos> - Pretty much sums it up, yeah.<eos> Is Alec coming?<eos> No.<eos> Not this time.
You have to see that.<eos> Please, just let Meliorn go.<eos> I have my orders.<eos> You and your damn orders.<eos> Who cares about orders?<eos> See?<eos> That's how little you know about being a Shadowhunter.<eos> You couldn't possibly understand...<eos> It's you that doesn't understand, Alec.<eos> Not this time.
That's true.<eos> Your seriousness is making me scared. And there are only two of us here.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> My principle is that I must protect beautiful women, seniors, and children.<eos> I am relieved that I am one of them.<eos> You are not.<eos> A senior!<eos> Big Boss, what is your name?<eos> I'm Yoo Shi Jin.<eos> What about you?
Critter right there was killed with a blade fancy-like and nailed up.<eos> "Nailed up"?<eos> All of them out there like some kind of display.<eos> Sent my dogs wild crazy.<eos> You see anything else out there?<eos> Spray paint?<eos> Graffiti?<eos> This ain't the Crips, Chief.<eos> You see any kids roaming around out there?<eos> Aaron McCready?
May your neighbors respect you... trouble neglect you... the angels protect you... and heaven accept you. Mmm?<eos> To better days.
He came over to make his fortune and now, look.<eos> Two cents to his name.<eos> He was a good kid, Finn.<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> You know, maybe you've been out of the game too long to remember.<eos> Death... is part of the deal.<eos> Leave it, leave it.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Jesus...<eos> Cheers.
Must have been a... busy couple nights.<eos> Yeah, I did everything I could to... uh, protect my client.<eos> - That work is done, Matthew.<eos> - Because I failed.<eos> At least you tried.<eos> Well, like you said, his life had value.<eos> A whole world's been lost and others are dying one after the other...<eos> Matthew, what are you looking for?<eos> - Forgiveness.<eos> - For what?
The Irish may not have invented revenge, but we sure as hell took some time perfecting it.<eos> Don't think you're showing me something I haven't seen before, 'cause your killing spree has all the signs of a man seeking retribution.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll tell you...<eos> I'll tell you where your money is.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> I promise you, it'll be over soon.<eos> In a jiffy.
Shaun!<eos> Jimmy!<eos> Jimmy!<eos> Shaun!<eos> You wanted this.<eos> No, I counted on it.<eos> Now I can ask you face to face.<eos> Who was there that day?<eos> Who killed my family?<eos> - Your family?
Number three?<eos> It's prioritized in terms of need and who was listed first as a Status 1.<eos> - He's the President of the United States.<eos> - It's the law.<eos> The attorney general is resigning.<eos> Add that to the press release for this afternoon.<eos> - Her decision or the vice president's? - My decision.<eos> Goodwin's WITSEC was a DOJ responsibility.<eos> We needed a head to roll.<eos> First hers... then yours.
It's very simple, Martha.<eos> You work with us, you stay on as AG.<eos> You don't, we prosecute.<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen, the First Lady of the United States.<eos> Good afternoon, everyone.<eos> I'd like to update you on my husband's recovery.<eos> The president's medical team gave me a full assessment last night and they have come to the conclusion that the president is in need of a liver transplant if he's to survive.<eos> I'm asking the nation to pray with me that a healthy liver makes its way to Francis soon.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> A moment.
And while we have no reason to believe Ms. Dunbar had anything to do with the assassination attempt... we will be questioning her about this alleged conversation.<eos> Are you arresting her?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> We're here to ask a few questions.<eos> - Then you need to make a formal request.<eos> - Is she here now?<eos> Send the request directly to me, and then I'll discuss it with Ms. Dunbar's attorneys.<eos> Hey, Kate.<eos> I tried calling.<eos> Home and cell.
You think you're the first time travelers I've ever come across?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I got some words that need saying.<eos> Where is who?<eos> Rip Hunter.<eos> What is it about you people that whenever we go to a new timeline, you feel the need to pick up... strays?<eos> Nice.<eos> I didn't get to see it last time around.<eos> Last time?
- Stillwater gang has been shooting up this town for months now.<eos> And I am done with pushing my luck.<eos> But you're the... sheriff.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> By the way, you might find a warrant or two out for me around these parts.<eos> You know, we have stuff back on the ship that can fix your... you know...<eos> Fix what?<eos> Yep. Nothing. Never mind.<eos> What can I get you?<eos> Information.
Well, then you must prove your mother wrong... so you can ride that stagecoach.<eos> One of mine is dead.<eos> And this here town's gonna pay.<eos> Now, who the hell are you supposed to be?<eos> John Wayne...<eos> Salvation's new sheriff.<eos> And this here town is under my protection.<eos> Well, you being new and all, you don't know about the arrangement that we got.<eos> See, me and my boys, we ride into town, we take whatever we want.<eos> In exchange for what?
You said you were blind.<eos> No, you said I was blind.<eos> So you can see?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> What about you?<eos> You said you took ballet lessons.<eos> I did.<eos> In the winters, when my capoeira master returned to Angola.<eos> Muay Thai?<eos> - Every other Thursday.
- Um...<eos> Who cares?<eos> They have wine.<eos> Right.<eos> That's...<eos> You know, I've always felt more comfortable with the cheap stuff.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, here, I'll drink to that.<eos> Cheap stuff.
Who cares?<eos> They have wine.<eos> Right.<eos> That's...<eos> You know, I've always felt more comfortable with the cheap stuff.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, here, I'll drink to that.<eos> Cheap stuff.<eos> Cheap stuff.
We need to buy a "not guilty" verdict.<eos> My high school debate team could prove that Castle did it.<eos> We need an affirmative defense.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I get that, but I'm not so sure Frank is insane.<eos> I'm no doctor, but I'd say he's at least driven past Crazy Town.<eos> - Foggy, I'm serious.<eos> - She has a point.<eos> I mean, insanity only has a 0.12% acquittal rate in New York.<eos> Reyes is just gonna call in some expert shrink witness to blow our case apart.<eos> - What case?
I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Um...<eos> - No, um...<eos> You know, maybe this is a good time to call it a night.<eos> I just think we're both exhausted, and...<eos> You know, a case this big, let's just... Um...<eos> Yes, you're probably right.<eos> I don't know, maybe, uh, after... after the trial's over.<eos> - Yeah, a real date next time.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Positive.<eos> We'll be in touch, Mr. Roth.<eos> I'm sure we will.<eos> Statement he wanted me to sign?<eos> Complete work of fiction.<eos> Probably handcrafted by Reyes.<eos> Well, we could write an anonymous letter, and maybe the judge will assign a new public defender.<eos> Yeah, or we could help Castle ourselves.<eos> - No way.
This ain't about what I remember.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Mr. Castle, I've got a lot of puzzle pieces, but... trust me, this moves a lot smoother if you can tell me anything.<eos> It goes in and out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The fact that it fades...<eos> We took our blanket down to...<eos> our spot.
Yeah, he drove me crazy with that thing.<eos> Look, Frank, it's...<eos> It's really not for me to say... but they clearly loved you.<eos> Very much.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Okay...<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> For what?
Thank you, ma'am.<eos> For what?<eos> You helped...<eos> You helped me remember.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> If you wanna ask your questions, you can go ahead.<eos> Blind bastard.<eos> Ugh, could one of you grab me a club soda?<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake.
All right, watch your head.<eos> Inmate 5-5-4-6-7.<eos> Fisk, Wilson.<eos> Everything off.<eos> Clothing and personal items in the bin.
- That right?<eos> You can save your bullshit sympathy, 'cause I don't buy it.<eos> I understand why you'd think that.<eos> Look, you got something to say to me or not?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've crossed paths with your attorneys... before.<eos> Needless to say, I'm not a... a huge fan.<eos> Pushing you towards a sentence in a mental health facility, after everything you've been through, that would have been a travesty.<eos> - As opposed to what?<eos> - Closure.
You don't get to create danger, and then protect us from that danger.<eos> That's not heroic.<eos> That's insane.<eos> We were really close to winning the Frank Castle case and getting that guy the help he needed.<eos> I don't know what tanked it, but I know we had a shot, mostly because I worked my ass off to cover for you.<eos> - I deserve better than that.<eos> - I know.<eos> Every time I walk up those stairs... I wonder if today is the day you're dead in your living room.<eos> I'm not gonna stop, Foggy.<eos> Not anytime soon.
Winter jacket.<eos> Gorsuch.<eos> Ski trip...<eos> Courchevel?<eos> Far too early for Courchevel, and anyway I prefer St. Moritz.<eos> Shopping and slopes.<eos> For a start, both my feet hurt after a while.<eos> I'll need a bath.<eos> I can draw one for you.<eos> In a tub for two?
Ah, he just changed the channel.<eos> The hit was clean.<eos> In and out.<eos> They'll release him tomorrow.<eos> You know, the bullet wound will do wonders for his career in hip-hop.<eos> You should pay him a visit.<eos> I can't help him, Claire.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> -'Cause he got shot.<eos> -Not by you.
Thank you, Foggy.<eos> That's really good work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> Hey, you, uh...<eos> What?<eos> Did you want me to convince you?<eos> - Of what?<eos> - This.<eos> Us.
You...<eos> You'll forget about me.<eos> Forget my Ellie?<eos> Never.<eos> I pretended my whole life.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to control this inside me.<eos> Maybe I don't have to anymore.<eos> Maybe this is my chance.<eos> To what?
Armed, packing katanas, couple of longbows.<eos> More coming up from below.<eos> Same weapons.<eos> I'd say we've got a couple of minutes before they break through that door.<eos> Okay.<eos> Even if we survive... we may not see each other again.<eos> Okay, let's do it.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Wait for one second.<eos> One second.
Because you love New York.<eos> And I'd give my life for it, but... there's one thing in this world that makes me feel more alive.<eos> And that's you.<eos> I'm the Black Sky, Matthew.<eos> Yeah, and I'm the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> The airport's just a cab fare away.<eos> All we gotta do is survive whatever's waiting for us behind that door.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Remember they're trying to kill me, not you.<eos> Over my dead body.
Are you gonna be okay?<eos> I came to New York thinking there's no way I could feel lonely in a city of millions.<eos> But you do.<eos> Somehow it makes it all worse.<eos> I used to love coming here... with you and Matt.<eos> Josie's actually felt like home.<eos> A home with... very sticky floors and belligerent drunks, nightly.<eos> Right.<eos> And now, no Matt.<eos> No us.
How is she?<eos> Well... she'll live.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You sure?<eos> Sure as I am of anything.<eos> Jesus, didn't we do this already?<eos> Start talking, Stick.<eos> It's about the war.<eos> What is?<eos> All of it.
Bingo.<eos> Some say it was just a kid.<eos> Hand comes into his village, kills everyone... almost.<eos> Kid... pulls the knife from the breast of his dead mother and goes to work.<eos> He cuts down some of the Hand's finest warriors.<eos> They're lying dead... kid's standing.<eos> They give him a name.<eos> The Chaste.<eos> And he's just one kid?<eos> Alone?
-Order!<eos> Hell, I loved it!<eos> I'm sittin' here, I'm...<eos> I'm just itching.<eos> I'm itching to do it again.<eos> And you think...<eos> What, you think you're gonna send me to a nuthouse?<eos> Some doctor, they're gonna get me to stop from doing what I want to do?<eos> Well, that ain't happening!<eos> Not on my watch!
I'm guilty.<eos> Come on, please, Judge!<eos> I'm guilty, you hear me?<eos> I'm guilty!<eos> I'm guilty!<eos> I'll kill every one of 'em!<eos> I'll kill every single one!<eos> How the hell did this happen?<eos> That wasn't the Frank I met with yesterday.<eos> Guys...
I have something for you.<eos> "Nuniq of the North in Toronto."<eos> This way, your family can share in the experience.<eos> Mr. Blair said he'd project it for you.<eos> Thank you, Crabtree.<eos> Nuniq means kiss.<eos> No, I just say that.<eos> "Kunik" means kiss.<eos> So what does Nuniq mean?<eos> Another time.
Kendra, do it!<eos> If I kill Savage, his mind will be lost.<eos> And if you don't, I will lose my wife and son.<eos> Well, my love, what's it gonna be, huh?<eos> Come on!<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm so sorry, Rip.<eos> I can't.<eos> We need to get them back to the ship.<eos> Both of them.
You're in league with him.<eos> I wouldn't expect you to understand our reasons.<eos> For all your wisdom, you were never able to take the long view of history.<eos> Take him away.<eos> Search their ship for the others.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - Don't try to distract me.<eos> We need to find somewhere to hide.<eos> Why do we need to find somewhere to hide?<eos> Alexa.
Go.<eos> You were supposed to be shipping out.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> My transport got delayed.<eos> I told my CO my wife's giving birth.<eos> He got me a pass and a Jeep.<eos> And I made it.<eos> I saw him.<eos> My boy.
So, this is where Rip plans on keeping our baby selves.<eos> If all goes according to plan, we'll only be here for a few minutes, then presumably never remember.<eos> When's the last thing anything went according to plan?<eos> I don't think there was a last time.<eos> I really would sit up if I were you.<eos> She'll kill you if she catches you slouching.<eos> Don't be fooled by appearances.<eos> That woman is as tough as nails.<eos> Funny how you never mentioned having a mother.<eos> Adoptive mother.
There isn't ti...<eos> We gotta go!<eos> - Mick.<eos> - Get outta here.<eos> Not without you, Mick.<eos> Pretty boy said I gotta hold this stick for the ship to blow.<eos> So I'm holding this stick.<eos> Now leave!<eos> My old friend, please forgive me.<eos> For what?
It's okay.<eos> I got this.<eos> - I know him.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Look, I'm sorry. He has to leave the premises.<eos> Oh, I don't think that'll be necessary, Officer.<eos> Besides, isn't this quite boring?<eos> I mean, there are several lovely ladies milling around out there.<eos> Which one do you desire?<eos> You.
Do we have that?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> But on-on her.<eos> Good.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, you're the expert.<eos> You tell me what's wrong with this picture.<eos> I mean, I'm me.<eos> Right?<eos> And she...
Mazikeen, we both know that something has fundamentally changed in Lucifer.<eos> Now, aren't you even the least bit concerned?<eos> No.<eos> It's a phase.<eos> It'll pass.<eos> You're lying to me.<eos> You're lying to yourself.<eos> Now, we can help each other.<eos> We can get him back to where he belongs, if you could just provide me with a weak spot.<eos> Some insight.
But seriously, darling, are you well?<eos> The berries are ripe and ready to be harvested.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> Huh?<eos> Now, you can't argue with that, can you?<eos> What happened to...<eos> My God.<eos> Well, yes, I suppose it is his fault.<eos> Whose fault?<eos> My father.
Oh, that sounds sinister.<eos> Just hand over the cash, and no one gets hurt.<eos> Yes, right.<eos> Got it here.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Where's Lindsay? !<eos> I want to see her.<eos> No.<eos> My rules.<eos> Money first.
Fine.<eos> Now bring us the girl.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> What?<eos> I will kill you!<eos> Oh, it's gonna happen.<eos> A deal's a deal.<eos> I am not leaving here without Lindsay.<eos> No way.
These guys kill for limited-edition kicks.<eos> Six G's a pair.<eos> Oh, even the Mistress of Excess is impressed.<eos> Go, Benny.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Mmm, dangerous.<eos> Lucifer likes.<eos> You were shot and you bled.<eos> No sharp objects until we find out why.<eos> Oh, quite the opposite.
I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.<eos> I'm joking.<eos> Puppies don't waltz.<eos> You like to hide insecurity in humor, don't you?<eos> I don't have insecurities.<eos> Everyone does.<eos> Very well. I'll play your game.<eos> What do you think I'm insecure about?<eos> That you are changing, but that you don't know what's causing the change.<eos> Or who.
I...<eos> If I tell you,<eos> - he's just gonna...<eos> No.<eos> Just...<eos> - He? Who?<eos> Would you please make him stop?<eos> - Who?<eos> He who?<eos> - Him.
- Hey, show me your boobs!<eos> - Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!<eos> Back off, you mouth-breathing scaven...!<eos> Well, go on then, punch him!<eos> Come on, let's punch them all!<eos> It's not me anymore.<eos> Well, it's still very much me.<eos> You, Friar Tuck, tell me, is this depravity really all you want out of life?<eos> I want to win a Pulitzer for photography.<eos> Pulitzer?
Yeah.<eos> I learned a lot working for him.<eos> He's my idol.<eos> He's the best pap out there.<eos> So you took photos of your idol being arrested for murder?<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Other than what Nick would've done.<eos> Which is to be first, no matter what.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just a second.
I'm really not.<eos> Believe it or not, I forgive you.<eos> This isn't about you, this isn't about me.<eos> This is about Robbie Russell.<eos> You know, he was a kid who didn't ask to be famous.<eos> He just wanted to live a normal life.<eos> Nick, if you don't testify, Josh will do this again.<eos> He'll do it again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh. Just a second.
If you truly worship the dollar, then I'm your ticket to divinity.<eos> Happy bidding.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's funny, isn't it, how all it takes to unite the faiths of the world is a bit of illegal consumerism.<eos> What I'd like to know is since when is the Prince of Darkness scared of some insufferable human gun?<eos> Well, since I, uh... I bled.<eos> - What do you mean, bled?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Don't know how it's possible, but on top of everything else, seems I'm dealing with a bit of a mortality sitch.<eos> Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.
That's right, me,<eos> Lucifer bloody Morningstar.<eos> Do you mind if I come in?<eos> You, Carmen, slightly more difficult to identify, aren't you?<eos> No phone, no bank account, home registered under one of your many aliases.<eos> Seems wings aren't the only thing you falsify, eh?<eos> - I can explain...<eos> - I'm still moved by your words.<eos> "I'm a man that believes in one simple divinity,<eos> - the almighty dollar."
Easy, Anthony. Easy.<eos> You got some nerve, Decker.<eos> I'd like to say a few things about Malcolm.<eos> He was a hero, who got shot doing what all of us do every day, by putting himself in the line of fire.<eos> I can't take back the things I've said.<eos> But I can promise not to let his life... or death... go in vain.<eos> And for any pain that I've caused... his family or otherwise...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm closing the case against him.<eos> To a good cop.

I've moved on to bigger and better things.<eos> So, what changed?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Or won't say.<eos> Well, how'd your Palmetto thing go anyway?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Did you find the answer you were looking for?<eos> I found something.<eos> Oh. Well.<eos> To our equally enigmatic futures.
Hi, Daddy.<eos> Hi, munchkin.<eos> Wow, shocker, you're late.<eos> Come on, give me a break.<eos> Right, here's the deal.<eos> We can have as much naked cuddle time as you desire, but you're gonna have to listen to me too.<eos> You like to hide insecurity in humor, don't you?<eos> What do you think I'm insecure about?<eos> That you are changing, that you don't know what's causing the change.<eos> Or who.
Let me get this right... your clients do all the work, yet you chaps make all the money?<eos> - Really?<eos> - And they call me the Devil!<eos> If I ever return to Hell, you kids will be my first call.<eos> Especially you.<eos> Oh, one last thing before I go.<eos> Which of you is into killing attractive redheads?<eos> Lucifer?<eos> Detective!<eos> A word?
I think they wanted to scare you.<eos> So... you know of any reason why someone would want to do that?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, why did you run, Debra?<eos> Awfully guilty-looking.<eos> I thought you were going to bust me for violating my restraining order.<eos> I went to Ty's party last night.<eos> I-I just...<eos> I just looked.<eos> From outside, through the window.
I've been trying to build a case on her for years, and every time we've approached her, she's lawyered up immediately.<eos> Ronnie is a pro.<eos> So how do we approach her?<eos> She's picky about talking to strangers.<eos> Definitely no cops.<eos> What about someone she'd never expect us to work with?<eos> Do I get a code word?<eos> You know, for when you take her down.<eos> If so, might I suggest<eos> "monkey bottoms"?
You think Joe's the killer, that he took things into his own hands, quite literally.<eos> We don't have any proof.<eos> Right, well, how do you propose that we get him?<eos> Joe pointed the finger right at Debra, painted her as crazy.<eos> It's not that hard a picture to paint, in her case.<eos> Why was he so certain she'd make a good suspect?<eos> Maybe he found out she went to Ty's party.<eos> Maybe he knew she went to Ty's party.<eos> You are looking at the future of football.<eos> The American Dream.
Come on, admit it... we solved this one together.<eos> Or are you too egotistical to acknowledge my help?<eos> Okay, yeah, you didn't completely destroy the case.<eos> So you can stop blaming yourself, great.<eos> Whatever do you mean?<eos> The whole reason you tried to prove Ty's innocence?<eos> Was to catch the true culprit.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> So I decided not to punish myself.<eos> Yourself?
I don't know.<eos> I suppose.<eos> Six-foot-two, black, voice like an angel?<eos> Oh, you know him.<eos> All too well.<eos> Trixie's finally down.<eos> She conned you into reading the book about the sneezing panda, didn't she?<eos> Five times.<eos> Um... thank you.<eos> For what?
Oh, you know him.<eos> All too well.<eos> Trixie's finally down.<eos> She conned you into reading the book about the sneezing panda, didn't she?<eos> Five times.<eos> Um... thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> You know, for having my back and... for everything.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> For everything.
He was an angel on her shoulder, trying to control me.<eos> I wonder how my dear, angelic brother got such a wickedly clever idea.<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> I told you, whatever the danger, I'll be there to stop it.<eos> Whether you see it coming or not.<eos> You betrayed me, Maze.<eos> And not for my own good.<eos> You did it for yourself.<eos> Who is this human world really rubbing off on, eh?<eos> Me or you?
Malcolm, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, you didn't hear the good news?<eos> Back on duty.<eos> So soon after, um...?<eos> What, my partner's suicide?<eos> Yeah, can't let that keep me down, am I right?<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I already got a new partner.<eos> Yeah, convinced the higher-ups to give me my first choice.<eos> You.
I'm already on it, all right?<eos> Everything's going according to plan.<eos> Don't keep me waiting.<eos> Patience is not one of my virtues.<eos> I promise you, I... I got this.<eos> Mr. Morningstar, surprised to see you again.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world.<eos> Father Frank, when was the last time you saw Lenny Arietta?<eos> This morning.<eos> Despite the restraining order.
I mean, some people are just... beyond saving.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> There's still hope for him.<eos> He shot up your church, he's most likely running a drug ring behind your back, and, oh, yes, killed a man.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Look, what if it's true?<eos> Then he needs me even more.<eos> How can you still have faith in this boy?<eos> God has faith in him.<eos> In all of us.
- Sorry, I don't have a choice, okay?<eos> - I have to do this.<eos> - I get it.<eos> You don't think you can rely on anyone else to survive... but you're not alone.<eos> I'm here for you, whenever you need me.<eos> I don't need you!<eos> Okay?<eos> I don't need anybody!<eos> Go on, then, shoot the altar boy.<eos> - Shh. - In the leg or something, obviously.
Yeah, 'cause we didn't need her anymore.<eos> We were just on our way to our first audition.<eos> Ooh, isn't that a thrill?<eos> You didn't think to ask me about that?<eos> What do you mean, "our" audition?<eos> I am up for a new role, and I thought it would be good to play off of somebody.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?<eos> So you thought it'd be a good idea to use Trixie as a prop?<eos> A co-star.
You killed him.<eos> Tell me all about it.<eos> I mean, is the air a little sweeter?<eos> Is the sun a little brighter?<eos> I didn't kill my dad, man.<eos> Oh, come on-- why return to dispose of the murder weapon then?<eos> The heroin.<eos> Sorry, it's all gone.<eos> Police took it away for testing.<eos> Well, most of it. "Heroin"?
You said the door's always open, and I'm walking through it.<eos> Mmm. Right, well, I was just on my way out to meet the Brittanys, but... I suppose they can occupy each other.<eos> Great.<eos> Then have a seat.<eos> Yes.<eos> Has something happened-- I'm guessing by the looks of it-- with Dan perhaps?<eos> Mmm. You mean Detective Douche?<eos> Yes, well, of course that's what I mean, but the bigger question here is: why do you mean that?<eos> We weren't even back together, and he ended it with me tonight.<eos> With a text.
Are you serious?<eos> I need to see your back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to know if you're an angel sent to destroy me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is this about the scars on your back?<eos> Look, I have no idea what happened to you or what's going on with you now, but... not everyone's out to get you.<eos> They found him...<eos> Corazon.

Well, not really.<eos> Look at me. Oh, no, I saw plenty.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Cheeky.<eos> Oh, Lucifer, Detective.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.<eos> Yes, we have a few more questions for you.<eos> Yes, how are you holding up?<eos> Doing my best.<eos> One moment at a time.
What better way to get intel on a murder than a gaggle of high-society frenemies?<eos> Tim Dunlear was a true humanitarian.<eos> Oh, there's so few of us around.<eos> And I have no one to help me process my grief.<eos> Can you believe my therapist had the nerve to go on maternity leave?<eos> Oh, well, I'm here for you, Gayle.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> You are a good man.<eos> Yeah, not quite the reaction I was looking for, but, uh, when in Rome.<eos> To Tim Dunlear.
Don't worry, Detective.<eos> There'll be a spectacle.<eos> These women are lonely and unappreciated.<eos> If I give them what they want, they'll give us what we want.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Thank you all so much for coming today.<eos> Uh, you've all given so generously over the years to the Dunlear Foundation.<eos> In honor of our fallen hero,<eos> I now give you a gift in return.<eos> Me.
Hey, Trixie.<eos> Are you okay, honey?<eos> Mommy's here.<eos> Uh, that's enough of that.<eos> What do you want, Malcolm?<eos> Aw. Poor Chloe Decker.<eos> Did someone take something from you, something valuable?<eos> Hurts, don't it?<eos> You want your money.<eos> Bull's-eye.
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...
- I want you to be happy.<eos> If it were you, if you moved your life for me and got an offer like this, I would be thrilled.<eos> I think you should take the job.<eos> I am not asking your permission.<eos> What are you today, CIA?<eos> You want to see my 1040s?<eos> Shut up and listen.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> In private.<eos> Off the record.
Help me!<eos> ...this whole place will blow.<eos> Help me, please!<eos> Help me!<eos> Game over.<eos> I'm trapped in here.<eos> I'm going to save you.<eos> Help me, please help me! I'm trapped in here.<eos> Help me, help me!<eos> Help!
Are you threatening me?<eos> Supergirl is the threat, Alex.<eos> This...<eos> Bizarro?<eos> She's humanity's guardian.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> May the best girl win.<eos> He all but admitted it.<eos> He took all those girls.<eos> All seven.

Maybe I'll have my cousin come down and the two of us can force you to talk.<eos> Kal-El doesn't have the stomach for it.<eos> He was raised on Earth.<eos> He might as well be human.<eos> You are the true heir to the House of El.<eos> If you help me, maybe I can help you.<eos> You're trying to manipulate my emotions.<eos> But you're undermined by your own fear.<eos> I'm not frightened of you.<eos> Not of me.
Let's do this another way.<eos> You know, you're...<eos> You're real tough hiding behind your muscle.<eos> Why don't you be a man and admit what you're really up to here, Max?<eos> You think insulting my ego is going to get me to spill like some Bond villain?<eos> That won't work on me, Jimmy.<eos> But I do like your idea of settling this like men.<eos> Human, alien, super.<eos> If you go up against me, you will lose.<eos> Next time...
We have to be better.<eos> You give me too much credit.<eos> Because I know the real you.<eos> The woman you knew died on Krypton.<eos> I still have faith there's good in you.<eos> I am not worth your faith.<eos> Everyone deserves faith, Astra.<eos> Even you.<eos> Now, tell me what happened on Krypton.<eos> The truth.
This is my war, not Earth's.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're not alone in this.<eos> I am so sorry for what happened to your planet.<eos> I can't imagine what that feels like.<eos> But together, we're gonna protect this one.<eos> It wasn't just my planet...<eos> J'ONN J'ONZZ:<eos> We fought back. We'd known war.<eos> But not like this.
- (GRUNTS) - (GASPS)<eos> (KARA BREATHING HEAVILY)<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I can't let you stop me.<eos> (GROANING)<eos> J'onn.<eos> J'onn, J'onn, listen to me.<eos> I lost everything.<eos> (VOICE BREAKING) Everyone.
Ker-rah.<eos> If you need me, I will be in my office.<eos> Hey, so, I'm confused.<eos> Is it Ker-rah or Kara?<eos> (CHUCKLES) It's Ker-rah to your mom.<eos> And Kara to literally everyone else on the planet.<eos> And beyond.<eos> Gotcha. Um...<eos> Kara, I wanted to say thank you.<eos> For all of this.
- Allison Steele?<eos> - No, that's NEW.<eos> - Carol something.<eos> - Carol Miller.<eos> How many tickets they got us down for? - 100?<eos> - I have a call in to Stein for more.<eos> This your thing at the Academy?<eos> - Put me down for 10.<eos> - For the New York Dolls?<eos> No, the fucking Ice Capades.
- No, that's NEW.<eos> - Carol something.<eos> - Carol Miller.<eos> How many tickets they got us down for? - 100?<eos> - I have a call in to Stein for more.<eos> This your thing at the Academy?<eos> - Put me down for 10.<eos> - For the New York Dolls?<eos> No, the fucking Ice Capades.<eos> Yes, the New York Dolls.
- What does that mean?<eos> - It means I quit.<eos> Get your shit and get out and don't fucking come back.<eos> I never want to see you again.<eos> Feliciano's doing "Midnight Special."<eos> Should get us a bump on "Compartments."<eos> Don't touch that bear claw.<eos> Every fucking morning, when have I ever eaten a bear claw?<eos> - You fucking touch all the donuts.<eos> - Holy fucking fuck.
He's a scumbag.<eos> You're right, a fucking weasel.<eos> But still, to do this, set you up, it requires forethought.<eos> He's too stupid, Corrado.<eos> Oh, then maybe you're not.<eos> All I'm saying is it was a coincidence.<eos> - I don't like coincidences.<eos> - You said yourself there were five people in the room.<eos> - It could it be... - What the fuck is that supposed to mean?<eos> - Nothing.
Last week... he... he came by the office.<eos> Him and the other guy, Del Greco.<eos> They were wearing very similar raincoats.<eos> The London Fog kind.<eos> Was it a stolen shipment or not?<eos> Maybe you can check that out.<eos> Sure, maybe.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> Next week, then?<eos> Maybe the week after?
Do you think Geordie's all right?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - This case, it feels like he's been hanging back.<eos> You know what he's like normally, full steam ahead.<eos> I'm just... - worried about him. - Have you tried asking him?<eos> - Well, of course.<eos> - I mean, really asking.<eos> I've got brothers.<eos> I know you boys would rather play cards and joke about your privates than have a proper conversation.<eos> Backgammon.
After letting Phil force Gary to drink that water.<eos> - Oh, that again?<eos> - Ducking this case?<eos> - I am not ducking anything!<eos> - What are you doing then?<eos> I had a visit from Mya.<eos> She needs to know what's going on.<eos> Her husband didn't even tell her he was a spy.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Our jobs.
Thank you.<eos> Are you busy?<eos> We're not talking about work.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Eddie Jones is kicking up a fuss.<eos> Thought you'd want to know.<eos> For the record, I would have won.<eos> You look well.<eos> So do you.<eos> Damn you.
Hey, hey!<eos> Easy now.<eos> That's what Eddie taught.<eos> You ever considered a change of career?<eos> What, go straight?<eos> Where's the fun in that?<eos> Your boy got shot, innit?<eos> Eddie said the bloke should have finished the job.<eos> You wrestling with it, aren't you?<eos> With what?
I knew it was too soon to scrap that pram.<eos> We need to stick you in it, you're that naive.<eos> We can agree to disagree... can't we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - All right, Mr Chambers?<eos> - Mr Lawson.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> How have you been?<eos> Do you believe in ghosts?<eos> In ghosts?
We've got stacks of them in the house.<eos> Thank you, Mr Chambers.<eos> I er...<eos> I do feel calmer.<eos> Clearer.<eos> They say you can see Lord Byron's ghost swimming in Byron's pool, just below the weir.<eos> I say any undergraduate in his birthday suit looks like Lord Byron.<eos> Easy not to believe in 'em till you've seen 'em for yourself.<eos> Goodness, Mrs M. Have there been many?<eos> My Uncle Bert.
Maybe she thought she'd be the next Mrs Lawson.<eos> So in the end, she couldn't forgive him for marrying the secretary.<eos> - (LAUGHS SOFTLY) - What?<eos> - You love all this, don't you?<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> It's true, though.<eos> Why do I spend so much time looking for the bad in people?<eos> Mm, when you don't like seeing it through to its conclusion.<eos> I don't like murder.<eos> Even for murderers.
But she stopped being suicidal.<eos> What irony!<eos> The year before her death was the happiest she'd ever been.<eos> So he had to do the job himself.<eos> I think he thought I just wanted to hear it.<eos> That I'd let him go.<eos> You have blood on your hands.<eos> Is that what Anna would have wanted?<eos> I feel guilty for many things...<eos> But this?
No.<eos> It's my job to serve God.<eos> And what?<eos> That's it, is it?<eos> You've just now remembered you're a vicar?<eos> I could lock you up, for perverting the course of justice.<eos> You do your job.<eos> I'll do mine.<eos> I've booked a table for three at the Garden House Hotel.<eos> For three?
Okay, here he is.<eos> Dennis Price, A.K.A. "Klip."<eos> Three arrests for assault and one for weapons possession.<eos> Nothing since 2009, though, ma'am.<eos> And now he's a religious leader.<eos> Did Daniel and all his gang find Jesus at once?<eos> Or did they find a safe place to land to process and distribute heroin?<eos> Not to mention money laundering. Any luck?<eos> This heroin is from the 28th Street Bloods operation, but the boy who sold it to me already has defense lawyers.<eos> Plural.
And Emile says, "he's been all over me about the third guy."<eos> Who we could still arrest for the murder of Officer Reese?<eos> Emile snitched before.<eos> He just spent over 24 hours with the L.A.P.D. Sharon:<eos> So we thought Emile was afraid of prison. Maybe it was Buddha.<eos> Bring Buddha downtown.<eos> See where he was during Tamika's murder.<eos> No fresh injection points, other than the one that killed your victim.<eos> So he wasn't a habitual user?<eos> Well, not recently.
Why did you put up Emile when he got out of prison, if you two went your separate ways?<eos> Look, it wasn't like there was exactly a welcoming party for him returning back to the neighborhood.<eos> So I figured, I'd put him up for a bit.<eos> Yo, where is he?<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> Yo, how long you gonna keep doing this?<eos> Do I have to get a lawyer?<eos> 'Cause when people read me my rights, -I get a little antsy.<eos> -You want us to arrest you?<eos> For what?
Far as we know, he hasn't broken the law.<eos> You know, his girlfriend and his little boy were just murdered.<eos> Barnes is probably somewhere drinking it off.<eos> That's what I did, after my husband... You know.<eos> How 'bout you?<eos> When my wife died?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I drank... For a night.<eos> It just made it worse.<eos> One night?
I just kept telling myself one day someone would be held accountable.<eos> - Car. - Blue.<eos> Of course, nothing says that Barnes has to show up in the same vehicle that picked him up at County. No.<eos> So you think holding someone accountable changes things?<eos> What do we do for a living, Julio?<eos> Yeah, if I didn't think holding someone accountable was important, I'd take a job at my father's company selling plumbing supplies.<eos> He's never been shot at, drives home around 6:00, and takes my mother to Hawaii three weeks a year. Sounds good.<eos> It's not my kind of life.<eos> Finding the bad guy, hearing him say, "I did it," that's what keeps me going.<eos> Accountability.
Dennis!<eos> You don't understand what you have done.<eos> Dennis Price may be trafficking drugs but he did not kill any of the victims.<eos> Provenza:<eos> Now, why do you think that? Just because he denied it?<eos> No.<eos> Because he shot at Jon Barnes several times at close range in a small motel room, and he missed... something our shooter never would have done.<eos> The big brother I grew up with... he would have been proud of what I accomplished.<eos> Proud of you?<eos> Proud of you?
Wait.<eos> Elena, wait!<eos> Elena, Elena.<eos> Okay, Oscar, Oscar!<eos> - Elena, just let me talk to him.<eos> - Please. Please.<eos> - He killed two people.<eos> He hurt one of our own.<eos> - Where are you taking him?<eos> - Somewhere safe.
Yours is already over.<eos> I care about my people.<eos> Your people?<eos> You wanted to be a great man.<eos> You still want it.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Then let them go.<eos> Give them permission to run.<eos> Where will they run to?<eos> North.
He is part of the firm's new apprentice scheme and will be working with me today.<eos> - I'm going to instruct him in grouting.<eos> - Right.<eos> Nice to meet you, Nathan.<eos> I'm Milo Khoury.<eos> At Qualia Global Systems, we're developing the next generation of synthetic technologies.<eos> Doing anything I'd understand, Mats?<eos> Hacking the Pentagon.<eos> I'll see if they know where the cafetière is.<eos> Early lecture?
We're already fully optimised.<eos> 99.8% capacity.<eos> Yeah, and running hot.<eos> Q takes up about 6%.<eos> So deleting him would mean V could stretch out a little.<eos> We're not deleting Q.<eos> What, you figured out a way to stabilise him?<eos> No, but I'm not giving up yet.<eos> Rent some outside rack space.<eos> With what?
Then he stops.<eos> And my heart's coming out of my chest.<eos> You got buck fever.<eos> Uncle John's got buck fever.<eos> That's not true, Casey.<eos> Your daddy's a liar.<eos> How big was the rack?<eos> It was huge.<eos> Where are you supposed to look when you shoot, Casey?<eos> At the body.
The Beast?<eos> No.<eos> Can I kiss you?<eos> I wanted to kiss the other girl with the dark hair, but she's in trouble.<eos> So, do you want to?<eos> I mean, I don't know much about kissing, though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> One...
Well, it's only $300, but with all of Jesus's plane tickets and Callie and Jude's legal bills, it's just...<eos> You know, we're starting to get a little behind, I think.<eos> Lena: It's making my head hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Ma.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning, Sharon.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> Oh, I was just... I was taking a walk.<eos> - This early?
Uh, it was Jack Downey, I think.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You startled me.<eos> I was just taking a walk.<eos> Another one?<eos> Gotta get my steps in.<eos> So which picture should I use?<eos> - That one.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You startled me.<eos> I was just taking a walk.<eos> Another one?<eos> Gotta get my steps in.<eos> So which picture should I use?<eos> - That one.<eos> - That one.
No place you can go in the world ain't got no black people.<eos> We was the first ones on this planet.<eos> I been here a long time... but I'm from Cuba.<eos> Lotta black folks in Cuba, but you wouldn't know it from being here, though.<eos> I was a wild li'l shorty, man.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Runnin' around with no shoes on when the moon was out.<eos> This one time...<eos> I run by this old...<eos> This old lady.
You feel me?<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Do you feel me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I feel you.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> Boy, please, you know you can stay here any time you need to, okay?<eos> Any time.
Yeah, it has, man.<eos> So, uh, where you at now, man?<eos> Georgia.<eos> Atlanta.<eos> I've been up here ever since...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, man, that's what I heard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, man, I'm sorry about all that...<eos> All that...
That's good, mama.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think it is too.<eos> I really do.<eos> So, you still in them streets?<eos> Didn't come all the way the hell to Georgia to have you fallin' in the same shit, Chiron.<eos> - Im'ma go. Im'ma go...<eos> No, no, no, no, you gon' listen!<eos> To who, ma? Huh?<eos> To you?
Whatever, Eliot.<eos> Welcome to the Physical Kids' Cottage.<eos> It's the single best place on campus for a number of reasons that will become clear as soon as you taste our signature cocktail.<eos> I-I've got to...<eos> Try on this dress I have.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> It's made exactly for those assets you're hiding underneath that pilgrim tent.<eos> Yes, you must.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Après moi.
Okay.<eos> Let's find a way out of this shit hole.<eos> You can't help and I can't help you, and it's just...<eos> To send your message, press one.<eos> To erase, press two.<eos> Deleted.<eos> Ho, ho, ho, you little piece of shit.<eos> You ratted me out.<eos> - I told the truth.<eos> Not all of it.
Which is why I'm so pleased to see you sitting there like you don't have an Emerson's in your pocket to repel any spell to wipe your mind.<eos> You stole that.<eos> Who stole it?<eos> Relax, nobody's taking your mind today.<eos> We'll make something of you yet.<eos> I'll tell the school one more chance, probation.<eos> They'll respect my call.<eos> Don't make me regret it.<eos> Don't hop back on the garden path like some little lemming, or I'll erase everything and start you over entirely, for your own good.<eos> The garden path?
There are reasons we teach this curriculum precisely the way that we do.<eos> Skipping around, focusing on all the wrong things, lack of guidance... these are all extremely dangerous.<eos> There are certain energies, certain spells, which are far too powerful for one magician alone.<eos> If you lose control, they will turn against you.<eos> They will kill you.<eos> They will consume you.<eos> Change you... into something else.<eos> - Now that I have your attention.<eos> We test to discern your discipline.<eos> Your area of concentration.
Life.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Let's not talk.<eos> Shit!<eos> How long were you to douchebags gonna leave me out there?<eos> - Oh, never mind that.<eos> Now you're with your people.<eos> Cheers to that.<eos> Good God.<eos> Cheers.
I mean, what's going on?<eos> - You don't remember? - I...<eos> I was at school, I think, and... And then I fell asleep at a party, and then I'm here where none of that ever happened, and...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Oh, man.<eos> - No.<eos> You came to find me.<eos> - I did?<eos> - To save me.<eos> But first, we have to break the illusion.<eos> - The illusion?
- That can strangle, suffocate...<eos> - Okay, what if you watched me the whole time?<eos> - No one has that kind of time.<eos> - I need to put these pages back together.<eos> - You need to get to music therapy.<eos> - Music is a way for us to express and receive feeling in a way that is safe and fun and sometimes illuminating. So who'd like to begin?<eos> - Oh, God, please not that one song.<eos> - Ah, I'm sorry.<eos> What was that, Penny?<eos> - Oh, that one song, please, no.
- Music is a way for us to express and receive feeling in a way that is safe and fun and sometimes illuminating. So who'd like to begin?<eos> - Oh, God, please not that one song.<eos> - Ah, I'm sorry.<eos> What was that, Penny?<eos> - Oh, that one song, please, no.<eos> It gets in my head, and it never leaves. - Oh, which song is that?<eos> - "Michael Rowed the Boat Ashore."<eos> - Everything here is me.<eos> - All right, everyone, why don't we kick it off with the Beatles?<eos> - "Helter Skelter." Helter Skelter," please!
You know what I mean?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do. I'll be right back.<eos> Are you gonna finish that?<eos> So, what else is going on with Fost and Found?<eos> Is that lady really gonna put all that money into it?<eos> Justina?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> She wants me to do a photoshoot next weekend.<eos> A photoshoot?
That's... awesome.<eos> Anyway, what I'm saying is that it's best just to focus on how nice it's going to be when you do see Connor as opposed to how bad it feels when you don't.<eos> - I'll try.<eos> Thanks, Grandma.<eos> - You bet.<eos> Well, it's nice to see that somebody around here appreciates my advice.<eos> As opposed to my daughter, who, you know, if I say orange, she says tangerine.<eos> You know, when she was little, the only way I could ever get her to do anything I really wanted her to do - was say, "oh, don't do that."<eos> - Did that work?<eos> Every time.
How do we know that you'll be able to follow through on all these promises of yours when the Vice Principal is your own mother?<eos> Well, last year I led the entire sophomore class on a walkout to protest against the firing of one of our favorite teachers, and my mother re-hired him.<eos> Or, I'm sorry, were you not there for that?<eos> Mariana, what's your position on prescription drugs being sold to students at Anchor Beach?<eos> Um, well, obviously, I mean, I'm against it.<eos> It's definitely something that we should combat.<eos> Lexi, what's your stance on having free condoms in the bathrooms?<eos> - (crowd gasps) - Well, I, um...<eos> Safe sex is important, and we obviously want to prevent pregnancy,<eos> At the time, or the morning after?
Yeah, why not?<eos> Well, Shakespeare's pretty... intense.<eos> Well, you know, we'll edit down the play, you know, to basic story points, and we'll make all the lyrics in modern English.<eos> Still, it sounds like a lot of work for a senior project.<eos> Well, it'll be fun.<eos> And this will give you a chance to pour all that heartbreak into it.<eos> You know, like a catharsis.<eos> That's really why I thought of it.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> No problem.
Give me the blaster, quick.<eos> Ready.<eos> Aim.<eos> Fire!<eos> Check the barrel.<eos> Ah, that never gets old.<eos> Great.<eos> Now I have two headaches.<eos> Let's blast it.<eos> On three.
Irritating,evento peoplejustwatching, theman-bun!<eos> Over-ratedandover-exposed, theKardashian!<eos> You get that I can kick your butt, right?<eos> My bad.<eos> There is an agreement.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Free trade.<eos> For tomorrow, I want everybody to become familiar with every single member of the Wu-tang Clan.<eos> We're gonna take a little trip to the Bronx.<eos> So,inconclusion...
You wanna shred the actual rules.<eos> Every stupid rule in this dumb Code of Conduct.<eos> Leo, are you kidding me?<eos> And get kicked out of another school?<eos> I would be disowned.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> 'Cause we're gonna be careful and nobody's gonna know it's us.<eos> So you're saying we do it anonymously?<eos> Exactly!
No!<eos> Dude.<eos> I can't believe people are actually into our work. Bro.<eos> We're trending, Rafe!<eos> This is the work of the legends.<eos> Hey.<eos> Done.<eos> I wish there was one person who I could share all this with.<eos> What, like, besides me?<eos> No way!
Where am I?<eos> Love you.<eos> Well, hold on a second now.<eos> Wait till you see what I got for you. Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh-oh. Jules, when I think about us, I think about one word.<eos> Cramazing.<eos> Crazy amazing.<eos> Right.<eos> More like "crawful." Yeah.
You go do whatever you gotta do, and I'll take care of this.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck.<eos> All right.<eos> Reveille!<eos> Let's go, turd!<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Count of three, or I'm coming in, i swear!<eos> One...
No, no, that would be insane.<eos> I'd forgive you.<eos> Sorry?<eos> If you slept with someone else.<eos> But I haven't.<eos> No, I know. I'm just saying, if you have, I would forgive you.<eos> One mistake in ten years is not that bad.<eos> I'm sure it's not if you're the one who's made it.<eos> Look, all I'm saying is I forgive you.<eos> For what?
Because I'm a grown-up?<eos> Because it's weird. Jesus, I just thought...<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, what the hell?<eos> Are you sure you want me back? Yes.<eos> And not just for the kids? Cos me and the kids are doing pretty well with the whole weekend access thing.<eos> No, for me.<eos> For me.<eos> I want us to be together again.<eos> No more sex with young men? No, of course not. Or anyone.
Do you copy?<eos> Captain, Zebra is compromised.<eos> We've got MSS crawling all over the place.<eos> We'll get to rally point Bravo when able.<eos> I say again, rally point Bravo when able.<eos> MSS on all sides.<eos> We're outgunned.<eos> We need a choke point.<eos> There.<eos> Through the bar.
Now, I'm gonna do a formal debrief when we get home,<eos> - but I need you to talk to René.<eos> - Why?<eos> He's been held captive for three months.<eos> - And?<eos> - We need to know now what he might have said.<eos> Now, he knows you best.<eos> He'll talk to you.<eos> He didn't break.<eos> Nine lives and then some.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Why won't they airlift you out?<eos> The Brits aren't sending any more planes in occupied territory.<eos> They lost six in the last two weeks.<eos> So Mayhew's arranged an extraction for Alfred, myself and now René.<eos> - Across the border.
Good afternoon.<eos> Seeing you again.<eos> - It suits you.<eos> - What does?<eos> Being in charge.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The only leaders I've known who didn't feel like imposters were imposters.<eos> - You knew?<eos> - Every minute.
"France libre?"<eos> I hear these are everywhere now, huh?<eos> Clever.<eos> You can't be arrested for using currency.<eos> Can I keep it?<eos> A souvenir?<eos> Don't worry; I'll buy you a drink.<eos> We don't want a Luftwaffe getting a bad name, do we?<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Not sure about you.
I don't have enough to do?<eos> There's gonna be many pissed- off Germans looking for my team.<eos> Right.<eos> What if we can throw them off their trail?<eos> Last time, we shared a bed.<eos> - Just what I was thinking.<eos> - Damn cot squeaked.<eos> - Not when you go extra slow.<eos> - Extra quiet.<eos> Back to the lounge by separate doors.
No. No.<eos> No.<eos> I'll use the clinic as my home base. I'll work out of my own office, regardless of how we split this up.<eos> I-- You're suggesting we just both sit in our offices, you with your clients and me with mine?<eos> Two practices sharing the same space. It happens all the time.<eos> I'm just, uh, surprised your new husband is so agreeable to you staying in St. Louis, given everything.<eos> My husband is remarkably understanding.<eos> So, the only way for Masters and Johnson to continue while the actual Masters and Johnson do not--<eos> We would have to hire new people.<eos> New partners.
We just got the call.<eos> It's on.<eos> Make the arrangements.<eos> Girl might be tricky if we can't put her in Gen Pop.<eos> We're transferring her planet-side.<eos> It'll be dealt with on the other end.<eos> She's just a kid.<eos> Here's the thing about kids, Herv... they grow up to become adults.<eos> What about the one who lawyered up...<eos> Moss?
1992.<eos> Do you have the names of the adopted children?<eos> The orphanage's archives were destroyed in a flood in 2002, unfortunately.<eos> Yes, unfortunately, but maybe Mother Élisabeth...<eos> Thanks, Sister.<eos> Call us when Mother Élisabeth is feeling better.<eos> Come on.<eos> The register.<eos> - It was destroyed.<eos> - No, the library register.
- Who are similar?<eos> Yes.<eos> We were inseparable.<eos> We did everything together.<eos> The amazing thing was I can always tell how he's feeling.<eos> Right now, I can tell you, my brother's thirsty.<eos> You're very alike.<eos> - He's very thirsty.<eos> - Ah, sorry!<eos> To Élise.
My dad's always talked about her, since I was a kid.<eos> - He loves her so much.<eos> - So he doesn't bear a grudge.<eos> No.<eos> I've always dreamed of meeting her.<eos> That's why I went to police school.<eos> And I asked to work in your group.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> I'm pregnant, but I'm not sure motherhood is my ideal job.<eos> To your pregnancy.
- He loves her so much.<eos> - So he doesn't bear a grudge.<eos> No.<eos> I've always dreamed of meeting her.<eos> That's why I went to police school.<eos> And I asked to work in your group.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> I'm pregnant, but I'm not sure motherhood is my ideal job.<eos> To your pregnancy.<eos> To my pregnancy.
- Drop your weapon.<eos> - Dmitri.<eos> Drop your weapon.<eos> Drop it or I'll kill her.<eos> OK. It's done.<eos> I'm not armed.<eos> - Let her go.<eos> - Handcuff him.<eos> Behind his back.<eos> Kneel.
- No, it's satellite. - It works anywhere.<eos> Well, there's... obviously something's the matter with it.<eos> So is this the right way?<eos> I believe so.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, well, let's keep going then.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> I looked everywhere.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> For your foxglove.
A little boondoggle.<eos> We can blast off this morning.<eos> -Yeah, I'd have to close the store.<eos> -If a tree falls in the woods...<eos> That's fair.<eos> What?<eos> Fuck!<eos> You've got to... you've got to give me... you've got to give more of a warning when I'm on this thing.<eos> What'd you have in mind?<eos> Like, Catalina?
I don't put it anywhere.<eos> It's like he's always...<eos> -He...<eos> -He haunts you?<eos> You know, you do that thing where you go, "What if I'd taken the later bus?<eos> Or if I'd left the house a few minutes earlier?"<eos> It's like that every day, except the stakes I'm playing with are...<eos> I took a life.<eos> Someone who had... friends and parents, brothers and sisters... lovers.<eos> A person.
That's too late!<eos> Finally gonna smoke it, huh, Fet?<eos> You've been saving that for a month now.<eos> Better me than some German, eh?<eos> That is a very good point.<eos> I will never see home again.<eos> We make a pact here and now.<eos> We fight for each other. To survive this.<eos> For each other.<eos> No matter what.
Fet!<eos> Fetrovsky, wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> _<eos> Wiped out a nest of thousands of munchers.<eos> By the time we got to the surface, reinforcements overrunning Central Park.<eos> It was a bloodbath, Professor.<eos> You cannot defeat an army that can regenerate itself every few days, which is why we have to be more creative.<eos> Putting 'em in a box.<eos> Not just a box.
So is Staten Island, Red Hook, parts of Queens near the shore.<eos> We're pushing the munchers further out.<eos> Did you just say "munchers"?<eos> It's something this guy I know calls them.<eos> I believe that confidence goes a long way.<eos> The message is that we are winning.<eos> But the truth is, we don't have the manpower.<eos> At this current casualty rate, we can't push out any further.<eos> What's the kill ratio for the bioweapon?<eos> Around 75%... ballpark.
Alright, eyes everywhere.<eos> These things can move.<eos> - Patience, patience, patience.<eos> Sentinel munchers.<eos> They're like lookouts. Just get as close as you can to them without alerting them to your presence.<eos> Coming up on our six!<eos> Stay sharp.<eos> Hold fire!<eos> I can see a person down here<eos> - in a suit.
- Where is he?<eos> - He's safe.<eos> - Where is my son?<eos> How much of you is still alive in there?<eos> Enough.<eos> When His voice leaves me, when His leash loosens, I still feel sadness... like a void.<eos> Then the thirst drives those emotions away.<eos> But I am still here.<eos> We want the Lumen.<eos> The book?
- Welcome.<eos> - The Palmer Foundation...<eos> - Sit down.<eos> If you require medical attention, please have...<eos> You sure you wanna fill this out?<eos> It's worse than Harlem Hospital ER on a Saturday night.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> If our fingerprints get caught up in the system, we're gonna go back to the chain gang, you know that, right?<eos> What system?
- No, just a little woozy.<eos> - I think maybe you should<eos> - lie down for a sec...<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> I think we should carry on working.<eos> We really don't have to do this right now.<eos> That was probably the Master's signal, right? The... same thing that incapacitated those people on the plane.<eos> Well, a very limited version of it 'cause we were only playing back the audio component.<eos> So, if we'd heard the Master's full-spectrum signal, we'd probably be paralyzed by now.<eos> Exactly.
- Topless.<eos> - OK, topless with these... divine, big, beautiful breasts, and she came to look after me.<eos> And we just start kissing.<eos> Like, tongues everywhere kissing.<eos> That wouldn't do anything for you?<eos> Meh!<eos> All right.<eos> So, she starts straddling me, and my hands are just all over her.<eos> And then suddenly, we just stop and look at you.<eos> Yeah, you.
What did the Master offer you for it?<eos> - My son.<eos> - The Lumen will bring the Master out of hiding.<eos> When he comes for it, I'll kill him.<eos> How do I know you can get the job done?<eos> I've been preparing for this "job"<eos> for over 1000 years.<eos> Alright, baby, you're doing great.<eos> Just breathe deeply. In... out.<eos> - Enough with the breathing.
But I must enquire, for what purpose do you desire to possess this abomination?<eos> The truth, if you must know it, is that this being you call a "leech," and whom you have caged and whipped like a cur, is a hybrid creature.<eos> Half-human, yes.<eos> And half-strix.<eos> A strix?<eos> But he does not resemble a strix as I have seen them drawn.<eos> They have black hair and curved fangs.<eos> Oh, by Orcus's sword, what have I done?<eos> Ask yourself, how much is it worth to you to remove its curse from your and your family's souls?<eos> Again.
You've already lost.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> _<eos> We can play out the next six moves, or you can just knock over your king right now.<eos> Maintain some dignity.<eos> Yeah, it's not gonna happen.<eos> Fine, it was bullshit.<eos> But this game is so boring!<eos> Yeah, well, I think it's over, anyway.<eos> Behind you.
I want these answers just as much as you do.<eos> Wait right here.<eos> _<eos> Yes?<eos> What is it?<eos> Mr. Kruger?<eos> My name is Roald Pirk.<eos> I believe you are expecting me.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Just a moment.
I feel better already.<eos> You really think the Egyptians trapped an Ancient inside this sarcophagus?<eos> Yes.<eos> And he's probably still there.<eos> I should have thought of this before, as I did something similar once.<eos> Not to an Ancient, but to a sentient strigoi.<eos> He'd always been a monster, a psychopath, even as a human.<eos> _<eos> What you got in that thing, man?<eos> A rabid dog.
So he has lost faith in you.<eos> Should I question your ability to do this?<eos> No-no, I can do it.<eos> He still needs me.<eos> Of that, I am certain.<eos> Otherwise, I would already be dead.<eos> You can find him?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> I will.<eos> To a new alliance.
This could be a game changer.<eos> At least I tried.<eos> Hey.<eos> I wish you the best of luck.<eos> Not a whiff of spooge.<eos> Thought for sure the feelers would be down here.<eos> We better find one soon.<eos> Time's running out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
Hello, Father.<eos> You have another son?<eos> Um... Hey, it's almost lunchtime.<eos> We don't wanna lose our table.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I heard you had a heart attack.<eos> I'm relieved to see you seem to be on the mend.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - To thank you.<eos> - For what?
_<eos> - What are you talking about, man?<eos> They're cops!<eos> All right?<eos> They don't give a shit about us.<eos> _<eos> We can't wait this out.<eos> Yo, come on!<eos> Open up!<eos> Out!
- Oh, hold on.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's on.<eos> Three of our teams<eos> - have engaged the strigoi.<eos> - Any news from Fet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Ugh. About 20 blocks to go.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - This old water tunnel.
They're learning their environment, developing.<eos> And they say we're winning.<eos> Well, it's pretty hard to stamp out a bug that doubles its numbers every couple of days, you know.<eos> Councilwoman Faraldo talks about how we're taking back this city.<eos> You and I are never gonna see that day.<eos> Just like the song says.<eos> An optimist, huh?<eos> That's why I'm making the glass half full turn empty.<eos> Here you go.<eos> To tonight.
Go on.<eos> I am willing to remove myself from the game, leave New York, withdraw all my support for the Master.<eos> You'll forgive my disbelief.<eos> Oh, I am still essential to the Master.<eos> And there are still a few critical moves to be made, which require my participation if they are to succeed.<eos> If I abandon the Master, you will gain a massive advantage over him.<eos> For that, I want something in return.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> The formula.<eos> What formula?
Mom?<eos> Zack!<eos> Mom, I can't breathe.<eos> Help me.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What did the Master offer you for it?<eos> My son.
Ah. We killed the Master, right?<eos> I saw his head go plop.<eos> We should celebrate with a drink.<eos> I mean, seriously, I'm worried, Professor.<eos> You should exercise<eos> - your facial muscles more.<eos> - Mr. Fet, this is me happy but we still have work to do.<eos> That deceitful, half-human, full-on thief decapitated the King Rat, right?<eos> Come on, come on. Drink.<eos> Na Zdorov'ya! Hey?
Since when do you make these calls, Captain?<eos> You know what?<eos> I wanna see for myself what this gigantic favour that you've done for me looks like. Now.<eos> Get in.<eos> Our job here today is to clear all the tunnels between here and One Police Plaza.<eos> Got it?<eos> Where's our guns?<eos> We don't give guns to inmates.<eos> How stupid do you think we are?<eos> Pretty stupid.
What does that mean?<eos> He has not yet taken another body.<eos> But he will?<eos> Is that what's happening?<eos> With you, we will share nothing!<eos> We want our book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Lots of stealing books going around.<eos> I saw something.<eos> A red worm... crimson.
I'm good, thanks.<eos> Just the tip?<eos> You could say "I told you so" about the Douchebag Twins.<eos> Oh, can I?<eos> Okay, well, I told you so.<eos> I just can't believe that they'd be selling drugs in their own nightclub.<eos> Aside from that, everything should be as you remember it.<eos> Mostly everything.<eos> Thank you for your payment in full, by the way.<eos> Oh, my pleasure.
Right, okay, um...<eos> I got a piece of evidence.<eos> It's not gonna be admissible, though. I-I drew a little bit outside of the lines to--<eos> It's not gonna be admissible, then it doesn't count.<eos> I know, yeah, just listen, okay?<eos> I can link her to the Lobos murder plot.<eos> I fuckin' knew it all along, and no one fuckin' believed me, and that's fine, but if--<eos> Shit, let me get rid of this.<eos> One sec, okay? Sorry.<eos> One--one sec.
- Why? I know.<eos> I mean, after all, Freddie's got no criminal record.<eos> There's been no hint he's stolen from guests before.<eos> But then, I imagine no-one's brought in a quarter of a million pounds in hard cash before.<eos> So why?<eos> I mean, in a world where you get by on dollar tips here and there... I imagine that amount of money was just a bit too hard to resist, eh, Freddie?<eos> I mean, plus, it's stolen.<eos> So if someone took it,<eos> Marcus would never be able to report its theft to the police.<eos> Easy money, really.
But that's exactly what it is not.<eos> I think it's time we met the kitchen crew, don't you?<eos> So the last time you all saw Robert was when you left here in a taxi at 11:30pm?<eos> Yes.<eos> He wanted to stay here.<eos> At busy times, he'd often sleep over.<eos> He couldn't wait to plan the menu, and prepare for the following day.<eos> And... would he have stayed up all night?<eos> Preparing?<eos> No, not all night, no, but certainly well into the night.
He couldn't wait to plan the menu, and prepare for the following day.<eos> And... would he have stayed up all night?<eos> Preparing?<eos> No, not all night, no, but certainly well into the night.<eos> He was a total workaholic.<eos> And who else did he know on the island?<eos> Er, er suppliers?<eos> Decorators?<eos> No.<eos> No-one.
Meanwhile on his blog he posted a strange wish list.<eos> Jewellery?<eos> Jackson said girlfriends were mentioned.<eos> Does he have one?<eos> Doesn't look like it.<eos> His online profile says single.<eos> Doesn't take after his father, then.<eos> Well, whatever they were arguing about, he never mentioned it.<eos> There's only one way to find out why.<eos> Back in the Jeep.
Yeah, and I will do the catering!<eos> And I... Oh.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Our first wedding.<eos> So, who's next in line?<eos> Hey! Don't look at me, you know!<eos> It's like you said, sir, love can be found anywhere.<eos> It's very true.<eos> But until then... .. I guess you two will have to do.<eos> To us!

Bjorn?<eos> Lagertha.<eos> Kalf.<eos> Erlendur.<eos> Torvi.<eos> We heard you took yourself away into the wilderness.<eos> Why?<eos> - I went to find someone.<eos> - Who?<eos> Myself.
I can't.<eos> Bjorn!<eos> Bjorn!<eos> If you want to go with my son, then go with my son.<eos> I will look after your child.<eos> We have one life, Torvi.<eos> So go and live it.<eos> A toast!<eos> A toast!<eos> To Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex.

So that even an Emperor's crown would not sit untidily upon his head.<eos> An Emperor's crown?<eos> I cannot believe it!<eos> What... What are you saying?<eos> Do... Do you have any proof of this?<eos> I have the word of his mistress.<eos> And, as your Highness knows, a man will always divulge the truth first to his mistress, and only afterwards, if at all, to his wife.<eos> Very well.<eos> Let me talk to his mistress.<eos> For God's sake!
Both of you join us.<eos> - Fill the horns. - Sup.<eos> This is my younger brother, Halfdan.<eos> - He's keen to know you. - All right.<eos> So, you are the genius that built the boats that changed our world, and helped made Ragnar so famous!<eos> Why would he fall out with someone like you?<eos> Because I killed his pet Christian.<eos> Floki!<eos> Skol.<eos> To new friendships.
- Yeah!<eos> Have you ever met harbard?<eos> No, not I.<eos> Perhaps your mother has. I don't ever want to forget how you looked on our wedding day.<eos> Earl kalf is dead.<eos> Long live earl ingstad!<eos> You are the boat builder that helped make ragnar so famous.<eos> Why would he fall out with someone like you?<eos> Because I killed his pet christian.<eos> - To new friendships.
Erlendur...<eos> If you're willing to share a boat with a lot of women,<eos> Then you're welcome to come with me to paris.<eos> Firstly,<eos> I want to announce that we leave for paris in three weeks to the day.<eos> But today is today,<eos> And we are here to perform an important ceremony,<eos> In which my two boys, ubbe and hvitserk,<eos> Will receive their sacred arm rings.<eos> Kneel.
He has retreated.<eos> His chance to attack again has diminished.<eos> And in the meantime, we can continue to build our defenses against him.<eos> You talk as if you no longer need me to protect you.<eos> I do not wish to give you that impression.<eos> You should also know that I am carrying Rollo's child.<eos> How strange life is.<eos> So let me drink to the first child of our Frankish Viking alliance.<eos> Long may it continue.<eos> Salut.

The finger bone of st. Augustine.<eos> - Believe me.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please.<eos> And please, look, sir, sir...<eos> No, no!<eos> Go away!<eos> A splinter from the true cross.<eos> - You buy! It change your life.<eos> And cheap!
We already see what has happened. In England and now in frankia.<eos> But we look to the future,<eos> To you, prince alfred of wessex.<eos> Step forward, my son.<eos> I have something amazing to show you.<eos> Here in rome, we have many treasures.<eos> And here is almost the greatest of them.<eos> When our lord was taken to the place of crucifixion,<eos> What did the pagans make him carry?<eos> His own cross.
But I was hoping that I could cheat the fates.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Go away.<eos> Just, just go away!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Your highness.<eos> Your grace. Daughter.<eos> How grateful I am that. We can now announce that you are with child.<eos> The alliance between our peoples, Born of baptism and marriage, Is the only way to safeguard our future.<eos> In the meantime,
You have to respect me in my sacred condition.<eos> Many things are better here.<eos> Just a few things which were better before.<eos> Heave!<eos> - Pull!<eos> - Heave!<eos> - Pull!<eos> - Heave!<eos> - One, two. - Heave!<eos> - One, two. - Heave!
Nowhere else to live or die, but here.<eos> To be here now is the only thing that matters.<eos> So gather yourselves, Gather all of your strength.<eos> And all of your sweetness into an iron ball.<eos> For we will attack again and again.<eos> Until we reach and overcome their king, Or we die in the attempt!<eos> - We attack!<eos> - Attack!<eos> Attack!<eos> Attack!
Yeah, we're really doing this.<eos> You leave a note telling him you're not coming back?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> My Aunt Helen was in there.<eos> I was afraid she would find it before I left.<eos> You should let your dad know you're okay so he doesn't worry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, um... here, uh, take a video of me, and we'll send it.<eos> If I talk to him, he might convince me not to go.<eos> Alexa.
A digital bombshell went off today with ripples far beyond the tech sector.<eos> Hardware, software, and social-media giant Lookinglass is down, leaving its 2 billion users stranded, trading on its stock suspended, and its twin founders,<eos> Mary and Otto Goodwin, unavailable for comment.<eos> I need the CCTV in Otto's office from the last few days restored.<eos> I can dig that out, but, uh, I don't think that's a priority.<eos> We're practically stealing Wi-Fi from the coffee shop down the street.<eos> We're dead in the water here.<eos> I understand where we are, but I need to see what happened in my brother's office, and you need to do it.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Alexa.
3,000?<eos> And not just you and me, but minds who think like us.<eos> Mary would never have let me.<eos> A vaccine would have to be made.<eos> We'd need a live donor with the precursor.<eos> We can't use him.<eos> We need a... we need a clean donor who hasn't gone through the regeneration process.<eos> Yeah, I see that.<eos> For lack of a better word, you'd need a virgin.<eos> One minute!
I need to print... on paper.<eos> I don't think we have a paper printer.<eos> We're... we're paperless.<eos> We don't have one printer?<eos> There's one in childcare.<eos> My kid does projects on it.<eos> Bring it to Otto's office.<eos> "This search warrant hereby grants the sworn officer access to any and all property."<eos> You've done this before?<eos> Once or twice.
I'm back.<eos> No.<eos> I buried you.<eos> I told you, hmm?<eos> She is perfect.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Let me have her and I will make her perfect.<eos> No.<eos> Not this one.
Someone wants to kill you, Mary, today.<eos> Someone?<eos> Arthur, display the list.<eos> I run a high-profile company with millions of users and twice as many haters.<eos> We put out one update that doesn't improve their lives instantly, I get death threats!<eos> Kind of making my point for me, Mary.<eos> But why don't you just postpone it one day?<eos> Why?<eos> So he can move his bet to tomorrow?<eos> Or the next day?

You've ignored me, ignored my lawsuits.<eos> Then you go on TV and you wear your little white dress and you lie to the world.<eos> Go to the Iron Horse Campsite, 30 miles off Highway 61 at the Holston Exit.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> One hour.<eos> Come alone or she dies.<eos> One hour.<eos> Remember, wear your little white dress.<eos> I'll make you a trade...<eos> You for her.
Gracie is in trouble.<eos> Just let me go.<eos> Let me get out.<eos> Please let me go get her.<eos> We're just taking you in, okay?<eos> You hit someone? !<eos> No, I didn't hit someone.<eos> How you doing, kiddo?<eos> Thanks for coming for me.<eos> Of course.
Why?<eos> I heard what the witness said.<eos> And I've never seen a real monster before.<eos> And you're not going to now.<eos> Look, if what she thinks she saw is real, these people need to be stopped, and it's what I do.<eos> So just let me stop them.<eos> There is nothing to do.<eos> What, why?<eos> You already caught them?<eos> Them?
Shoot your own brother?<eos> I'm family.<eos> You think my son's just gonna walk away?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Not even gonna leave a $20 on my nightstand?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you for, uh... - My blood? - Yes.<eos> Not at all.
I don't understand.<eos> Is the DNA sample a match or not?<eos> From what I got off the glass you gave me, there are enough points of commonality for it to meet the criteria for a familial match, but the rest of it seems almost transgenic.<eos> I'm sorry, trans...?<eos> Genic.<eos> Yeah, like, the way you would modify corn against insects or cows to give more protein-rich milk.<eos> But the sample came from a man, so...<eos> Something's either funky with my machine or real funky with that DNA.<eos> Can you get me another sample?<eos> Yeah, but the match.
I think he's trying to get his dad's attention.<eos> "Out of darkness, the Sun."<eos> It is a message... for Duke.<eos> It's a pun.<eos> "Out of darkness... the Son."<eos> Alexa!<eos> No, if this is about that man this morning, no need to explain, but I do have to tell you I am so happy for you.<eos> You work so hard, and you take care of your brother.<eos> And if you want to enjoy the pleasures of a man, even one who doesn't offer any intellectual challenge at all...<eos> Alexa.
Why... why don't you just be a good girl, huh, and make me that, uh, famous hangover cure?<eos> It was just one time.<eos> Gracie, Gracie, Gracie.<eos> Don't do drugs.<eos> Understand?<eos> But Dad brings me all the good stuff from the evidence locker.<eos> Hey.<eos> Not funny.<eos> The designer drugs kids do these days... in my day, all you needed was a little Mary Jane and some whiskey, and you were set.<eos> Your day?
He was always in trouble.<eos> Just boy stuff.<eos> His mother saw.<eos> I just thought rambunctious.<eos> Then came the business at Highland Hall.<eos> Then he did it again.<eos> And the company... oh, that kind of publicity is gonna hurt all of us... family, friends.<eos> What was I supposed to do... destroy everything just because I couldn't handle my kid?<eos> So many.<eos> At some point, I...
I told you to watch the right cross.<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> She doubled back.<eos> Her car's gone.<eos> Did you set up a perimeter?<eos> You mean have I done this before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I'm gonna cuff him 'cause he's a bad guy.<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> On your knees!
Is Asher okay?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Now what the hell did you do?<eos> I got shot.<eos> What's it look like?<eos> All right.<eos> You hang on.<eos> The ambulance is coming, okay?<eos> No.<eos> No ambulance.
And you're trying to keep this whole thing a secret, and you're not even easing up on your work load.<eos> And you're being so nice and giving me a tissue, and you're the sweetest ever, and I think it's too much for you.<eos> It's going to be okay, I promise.<eos> _<eos> Alexa, why don't you go clean up.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Arthur, show her.<eos> I've hacked into the cops' body cams.<eos> This is happening right now.<eos> On the floor!
No, you want to.<eos> I was watching you and Pritchard.<eos> Your pulse was elevated when you decided to let him go after those men.<eos> Do you know what caused that?<eos> _<eos> I know your mom hasn't told you about me, but I'm here now, all right?<eos> Me and your mom, we're all married up now.<eos> So it's gonna be all good and proper.<eos> Please, can't I just go home now, please? !<eos> - J-just one more night!
I have more than six months to live now.<eos> I don't want to prepare for my end anymore.<eos> I need to call off the merger.<eos> Now that the merger's off, I'm not going to be able to get Otto.<eos> I need you to get me Otto's lab work and notes.<eos> If I can't have Otto, I need his work.<eos> Don't forget what you want.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Delexda.<eos> Alexa.
I'm following this guy in the car down the block.<eos> Helen and Duval thinks he's changed, but he's up to something.<eos> I saw it.<eos> Who's this guy?<eos> Arthur, can we listen in on that car over there?<eos> My technology is only available to you if you are performing a public service.<eos> Is it a public service?<eos> Yes, it's a public service.<eos> I can access the car's Bluetooth.<eos> How many more times?
I can tell her.<eos> My old apartment, huh?<eos> Is it weird that she lives here?<eos> Not as weird as your living in the fake version of it in Mary goodwin's basement.<eos> What's the DVD?<eos> "The Notebook." She likes it.<eos> I'm using it to clean up your mess.<eos> My mess?<eos> I didn't break my oath as a law-enforcement officer.<eos> Lately.
I can see it worming its way through your head now.<eos> "This guy... he's a lot stronger than I am, isn't he?"<eos> Ask him again, Wally.<eos> Where's Mellenburg?<eos> Screw you!<eos> The both of you!<eos> What do you say we give him the full sheriff, huh?<eos> Wait. What's that?<eos> See, the full sheriff is when he counts to three and then you start crying.<eos> One, two...
You tell Agent Pritchard what you found out.<eos> Hi.<eos> You might want to get a pen.<eos> Okay, you take highway 30. Get off at the old road.<eos> And then, apparently...<eos> FBI, freeze!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Drop it!<eos> On the ground!
For his cooperation leading to the arrests.<eos> Helen, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> I just want to know...<eos> What you said to me then... is it still true?<eos> Will you leave, too?<eos> No.<eos> I will always be here with you, Otto.<eos> Nothing can ever change that.<eos> Okay. It's, uh, time to go now, Wally.<eos> To jail.
What do we do?<eos> You mention here that Mary and Pritchard have grown close, right?<eos> Oh, they would never admit it, but I can see it when they're together.<eos> All right.<eos> You're gonna use Pritchard to take Otto away from Mary?<eos> No, we're... we're just going to show Otto that the man he brought back to save his sister is taking her away from him.<eos> - That's...<eos> - Mr. Graff... sneaking into a lab is one thing, but if Mary were to find out that we turned Otto against her, her... her heart would break.<eos> There's got to be another way.<eos> Alexa.
It's Otto.<eos> I need blood samples from you as a basis for the universal cure.<eos> Once I have them, we won't be needing you anymore, so...<eos> It's Mary.<eos> Arthur says you've been sitting in your parked car.<eos> If you want, you know you can call.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Emma.<eos> There's something you'll want to come and see.<eos> On my way.
A-and he killed my friends.<eos> He tore them apart.<eos> Okay.<eos> It was a giant and he did it with his bare hands.<eos> Is there anything else you remember?<eos> I don't think he had ears.<eos> You been drinking tonight?<eos> Yes.<eos> For a few days running?<eos> All week.
All it needs now is money.<eos> Can I help with something else?<eos> Access the F.B.I. computers.<eos> Show me what Duval and Pritchard are working on.<eos> Yes, Mary.<eos> Two crime scenes with this left behind and no apparent connection between the victims.<eos> Arthur, use every bit of computing power Lookinglass has.<eos> Find a connection.<eos> I know I sound like Aunt Helen, but when you came to get me that night with the gun, for a second I thought it was him...<eos> Grandpa.
Keep your hands up!<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm sorry, is something wrong?<eos> Show me your papers!<eos> Now!<eos> Stop it!<eos> He's one of mine!<eos> You got what you came for, now go!<eos> Now then, how are you feeling?<eos> Better since last time, hm?
- Distract them.<eos> Take their guns, shoot them.<eos> Run.<eos> Good plan, if you're a cat.<eos> You'd need nine lives to make that work.<eos> The more Nazis you kill, the more come after you.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We wait for the right moment, better our odds.<eos> Max would work late almost every night but what can you do?<eos> Especially these days.
- Give it back, you pig!<eos> - Get off the street.<eos> (grunting) (boy): Let's go!<eos> Check the truck.<eos> Here.<eos> Stop!<eos> Put down the box and raise your hands...<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Behind the truck.
- not sustainable.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Martin.<eos> - Where do you sleep?<eos> How do you eat?<eos> There's always a way. At night.<eos> Behind the cafes.<eos> Yeah, you never know what you'll find.<eos> - Let's take him with us.<eos> - No chance.
- Why?<eos> - You're asking me to teach you things that make you the weapon.<eos> I don't know what you're really fighting.<eos> I fight ghosts.<eos> Maybe I fight for them.<eos> I'm not sure I know the difference anymore.<eos> Everyone's gone.<eos> Everyone I know.<eos> The Germans killed them?<eos> Me too.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What's her name?<eos> Fei Yen.<eos> All right, no need to draw blood.<eos> I won't pry.<eos> - I never did thank you.<eos> - What for?
Move!<eos> Move, move.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Get inside.<eos> There's a sharpshooter in the church.<eos> - Shooting soldiers.<eos> - Show me where!<eos> He went in there.<eos> In the tower.
If that tank doesn't move, we're done.<eos> It'll move if it's ordered to.<eos> Harry, how fast can you get a signal out?<eos> It's a disaster.<eos> They're all pinned down at the seawall.<eos> Do we have anything more recent?<eos> It's hard to find a radio man still alive on the beach.<eos> Communication's broken down.<eos> They're sending reinforcements<eos> - straight into machine gun fire.
Yeah, two life sentences.<eos> He's only up here for about two more months.<eos> Suspect in some prison fight case.<eos> Goes back to Otisville right after the trial.<eos> Is he in one of the interview rooms already, or... He should be.<eos> I made the call.<eos> The fuck?<eos> Stay close.<eos> Down on the floor!<eos> Down on the fucking floor!
If this condition is unacceptable, take it up with the president.<eos> Of course, Colonel.<eos> I hope we didn't get off on the wrong foot.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Every operation needs a well-defined hierarchy.<eos> I hope this will be an adequate space for you to do your work.<eos> -What, you're talking about this?<eos> This-- -This is more than adequate.<eos> - Gracias, Colonel.<eos> - Welcome.
I want everyone in his fucking family dead!<eos> - That fat fuck!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> --Listen, Judy... I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very sorry about all of these deaths.<eos> We have to accept that we lost this time.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I'll be with you until the end.<eos> And if you want to go ahead on against Pablo, just say so.<eos> We'll find strong allies.<eos> And people.
A showgirl. Michelle...something or other.<eos> On her way to her club.<eos> Didn't see anyone.<eos> Is it the same?<eos> Yes, Chief.<eos> No sexual assault?<eos> No, Maigret.<eos> It's your man again.<eos> Two stab wounds.<eos> One to the back of the neck, one to the chest.
What's your name?<eos> Marthe Jusserand.<eos> Police Officer Marthe Jusserand...sir.<eos> Did you get a good look at him, Marthe?<eos> For a second, sir.<eos> For a second his face was close to mine, but... ..I don't think I'd recognise him, sir.<eos> You saw the knife?<eos> A small knife.<eos> What was he wearing?<eos> A dark suit.
Yes.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Someone standing at a bus platform burnt the lapel with a cigarette.<eos> So...you're having it mended?<eos> Oh, no, no, I hate anything that's damaged, no matter what.<eos> You threw the suit away?<eos> Oh, no, I gave it away.<eos> I took it out with me one evening when I was walking by the Seine, as is my habit, and I gave it to a tramp.<eos> When?<eos> Oh, er, about a week ago.

She admires his muscles, his strong features, and the way sweat collects under this nipples.<eos> Mmm! That's nice, too.<eos> As with Adam and Eve, so the serpent sparks the sexuality.<eos> Well, now there's barf on the beach.<eos> So, the world didn't end.<eos> Well, then I'm gonna need your help finding my family so that I can kill my father.<eos> That's a story I'd like to hear, but we're very busy.<eos> This is the U.S. Navy.<eos> Everybody on this ship has a clear job to do... and a purpose.<eos> Whoa, indeed.
Steve!<eos> Hayley!<eos> Well, we came together and made it as a team, Steve.<eos> Looks like the person you'd least like to be stuck on a lifeboat with just saved your life.<eos> Listen to me jabbering on.<eos> I'm in the middle of a big bike race.<eos> On your left!<eos> All right, back to our mission.<eos> Operation destroy all the islands.<eos> Too many islands.
That's a fire hazard, isn't it?<eos> Well, it may be, sir, but... what a fire hazard!<eos> Please, will you talk to the Inspector?<eos> Ready your axe, Jackson.<eos> Ha ha! Thank you, sir.<eos> We're getting a tree! Ha ha!<eos> My mother will be marinating the goose by now.<eos> - A goose needs to be well sauced, Henry.<eos> Sometimes we eat it the night before.<eos> - On Christmas Eve?
Full of surprises.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you have, um... anything like a small duck or a capon?<eos> Smallest I got is four pounds and it's spoken for.<eos> What about a turkey?<eos> Ten's the least.<eos> - Nothing for a single person?<eos> - On Christmas?
What is it?<eos> There's something in the woods, it was coming after me!<eos> Something?<eos> What do you mean, something?<eos> A creature.<eos> And it was carrying a body - as if it was a feather pillow.<eos> - A creature?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Horns on his head.<eos> Blood-red eyes.
- Sirs, even if Lynch was the murderer, somebody's killed him now, - so we have another crime.<eos> - What are you still doing here?<eos> I think my efforts are better spent here on the investigation.<eos> Alright, Crabtree, what do you think?<eos> I think a third party killed McGowan and Lynch.<eos> Oh?<eos> And why would they do that?<eos> It would appear, sirs, for the sole purpose of destroying Christmas.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> My office.
Oh?<eos> And why would they do that?<eos> It would appear, sirs, for the sole purpose of destroying Christmas.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> My office.<eos> Krampus!<eos> - Who?<eos> - Kram... pus.<eos> Krampus.<eos> With a K.
- Oh sir, that is wonderful.<eos> I thought my Christmas Eve was going to be bleak, but... your place at the Windsor is just lovely, and the food is to die for.<eos> And Doctor Ogden, sir, she is lovely company.<eos> Really, I think that's important.<eos> And very attractive.<eos> As are you. I'm sure if you asked any lady, they would say as much.<eos> Julia?<eos> Julia, where are you, I've brought a...<eos> Unwrap me, William.<eos> - ... visitor.
Oh, please.<eos> Look at me, I'm hale and hearty and I can assure you: I am no danger to myself or anyone else, I promise you that.<eos> You're quite certain?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Now please.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Both you and I have important work to do tonight.<eos> Alright.<eos> Let's go catch a thief.<eos> - And a murderer.
Julia, wait.<eos> - Who did this to you?<eos> - It wasn't a who.<eos> - Where's Mr. Rankin?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Who brought you here?<eos> - It was a monster.<eos> It had horns, and had horrible red eyes.<eos> I have no time for fairy tales, Mrs. McGowan.<eos> The truth.
A rib spreader!<eos> Yours was getting old and rusty.<eos> Overuse, I imagine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I had this made especially for you.<eos> - My hat?<eos> - For the tree!<eos> Oh! Thank you.<eos> Shall we go to the hospital?<eos> In a moment.
You're not Chief Inspector Maigret.<eos> No.<eos> He's not available right now - I was hoping to speak to Maigret.<eos> If you sit and speak to me, I will relay everything you say to the Chief Inspector.<eos> If it's of importance.<eos> But it is important, that's why I need to speak to him.<eos> I saw the cream-and-blue car.<eos> The car that's in the paper?<eos> The car that's in the paper.<eos> This one.
None of the girls recognised him, sir.<eos> And the knife you found on this Poliensky, is the one that killed your cafe owner?<eos> Moers has confirmed it.<eos> Albert Rochain was not underworld, sir.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Now we will be supported by men from the 2nd arrondissement who will search the area.<eos> Everybody lock down a section of two blocks here and are picking up anyone that leaves.<eos> We're going to find a lot of rubbish and may not find his killer, but we need to find out where Poliensky was heading and discover who shot him.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Him?
Think about it.<eos> Think about it, boy, she knows too much.<eos> She's just a woman.<eos> There are others.<eos> Oh, no. He's under a lot of pressure at work.<eos> What, and you want a woman?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is that it?<eos> You want that?<eos> But not the old one?
It's fine, sweetheart.<eos> Please, this way.<eos> Nicole, it's very brave of you to come and see us today.<eos> Inspector Colombani tells me that you saw the faces of some of the bad people who came to your farmhouse the other day.<eos> I have a photograph here of a woman, and I'd like you to tell me if she was one of those bad people.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you want to hold my hand while we turn the picture over?<eos> Keep pushing. Aaaargh!<eos> Push.<eos> And again.
I am wearing today are worth more than you can make in a year.<eos> This man Tonnelier...<eos> Dacourt.<eos> ..would get to know some of the Czechs who would turn up for casual work at Citroen.<eos> He would manipulate them, sleep with their woman, and he heard them talk of the wealthy farms that they'd worked on in the summer in Picardie.<eos> He is a film producer.<eos> He is a ringleader of murderers and thieves.<eos> He kept them high on dope in conditions you wouldn't keep an animal.<eos> He got them to murder and rob the farms they knew in Picardie in order to fund his life at Maxim's and the George V. No.<eos> And you.
He was a good man.<eos> And happy, you know?<eos> He was always singing, Chief Inspector.<eos> He always wanted everyone to be happy.<eos> That's why he was good at running this place and...working in bars.<eos> And he was good to me.<eos> I'm sure he was.<eos> I knew I was lucky when I found him.<eos> Will you keep the bistro on?<eos> Absolutely.
Looks like I missed one though.<eos> All right, you can assist, but I'm in charge.<eos> Yeah, you're in charge.<eos> Check that ass.<eos> What the hell are you doing here aside from trying to send me to therapy?<eos> I told you, I did some research.<eos> I thought it would be a good idea for a story for the paper, plus I thought this would be a great way for us to really get to know each other.<eos> I mean, I want to know what's so great about this that you can't let go, bro.<eos> No one here is eager to get their picture in the paper, you got me?<eos> And which part of the paper?
Okay, relax.<eos> I was just talking about...<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I have a kid already.<eos> I don't need another one, so scram.<eos> Let me finish this by myself.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, I ran your crime scene samples six ways from Sunday.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Uh, nothing.
Thank you.<eos> It's just the first step in getting your daughter back.<eos> Come on!<eos> Welcome to the wrong side of the wrong side of the tracks.<eos> So where's Clark?<eos> - That's him. - Oh.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> There's Wally.<eos> Now, if our fly flag girl can step up, we're ready to begin.<eos> What the...?
Your office signed off on its delivery.<eos> Our office?<eos> What was in it?<eos> They didn't say.<eos> 94 minutes.<eos> That's all that stands between us and fiscal Armageddon, all because, as many believe, Republicans have collectively lost their minds.<eos> What started as simple brinkmanship on a Supreme Court nominee...<eos> - One second, sir.<eos> - ...has now expanded into all-out war<eos> - over the direction of our...
Yes, thank you.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> Did you see what the Republicans said?<eos> No.<eos> They're insane.<eos> What is this world coming to?<eos> We need to do something.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't been myself.<eos> I think I've been feeling a bit angry.<eos> About the world.
- London, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm Chip.<eos> - This is Dennis.<eos> - Yeah, well, she knows.<eos> I supply the wine at the restaurant.<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm on my way there now, actually, to start a shift, so...<eos> - A work shift?
- Oh, great.<eos> Yeah. - Man, I thought you liked this shit.<eos> - No, I do.<eos> It's super good for you, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Is somebody back there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe Kara?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh! What the fuck?
You scare pretty easy for a killer.<eos> You do your wife?<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> - Did you kill your wife?<eos> Did you?<eos> Where's Liam?<eos> - Where's Liam?<eos> ! - I don't know.<eos> He stopped coming to work.<eos> - When? - About a week ago.
No.<eos> We done?<eos> I can't believe Cornell backed the restraining order.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not okay.<eos> Good.<eos> She's been building a case against you, and part of it centered around your history of violence.<eos> First, you hit Steven Porter.<eos> Then she thinks I beat Kate...<eos> - And Tina.
How he cheated on you.<eos> With your best friend.<eos> - In your own house...<eos> - I got it.<eos> I was there.<eos> Happened to me.<eos> She has been a little paralyzed lately.<eos> No, I have not been paralyzed.<eos> I opened an online dating account.<eos> - Well, good for you. - Yeah.
- Yes, I am.<eos> - Are you bucking for my mini-fridge?<eos> - No.<eos> - I just wanted to say thank you. - Oh...<eos> This woman is a godsend.<eos> Aw, I'm really happy for you.<eos> - Call me anytime, okay?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> My phone is always on. Okay.<eos> Mute.
Grimy nigga though.<eos> You a grimy nigga.<eos> Pound that.<eos> I notice that tight-ass suit you got on ain't no hand-me-down.<eos> Ghost got you holding umbrellas for him?<eos> Like that Farnsworth Bentley nigga?<eos> Fuck nah, nigga.<eos> I'm moving up in the ranks.<eos> You know, he's taking me, you know, to meetings and shit, so it's cool.<eos> Okay, big time.
Thank you.<eos> Miss Karen.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I have been seeing your face all over social media.<eos> Well, that is my face.<eos> Now everyone will know James St. Patrick.<eos> They'll all know who you are.<eos> To reinvention.

I know it's scary, and I know there's a lot of people that don't want to see us together, but you can't let Paz get in your head.<eos> It's not just Paz.<eos> It's... everything.<eos> Did you ever wonder maybe everyone else was right and we're the ones who are wrong?<eos> No, I never think that, and I think that you should never think that.<eos> I'm not letting you go.<eos> You want food?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> You need to speak to me son?<eos> Money first.
- no need to fuss about it.<eos> - If it were me, I wouldn't be able to sleep until I got it off my mind.<eos> You're very sweet.<eos> - It matters.<eos> - It's the usual.<eos> He's busy with work and won't compromise.<eos> So he's using work as an excuse<eos> - to avoid you?<eos> - I know things are busy with a special guest in town.<eos> But lately,
And she caught him in a hotel with his secretary.<eos> - That's horrible.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But Franz would never...<eos> No.<eos> He wouldn't do something like that.<eos> Well, that's exactly what my cousin said.<eos> No.<eos> I know he had a ticket to a concert tonight.<eos> At ThéÃ¢tre de I'Opéra.
Have we met before?<eos> Ah, I don't think so, madame.<eos> Einen Goeringschnaps mit Eis, bitte.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, I'm not familiar with the German cocktails.<eos> Whiskey.<eos> You have this?<eos> Of course.<eos> No.<eos> Not this one.<eos> That bottle.
Any call you make won't be secure and will most likely be intercepted by Peng.<eos> Well, you're gonna change all that, right, Valkyrie?<eos> Getting close to Vietnam.<eos> We need to pick up our local pilot to guide us in.<eos> Subsurface, what do you hear?<eos> Dozens of small vessels in the area, sir.<eos> From the spin of their engines, I'd say nothing larger than a 50-footer.<eos> Small fishing boats, some outboard engines.<eos> A lot of reports about pirates running swarm attacks.<eos> Even on military ships...
Okay.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yep.<eos> He says he doesn't like your face.<eos> The hell should I know what he's saying?<eos> "Captain Chandler.<eos> Welcome to Asia.<eos> It is such an honor to meet you.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this moment."<eos> His words.
And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.<eos> Oh, it'll pass.<eos> Because you are going to push it until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.<eos> We may have support now...<eos> But by the time this bill gets onto the floor...<eos> You focus on the language, Congressman.<eos> Leave convincing the American people to us.<eos> Now, if you wanna work with us on this bill, I can stomach a gun-friendly candidate.<eos> What about you, Francis?<eos> The kill.
Nobody followed you?<eos> No one.<eos> I'm positive.<eos> You know, sometimes I have a student and something seems off.<eos> They look a little too old, you know?<eos> To be in college.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Xanax.<eos> Lucas came up here.<eos> To the campus.
- Buzzy, come on, good boy.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Good boy, good boy, good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Lord have mercy, I don't know what got into him.<eos> Oh, he's just letting us all know who's boss.<eos> Anybody need anything from inside?<eos> Hit me.<eos> You better slow down, big boy.<eos> Never.
It's... It's been a while since we done this is all.<eos> Yeah, well, there's a reason for that.<eos> - Look, Mark, I'm...<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> Trying to keep my head down.<eos> I shouldn't have lost my cool.<eos> I don't even wanna know.<eos> Look...<eos> Megan and I, we went to dinner the other night.<eos> Date night.
But I can't... Not until the last of them gets home safely.<eos> How many get to leave the hospital with their parents?<eos> Not enough.<eos> This is the latest from inside the cordon.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Hazmat guy painted one where the kids got infected at that party.<eos> It caught on.<eos> It's like the plague crosses in Europe or how they marked the houses during Katrina.<eos> Hold on.<eos> One second.
- 12 so far, at least.<eos> That reporter, Leo Greene, has been posting some pretty incendiary videos from inside the cordon.<eos> People are bound to have a reaction.<eos> Does that mean you're finally sending more cops in?<eos> For now, we have to make do with what we got.<eos> I'll set up a meet point for all the cops inside the cordon.<eos> All right. How many are here?<eos> Including you?<eos> 11.<eos> - For the whole cordon?
- We're close.<eos> What's happening in there?<eos> Crowd thickens.<eos> Think you can hold them?<eos> Yeah, as long as they just want a target practice.<eos> - You can't make me go...<eos> - Break it up!<eos> Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Full support!
Rough day, huh?<eos> Leo Greene is pond scum, king of the click-bait.<eos> I mean, the amount of lives that he risked...<eos> Yeah, it worked. He's gained almost a million followers since Wednesday.<eos> Well, I hate every one today, except you.<eos> You, I... I don't hate.<eos> You're the only one at the moment.<eos> You know, Jana, when this is over, I, uh... I don't want to spend another night away from you.<eos> Me either.<eos> Not for a really long time.
Me either, Lex.<eos> Well, let's see if they have an emoji for that.<eos> I just lost my Internet connection.<eos> Yes. You'll have a secure Internet and phone line tomorrow, but only you.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> The rest of the area will remain dark.<eos> After today's events, things were getting away from us.<eos> Anyway, lose control, we have no hope of getting it back.<eos> This was for the good of everyone.<eos> Everyone?
So how do you guys talk?<eos> Oh, we meet up once a day, fill each other in.<eos> It's not ideal, but we got to play the hand we're dealt, right?<eos> Why can't they send in more cops?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> I guess they don't want to risk them getting sick.<eos> You got anybody on the outside?<eos> Yeah, yeah. I got... I got people.<eos> No, I mean, like a girl.<eos> A girl?
I'm all too familiar with that dance.<eos> Hey.<eos> Everything OK?<eos> Yeah. Dr. Cannerts was looking for some allergy medicine for Britney.<eos> I'm afraid our pharmaceutical supplies are rather low.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm, uh,<eos> I'm heading out on patrol.<eos> Have you seen my... my black T-shirt?<eos> That one?
I bet she still has it.<eos> Ha ha. Yeah, she would.<eos> She, uh, she actually... she passed away when I was young.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> No.<eos> It was... It was a long time ago.<eos> You know, I don't know why, but I kept the mug.<eos> It's ugly, it leaks, and it mocks me from the cupboard when I'm home.<eos> This could be the first time I've gone more than a day without checking my phone.<eos> Like, ever.
Give him a hug for me, will you?<eos> I will.<eos> Hey.<eos> You guys need to get someplace safe too.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The only place we can.<eos> - Dad, we can't just leave.<eos> - We have to, honey.<eos> What, you want me to leave everything I have here?<eos> My friends, my family...
Also, I found a lab that'll do all the DNA testing.<eos> It's not that expensive, but it takes about a month.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> What?<eos> I want you to put all that stuff in my office along with your report.<eos> And get yourself cleaned up.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> He said I'd never be free of this.<eos> He was manipulating you, making you doubt yourself.<eos> What about you?
Thank you.<eos> It's our crib.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - Who says?<eos> State of Illinois.<eos> They can't just take it from us.<eos> I don't have time to explain foreclosure law to you.<eos> Those are the stairs where I broke my arm for the first time.<eos> Yeah, and the second.<eos> Oh, and the fifth.
- Yeah.<eos> - One will do.<eos> - All right, kiddo.<eos> - Oh, my. Shit.<eos> - I got you right in the-- Oh! - Should not have done that.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Wait!<eos> Hold up!<eos> - Bing, bang.<eos> - Right in the kisser!
- Oh, my. Shit.<eos> - I got you right in the-- Oh! - Should not have done that.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Wait!<eos> Hold up!<eos> - Bing, bang.<eos> - Right in the kisser!<eos> - And boom.<eos> All right.<eos> Me?
- Winston, you don't have to come.<eos> - No, but I want to.<eos> - Oh, don't, you're too sweet.<eos> - And I'm walking away.<eos> - You can stay.<eos> - It would be my pleasure to come.<eos> I... literally nobody wants you to come.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Hey. Can we talk?<eos> One second.
Hey. Can we talk?<eos> One second.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Why, did something of note happen?<eos> Someone I hooked up with once is potentially gonna live here.<eos> Totally fine with it.<eos> Okay.<eos> As long as we both agree that open communication is the key to a healthy relationship.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just one second.
But you...<eos> All right!<eos> Okay!<eos> Dad, you want to sit down?<eos> Hey, Oscar.<eos> I picked up our jerseys.<eos> Ah, cool, an old guy.<eos> Oh, my God, Marcus Murphy?<eos> Six-time All-Star, eight Gold Gloves?<eos> Yes, yes and yes.
Murph!<eos> You broke my guy!<eos> I couldn't stop him.<eos> I tried to take the ball away from him.<eos> He started throwing pinecones.<eos> Those little guys hurt.<eos> Wow!<eos> The Mets locker room.<eos> What a day, huh?<eos> Yes, what a day indeed.
- I'll go have a look.<eos> See if he's left a box?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You must be truthful, it's the only way.<eos> Christmas, it's...<eos> It's a struggle at the best of times, Inspector.<eos> I'm not making an excuse, it's just the way it is.<eos> But we had Martha's wedding coming up.<eos> When we got the Christmas pay-packet, Jacob Marley had docked Bob's wages.<eos> And not for the first time neither.
My oldest is, uh, 66.<eos> Was.<eos> She passed last year.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Well, that's young.<eos> What was it?<eos> Natural causes.<eos> I blame most of it on stress.<eos> So much more pressure than there was years ago.<eos> Back in our day --
WHEN THEY'RE READY, THEY'LL LEAVE.<eos> COULD BE ANY DAY.<eos> OH, AND IN THE DUCK'S DEFENSE, CLAIRE,<eos> YOU CAN'T STICK YOUR LEG OUT OF YOUR ROBE AT BREAKFAST AND THEN PRETEND TO HATE THE ATTENTION.<eos> UM...<eos> WHY DIDN'T YOU FIGHT HARDER ABOUT THE DUCKS?<eos> YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.<eos> THE DUCKS COULD LEAVE ANY DAY NOW.<eos> YEAH, OR IT COULD BE TWO MONTHS FROM NOW.<eos> OR ANY DAY NOW.
OKAY.<eos> GET ON OUT THERE.<eos> THERE YOU GO.<eos> YOU'RE FREE. OKAY.<eos> WHY AREN'T THEY GOING ANYWHERE?<eos> WELL, MISS THING OVER THERE IS STILL GETTING HERSELF READY.<eos> I SWEAR SHE SPENT ALL MORNING LOOKING AT HER REFLECTION IN THE WATER BOWL.<eos> [ CHUCKLES ] HOW ABOUT THAT WEIRDO?<eos> DID YOU SEE WHEN HE GOT HIS BILL STUCK IN HIS CAGE YESTERDAY?<eos> WHAT A SWEET LITTLE DOPE.

I haven't said anything until now because I know what you went through with Danny, and that you're still going through.<eos> But we all went through it.<eos> Ben, Janey, me.<eos> You're here, but you're not.<eos> You're gone.<eos> I see the toll that this has taken on you.<eos> You ended up in the hospital.<eos> I'm worried.<eos> About you.<eos> About us.
Someone specifically asked for me and you.<eos> This her?<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> Detective Diaz, Detective Rayburn.<eos> How do you do? Nice to meet you.<eos> The guy that was bothering you, do you know him?<eos> Never seen him before.<eos> He came in, he was drunk, and started talking weird shit to me.<eos> - Talking about what?<eos> - All sorts of crazy shit.
- Hi, it's a pleasure.<eos> - Yeah, come on. Have a seat.<eos> - Thank you. Sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Would you give me a second?<eos> I gotta talk to Kevin here.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Glad you could come up.<eos> I really appreciate you meeting me.<eos> Absolutely.
Who is it?<eos> - Hey, Marco.<eos> - We're good to go on Elena Cortez.<eos> We can search her house.<eos> Judge Hemel signed off.<eos> That's great.<eos> Okay. Good job.<eos> - He gave us the warrant.<eos> - You can't.<eos> No way.
The Quark Matter energy that we used to seal the breaches, it prevents them from being opened, ever again.<eos> There's no going back to our world.<eos> Wait.<eos> We're trapped here for good?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, we can't just let Zoom get away with this.<eos> He just murdered Jay right in front of us.<eos> There's got to be something we can do.<eos> There's not.<eos> Not this time.
But feel free to follow along on the television or perhaps on one of the many bugs that you've planted throughout the White House.<eos> - Mr. Lowell.<eos> - Senator James.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> What have we got?<eos> It's tighter than we thought, ma'am.<eos> Tom up by two.<eos> - What? - Mr. Murray.<eos> - Senator Montez.<eos> - Up by one.
Oh.<eos> Anyway, there is no easy way to say this, but you have a lump on your left testicle.<eos> I just want to biopsy it and we can take it from there.<eos> Take what from where?<eos> Early detection would have prevented this.<eos> We really encourage regular self-exams.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Oh, they're waiting for you in the Roosevelt Room, ma'am.<eos> - Thank you, Sue.<eos> - Of course.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You need to step back.<eos> Step back, please, and stay 4 to 6 feet away at all times.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm with the Atlanta police.<eos> I need to speak to Sayid.<eos> When did he arrive in the country?<eos> Monday.
EIS is with the family initiating home quarantine procedure.<eos> At least 3 of them have had direct contact.<eos> I think one is sick.<eos> This is the stuff the guy carried with him.<eos> I'm gonna head to the precinct.<eos> Actually, I think it would be wise, considering the contact you had, if you stayed here a while.<eos> No, no.<eos> I had my visor on, gloves.<eos> - No fluids got in there, man.<eos> - Just as a precaution.
Yeah. Bye.<eos> You're my new stalker, aren't you?<eos> - I hear you're looking for a girl.<eos> - No comment.<eos> A lot of people in danger if she's sick outside the cordon.<eos> A lot of people in danger if she's sick, period.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I still have connections in a lot of places from the days when people actually liked me.<eos> You're welcome, by the way.<eos> For the piece.
Sir. That way.<eos> You...<eos> Look out, now.<eos> Don't start no trouble, don't be no trouble.<eos> Hands up, po-lice.<eos> Hey, hey, just stay cool.<eos> We cool.<eos> You stay cool.<eos> We're just gonna take all this food.<eos> All the food.
Strictly speaking, I would classify this as more drunk than hungover.<eos> ...baseball going, and that's exactly what Atlanta...<eos> Had a cop at the hospital who thinks that they've been lying to us about patient zero.<eos> Might not be the Syrian.<eos> Could be a cover-up.<eos> Now, we just need to get the tape of the hospital's security feed...<eos> Are you even listening?<eos> I killed them.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My friends.
The clean rooms are now dirty.<eos> Hey. What the hell happened?<eos> The guys were coming in through the vents.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> How's the roof?<eos> - Sealed off.<eos> Should hold.<eos> - You think these guys are gonna give up?<eos> Heh. Office full of huffables?<eos> No way.
Definitely gonna take a sick day or... or five.<eos> You know, hit some ball games, grab some beers.<eos> Just be nice to not have any responsibilities for a while, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounds nice.<eos> What is this, a bribe?<eos> It's an olive branch.<eos> I need you in uniform for this.<eos> There's a child under Cannerts' care who represents a chance for a cure.<eos> Hope.
That is quite the war room, Larry.<eos> And warm champagne never tasted so good.<eos> Sure you won't stay?<eos> We found some champagne in one of the surgeon's lockers.<eos> This is your accomplishment, too, after all.<eos> Thanks, but, uh, my Micheline is waiting.<eos> Give her my best.<eos> Stop by the cafeteria on your way out.<eos> Take a few more MREs home.<eos> To Thomas.
A little.<eos> I never play for anyone except Quentin.<eos> Please.<eos> Fine, but you cannot laugh.<eos> Wouldn't dream of it.<eos> - I'm not gonna look at you while you...<eos> - Don't.<eos> - Close your eyes.<eos> - Nope.<eos> ♪ Every Sunday ♪

And-and Sam has got grandmothers with blueberries, and I don't even know - where I was born or how or...<eos> - Jana?<eos> Stop it, okay?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Who cares how you were born?<eos> Look at you now.<eos> There's no one I'd rather have in a crisis and, well, I should know because that could be me in eight-months time.<eos> With the pick of anyone in this world to have next to me?<eos> I pick you.<eos> Every time.
We'd miss.<eos> All right, what's your plan?<eos> We need to change the script.<eos> It worked for her, it can work for us, but I need you to trust me.<eos> I don't.<eos> But I can give you two hours, then I'm gonna press "send."<eos> Hey, you're almost there.<eos> No, no, no, you're almost there.<eos> Teresa, hey, I just need one more push from you.<eos> Just one more push. Just one more.
Well, it's a long story, but it ends with all of us getting bratwursts.<eos> Perfect.<eos> And I want to hear all about it, right after I tell you that I just delivered a baby.<eos> What?<eos> And I'm not gonna lie, it was crazy.<eos> I mean, the mother, this, uh, this 18-year-old girl, she was amazing, I don't... I don't know how she did it.<eos> I don't know how you did it.<eos> By the way, good job.<eos> Yeah, well, it's all kind of a blur.<eos> Thankfully.
Nah, Cannerts is a warning shot, man.<eos> Lommers is tying up loose ends, and we're next.<eos> You've done nothing for the past two weeks but preach about challenging the system and fighting for the truth!<eos> And you know what you've been preaching back at me?<eos> Proof.<eos> If you're gonna shoot at the king, you don't miss, right?<eos> Well, you know what we have?<eos> How do you think we'll fare?<eos> Now is not the time to get cold feet.<eos> "Cold feet"?
The hope may lie in one of us.<eos> Which means it lies in all of us.<eos> I, for one, am glad the president apologized.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Just because they didn't do this attack doesn't mean they're never going to attempt one like it in the future.<eos> I think an apology like this is just an invitation for more aggression.<eos> Missing the bigger point.<eos> We were all so eager to lap up this story...<eos> What does that say about America?<eos> About us?
We've got to make this right.<eos> Did you put it in?<eos> Yes, Michi.<eos> As you asked.<eos> Are you really sure you want to do this?<eos> I'm tired, Bertie.<eos> This is the best way.<eos> We usually don't have control over moments like this in our lives.<eos> This is how I want to do it.<eos> To you.
Yeah, what we need is some downtime.<eos> Downtime leads to increased productivity, ergo we have to have fun.<eos> And the best way to have fun is for us to go out to the club.<eos> Am I right, Team Flash?<eos> Let's get turnt!<eos> No, but seriously, we need a break.<eos> You know, I think Cisco's right, and if I'm saying we need a break, then you know it's serious.<eos> All right, let's go out tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Over my dead body.
It's Ray.<eos> I-I thought we should talk.<eos> Drive.<eos> Well you didn't waste any time getting back to your old habits.<eos> I like stealing stuff.<eos> It makes me feel good.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe you weren't meant to do this anymore?<eos> What do you want, haircut?<eos> To apologize, sort of.<eos> For Snart.
- Come on, man. We got to try it again.<eos> That thing that we did in World War II.<eos> - It's called transmutation.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's a similar process by which our uniform materializes when we merge, but at the moment, we need to focus on figuring out what Savage is planning.<eos> Come on, just the once.<eos> Is that Raymond and Kendra's lucky vase?<eos> I don't know, I just found this junk lying around.<eos> Oh, come on. Don't you think that turning something into something else might come in handy?<eos> All right, one time only.

Come on.<eos> I never thought I'd utter these words, but I think we need a Nazi.<eos> - Not funny.<eos> - Look, the reason I keep telling you to focus is because transmutation is a literal function of mind over matter.<eos> Dude, this sucks.<eos> Why do I always got to<eos> - be in the driver's seat? - Oh, don't despair, Jefferson.<eos> This is only our second attempt at transmutation, and, you know, they always say, "The third time's a charm."<eos> What?<eos> Third time.
Just let it be.<eos> A full compliment.<eos> To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go.<eos> - Well, actually...<eos> - We're not coming with you.<eos> With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens.<eos> I give it three months, tops.<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I want to say thank you.<eos> To all of you.
Yeah.<eos> You know, Mickey and I never went out on dates.<eos> Ned never took me out.<eos> Kash and I fucked in the back of a convenience store, and I don't think jerking off strangers in a nightclub counts, so...<eos> Well, how hard can it be?<eos> You know, you eat, you drink, and you bang till your balls fall off, right?<eos> What about clothes?<eos> I'd definitely wear some.<eos> Yeah, asshole, I mean, like, what kind?<eos> Like fancy?

Okay, so you're a street rat.<eos> A brawler.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Only if you make it one.<eos> I got to get to the firehouse.<eos> Thought you were off-duty.<eos> I know this sounds like an excuse considering how well this is going, but Hank's kid is sick.<eos> He needs me to cover.<eos> Let me come with you.<eos> To the firehouse?
Man with lady bun!<eos> What's with the sign, bro?<eos> The Alibi is serving working-class regulars only, so you and your bun buddies can take your privileged asses to the overpriced toilet down the street.<eos> - Capiche?<eos> - Whatever, man.<eos> Whatever this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nice!<eos> Who's tired of the smell of latte foam and ball cheese?<eos> Me.
_<eos> Attention soldiers... cut out this paper heart and show your...<eos> little heart when you're back on leave in the Fatherland.<eos> Pin it proudly to your chest...<eos> - and the National Women's...<eos> - Alliance... of Patriotic Love will be waiting.<eos> - All the wives, sweethearts...<eos> - Sisters... sisters of Germany will be offering their... tender services.<eos> to... stiffen<eos> - your resolve.
- Name?<eos> - Richard Williams.<eos> Name?<eos> Lieutenant Danny Simpson.<eos> Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.<eos> Get on the truck.<eos> Name?<eos> Lieutenant Eric Darcy.<eos> Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.<eos> Back on the truck.
And, anyway, Sister Marie has taken a vow of silence, so there is nothing to worry about.<eos> Please speak freely.<eos> I may need your help soon.<eos> And I apologize if I'm being presumptuous, but... this is a place of God, and...<eos> Yes?<eos> If there were any other place my friends could turn, believe me...<eos> You need us to hide some people who may or may not be in trouble with the authorities?<eos> I'm not sure that they will be free to come.<eos> - A very small number of them.<eos> Yes, but only for a short time.
You know what?<eos> I missed lunch.<eos> So, do you mind if I...?<eos> If you're done?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Luftwaffe silver clasp.<eos> - Sixty missions to get one of those.<eos> - I know what you want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gravy.
Must be something up there.<eos> Everything looking so small, like tiny little pieces on a board game.<eos> It's not a game.<eos> Real men, dying every day.<eos> And I'm being moved from camp to camp, for what?<eos> - It doesn't make sense anymore.<eos> - You won't eat.<eos> - Why are you still fighting?<eos> - I fight for my country.<eos> For my brothers.
- Your job is to follow my orders.<eos> - Our job is to recruit fighters. We got what we came for.<eos> We got lucky.<eos> If you want to stay on this team, you can't be so impulsive.<eos> - We almost lost you once.<eos> - Is that what this is?<eos> I survived 37 hours of Gestapo interrogation.<eos> That wasn't luck.<eos> - Don't make the same mistake twice.<eos> - What mistake?
That wasn't luck.<eos> - Don't make the same mistake twice.<eos> - What mistake?<eos> Treating me differently.<eos> Compromising our objective because of what you feel.<eos> - Feel?<eos> - For me?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Sister Miri, thank you<eos> - for all your help.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - And Billy...<eos> William now...<eos> He's missing in the Pacific.<eos> I hope he will come back to you soon.<eos> I'm sure your father wants the same thing, Klaus, and I wish I could give it to him.<eos> But that's not the game, is it?<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For your kindness.
And I think she carried it on her own, because she felt she had to.<eos> When she gets here, I'll tell you the rest.<eos> The rest?<eos> I'll tell you the real reason we're here in Dieppe.<eos> I, I can come back.<eos> It can wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know what he meant to you.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do it.<eos> Your first time?
The Duke and Duchess of York, Your Majesty.<eos> I won't see her.<eos> Just my brother.<eos> - I gather you've made your decision.<eos> - I have.<eos> I'm afraid you won't thank me for it.<eos> - Is she really worth it?<eos> - I love her with all my heart.<eos> Of course, but more than your own... country?<eos> More than your own family?
- Hmm? - Serena?<eos> That is Serena.<eos> The diamonds have been woven into her tail.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Labourers toiling in that field and in this one, a horse wears diamonds.<eos> And they wonder why civil war looms in England.<eos> Stay here.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> Ah, magnificent animal.<eos> Rope.
- There must be another solution here.<eos> Monsieur, stand down.<eos> Ah, really?<eos> Really.<eos> Aramis.<eos> You know I hate following orders.<eos> Then don't make me give you one.<eos> Then lower your pistol!<eos> I never ask three times.<eos> Not of anyone.
Athos and his friends... will be dead.<eos> Next time, try not to wait until the bottle's kissing the ground before shooting.<eos> It's not good for the nerves.<eos> Next time, don't choose such a small pebble.<eos> I could barely hear it.<eos> - Here's your share.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You boys are expensive to feed.<eos> Especially you.
I'll see to it that you do.<eos> Something I learned a from a Spanish prisoner.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I imagine with that, the thing is just knowing when to stop.<eos> Very good.<eos> I think this calls for a toast.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Long live the king!<eos> The king.<eos> And the new regent.
Don't worry.<eos> Now, be very, very quiet.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> I warned you, didn't I?<eos> Disbanding the Red Guard was a bad idea.<eos> Was it?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> We get paid to kill traitors.<eos> Not this one.
I owe you nothing.<eos> You have no morals or conscience.<eos> To hell with you and Gaston.<eos> There.<eos> It is signed.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> You shouldn't have moved your troops.<eos> Who's going to protect you now?<eos> Sire, run!<eos> This way!
She was weak.<eos> No.<eos> She was strong.<eos> She had some of these.<eos> They did not protect her.<eos> It cannot protect you from others.<eos> Only from yourself.<eos> Then you do not need them.<eos> When the Queen has met my demands you should not fear God<eos> or yourself.

- Thank you.<eos> I heard you've been teaching the poor to read and write.<eos> Word has spread and people keep coming, but... we're running low on materials.<eos> Well, we can help with those, too.<eos> You've already done more than enough to help us.<eos> We'll never be able to repay your kindness.<eos> Come with me.<eos> With all this, you could spread your message far and wide.<eos> Reach everybody in every part of Paris.<eos> Beyond.
- Majesty.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where is the Captain?<eos> Who are you?<eos> His wife.<eos> Oh, my apologies, Madame.<eos> He is not here.<eos> No matter.<eos> I am looking for a companion of his.<eos> A woman.
We'll draw out as many as we can.<eos> You go on and rescue Aramis.<eos> And Grimaud?<eos> As soon as any of us gets the chance...<eos> We have a warrant for his arrest.<eos> He will not leave this place alive, not as long as I am Captain.<eos> You've trained for this.<eos> You're ready.<eos> Whatever happens you keep the gunpowder coming.<eos> Positions.
Oh, you don't, do you?<eos> You take out as many as you can, keep it quiet.<eos> All the time they think you're dead, we've got the upper hand and we'll keep their eyes on us.<eos> Aramis.<eos> Make it count.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> There's more shrapnel in there.<eos> - Fetch alcohol.<eos> - Will he live?<eos> And a fresh bandage.
Or Feron!<eos> Get up!<eos> That was for Sylvie.<eos> That was for my cadets.<eos> And this is for me.<eos> I wasn't sure how to tell him.<eos> I'm terrified.<eos> And elated.<eos> We're all elated for both of you.<eos> All three of you.
We'll teach her how to fight off the boys.<eos> I've got to get the supplies to Constance.<eos> You need rest.<eos> I'm with child, Athos, not without use.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your plan saved their lives.<eos> Your Majesty, I'd like to recommend Porthos for a promotion.<eos> His courage has never been in question, but his tactical instincts saved us all.<eos> Not for the first time.
D'Artagnan!<eos> D'Artagnan.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Grimaud.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In there.<eos> We're missing half our powder from the garrison.<eos> If he's got it...<eos> We need to get everybody away from here.<eos> Everybody?
If he's got it...<eos> We need to get everybody away from here.<eos> Everybody?<eos> Do it now.<eos> Take the Queen, he's here!<eos> We cannot proceed.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Grimaud's inside.<eos> We're moving.<eos> Back to the carriage.
I'll knock him out with something.<eos> I mean, he's not like he'll see me coming, and then I'll have Wells teach me.<eos> Barry, that's crazy.<eos> Nothing I've read is pointing me towards a solution, and if there's anybody that's figured out the key to getting faster without V-9, it's him.<eos> What do you guys think?<eos> Your plan is asinine.<eos> Did you find Jesse?<eos> Does it look like I found Jesse?<eos> How many times have you traveled through time?<eos> - A few.
What are you talking about?<eos> Look, I know you told Iris that you love her, but you said you'd moved past this whole Eddie and Iris thing.<eos> I have, Joe. I have.<eos> Then why are you being so weird to Eddie?<eos> Okay, um, look.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me just take care of all this, okay?<eos> I'll talk to you later, I promise.<eos> Fine.<eos> But soon.
Hello? Is anyone here?<eos> Just get on the next flight, okay?<eos> Oh, my God, Calista? !<eos> Wilson?<eos> Where you going, lovely?<eos> _<eos> I definitely felt my life was in danger.<eos> And I knew I didn't have much time.<eos> And did he seem mentally impaired in any way?<eos> Objection.
You're lucky I missed you so much.<eos> - You okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I love what you've done with the place.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You haven't even seen it all put together.<eos> Baby, baby.<eos> Wait until you see what I did in the bedroom.<eos> - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You betcha.
So who's this boy, Noel?<eos> The boy you took the selfies with.<eos> He's just a boy that goes to school that was on the trip.<eos> That's all?<eos> Because there's more pictures of Noel than any Sacramento landmarks.<eos> Everyone takes selfies.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> That's what they do.<eos> Did you spend the whole time I was gone on my Instagram?<eos> Not the whole time, no, but a lot.
There's this painting fellowship I read about.<eos> I used to be an artist, and then I had a kid and put it on hold.<eos> And then I had the store, and that became my life.<eos> "A desire that had always been there."<eos> Whoa! You're my nanny.<eos> - He's hot.<eos> - This is a terrible idea.<eos> I read your book, and I loved it.<eos> I think we can do big things together.<eos> One!
Whoa! You're my nanny.<eos> - He's hot.<eos> - This is a terrible idea.<eos> I read your book, and I loved it.<eos> I think we can do big things together.<eos> One!<eos> Two!<eos> Three!<eos> Kick!<eos> One!
Time to spar.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Joss, no.<eos> Find someone else.<eos> Marisol's too advanced for you.<eos> No, I got this.<eos> Ready.<eos> Go!<eos> Okay, Joss.<eos> That's enough.<eos> - No way.
Fine. I get it.<eos> I'll do it myself.<eos> I've heard of this place called the Basement?<eos> Apparently, it's where all the hot actors hang out.<eos> - Do you know it?<eos> - Uh, yeah. I know it.<eos> And I know you're not going there.<eos> It's gross and sticky, and so is the clientele.<eos> No.<eos> No way.
Wait.<eos> I want to... thank you for saying what you said the other day.<eos> You were right.<eos> I can be a sexpert and a doctor.<eos> They're not mutually exclusive.<eos> Who cares if some people have a problem with it?<eos> Not everyone's gonna agree with what you choose to write about.<eos> Look, what people do after they read your book, that's on them.<eos> You can't be responsible for anyone else's bad decisions.<eos> Just my own, right?
If I want to have kids...<eos> and I want to have lots... there's only so much time left to have a happy family like we never had growing up.<eos> Listen, look... you don't have to worry about that.<eos> You've got plenty of time.<eos> What am I gonna do, live with you the rest of my life... some sad spinster lady camped out in your guest room forever with cats named Sadie and Suzie?<eos> You are my baby sister.<eos> I love you.<eos> You can live here as long as you want... without the cats.<eos> But just... . just know one thing.<eos> What?
Joss, listen, after all that nickel-and-diming that bloody cheapskate Ellis put me through, this is the universe making amends, baby.<eos> And if it's a little more amends than is needed, who's complaining?<eos> Okay.<eos> I cannot believe how good things are going for us right now.<eos> Me neither.<eos> - We need to toast.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - To us.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> To us.
Kate and I did not have a lot growing up, so why not live in the moment?<eos> O...kay.<eos> So it's wish fulfillment.<eos> Hey, everything on this bed is more than I could have ever wished for.<eos> Honey.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> If you put it like that, by all means, then let's dig in.<eos> All righty.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> One second.
I'm so glad you called me in.<eos> I have so many ideas to go over with you...<eos> Are you a bourbon or a scotch girl?<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Honestly, I didn't think I'd have any new thoughts.<eos> At least not this quickly.<eos> But my last interview with Jason got me so pumped up.<eos> Well, that's great, Karen.<eos> But unfortunately, I'm not sure I can invest any more time in this right now.<eos> - In what?

I'm just feeling a little tired.<eos> Still, I'd love to run some additional tests, maybe a biopsy to confirm exactly what stage you're at.<eos> But this is manageable, right?<eos> You can fix it, can't you?<eos> Well, we can give her medication to help, but ultimately, you'll probably need a liver transplant.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - How did this even happen?<eos> Well, the major cause of this disease is excessive alcohol consumption.<eos> So, Marjorie, how much would you say you normally drink?<eos> Once or twice a week, perhaps.
Of course I am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I confess something?<eos> At the risk of sounding a little sappy, I haven't felt this strongly about someone in a long time.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> Just as sappy.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Is that your new book?<eos> - Can I...<eos> - No way!
Is, um, Joss home?<eos> Uh, no, she's out.<eos> I know she wouldn't be thrilled if I was here.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> - Oh, hey, come in, please.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Me... I don't know how you were raised, but I was raised to be a certain way, and I am starting to worry that it's affecting everything in my life.<eos> Everything?<eos> As in what exactly?
Your, uh... Your look is fine.<eos> Says the boy with the cliched rock T-shirt.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Love that guy.<eos> How's things with April's mum?<eos> She staying sober?<eos> That's what she says.<eos> Hey, so, I tell you she wants to give us 30,000 bucks?<eos> - For your liver?
Oh, good.<eos> You guys know each other.<eos> Jonathan was just telling us some of his new ideas.<eos> Beginning with a change in casting.<eos> I'm thinking Padma Lakshmi would be a much better choice for this project than Harry.<eos> Uh, um, could... Jonathan, could I speak to you?<eos> Would you excuse us, please?<eos> I promised you'd be dazzled.<eos> And unlike you, I'm a man of my word.<eos> Oh, uh, a double vodka, straight up.
You remember Marc, right?<eos> You're from New York?<eos> - I've always wanted to see New York.<eos> - You should go.<eos> It's the most alive you're ever gonna feel.<eos> Walking through the streets, it's like pure energy.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> 'Cause I'm a very energetic person.<eos> Kate.<eos> A word, please.
I'm working on four hours of sleep.<eos> - I'll have the usual.<eos> - Sure thing.<eos> How's Stella?<eos> Adorable.<eos> Exhausting but adorable.<eos> Oh. You just missed your friend.<eos> She was here earlier.<eos> I haven't seen her in so long, I assumed she moved away.<eos> Which friend?
Look, mate, I don't know what you were hoping for when you came out here, but I'm sure it was better than I gave you, and I can do better.<eos> I'd love to get know you.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna have coffee with a friend, then I'm flying back out to New York tomorrow, so...<eos> But if you can give me your number,<eos> - I'll give you a call sometime. ‭<eos> - You know what?<eos> Why not stay in L.A. for a bit, work at the restaurant for me?<eos> Um... uh, that's really nice of you to offer that, but... I don't have a place to stay, and whatever you'd be paying me to wait tables isn't gonna cover the rent so...<eos> You can stay with me and my wife, Joss...<eos> And the baby.
My parents are coming into town for a few days, and we're gonna have lunch at the beach.<eos> Any chance you'd want to meet them?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Because they've hated all of my exes, including the one I was engaged to, who, it turns out, they had every right to hate, so you're gonna be a breath of fresh air.<eos> I'm pretty sure that that's the best night of sleep - I've had in a year, you know? - Mm.<eos> Well, without the help of medication.<eos> Certainly glad about that part.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Well, I feel kind of honored that my music inspired it.<eos> Well, like I said, you guys are really good.<eos> So, about that...<eos> I...have some news.<eos> That label rep wants us to do a tour!<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's... great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> For like a month.
Would you like to say a few words?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh... right.<eos> - Joss.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Standing here in the spot where I proposed to you all those months ago, I can honestly say that I... I love you more than ever.<eos> And I promise you that I will always be there for you whenever and wherever you need me, okay?<eos> Because this is where we belong. Together.<eos> Ow! How about the little finger?<eos> Any finger.
Mom's crashing.<eos> You need to tell me who to prioritize...<eos> Zoila or her baby.<eos> That is my petition for divorce.<eos> Adrian, I've spent my entire adult life with you, and this ordeal has made me realize what a terrible waste that's been.<eos> Where is Adrian?<eos> Adrian!<eos> Adrian!<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> Help!
She could be your daughter.<eos> iSanto Dios!<eos> That girl's your daughter?<eos> I was just a teenager.<eos> I had big plans for my life.<eos> So my cousin Josefina, she raised her as her own.<eos> So she doesn't even know she's adopted?<eos> Nobody knows!<eos> And if she finds out, it's gonna mess up her whole life.<eos> Her life or yours?
You seem so devoted to him.<eos> I planned on leaving him before the accident, but now that he's an invalid I can't, or everyone will think I'm a monster.<eos> Guess your only choice is to hope he makes a full recovery.<eos> Well, I've hired the best concierge doctor in town.<eos> And as soon as Adrian can walk...<eos> I'm walking, too.<eos> Are you washing dishes?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Hand me that rectangular thing.<eos> The sponge?
Can we focus on that?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're right, Rosie.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> I know.<eos> I bet Jesse could help you get some time alone with Spence.<eos> I tried, but he wouldn't let me.<eos> If you want, I can talk to Jesse on your behalf.<eos> On Rosie's behalf or your own?
Sorry.<eos> You're right, Rosie.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> I know.<eos> I bet Jesse could help you get some time alone with Spence.<eos> I tried, but he wouldn't let me.<eos> If you want, I can talk to Jesse on your behalf.<eos> On Rosie's behalf or your own?<eos> Rosie's.
I have to stop fighting to remember everything and let it go.<eos> If I keep obsessing, I'll never be free.<eos> You understand?<eos> Uh, n... not really.<eos> You know, you should spend some time with Ben.<eos> He really puts things in perspective.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I took care of it, all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Absolutely.
No.<eos> You have to go back to San Juan and... and save the money and...<eos> And come back in a few months?<eos> Or years, or never at all.<eos> Who knows what the future will bring?<eos> Marisol Suarez?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are those for me?<eos> Where do you want them?<eos> Uh, on the table there, please.
He was at a club at the time that Peri was killed.<eos> I have a witness.<eos> Her name is Cinnamon.<eos> She's a stripper who works there.<eos> That's her name and number.<eos> You've got to question her.<eos> And how did you get this stripper to say what you needed her to say?<eos> Did you give her money?<eos> No!<eos> Well, yes, for a lap dance.
No offense, but I'm just not a maid person.<eos> I only took this meeting to get you to stop calling.<eos> Hello, Cece.<eos> Evelyn, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I'm friends with Marisol.<eos> Now, when is the last time we saw each other?<eos> Your God-awful holiday party?<eos> But look at you.<eos> Taking the bull by the horns and rectifying the problem.<eos> Problem?
means you're just gonna change it later.<eos> Wow, you're right.<eos> You are learning a lot from me.<eos> Westmore.<eos> Oh. Uh, Kill Face.<eos> Heard you were back from the hospital.<eos> We missed you at play rehearsal.<eos> That's still happening?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> This Friday.
Let me pour you a drink.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think your mother's jealous.<eos> She's afraid I'm gonna take away her little boy.<eos> She's just overly protective.<eos> So tell her to back off.<eos> We just need to give her some more time, okay?<eos> She'll come around.<eos> I'm not gonna wait for her to come around.<eos> Zoila, please.
Yeah, not one of those fat-tresses that are all the rage right now.<eos> Oh, my God, that... is fine.<eos> You know, um, as long as we're being candid and everything, I've got to tell you that, um, I'm not feeling great about your choice of writer.<eos> We tried this movie with a different writer, and it didn't work.<eos> We brought Marisol in to get it right.<eos> Well, be that as it may, I've made up my mind.<eos> So it's either her or me.<eos> Oh, well, fine.<eos> We'll get another director.<eos> Maybe even a woman.
No.<eos> You're not my mother.<eos> And you never were.<eos> Thank you for gracing me with your presence, your highness.<eos> Evelyn, I'm certain you called me here to ask for something, probably money.<eos> May I suggest you dial back the sarcasm.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I thought we'd meet on neutral turf to discuss custody.<eos> Custody of what?<eos> Of our social calendar.
Bartholomew. Mm.<eos> And if I'm there with Bartholomew and... and you're there alone, you'll be horribly embarrassed.<eos> Well, how very considerate.<eos> So you won't be attending?<eos> I will not.<eos> You have my word. Mm.<eos> Bartholomew.<eos> Fabian kissed me.<eos> Fabian your hairdresser?<eos> Square on the mouth.
Certainly.<eos> Now, I know these fundraisers can be a bit tedious.<eos> Let me just...<eos> But at least this one benefits underprivileged children and not some ridiculous whale or manatee or some other beast who should be able to fight his own battles.<eos> Adrian, you're so funny.<eos> So will you join me?<eos> Uhhuh. Great.<eos> I'll pick you up at 8:00.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> For our second date.
The ideas in that book are new... and you're old.<eos> Westmore.<eos> Old age finally getting to you?<eos> Hey, Ben.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Rosie told me you were asking for me.<eos> I really wish she hadn't had done that.<eos> Well, she's just worried about you.<eos> Brought you coffee...<eos> old time's sake.
This is supper.<eos> I was hoping for breakfast.<eos> Breakfast at night?<eos> Well, my jet lag is wreaking havoc with my internal clock.<eos> I assumed you would have thought of that.<eos> Silly me.<eos> Oh, it's all right.<eos> I'm sure you never travel.<eos> You know what I would kill for?<eos> A frittata.
Are you older than me?<eos> Oh, Jesse.<eos> It's just, I like to keep my client relationships professional.<eos> I could fire you.<eos> Oh, please don't.<eos> Uh, truth is, you don't want to get mixed up with someone like me.<eos> My love life is a complete mess.<eos> Shoulder press.<eos> Tuck those in.<eos> And one...
Oh! Are those for me?<eos> Why would they be for you?<eos> I didn't even know you were coming.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> Look, those are for my girlfriend.<eos> She doesn't know about The Circle.<eos> I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> Have you talked to Ben?<eos> Mother said she sent him to Malaysia, but...<eos> Malaysia?
You knew.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> About Spence not being Tucker's father.<eos> That's why you didn't want Spence to give blood for Tucker's surgery.<eos> - This is none of your business.<eos> - It is my business!<eos> Spence is in jail while another man should be.<eos> Ms. Shannon.<eos> I know you two weren't close, but your sister was murdered.<eos> Your sister.
I spent a great deal of effort renovating that apart...<eos> It's yours.<eos> Our yacht, The Lady Evelyn... yours again.<eos> In fact, this all seems acceptable.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I know it's not on the list, but I also want the Manet.<eos> The Manet or the Monet?<eos> Both.
My waxer offers complimentary Vicodin.<eos> So, what are you in for?<eos> I recently discovered, uh, some troubling things about an incident in my past.<eos> You?<eos> Breakup... two years ago.<eos> Letting go of relationships is... It's not my strong suit.<eos> I've been holding onto mine for 20.<eos> Ohh. I love meeting somebody who's more messed up than me.<eos> Oh, you should probably leave the bottle.<eos> Cheers.
What breakup?<eos> Peter has just disappeared.<eos> It's the best relationship I've ever had, and I never even got the chance to say I'm sorry... or goodbye.<eos> Well, why don't you stop moping around here then and go out and find yourself some closure, already?<eos> God, I envy you, Evelyn.<eos> You seem completely over Adrian.<eos> - Ah, you don't know yet.<eos> - What?<eos> Adrian is marrying...<eos> Gail Fleming.
Maybe just scroll forward until she gets emotional?<eos> Wait.<eos> There.<eos> Is she crying?<eos> This could be it.<eos> I was terrified that Spence would find out the baby wasn't his.<eos> I knew I had to come forward about the rape, so I called Hugh and I told him I was turning him in.<eos> But you never did?<eos> Well, the strangest thing happened. Hugh's daughter showed up with an offer.<eos> In return for my silence,
- Hey, Chip.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Wasn't sure if you got my message.<eos> - How can I be of service?<eos> Yeah, that... no, no, no.<eos> This is more of a real life problem.<eos> Oh, you want to talk about the store?<eos> Yeah, and about your friend who lives above the store.<eos> - London?<eos> - Yes, London.
Fucking Cooler, man.<eos> He set us up.<eos> This is...<eos> Come on, Dennis.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> We're here.<eos> Let's just...<eos> Let's talk.<eos> No, that's not going to cut it!<eos> Not this time, man.
You know, out there.<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.<eos> Listen, man, um...<eos> If it's space that you need, uh, you're free to use my store.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> - That's... fucking awesome, man.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Yeah, of course.
- Is frequent?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Martha?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you stay here while I go grab something?<eos> Okay. Do you want me to get it?<eos> - I got it.<eos> So how many times are you urinating a day?<eos> Like 12 1/2.<eos> One Year Ago
No, I'm freelance. I don't need a permit.<eos> No, he does not know the French rules!<eos> Never mind. I don't need a permit.<eos> But you can not do that, it goes wrong!<eos> You stay.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I demand to go to my embassy!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I don't know you people!<eos> Cheers.

I don't know anything about that guy.<eos> Who cares about that guy?<eos> I came to talk to you.<eos> I wanted to know who you are.<eos> I saw you singing, and I wanted to meet you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you called?<eos> Chip.<eos> Chip?<eos> Like a birdie?
Come on, drink!<eos> Here. Drink!<eos> You stupid pig.<eos> You're a stupid pig!<eos> Adorn and son.<eos> Please leave a message after the tone. We thank you.<eos> The first time is always painful, but unforgettable.<eos> The easiest way is to press your forehead against the wall.<eos> Then you picture us meeting on the other side of the wall.<eos> Through the wall into the forest, for instance.

Our voices generate an image.<eos> Our words set them in motion.<eos> Besides one's imagination, hearing is the most important thing.<eos> It's the interface between our thoughts.<eos> Technically speaking, phone-walking...<eos> We're in the forest now.<eos> Things are creeping and crawling in the forest.<eos> Trees, wood...<eos> - The wind is blowing.<eos> - Out of yourarse.
Hello?<eos> We have guests at the moment.<eos> We thank you.<eos> Do you know what?<eos> That party outside, where I'm not invited...<eos> I don't want to be invited.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> I've been observing it for long enough.<eos> Every party must come to an end, and left behind... are lonely people, who then go to the next party.<eos> And to the next one.
Look what your boys got for you.<eos> Oh, presents.<eos> Unnecessary.<eos> You smell so good.<eos> That's a dope-color mumu, Mom.<eos> You're definitely rocking that. - Thank you.<eos> - Chip!<eos> Well, screw you!<eos> What's going on, baby?<eos> Guys.
Let me get my camera.<eos> I need a picture.<eos> You don't need to do that, Mom.<eos> You don't need to do that.<eos> - Yo, bye, everyone.<eos> - Bye, everyone.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Don't sweat it, Mom. We'll send you some selfies.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye, guys.
Oh, hell.<eos> I just gave my cousin 50 dollars to break his legs.<eos> - Both of his legs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You suck.<eos> - Some fatherly advice...<eos> Don't ever have kids.<eos> They can be mean little bastards.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey! Hey! Not the lady.
Can you repeat that?<eos> Sure. Um, your mother was living as an undiagnosed diabetic,<eos> - and she was maintaining...<eos> - So it's basically bad news? Well, the good news is that you called 911.<eos> You saved her life, so...<eos> - That's the good news, right?<eos> That's good news.<eos> It's a lot to process. Why don't I just leave you be here.<eos> - Thank you, Doctor.<eos> - Sure.
Are his vitals okay?<eos> Yeah, they're perfect. Cool.<eos> It's like having a pit-stop attached to your chest.<eos> Guys, I can go faster.<eos> Do it.<eos> I'm back.<eos> What... how long was I gone?<eos> Let's put it this way, you just annihilated your old record.<eos> Yeah, you went four times faster than you have ever been.<eos> Four times?
I was wrong.<eos> All it did was create an unstoppable monster.<eos> NOTORIOUS SERIAL KILLER CAUGHT!<eos> He's not unstoppable.<eos> Jay doesn't know that we know who he really is.<eos> He thinks that his past is a secret.<eos> - So?<eos> - I think I have an idea of how we can stop him.<eos> Are you sure Jay can't get in here?<eos> Pretty sure, but just in case.
You made a mistake.<eos> You told Caitlin who your doppelganger was.<eos> I had to do something to get her to stop trying... to fix me.<eos> She's a smart girl.<eos> - And that I was Zoom?<eos> - The Velocity-9.<eos> When you run fast enough, it turns a speedster's lightning blue.<eos> We would have helped you.<eos> We would have done anything we could to save your life.<eos> Not everything.
The reverend gives you any trouble, you let me know, but I doubt he will.<eos> Wait!<eos> You know... that won't work with me.<eos> You can't blame a girl for trying.<eos> I won't survive to The Merge.<eos> You took your chances, my dear, just like all of us.<eos> Sometimes... you draw the short straw.<eos> Okay, well, if you do see her, let me know, huh?<eos> - Thank you, appreciate it.<eos> - Sure.
She's in God's hands now, same as your mother, and though my soul weeps for them, they will have eternity with him.<eos> That is a win.<eos> Look, I don't know where that girl Sherry is right now, but God sure as shit didn't put her there.<eos> No. Who did then, you?<eos> The "Outcast," whatever the hell that is, with your magic touch?<eos> Wake up, Reverend.<eos> All these souls you think you're saving with God's infinite wisdom?<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> Look at her. And Brian.<eos> And Mildred.
I don't see that we have much other choice.<eos> But we gotta be clear on one thing.<eos> In there on Sundays, you're in charge.<eos> If we're gonna do this together, we do it my way. Or we don't do it at all.<eos> How you feelin'?<eos> I'm all right, I guess.<eos> A little sore.<eos> Reverend... I don't even know where to start.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Why?
Who are you?<eos> Where's Ontari?<eos> Not coming out, but you can give the Flame to me.<eos> I'll be sure she gets it.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Your friends in the tunnel can't help you.<eos> Now give me the Flame.<eos> Back up, or she dies.<eos> Do it. Do it now.<eos> On your knees!
We just saved your lives.<eos> Why do I think I'm gonna regret that?<eos> Clarke is in trouble.<eos> Clarke's always in trouble.<eos> They took her and the Flame to the tower.<eos> It's a safe bet Ontari's there, too.<eos> Everything we need to stop A.L.I.E. is in the same place.<eos> If we go up that tower, we won't be able to fight our way out again.<eos> If we stop A.L.I.E., we won't have to.<eos> Up the tower.
I, uh... I have something I need to attend to.<eos> - I'll see you at the ceremony.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Take a pew, Reverend.<eos> You're up next.<eos> Surprised to see you up and about after last night.<eos> You already heard about the Reverend's legendary poker game.<eos> Sun come up on this one?<eos> No, not this time.
Surprised to see you up and about after last night.<eos> You already heard about the Reverend's legendary poker game.<eos> Sun come up on this one?<eos> No, not this time.<eos> I need to be ready and rested for this day of remembrance.<eos> It's my job to show the community how to stand tall and defiant in the face of darkness.<eos> Well, that's admirable. But I thought the point of remembering tragedies of your past... making sure you don't repeat yourself.<eos> You a poker player?<eos> Never miss my regular game.<eos> No matter what.
What?<eos> I'll be back in a few hours to pick her up.<eos> Does this have something to do with Anderson?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> That man is mentally unstable.<eos> Seriously, don't let him drag you down with him.<eos> I got it, okay?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.
I think he'll talk to me.<eos> How do you know my mother?<eos> I don't know your mother, Kyle.<eos> I never met the lady before I came to town.<eos> Then why are you bringing her flowers?<eos> I heard a lot about her.<eos> They say she put up one hell of a fight.<eos> You ain't seen a fight yet.<eos> How often do you go see your mother, Kyle?<eos> Once a month?
That's not how it is.<eos> You've been lettin' him get inside of your head... because that's what he does.<eos> You think you know what this is about.<eos> Reverend, I'm telling you, you're wrong.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why don't you talk me through it?<eos> I mean, what are we up against here?<eos> What is it inside of her, huh?<eos> Look, until we know, we gotta let it be.<eos> For now, okay?
Look, until we know, we gotta let it be.<eos> For now, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> No, stop!<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?<eos> You saw how he turned the people against me!<eos> They were laughin' at me!<eos> Now, if... if I can bring her back, they'll be packing my church every week!<eos> Every week!
- But I will not apologize... for the message that I am sending out.<eos> There is a disease in this town and it's spreading like a wildfire.<eos> Now, you... you can sit there with your smug, self-righteous looks on your faces... or you can open your fucking eyes to the devil in your midst.<eos> I've already informed the District Council of your termination.<eos> They're beginning a search for your replacement.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> - Unfortunately... the rectory is on church property.<eos> You're gonna need to clear out your things as soon as possible.<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> A big mistake.
Not if he's gonna be there.<eos> Why do I get the feeling we're talking about a mutual friend?<eos> Anderson.<eos> I want him out of my life.<eos> Want more mashed potatoes?<eos> - Hold... hold on.<eos> - A lot or a little?<eos> - Here, come sit down...<eos> - All right, here it comes.<eos> A lot. What about chicken?
You could tell me what the deacons are saying about me.<eos> What they're thinkin'.<eos> They're meetin' at noon to discuss your replacement.<eos> I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<eos> You want anything from the store?<eos> Somethin' salty.<eos> Now, your blood pressure is already high enough.<eos> How about a nice, tasty apple?<eos> Sounds delicious.<eos> Just a second.
I can stop them.<eos> I can draw these things out of people and make 'em go away, and, baby, that's... that's what I did that day.<eos> To the one that was inside of you.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're not sick.<eos> You're not dangerous to anybody anymore.<eos> I want you to come home, baby.<eos> I want you to come home to a family.<eos> Our family.
Then, when that man-shark thing attacked our house.<eos> And when Zoom took me, he said,<eos> "Someone The Flash knew cared about me""<eos> Yeah, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that's you.<eos> You want me to tell you who he is?<eos> I can't do that.<eos> No, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I was actually hoping that you could set up a meeting for me.<eos> A meeting?
Ugh.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Did you do something to him?<eos> There is no baby, Annalise.<eos> No, unh-unh.<eos> Bonnie...<eos> I-i told you.<eos> There was a woman at the door and she was hysterical and she put the baby in my arms and I didn't want the baby.<eos> No, it was in your head.<eos> Like last time.
Could test my blood if you want to, but I'm fine to take the stand.<eos> And according to your statement, Ms. Keating, it was after your meeting with Ms. Sinclair that Catherine Hapstall entered the house?<eos> I never heard her come in.<eos> Ms. Sinclair noticed her first.<eos> But when I first saw Catherine, I knew something was wrong.<eos> Wrong how?<eos> Her pupils were dilated.<eos> Her expression was vacant.<eos> There was clearly something physically wrong.<eos> Objection.
Again, I didn't see anything.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> The only reason we're all here is because you say you saw my client shoot you.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's true.<eos> I...<eos> I only...<eos> You only what?<eos> Want to keep changing you story?<eos> - Objection.
I'm so full.<eos> Pasta game's strong, Frankie D.<eos> Well, it's not just pasta.<eos> It's the famous Delfino ziti.<eos> Hey.<eos> - A toast.<eos> - Wait for me.<eos> Just make it strong.<eos> We won for today.<eos> Salute.

That was only Jason.<eos> It's a simple question that I need a simple answer to.<eos> "Yes, I sent the text from Tyler's phone,"<eos> or "No, I don't know what you're talking about."<eos> If I tell you the truth, you can't tell anyone else, right?<eos> You just told us the truth.<eos> Don't you ever tell that to anyone again.<eos> Understood?<eos> I have been so angry.<eos> At you, mostly, but angry at the lawyers, the system, and God.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> Oh, don't worry about it.<eos> You know me.<eos> As long as I have a place to sit, I can wait all day.<eos> - Where's Christophe?<eos> - At the neighbor's.<eos> He'd be a pain if I brought him.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> I was going to bring that back brace. I forgot.<eos> Next time.
Rose, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Did you see anyone when you got out of the elevator?<eos> No.<eos> The floor was empty.<eos> But then I went into the corner office and saw him...<eos> Mr. Mahoney.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Charles.<eos> The young one.
Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Dude, open your pie hole.<eos> He e-mailed again.<eos> Annalise?<eos> !<eos> "Deposit $1 million in the below account within 36 hours, or this goes to the police..."<eos> Now what... Mommy?<eos> Frank.<eos> My office.
She had been resistant to my previous attempts, but then agreed to act as my informant after a physical-abuse altercation with the defendant.<eos> Objection. Hearsay.<eos> Sustained.<eos> There's an anonymous witness.<eos> G-34.<eos> Why would they allow a witness to testify anonymously?<eos> If the judge believed their life was in danger.<eos> That must be her.<eos> The fatal blow struck the victim on the back of the head, lacerating a four-inch section of the scalp.<eos> Objection.
You're serious?<eos> You still think that's possible?<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> You know how you can know that?<eos> What good would that do me to tell the truth now?<eos> Tell me how that helps out any of us at this point.<eos> I forgave you, Annalise.<eos> That's why I came here.<eos> For dinner.
Because you gave him that file.<eos> Why?<eos> So that he could go on a treasure hunt and find out his mother was killed?<eos> Sounds crazy, I know, but...<eos> "Crazy" is not a word we use lightly around here.<eos> I'm just saying I know how it sounds.<eos> It's why I came here.<eos> I don't know how to talk to anyone else about it.<eos> You mean Annalise?<eos> Yes. But everyone else, too.
Finally.<eos> Did you eat?<eos> I was just ordering room service.<eos> I, uh, fly all the way here.<eos> I was kind of hoping we could do something better than overpriced hotel food.<eos> It's on the client.<eos> Right.<eos> Big spenders, I see.<eos> Yes, I'd like the Cobb salad and Earl Grey tea, and, uh...<eos> - Same. - Two of each.
Just tell the agent that Rose told you that she was threatened by the Mahoney family.<eos> That's why she was willing to lie on the stand.<eos> Eve, please.<eos> Now, I'd do it myself, but I'd get disbarred... Or worse!<eos> These people are dangerous, especially if what you're telling me is true, so stop it.<eos> What happened to that boy is sad but... sad things happen to all of us.<eos> I'll do it myself.<eos> - No, Annalise!<eos> This is concerning Rose Edmond.<eos> More specifically, her son.
Or was it that you're the one that ordered Frank to kill Lila?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Frank told me... that he killed Lila because you asked him to do it.<eos> Which makes all the sense in the world... that you started all of this.<eos> Sam was cheating on you with a younger woman.<eos> And then she's pregnant?<eos> So why not use your trusty hit man to get rid of her and then play all of us like your little puppets as we defend Rebecca, kill Sam...?<eos> It was all you all along...<eos> All along...
- Abuse? - Yeah.<eos> All you do is rip on me.<eos> I'll go get another job if you hate me so much.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Sam dragged you out of the gutter, then guilted me into hiring you, and all I've done is baby your ass ever since.<eos> You call that abuse, then you deserve whatever white-trash future I was trying to save you from.<eos> Glad you got that off your chest.<eos> What the hell are they gonna arrest her for?<eos> All I heard was the D.A.'s getting a warrant.<eos> But only for Annalise.
Oh, my God.<eos> We're gonna do this again, aren't we?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> We're not these people.<eos> You put your foot in this, Ophelia.<eos> Much appreciated, Big Daddy.<eos> Nate, how did you two meet?<eos> - Work.
Or one of us could be the rat.<eos> - Pass the chicken.<eos> - You want a piece of chicken?<eos> Nathaniel, you know these three children of mine never gave me any grandchildren?<eos> Well, it makes sense.<eos> Both Celestine and Anna Mae are career women.<eos> Who has time for kids when you're busy helping people with their lives?<eos> What's my excuse, then?<eos> You just haven't found the right woman.<eos> Or man.
- It's fine.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - We want to hear how you're doing.<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> Bye.<eos> Do you remember those two?<eos> - Look.<eos> Elton John.<eos> - Yes.<eos> In his leaner days.
Bye.<eos> Do you remember those two?<eos> - Look.<eos> Elton John.<eos> - Yes.<eos> In his leaner days.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> We listened to this all the time.<eos> - It's 25 years ago.<eos> - At least.
We're having a date night.<eos> - I just wanted to see how you were.<eos> - We're fine.<eos> Hi, Esben.<eos> - Hi, Vibeke.<eos> - How are you?<eos> Fine, thanks.<eos> I miss you.<eos> - I thought we could have some tea.<eos> - Some other time.
I got this.<eos> I'll tell you for five bucks.<eos> No.<eos> You better sign me up Me too.<eos> I've always wanted to learn more about grifting ever since I saw 1990's,<eos> The Grifters, featuring John Cusack, Anjelica Huston, and almost no grifting.<eos> You guys, don't take a grifting class.<eos> You're going to get grifted.<eos> Even more so than by that oceanography class, only none of you will even get a goldfish, then you're gonna come crying back to me.<eos> Why you?
And he responded to you?<eos> He said, "Okay"" And then what happened?<eos> He changed the game.<eos> I assume it's bad he was talking to the game designer?<eos> Ralph made a suggestion that helped modify the game.<eos> Do you know how that's gonna look to Eckherd when he finds out?<eos> Ralph did nothing wrong.<eos> He was asked if he helped design the game, Ralph said no.<eos> But we have proof that he did help.<eos> Unknowingly.
All right, we're on comms.<eos> I've seen pictures of these conventions.<eos> They don't do them justice.<eos> World's largest gathering of virgins.<eos> I don't know.<eos> The after-hours parties at these things can get pretty filthy.<eos> So I've read.<eos> The last signal leads to the room down there.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi, there.
I know you can't.<eos> So what do I gamble on, Walter?<eos> I couldn't advise you; gambling is Toby's department.<eos> Paige, I care about this team and our work... but what I care about most is giving Ralph a safe place to reach his potential.<eos> He has a lot of it.<eos> I know that, too.<eos> Oh. Do you remember when you and Ralph turned up, and I gave him that riddle?<eos> What is a group of jellyfish called?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A smack?
- I think he might be.<eos> - No.<eos> Could you give me a half hour?<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I think that David Lee is offering him a job, but Evan's too afraid to bite the hand that will feed him.<eos> Okay, so we put a pause in the negotiation, see if we should replace Evan.<eos> What?<eos> I've missed this.<eos> All the usual disasters.
I need some help with that thing.<eos> Maybe I could help.<eos> I-I'm pretty good with... things.<eos> No, it's a project Todd already started on.<eos> Sure, I'll jump, uh, right on that.<eos> Great.<eos> She's talking about sex.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> This is my life now.<eos> Good for him.
I couldn't sleep.<eos> So I went downstairs, and I got myself a snack.<eos> And then I went to the living room, and I reread a Twilight.<eos> Then I did some knitting.<eos> Then I got drowsy, so I walked back upstairs, and I got into bed, and then I fell asleep.<eos> And I woke up, and there was a cow in my face.<eos> And that's exactly what happened.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, it all worked out<eos> - for the best, right?
Not yet.<eos> Look what we have here.<eos> Well, that was anticlimactic.<eos> Uh, the lining.<eos> Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> The documents on the flash drive you found at the apartment were SVR encrypted.<eos> Fortunately, the CIA has had the cipher for that particular encryption for eight months.<eos> The drive contained a communiqué from Russia.<eos> According to the New York Rezident, Genady Isakov, the SVR believes Mikhail passed the stoles files to a third party.<eos> - Who?
You're getting married tomorrow.<eos> And nothing is going to stand in the way of that, okay?<eos> Right now, quickly!<eos> Talk to me. Are you okay?<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> He's gone.<eos> ♪ I... ♪ Wrote in blood... Hey.<eos> Did you get any sleep last night?<eos> Barely.<eos> You?
Because your sister's life could very well depend on it.<eos> Look, I-I'll admit, I didn't believe in any connections to the past, either.<eos> In fact, truth be told...<eos> He tried to have Vincent killed.<eos> But that was before I understood that he and Catherine were meant to be together.<eos> All right?<eos> I-I thought he was just like the other ones, a threat to her, but I was wrong.<eos> Okay, so what does this have to do with Rebecca and Alistair?<eos> Rebecca and Alistair?<eos> Everything.
Which is why I told Vincent to leave before everyone got here.<eos> I didn't want to raise any flags that I couldn't take down.<eos> Sounds like the old Cat to me.<eos> Just saying.<eos> Hey.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I think.<eos> Although I can't figure out why Liam was after my blood.<eos> Shh, not so loud.
- I agree that it's all very promising, but...<eos> - Washington DC?<eos> - Rob.<eos> Rob Bradley.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> That guy?<eos> - Okay, fine, you don't like him, but he knows everybody.<eos> He's true blue, we go way back.<eos> He can get us in front of all the right people.<eos> Both on the manufacturing side and the military.

Lord...<eos> He was telling the truth.<eos> Once the worms turn you, the Master will read your thoughts and the Lumen will be his.<eos> But there is a higher power watching us right now, and he wants you to stop the evil that has cast its shadow over this city.<eos> How?<eos> Tell me who has the book.<eos> It's our only hope. Tell me, and<eos> I will release your soul to God before the forces of vile darkness take it from you.<eos> Rudyard<eos> Fonescu.
I can see why he started here.<eos> You indulged him.<eos> You looked the other way for too long.<eos> Perhaps you're growing complacent.<eos> You should have stopped him 70 years ago, if not seven centuries ago.<eos> I get no pleasure from your anxiety.<eos> I trained Vaun and the others to be better; they failed us.<eos> I'm here now.<eos> I will stop him.<eos> But for my own reasons.
Aren't you going to ask her?<eos> About the money that mysteriously disappeared from<eos> - your apartment? Your laptop?<eos> - None of that's important now, is it?<eos> She's terrified.<eos> She's been through it.<eos> Oh, is that why you seem, uh, a little reluctant to tell her about us?<eos> She is dealing with so much right now.<eos> Just give her time.<eos> And me.
- I'm not the one he's running away from.<eos> Ah! Reinforcements.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Today was amazing.<eos> It's rather nice to have a helicopter.<eos> I'm learning so much from you.<eos> - As am I from you.<eos> - From me?<eos> Like what?
- Especially for someone like me.<eos> - Like you how?<eos> Someone who can't skate by in life just on her looks.<eos> What?<eos> If I showed you my school yearbook photo, you'd understand.<eos> Yeah, well, you pulled it together pretty well.<eos> How's that work?<eos> The laser can read incredibly subtle vibrations on the window glass.<eos> Isn't that how they found out where Bin Laden was hiding?<eos> A rudimentary version of it, yeah.
Shall I fetch her ladyship and ask her to tie on the cloak?<eos> God help me, that child has driven it from my mind.<eos> Quarter of an hour, please, a few minutes late, I'm sorry, that girl Irene is going to be the death of me.<eos> The quarter, I can't, I'm not ready, tell them to go home, give them their money back.<eos> I hate the swines, I can't, I can't.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Do you want the performance cancelled?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> How does it begin?<eos> For your own good.
Speak well of him?<eos> I know what YOU'D say.<eos> I know all about YOU, ducky.<eos> I have eyes in my head.<eos> We all have our little sorrows.<eos> I know what you'd say - stiff upper, faithful, loyal, loving.<eos> Well, I have only one thing to say about him and I wouldn't say it in front of you, or Her Ladyship, or anyone.<eos> Lips tight shut.<eos> I wouldn't give you the pleasure.<eos> Or him. Especially not him.
Who cares?<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> When Josh found out that I was the one that spent all those weeks recreating his special childhood blanket, he realized I was the one that knows his heart, which means I'm the reason he called off the wedding! Now what am I gonna do?<eos> What do you mean what are you gonna do?<eos> Sofia, last night I was freaking out that Josh was getting married because I had feelings for him.<eos> Yeah, and then Cooper came in and swept you off your feet, and now you're back together with Cooper.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But then Josh, he called off his wedding because of me!<eos> Which means he has feelings for me!<eos> For me!
Go to her!<eos> Leave your tab open and go to her.<eos> No, yeah, Josh. He's right.<eos> She has to know everything.<eos> And if she still wants to go with Cooper-- fine, but... she needs to know.<eos> Run!<eos> Run like the wind to that airport.<eos> Get out of here now.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You too.
China.<eos> Ticket.<eos> Buy a ticket!<eos> I'm sorry, you're too late.<eos> That flight's already boarding.<eos> Okay. Well, now you have to call her.<eos> Gabi!<eos> - Josh?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - On the phone.
I think I've got everything.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Looks... looks-looks very good.<eos> Okay. We're done here.<eos> Shahir, you're up.<eos> Okay. Let's go.<eos> Get me the corpectomy tray and the spine microscope.<eos> Dr. Katz.<eos> Dr. Hamza called me.<eos> About?
Deb, I just heard.<eos> Is it really true?<eos> It's the real thing.<eos> We tested it on ourselves.<eos> This is Peter.<eos> I've told him all about you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You too.
It's been five minutes, sir.<eos> Vulture Team, this is the bridge, radio check. Radio check.<eos> Bridge, Vul... Team.<eos> Hey, no... life.<eos> Vulture Team, say again.<eos> Your last was garbled.<eos> Bridge, Vulture Team, I say again, no sign of...<eos> Vulture Team, say again.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> For me?
Nathan James, what's your whiskey?<eos> Comin' up your starboard side, 400 yards, lookin' for a target.<eos> Well, I'll give you one.<eos> Flight deck.<eos> We flush three hostiles topside, you light 'em up.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Batteries released.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Starboard Mark 38 hot.<eos> On your count.
Our latest app- - VAL.<eos> For Voice Activated Lookup. Here.<eos> Where does country originate?<eos> Are tomatoes vegetables or fruits?<eos> VAL's a personal assistant on your phone.<eos> You wanna find anything online, just ask it a question like the ones you're hearing right now.<eos> VAL, how's Fetch Retrieve doing in the market today?<eos> Fetch Retrieve is up $1.87 today.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks to our algorithm and our transcribers,
Ah, Polly.<eos> I've missed Polly.<eos> You won her on a very lucky hand.<eos> Yeah, she is, uh, a woman of many talents.<eos> - Allow me. - Hmm?<eos> Allow me.<eos> Mr. Bohannon came to see me today.<eos> One hell of a railroad man.<eos> Yes, it seems he has great enthusiasm for his work.<eos> As well as the work of others.
The rezident wanted to discourage any second thoughts.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm not doing this to you.<eos> If I was, the rezident would know Sarah's not in Albany.<eos> She's here.<eos> Just do your job today and everything will be fine.<eos> If anything happens to Sarah, I kill you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
What part of "this FISA judge could shut our task force down"<eos> did you not understand?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You best darken this doorway in the next five minutes, comprende?<eos> I'll be there.<eos> I didn't have a say in what my future would be.<eos> My father sent me to boarding school in Switzerland under an alias when I was nine years old.<eos> When I was 17, I came back to Russia and learned that my father was a KGB general, and I was shipped off to the red banner institute to begin my training.<eos> Did you hurt anyone?<eos> Any Americans?
He got us the tapes no problem.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Just because you lost confidence in yourself, kid, doesn't mean I did.<eos> A bureau agent made it to the temple just before their system did its 72 hour recycle and erased all the footage.<eos> For once, the fates are on our side.<eos> Has he seen the footage?<eos> No. He sealed the hard drive, and it's headed straight back here.<eos> That's great.<eos> I can't wait to see who did this in handcuffs.<eos> Me too.
Well, listen up, vinny voicemail.<eos> I hope you check your messages,<eos> Because if you don't retrieve that computer<eos> And meet the extraction team within the next two hours,<eos> You can just...<eos> Get used to bananas!<eos> [mashes handset] [phone error tone]<eos> If you'd like to make a call... [mashes handset] Even the damn phone is the same.<eos> [cheryl] everything is the same.<eos> Jesus!
They were huge.<eos> What do you mean were?<eos> What happened to Paul Newman?<eos> Paul Newman died, like, five years ago.<eos> - The popcorn guy?<eos> - No, no.<eos> He was a chef.<eos> Speaking of fame, that's why I'm here.<eos> I need you to help me get famous.<eos> Famous how?
Matty Flynn called.<eos> Said he could help.<eos> - Matty Flynn?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's a fucking jailhouse lawyer.<eos> He's one of them.<eos> They listen to him.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're gonna bribe him with drugs?<eos> Quiet down.
I don't have it anymore!<eos> Okay, clearly this is illegal forced entry.<eos> - You don't have to tell him anything, Briana.<eos> Briana, could you just come out here so we can talk, please?<eos> Say the word, Briana, and I'll mace this son of a bitch.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Ted.<eos> Briana, I'd like to not hurt your friend Ted here, so could you open the fucking door?<eos> I gave it to my advisor last night...<eos> Sheldon Blackwood.
Jesus Christ, she works fast.<eos> He's gonna get his heart broke.<eos> Ray, come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I have the money.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> My father's plant.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Work.
This stuff, hey, it's not what I do.<eos> It's exactly what you do.<eos> You're a piece of shit pimp, aren't you?<eos> May I jump in here? Mr. Donovan,<eos> U.S. Attorney's Office is primarily concerned with Mr. Belikov.<eos> You're in a unique position to obtain the kind of evidence we need to finally hit him with real charges.<eos> I'm not... I'm not in any kind of position.<eos> Me and Minassian, we're not on the best of terms.<eos> Then after Detective Muncie releases you, I promise you the full extent of the government's protections.<eos> Protection?
Old guy, tall, gray hair, would've checked in this morning?<eos> I didn't work this morning.<eos> Is there anything else I can help you with?<eos> No, that's all right.<eos> Hello.<eos> Get up.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Where?<eos> You know where.<eos> Muncie?
What are we looking for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Bring back a Veggie Fiesta Panini and a Coke Zero.<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Afternoon, beautiful.<eos> If you're worried about being outed, Mr. Donovan, a family reunion at the station's probably not the play.<eos> My father's done working for you.<eos> Non Compos Mentis declaration approved by the probate court for your records.<eos> For my records?
I think I talked to her a little bit about what a good mother you were, about how hard you were trying, how tough it had been for you since you moved here... and talked to her about how close we were.<eos> Do you still like me?<eos> What kind of a silly question is that?<eos> You just seem... different as of late, maybe because Dylan lives here now.<eos> Things have changed between the two of you and between us.<eos> It's... it's different.<eos> No, Norman, I don't think anything is different or ever will be.<eos> Okay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry.
Do you have any reason to believe that Bob Paris would want her dead?<eos> Maybe... maybe she knew too much?<eos> I honestly doubt that guy gives a damn who knows what about his sex habits.<eos> But I think Lindsay started to get a taste for a lifestyle she couldn't afford.<eos> She started resenting him.<eos> Maybe she had feelings for him that weren't reciprocated.<eos> I just got the feeling she was pissed.<eos> Just out of curiosity, you know who took your place in that three-way?<eos> I'm pretty sure she said Annika Johnson stepped in.<eos> You warm enough?
- Mom's in jail?<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> - No, she's not in jail.<eos> - You'll see her tomorrow.<eos> - I need a bathroom.<eos> - I need a bathroom!<eos> Now!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, any better?
- Someone's calling.<eos> - Ow! Ow! Ow!<eos> Okay, go back and watch.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> Go back and watch.<eos> Go on.<eos> Hello?<eos> Alison, hey, I can't talk right now.<eos> I just, uh... TV now.
I'm "the reason the word was invented."<eos> "No marriage could survive" me.<eos> Is that all you read?<eos> No, I read some choice passages about my supple breasts, my perfect ass, my long tongue on your...<eos> So you... you only read the sex scenes.<eos> Well, no, I read a few pages, but so far as I can tell, the whole thing is sex scenes.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I asked you not to read it because I wanted to explain it before.<eos> - I wanted you to be prepared.<eos> - For what?
Cole.<eos> Leave me alone, Scott.<eos> Just... just come back inside, will ya?<eos> She's gone crazy, and you're enabling her.<eos> That is why we need you, okay?<eos> We need you to come back and be a part of this family again, and we... we need your fucking money, okay?<eos> So that we can invest in something real and move forward, okay, because if we don't, if we stay here, it will be the end of the Lockharts!<eos> You are the only one who has the ability to change everything!<eos> What the fuck are you waiting for?<eos> Scotty?
- I'm sorry, you can't.<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - You can't!<eos> - Don't fucking touch me! - Oh!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't touch...<eos> - Hey! - Scotty!<eos> - Hey, don't... you can't.<eos> - Scotty!<eos> Scotty!
Each one's got a story.<eos> Mighty fine collection you got there.<eos> Well, this just what I came up here with.<eos> You ought to see what's in the coach.<eos> You inviting me for a ride?<eos> Well, now, there's a mouth.<eos> Huh?<eos> Now you're talking about my mouth.<eos> And we only just met.<eos> - Shame on you, now. - Mmm-hmm.
What would you say if I told you eternal life is free?<eos> Costs you nothing whatsoever?<eos> I'd say, "Tell me where to sign up, sir."<eos> Salvation through The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<eos> We meet on Sundays.<eos> All are welcome.<eos> Oslo, come.<eos> You boys got everything you need on them mountains?<eos> We are well attended to.<eos> Thanks to Brother Gundersen.
Mm. She pulls to the left.<eos> You don't want to test your luck again, you best get to walking'.<eos> And... Yeah?<eos> You're missing the show, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> - Show me what's in them rice crates. - Hmm?<eos> Open 'em.<eos> Slow.<eos> Steady now.<eos> - Go there. - Hmm?<eos> Against that post.
Pity the only witnesses... were Chinese.<eos> No.-<eos> It ain't worth it.<eos> No.<eos> Mei!<eos> It's okay.<eos> He wanted to go home.<eos> Need to talk to him.<eos> Thirty million dead in south China.<eos> Scores by my own hand.
You shouldn't be up after all you've been through.<eos> I heard Brigham Young was outside.<eos> You've got to let the slippery elm do its work.<eos> I am.<eos> I... I will.<eos> From bed.<eos> In case of infection, you need to rest.<eos> Eva, thank you.<eos> I truly appreciate everything that you've done, and I promise you that I will rest.<eos> But I...
- How can I help you?<eos> - Can you meet me?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I wasn't forthcoming on previous encounters, but now I fear...<eos> I'm right in the middle of something.<eos> Something terrible is about to happen, something I enabled.<eos> But now I'm having second thoughts.<eos> What?<eos> What's about to happen?<eos> Not on the phone.
Do you have a problem with Synthetics?<eos> Why would I have a problem with the thing that's making my existence pointless?<eos> ~ I told you - I didn't touch him.<eos> ~ We both know there's no-one in this school who would even know where to begin.<eos> Modifying Synthetics is not only illegal, it's also dangerous.<eos> If I find you were responsible - exclusion will be on the table.<eos> All right.<eos> I've heard your allegation and your threat - but I haven't heard any proof.<eos> My daughter has said she didn't do it, so until you come up with some evidence to the contrary, that's how we'll proceed.<eos> Mattie?
People don't really want to be free.<eos> Besides, it's an illusion.<eos> I mean, you take my birds... oh, they just love flying free, but every night they fly on home to their cages where it's safe and warm.<eos> Sunny, you know what's out there beyond our borders?<eos> A big sack full of stories.<eos> It's a wasteland.<eos> No, no, it's a paradise.<eos> It's a... whatever.<eos> Nobody knows what is and ain't true.<eos> And, besides...
Keep going.<eos> You took me off on purpose.<eos> You have to let me do my job.<eos> If you can't, how do we work together?<eos> Peterson can end my career.<eos> I can go to prison.<eos> Any mention of this could end things for Lena before it even starts.<eos> Well, you can't let him do it.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> And your wife.
This is just great.<eos> You okay?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You drove me off the road.<eos> I could've been killed.<eos> You're lucky you're not dead, Norma Bates.<eos> I'm calling 911.<eos> Sure, you could.<eos> But do you know who would be better for you to call?<eos> Bob Paris.
It's attractive.<eos> I know this sounds weird, but could you possibly bang on my chest?<eos> I've got all this crap in there that needs to get out.<eos> I know it's disgusting.<eos> My dad normally has the honors, but...<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cup your hands and then pound on my chest like this.<eos> Sorry.
Okay.<eos> Cup your hands and then pound on my chest like this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You've got to do it harder.<eos> You've got to knock all the stuff off the walls in my lungs.<eos> I-I don't... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.<eos> I'm tougher than I look.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Sorry.
I-I don't... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.<eos> I'm tougher than I look.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You've got to do it harder.<eos> That's better.<eos> Sorry.
I mean, we all go a little mad sometimes.<eos> It... it was a mistake.<eos> But I'm home now, and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> And nothing means as much to me as being your mother.<eos> I'll make us some dinner, and we can spend some time together.<eos> Okay, Mother.<eos> Hi, Alex.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> Hey, Norma.<eos> I, um...
Eh... you know, tinker around a little bit.<eos> Play something for me.<eos> Go on.<eos> I hardly remember.<eos> I remember you practicing that on that old piano that we inherited.<eos> Half the keys stuck, but you played it anyways.<eos> Yeah. Remember this?<eos> What?<eos> ♪ Although, although you belong ♪<eos> ♪ To somebody new ♪
What?<eos> ♪ Although, although you belong ♪<eos> ♪ To somebody new ♪<eos> ♪ Tonight, you belong to me ♪<eos> - You remember?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> ♪ Although, although we're apart ♪<eos> ♪ You're a part of my heart ♪<eos> ♪ Tonight, you belong to me ♪<eos> ♪ Down by the stream ♪
This wasn't on the manifest.<eos> Yeah, this is kind of a personal thing.<eos> Hey, Pavlov, you dog-teasing-dick!<eos> How's this for positive reinforcement? !<eos> All right, where to next?<eos> I want to kill more scientists!<eos> All right, Chris, that was the British Parliament, 1912. Next, we...<eos> I say, that looks like a young Charlie Chaplin.<eos> Sir, please, take this money and use it to pursue your dreams.<eos> Danke.
Thanks so much for coming down.<eos> I, uh, know your schedule must be completely insane.<eos> I'm missing my book club, a World War I saga with... Surprise... Orphans and tuberculosis.<eos> This will be much more interesting.<eos> Well, I'm interested in hearing your take.<eos> A take is all I'm giving you, so we're clear.<eos> We have to run.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, w-what do you think you're doing? Nap time is over.<eos> We're taking him to county lockup.<eos> On whose orders?
I think she said she wasn't really feeling it with her husband anymore.<eos> A stripper with a husband.<eos> We're not the most stable of people.<eos> Well, you seem pretty... Self-aware.<eos> Well, you seem pretty cuddly for a cop.<eos> Is your partner for real?<eos> No, Molk is magical. Like a unicorn.<eos> Why don't... You two get to know each other?<eos> A lap dance? Come on. We're working here.<eos> For what?
Are you happy?<eos> Can she corroborate your story?<eos> We meet up at the Devonshire on Market and 6th.<eos> I was going there to break up with her.<eos> And if you don't believe me, you can check the security log at the time of Kaleb's death.<eos> All right, what... what... what about this girl?<eos> Does she... does she have a name?<eos> Her name's Alyssa.<eos> You're such an asshole.<eos> Hey. Easy.
Going over your speech?<eos> Ha. My speech, uh, my dance, trying not to sweat right now.<eos> Probably thinking about that second mortgage you have to take out to afford all this, huh?<eos> And I got to do it three more times, homey.<eos> - Ooh. - I couldn't have had one boy?<eos> I was just gonna say that.<eos> I appreciate you doing this, though, for real.<eos> It's been a tough week.<eos> The thing that happened with Kaleb... difficult for everybody to swallow.<eos> Not for me.
We're just friends.<eos> - I'm 21.<eos> - So, you have daddy issues, and you're gonna have sex-offender status if you get anywhere near her again.<eos> You had no right to do that.<eos> I had an obligation.<eos> He been your boyfriend for long?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Who the hell are you, anyway?<eos> I'm Dustin Maker's lawyer.<eos> Whatever.
And I can't claim credit.<eos> I know I tried to stop you.<eos> But you never gave up.<eos> You knew what you wanted.<eos> [inhales deeply] You proved me wrong.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Keep an eye on your brother, will ya?<eos> FATTY B: Yo. We need to talk.<eos> Where's all this shit going, man?<eos> Straight back at Chan.
Face the wall.<eos> Face the wall!<eos> Where's your shadow?<eos> No gun, no shadow. Just Suger.<eos> So, does everyone in Potrero know where I live now, or just you?<eos> Just me.<eos> [clears throat] Your crib... it looks just how I pictured it.<eos> It's raw.<eos> Yeah, that's how I like it.<eos> Me, too.
- Oh, my God. - Legally.<eos> Okay. Look, I'm... I'm gonna get this back to you, okay, with whatever interest you want.<eos> I don't want interest.<eos> I want you to tell me and Terry everything you know about The Union.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Oh. What the hell for?<eos> It's non-negotiable.<eos> So, who's in The Union?<eos> I don't know who's in The Union.<eos> Except for Criolla.
You ask him yourself... Ask him what this all means.<eos> Tell him you're investigating the union and you want answers.<eos> Okay, but we know that this is bigger than Criolla.<eos> You still don't think they did the frame job?<eos> I think I want to keep my goddamn fingers!<eos> Okay, look, I'm going back to the invisible hand, and I'm giving them their 70 grand.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> I'm sorry, Hildy, okay? You gave it to me.<eos> I know I did, and I'm not asking for it back, but this is Friday.<eos> Friday.
Your choice.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was having an affair.<eos> Mark, I'm so sorry.<eos> Please tell me that's not true.<eos> You were overseas for months at a time and... making a living for us.<eos> - I was... I was so lonely.<eos> - Lonely?<eos> I was lonely too.<eos> I...
This operation will answer the American aggression forcefully.<eos> Collapsing their economy in a single blow.<eos> American influence over the world will erode, and we will be able to operate as we wish in the Ukraine, in Europe, and beyond.<eos> We are calling it "Black Dagger".<eos> Madness.<eos> This plan will kill thousands of Americans.<eos> Tens of thousands.<eos> Madness is the last of Russian sovereignty.<eos> Madness is American sanctions forbidding us from accessing our own bank account.<eos> Now even in Switzerland.
Sit down.<eos> I'm gonna respectfully decline Intelligence.<eos> Wasn't the answer I expected.<eos> I know Intelligence is this... huge opportunity...<eos> It's just I'm not ready to be off the beat yet.<eos> My partner and I, we went through something with that shooting.<eos> And, you know, I'm just...<eos> I'm not going to leave him until we can both put it behind us.<eos> My heart's in uniform.<eos> At least right now.
Oh, shit.<eos> Officer Cameron.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're in CPS Med Bay Nine.<eos> What's the day?<eos> September 25th.<eos> The year?<eos> 2080.<eos> Have Officer Cameron's family notified she's awake.<eos> Family?
Not the future.<eos> Right now.<eos> Your foot soldiers are here in this time.<eos> I can help you use them, push their actions.<eos> Push the timeline in the right direction.<eos> The right way.<eos> I'm still gonna think about it.<eos> It's your prerogative, of course.<eos> But one way or another, your destiny will catch up with you and bring you back to me.<eos> To us.
And you can tell Alec that I'm...<eos> Did Alec tell you who's bearing an encryption code on my data?<eos> He wouldn't do that.<eos> Except he did.<eos> I want clean data disks or a key to turn it off.<eos> Otherwise, we're finished here.<eos> And I'm making a call to ensure someone else is finished as well.<eos> Woah, woah, woah. Hold it there.<eos> This is a restricted area.<eos> Not for me.
Sure, sure.<eos> You could introduce yourself.<eos> Hey, I'm your future husband.<eos> The older guy here is our future kid.<eos> Yeah, she'll fall for you straight away.<eos> It doesn't have to get that weird.<eos> It's already a supernova of weird.<eos> There are things I haven't told you.<eos> I really only remember her from pictures.<eos> Vid files.
Is Kiera dead?<eos> Alec?<eos> She might not be.<eos> The machine was tethered to my future.<eos> The future that was destroyed the moment Kellogg went through, allowing the traveller to return to his own time.<eos> What the hell happened to Kiera?<eos> There's no way to know.<eos> It might be another 60 years before we figure it out.<eos> Look, what we do with this is up to us.<eos> All of us.
Hey, we don't have to talk about fishing.<eos> I ... or we can talk about fishing, if it'll help your case.<eos> Is it the air?<eos> Is it the trees?<eos> There's just group insanity going ...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Fish scales.<eos> Well, can you sniff the tires and tell me where the car's been?<eos> It's addressed to Mark.<eos> Probably Harris.
Do you own a crossbow?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> Listen, I hope that you catch whoever it is that killed this guy.<eos> And I hope you figure out how he cheated.<eos> What makes you think he cheated?<eos> What do you think? Fish just jumping into his boat?<eos> - When you do...<eos> - Would you tell me how he was doing it?<eos> - On the sly?
And on the eve of our biggest annual benefit?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If you wanna come in, you're gonna need a warrant.<eos> We're investigating a homicide here.<eos> I know you're not trying to stand in our way.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> But unless you think one of my paintings murdered someone, this conversation is over.<eos> Detectives.<eos> Remind me to halt my donations<eos> - to this establishment immediately.
And going through the lab's recent cases to find if any of them are missing any key evidence.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Well, it's what I didn't find that's interesting.<eos> Not one case ... Susie's or otherwise ... in the last six months is missing any of the evidence that you found in Susie's apartment.<eos> Well, then, where did it come from?<eos> I'm afraid that's your job, detective.<eos> Now, the autopsy did confirm that Susie died from a massive blow to the back of the head.<eos> Something ... Something heavy, like a-a metal pipe or a tire iron.<eos> I found some metal alloy in the cranial avulsions ...<eos> - Um...
And they're all assigned to different responders.<eos> Who has access to the company's data?<eos> Unfortunately, a lot of people.<eos> We ran their employee list through our database, but no one popped.<eos> We're gonna check them out one by one,<eos> - but it's gonna take some time.<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> Do you still have the naughty cowboy?<eos> Winston?<eos> At your service.
- Opportunity.<eos> Love it.<eos> - We have an address on this guy?<eos> All right, all right, I'll be down in the lobby in two minutes.<eos> Technically, talking to your mother isn't working.<eos> She needs me.<eos> - You know, I don't have time for this.<eos> - For what?<eos> We're having a meeting.<eos> About what?

So, she was dead when she went into the pool?<eos> - Or almost dead.<eos> - What killed her?<eos> Acute strychnine toxicity.<eos> She was poisoned.<eos> Kent!<eos> - Kent.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, did you call the Harris family?<eos> - Who?
Salem, as in the Salem witch trials?<eos> His family came to Massachusetts during the Great Puritan Migration.<eos> He grew up a spiritual man, a pillar of the community, beloved by all.<eos> Times were hard back then, but the town was close-knit.<eos> Everyone pulled together, no matter their background.<eos> Why, thank you, Mrs. Parsons.<eos> I don't know the next time we'll have fresh bread, especially if this drought lingers.<eos> As Providence decrees.<eos> Peace be upon you.<eos> And upon you.
Power that can be turned against you.<eos> Atropine... found in Jimsonweed, which you use to boost your powers.<eos> In high doses, it causes hallucination and seizures, something we know through modern chemistry.<eos> Your magic is vulnerable to elemental energy.<eos> Such as lightning.<eos> And in the 21st century, we make our own lightning.<eos> The spellcaster of whom you speak her name is Katrina Van Tassel.<eos> And you've brought harm to her family!<eos> And you've brought harm to her!<eos> And to me!
- He's not the one who's pregnant.<eos> - That's the fucking problem, isn't it?<eos> He's isn't the one who's pregnant.<eos> He'd be shitting his pants if he were.<eos> He'd find the money if he thought he was gonna swell up...<eos> - ... like he swallowed a watermelon.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So let's go see him.<eos> - Wait. Who?<eos> No. Cam?
It's less traumatic to the uterus.<eos> - Guess it's not the Dark Ages anymore.<eos> - How much is it gonna hurt her?<eos> - It'll be a bit uncomfortable.<eos> She might cramp a fair amount afterwards.<eos> - But the procedure shouldn't hurt.<eos> - Mine hurt. Mine did.<eos> - It was like a nightmare.<eos> - Well, like you said... this isn't the Dark Ages.<eos> Not here at least.
At this rate, you should be able to solve the problems in the reference book in no time.<eos> It's because you're a good teacher.<eos> Really?<eos> I have a bossy master, so I can tell.<eos> By master, do you mean the kendo master who raised you?<eos> He's useless.<eos> You must be close.<eos> No way, we always fight.<eos> Sounds nice, I'm jealous.<eos> Why?
We kinda had a fight.<eos> It got awkward so I kept my distance.<eos> We haven't seen dad around lately, either.<eos> He's been busy training.<eos> I miss him, but it can't be helped.<eos> You don't want your master to lose either, right?<eos> So just forget about that awkward stuff and cheer him on.<eos> Regardless of the outcome, we remain friends.<eos> I hope it's a good match.<eos> Jiroumaru!
I do.<eos> I'm taking meds to forestall it, but there's no cure.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> So you know what it's all about for me now.<eos> Time.<eos> I've been a wife and mother all my life, and I wouldn't change that for anything, but I... I never got to follow my own dreams, because I was always putting somebody else first.<eos> And now with...<eos> The time I have left, I want to change that.<eos> But you can't be on your own, mom.<eos> At least, not for much longer.
Well, that trance that brought you and all of us into town, that child in there's behind that.<eos> - So I hear. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So, what happens if that occurs again, only this time, the child turns you against your fellow man, maybe even your wife?<eos> But...<eos> Why are you so convinced of all this?<eos> Yesterday was just the beginning.<eos> This has all been foretold.<eos> Foretold?<eos> To who?<eos> To you?
I see I'm not the only one that's had a long night.<eos> He's miserable.<eos> Nothing works.<eos> All he needed was his father's arms.<eos> Or the poor thing finally exhausted himself.<eos> Well, I like my story better.<eos> I want to put him down, but I don't want to wake him.<eos> Your Eminence?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Condé.
Any idea who the dead woman was?<eos> No, but hopefully we'll get an I.D.<eos> You know, this place seems a little down-rent for a guy like Paul Winthrop to squat in.<eos> We have assumed that he's been working with a partner since he's been in Vegas, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... maybe it's more his style.<eos> Ants.<eos> I hate ants.<eos> How do you feel about body parts?<eos> All units. All units.
He just thought a familiar face might make you feel a little more comfortable.<eos> You're here a little early.<eos> I probably should have called, but there's a pileup on the I-15.<eos> Oh. Well, okay.<eos> Um, better safe than sorry.<eos> Can I get your bag? Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey.<eos> Got your text.<eos> You have something on the bodies Morgan and Hodges found?<eos> Not all of them.
Like I had insulted them by rejecting him.<eos> I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> They went through my ID, they wrote down all my information in this little notebook, and then Seth yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag.<eos> Like, what is that?<eos> Is that a trophy?<eos> - It's assault. - Yeah.<eos> But I consented to the first guy, so that's not rape, right?<eos> I'm sorry you had to go through that.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
I'm... I'm Cosima.<eos> Welcome to Clone Club.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - I know, sorry.<eos> I... I knew Beth.<eos> I knew...<eos> I knew what she was going though.<eos> We really miss her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Keep it far away from you.<eos> You know, I had to send Kira away again because these Castor assholes came after us, but I knew I had to come find you because we can't fight them alone.<eos> You know, I should have just left you here to bloody rot.<eos> In convent, I live for four months in a broom closet.<eos> I do not rot.<eos> Five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Another one of you bastards.<eos> Back away from the door.<eos> Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.<eos> Against the wall.
No, but the elastic's wearing out, so...<eos> You're late.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> - Uh, excuse me?<eos> - I tried calling you all morning.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Cosima, hang on.<eos> You're back.<eos> I came as soon as I found out Sarah was missing.<eos> - Five days too late.<eos> - No thanks to you.
I was with Rudy.<eos> It was either take her or terminate.<eos> Made the call.<eos> And marrying the Johanssen girl?<eos> Was that a call, too?<eos> Speak freely.<eos> I fell in love with her.<eos> I need you to do something.<eos> Unofficially.<eos> Huh. "For my old friend Jage."
You have my...<eos> Book?<eos> - Book.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Not your book.<eos> My... my... my father...<eos> Our... se-secret language.<eos> He didn't leave it for you, though, did he?<eos> Who, then?
Yeah.<eos> Amateur hour.<eos> Delphine was onto us the whole time.<eos> The stress was too much for her.<eos> She suffered an acute intra-cranial bleed.<eos> I've induced a coma to control the swelling, but... she may never recover.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Get back to your patient.<eos> We couldn't give you the book because if Topside had gotten ahold of it...<eos> Topside?
_<eos> Security will see you out.<eos> In London town, we all fell down, and Castor woke from slumber.<eos> Well, it's not quite Chaucer, is it?<eos> London.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Well, the bit Rachel translated, it points to London.<eos> It's our best lead.<eos> It's our... only lead.<eos> To the Castor Original?
Your resignation is accepted.<eos> You might need this while you're out in the cold.<eos> You're gonna translate that, or else we send you back to Delphine.<eos> In London town we all fell down.<eos> Thank you, Rachel.<eos> Sorry to raise any false hopes.<eos> - London.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, the bit Rachel translated points to London.<eos> To the Castor original.
So that was after the late John Sadler, I presume.<eos> These boys were all John's friends.<eos> And then after he was killed, they became my family.<eos> And, yes, Carlton was... A little bit more than that.<eos> Well done, S.<eos> Oi!<eos> S!<eos> Some nerve showing your face around here.<eos> Oi, you geriatric wankers.<eos> Oh, Christy!
Well, Paul seems nice enough--<eos> Although we hardly know them.<eos> Actually, I've gotten to know Joy quite well since they moved in.<eos> Obviously, my mistake was giving her "The Feminine Mystique."<eos> I simply said it was an interesting book,<eos> I never told her it was an instruction manual.<eos> David Buckland says we've written the most important medical book of the decade.<eos> Reshaped the entire field.<eos> Do you think I should tell him?<eos> David Buckland?
David Buckland says we've written the most important medical book of the decade.<eos> Reshaped the entire field.<eos> Do you think I should tell him?<eos> David Buckland?<eos> No, Paul, that his wife is leaving him!<eos> Is that a serious question?<eos> Well, she said she won't say anything until her bags are packed.<eos> She says he'll just try to convince her to stay, which is exactly what he should do.<eos> Or maybe you could say that you overheard the two of us talking, and tell Paul.<eos> Paul from next door?
We didn't let the time go to waste.<eos> And after the war?<eos> After the war, it was back to real life.<eos> And back to the girlfriend at home.<eos> Back to my wife.<eos> But that girl...<eos> - Did you love her?<eos> - Very much.<eos> Then how does a man just walk away back to his fiancã©e?<eos> Wife.
You're still in love with your ex-wife.<eos> No, that's not, uh...<eos> No.<eos> There were... some difficulties in our marriage, problems that still exist with me.<eos> I'm, uh...<eos> I'm on medication... for high blood pressure.<eos> Comes with certain side effects.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> I haven't wanted to tell you because I've been enjoying your company so much. And, uh, nowadays, women seem to think that sex is so important.<eos> Not all women.
It's...<eos> Thursday.<eos> I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> I thought it was Friday.<eos> Is that nightie new?<eos> It looks pretty on you.<eos> Doesn't it, Graham?<eos> Come here.<eos> Sleep well, Magpie.<eos> You too.
Thursday.<eos> I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> I thought it was Friday.<eos> Is that nightie new?<eos> It looks pretty on you.<eos> Doesn't it, Graham?<eos> Come here.<eos> Sleep well, Magpie.<eos> You too.<eos> Both of you.
Recurring dreams mean--<eos> Mean that you want me to do something about this.<eos> I know.<eos> So, I checked it out.<eos> I went to three different adoption clinics, and they all said the same thing.<eos> They do not let single women adopt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hon, it's just-- it's just not in our cards.<eos> Well, that's completely unfair, which is why I've been thinking-- there's this guy who comes in every week to get his palm read-<eos> - Rufus.
You got me.<eos> I don't let mine take any business trips without me.<eos> It's just too much fun.<eos> He does his... whatever it is he does all day while I get to enjoy myself.<eos> Last week, we were in New York City.<eos> I spent 4 1/2 hours at Saks.<eos> I thought I must have died because this is heaven.<eos> And... and what does your husband do?<eos> He's in business.<eos> What kind of business?
Is that what you mean?<eos> I-I'm not trying to get back at Jane.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Do you find that you have difficulty separating emotion from sex?<eos> As long as I'm in love with the other person, it's not a problem.<eos> Is that what you mean?<eos> Would you have sex with a man to whom you are not physically attracted?<eos> Does it pay extra?<eos> Are you able to separate love from sex?<eos> Only every night.
My responsibilities here are varied and far-reaching, but reffing a fight between mommy and daddy is not one of them.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Maybe I can spare you a lot of grief by sharing with you a tidbit I've picked up-- one you seem to have missed.<eos> Trying to control other people doesn't work, ever.<eos> The only person you can control is yourself.<eos> So, you got no relevant information out of her - about Logan.<eos> - Oh, for the love of God!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> The placebo reaction.<eos> With scents?
You should stay the night and bring them home with you.<eos> All right.<eos> I-I want you to know that, uh--<eos> This is not the time, Bill.<eos> We have a cab for you, sir.<eos> Go.<eos> Excuse me, madam.<eos> May we serve you your dinner?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Very good, madam.
Hands up!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Major.<eos> You seem to have found yourself in a spot of bother.<eos> Harry, there you are.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I was passed out on the backseat, sir.<eos> But you better get down from there. You're surrounded.<eos> It's the Falklands all over again, Harry.<eos> By land, by sea.
You are going to Galveston.<eos> I agree with Bob.<eos> You should go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I gave you a second chance last night.<eos> I can take it away.<eos> Bob giveth, Bob taketh.<eos> Juice?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey.
Let me remind you, the DA was very explicit.<eos> Ever since he worked that case for the mob, Mr. Castle can no longer take part in our investigations. He's not.<eos> I mean, technically he's conducting his own investigation.<eos> And since he's licensed, legally, there's not much that I can do to stop him.<eos> Okay, Detective. But let me be perfectly clear.<eos> You cannot help him either.<eos> And that goes for you too.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> No sharing of information, no granting access. Nothing. Or there will be hell to pay.<eos> Yes, sir.
- In this world.<eos> - Hello, sis.<eos> - Zelena.<eos> Where's Robin?<eos> What have you done with him?<eos> One phone call from me, and your beloved dies at the hands of your sister.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You are gonna write new happy endings.<eos> You have made me a monster, but I won't let you do the same to Emma.<eos> Heel.
Can't believe this survived all that time.<eos> This place that belonged to your...<eos> His name was Neal.<eos> He was a lot of things to me.<eos> Now he's just gone, thanks to her.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I think I just felt it kick.<eos> You wouldn't want to rattle an expectant mother now, would you?<eos> Everyone, pack up.<eos> You, too.
Bad news for you and me both.<eos> You said it would kill your ability to love.<eos> You didn't say that...<eos> The Dark One can't die, not like that.<eos> No, but Rumplestiltskin can.<eos> A friendly warning... you don't wanna face the Dark One when there's no one else at home.<eos> So I suggest you don't antagonize me.<eos> Oh, but it doesn't really matter.<eos> By definition, when I get my happy ending, I'll be... Guess what?<eos> Happy.
All this killing will only bring more hatred into your life, and all you'll be left with is a hole in your heart...<eos> And no hope of ever finding true happiness.<eos> You... know nothing of my happiness.<eos> Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!<eos> Milady.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> A simple "thank you" would suffice.<eos> I told you I didn't need rescuing.<eos> Believe me, I'm already questioning helping the competition.<eos> Competition?
Well, you perhaps you hadn't noticed, but I'm a deckhand, not a soldier.<eos> Then maybe we don't need to fight.<eos> I'm here on official business for the queen, delivering a dangerous prisoner from the kingdom of Kashyyyk.<eos> Well done, lad.<eos> The Wookiee prisoner gag... it always work.<eos> The what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Lock the guard in the cell.<eos> I'll be back with my mom as soon as I can.<eos> What...
I've been with Josh for a long time.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Shouldn't he realize how worthless you are?<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> All you got to do is walk in there and ask for a raise.<eos> I do it every other month.<eos> I could never do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look, I know I come off as this confident self-assured renaissance man...<eos> To who?
You don't control me.<eos> I'm not the Pharaoh.<eos> It's only because I worry.<eos> You're still young to travel alone.<eos> I'm not a child anymore, Father.<eos> Besides, I brought two guards.<eos> You're sick.<eos> It's just a cough from the desert.<eos> You're the one that looks weary.<eos> From many things.
My allegiance is to my family and to my people here.<eos> Pharaoh, who sits on a throne far across the desert, is of no more consequence to me than I am to him.<eos> The Pharaoh might have your tongue cut out for that.<eos> From what I've heard of our Pharaoh, he wouldn't know what to do with my tongue if he had it.<eos> I'll get you some water.<eos> You've been at prayer since you and Ka returned.<eos> You've never been a devoted man of the temple, General.<eos> I am pleased.<eos> I'm here to seek clarity.<eos> Clarity?
Do not count them as those who serve you.<eos> They served only their ambition.<eos> Ka was obviously taken with the promises Of general horemheb and his own desire, Which was no secret to anyone.<eos> One you were all too ready to see consummated.<eos> It was the queen's decision, my lord.<eos> I did propose a union between myself and her To keep ka and horemheb from seizing power, But she would not be deterred.<eos> In fact, she was determined to act quickly.<eos> Then tell me, vizier...<eos> Whom can i trust?<eos> No one.
I'm the vizier's son.<eos> Nahkt.<eos> Welcome.<eos> That's the first sincere greeting i've received.<eos> I'm suhad.<eos> Do you want me to teach you the rules, suhad?<eos> Another time.<eos> Would you leave us, please?<eos> It was nice to meet you.<eos> And you.
Go inside.<eos> I trust you will reveal to no one.<eos> You have my word.<eos> May the gods honor you.<eos> Sete!<eos> Sete!<eos> Death awaits us all.<eos> No... no.<eos> Whom can I trust?<eos> No one.
You have us all.<eos> Rise, my friend.<eos> My Lady, you're still too weak.<eos> I will get you the water.<eos> I want to see Sete.<eos> Sete's gone.<eos> Gone.<eos> I was told he went to care for his family in Koptos.<eos> Then please tell the Vizier that I would...<eos> Madam?
You as well, Lagus.<eos> I will not leave him.<eos> Bring me Ankhesenamun.<eos> Do this for me, my friend.<eos> My Lord.<eos> If it is time for you to join the gods, then know... that you have left this kingdom free from all her enemies.<eos> The most treacherous enemy of all is the one no one knows.<eos> I asked you whom I can trust.<eos> Do you remember what you said?<eos> No one.
I don't know, Doc.<eos> Depends on you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Let's go for a ride.<eos> The princess here has something in her head that I want.<eos> It's a memory.<eos> Now, you helped make all my memories go away.<eos> You made Khafji disappear.<eos> Boom!<eos> Just like a magic trick.
40 years ago, this man, Theodor von Martius, He was here and wrote about the plant I seek.<eos> I want to know if what he wrote is true.<eos> I dedicate my life to plants.<eos> Dedicate your life to plants?<eos> It's the most sensible thing I ever heard a white say.<eos> My name is Evan.<eos> My name was Karamakate.<eos> I went down the river from the longhouse of Wanano people.<eos> I'm looking for a plant.<eos> The yakruna.
Come on.<eos> I will not.<eos> Because?<eos> You cannot trust whites.<eos> I also do not have trust in you.<eos> So what are we doing?<eos> This is your knowledge?<eos> Firearms?<eos> His science only leads to this: "Violence".<eos> Death.
I'm afraid I walked away from you only to die thousands of kilometers from our house.<eos> I can only hope that this disease is caused by the great longing by not having you by my side.<eos> And I beg you to forgive me for expressing dark feelings.<eos> But also I hope, my love You find in my honesty another proof of my affection ...<eos> What is it?<eos> You understand me?<eos> No, but it looks like you're about to cry.<eos> He is writing to his wife.<eos> I like to express my affection for her.<eos> For a woman?
You do not deserve this!<eos> You bring hell and death to the earth!<eos> Colombians are coming!<eos> Colombians are coming!<eos> Here is yakruna!<eos> Greater knowledge than that of my people!<eos> I will not let you take it.<eos> Never!<eos> Colombians are coming!<eos> Karamakate!
Before, in no time time yesterday, 40 years ago, maybe 100. Or is there a million years.<eos> But you came back.<eos> It was not for me to teach my people.<eos> I was supposed to teach you.<eos> Give them more than they asked for.<eos> Take a song to them.<eos> Tell them everything you see, everything you feel.<eos> Come back as a man of integrity.<eos> You are Cohiuano.<eos> Karamakate!
That was that bitch in 4G, wasn't it?<eos> You got a problem?<eos> You can't say it to my face?<eos> Got to call the cops?<eos> All right, Miss Prado.<eos> There's no need for that.<eos> Just turn it down.<eos> No problem.<eos> Have a good night, Miss Prado.<eos> You too.
I will weed for eight hours straight.<eos> Just please don't make me paint over that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because it's art.<eos> (Scoffs) I don't care if it's the Mona Lisa.<eos> I told you to paint over it.<eos> Okay, could you just stop and... and look at it for a second and try to see it for what it really is?<eos> An artist trying to make people see something differently.<eos> Get it done, or I'm writing you up.<eos> As a fellow street artist,
I love them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, no, of course.<eos> I'm really glad to see you.<eos> Yeah, I'm really glad to see you, too.<eos> Come here.<eos> Excuse me, I'm looking for Connor Stevens's room?<eos> - And you are... ?<eos> - His cousin.<eos> Uh, 325.
- I told you, you have no authority here.<eos> - Denisov contacted us. I know this is your case, but if Denisov wants to talk to the FBI--<eos> - Not an option.<eos> - It's an option if Denisov says it's an option.<eos> He's holding an American hostage.<eos> A Frenchman, a German and many others.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You can't order us not to talk to him.<eos> I could arrest you and your partner for interfering in my investigation.<eos> What investigation?
I think she only invited me cos she thought she should.<eos> I think you're being a bit sensitive.<eos> If she didn't want you, she wouldn't ask you, you know what she's like.<eos> Who else is going?<eos> William's coming up from Oxford, a few people from school, a couple of her pals from Oxford, and I don't know about Kate's family.<eos> It's only small, it's all a bit last minute, not everyone's available.<eos> Our Muriel's in Corfu, sadly.<eos> So... John's living at the house.<eos> And Kate's on leave now, so she's at home all day... with John.<eos> Well, yeah. Presumably.
Is Jayne in high school or something?<eos> Yeah, Jayne's in high school.<eos> Yo, I'm ready to go.<eos> Give me 10 minutes.<eos> I'm onto something. No, man.<eos> Yo, 10 minutes, bro.<eos> I'm about to sell this dude a blunt for 50 bucks.<eos> Ten minutes.<eos> Who'?<eos> The Asian boy.
I am trying my best.<eos> I still have a lot to learn.<eos> I'm a flawed human being!<eos> But aren't we all?<eos> Really?<eos> Everyone here is perfect?<eos> Do I need to remind you that I have the keys to all your apartments?<eos> That's right.<eos> I have access to all your homes.<eos> And all your secrets.
So he's using Alison's money to buy gifts for Alison?<eos> Classy.<eos> Do you want me to say something to Aria's brother?<eos> No!<eos> No, God, no.<eos> Why aren't you answering it?<eos> Is that Aria?<eos> No.<eos> I'll just call her later.<eos> "Her?"
I honestly thought that I was helping you guys.<eos> Telling you what to wear, how to act, who to like.<eos> And when you stopped listening, I found new people who would.<eos> Being here?<eos> No one listens to me.<eos> I can't even decide what to wear, what to eat... and when to shower.<eos> I'm told everything.<eos> Everything's an order.<eos> I never realized колко лошо се чувстваше, за да си от другата стана на това.<eos> Съжалявам.
But we've already been down that road with Toby.<eos> He's not gonna tell us anything.<eos> I'm not giving him a choice this time.<eos> You need to come home with me.<eos> I never came across the name Varjak in any of my research.<eos> Are you sure Alison didn't know him?<eos> Hanna found that "Holly Varjak" passport in her attic.<eos> Yeah, Ali said all that stuff was planted.<eos> Everything the lawyer gave us was a set-up.<eos> By Mona?
If you really need a place to stay...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> Cross your fingers and wish hard that you never have to sit in that chair.<eos> You won't like it.<eos> What did he say?<eos> The truth will set you free but first it turns you inside out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where?<eos> Mona's house.
She tracked me down somehow.<eos> Said she was looking for others like her.<eos> So she's stalking you.<eos> We ended up kind of stalking each other.<eos> OK... so with everything we've got going on right now, you think you should trust her just because she's an upir?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If she wanted to hurt me, she could have let that thing last night finish the job, but she didn't.<eos> And if you scare her off, I'll never know how she fits in to any of this, or how I fit in... to things in general.<eos> Hey there.
We're listening.<eos> It's "A."<eos> Any chance of "A" hurting those girls again died with Mona.<eos> Mona was "A."<eos> That's true.<eos> But it all started again when she was locked up in Radley.<eos> It was the same game, but with a new puppet master.<eos> And the stakes were higher than ever.<eos> This "A" killed my mom<eos> - and Mona.
I will kill all the people in the square.<eos> Begins with me.<eos> And then what? Hey?<eos> You came looking for my help.<eos> Because the Doctor is in danger.<eos> - Get creates. - What?<eos> Libera aircraft.<eos> The planes kept me alive<eos> That is, there is ... one, two, three four five six seven, ... Eight naughty francotiradorcitos ready to kill me.<eos> Yes, my order.
There goes the coffee restriction.<eos> What do you want to talk to my client about?<eos> $300,000.<eos> From an offshore bank.<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> Okay, let's try something else.<eos> Where were you two nights ago?<eos> Were you at home?<eos> Or did you sleep someplace else?<eos> By chance.
Yeah.<eos> Who owns it?<eos> It belongs to Matt Robbins, but he's not here right now.<eos> He moved to New York last year, rents out the condo through an Internet service.<eos> We're going to need his phone information.<eos> I've got that in my office.<eos> Can you get us inside?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I have the key, but it's rented out right now.<eos> To who?
I was laid off a year ago, and I've been picking up freelance it work installing server systems at night.<eos> Why was your phone off all day?<eos> My battery was dead!<eos> I forgot my charger.<eos> It's a three-hour drive home.<eos> Where's your son?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I don't know!<eos> Why don't I start asking you that question?<eos> Or you!
I am a Crocker, and Crockers were made to kill.<eos> But you can stop.<eos> I don't want to stop.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> For the first time, I have chosen my destiny.<eos> And it feels good.<eos> Duke, let me go.<eos> I don't take orders from you anymore.<eos> And I'm finally taking orders from the person I was always meant to.<eos> Croatoan.
Andreas, Peter, where are you?<eos> My fucking head.<eos> I need some air.<eos> You okay?<eos> What I told you last night about Letha...<eos> You can't put that on yourself.<eos> I kept my daughter locked in a soundproof box, and I never knew how to love her.<eos> - Promise me you won't tell anybody.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Especially Peter.
I get what you're going through... losing Letha, the baby, and now you feel like you're losing me, but you're not.<eos> You need to let go, so that I can live my life.<eos> Ride or die notwithstanding.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Any sign of them?<eos> Not for a while now.<eos> - You've got bars on your phone?<eos> My neighbor has a land line.<eos> One of you should make a run for it.<eos> - One of us?
I-I think I remember reading something about that somewhere.<eos> Then I moved back to France in 1944.<eos> My fiancé at the time was a Canadian army officer.<eos> I was a nursing sister.<eos> And what happened to him?<eos> He saw combat in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge.<eos> PTSD.<eos> We drifted apart.<eos> You do like soldier boys.<eos> And the war machine.
I don't know.<eos> This could go very badly for you if you know something you're not telling us.<eos> What the fuck's wrong with you?<eos> You're threatening her after she's lost...<eos> You need to cool off, pal.<eos> Look... we all want to catch whoever did this.<eos> But right now we have a funeral to get ready for.<eos> We can pick this up another time.<eos> If you think of anything in the meanwhile, call me.<eos> Sorry for your loss.
- So?<eos> - So?<eos> You know what she's like, you know what she can do.<eos> If she gets suspicious, she will not drop this, ever.<eos> A psychic who didn't have a clue her fiancé was fucking every Croat cooze in the greater Pottstown area.<eos> I'm not exactly terrified by her powers.<eos> It doesn't take a clairvoyant to know something's wrong if you don't...<eos> Our hands are clean!<eos> So I don't give a jumping fuck what she turns up.<eos> Bajram?
You're gonna have to convince him.<eos> But I know this man.<eos> He is the answer to our problem.<eos> And Culper is not dead.<eos> Neither is our ring.<eos> It's just not completed yet.<eos> I pray you've not been attending me this entire day, Mrs. Woodhull.<eos> It was no trouble.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Oh, wretched.
How do you feel?<eos> Oh, wretched.<eos> But I no longer despair.<eos> I never thought to have a roof over me.<eos> Never sleep in my own bed.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> Richard.<eos> Glad to see you, old friend.<eos> I'm so sorry that you got caught up in all of this, Richard.<eos> - You and your family.
Everybody moves on our command!<eos> Reece here.<eos> Alpha Team is in position.<eos> Kensi, Deeks, you ready?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Charlie Team is waiting on your green light.<eos> Charlie Team, hold.<eos> Bravo, hold.<eos> Alpha?<eos> On my count.
And he was formerly deported.<eos> All right, we're on it.<eos> Check it out.<eos> It's the same guy that's loading his truck across the street.<eos> Wow, fantastic.<eos> Maybe he can get us a discount on low-flow shower heads.<eos> You know showers account for 1.2 trillion gallons of water a year?<eos> Maybe he can get us a low-flow fixture for your mouth.<eos> Maybe he can get us a water softener for your attitude.<eos> Oh, touché!
Two young lovers who were forbidden to marry, so they ran away, up into the mountains.<eos> Avoiding all drug tunnels, of course.<eos> Now, the goddess of the land took pity on them.<eos> She changed the young man into a giant cactus, and she took the spirit of the young woman and put it into the plant.<eos> Occasionally, the young woman emerges to enjoy the view, in the form of a cactus flower.<eos> Protected and together for eternity.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, arriba!<eos> Arriba!<eos> Abajo!<eos> Al centro!
I'm just saying leave the thinking to the rest of us, you know?<eos> Stick to what you're good at, throwing up your dinner.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw all of you.<eos> Can you believe her?<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> Annabel told us how you wanted to go to the cops and rat us out?<eos> She doesn't know what she's talking about.<eos> Oh, I hope so, because I would hate to see something happen to you as well.<eos> Or worse, your reputation.
You see, it's hard for me to believe you were in a serious relationship... when you don't even know his name.<eos> This man is called Alistair.<eos> His parents are alive.<eos> He did not work for a bank.<eos> Is it possible... you enjoyed extreme sexual encounters with someone who didn't want you to know their name?<eos> Is it possible?<eos> This will stop.<eos> Right now.<eos> He lied.<eos> About everything.
- I can't wait, to be honest.<eos> Listen, after the honeymoon, you come and see me.<eos> We'll sort you out, all right?<eos> Ellie's used to the best in life and no son-in-law of mine can go on living like a student.<eos> Or wearing shoes like that.<eos> I had no idea just how important those bloody shoes were going to be.<eos> Ryan, is this what you dragged me out here for?<eos> - Give it a rest.<eos> - Oh come on, El, just for old times.<eos> What old times?
What is the change you want to make?<eos> Kitty, I'm sure you'll agree, has made an excellent protégée.<eos> I believe that a matriculation is in order.<eos> So you want to make Kitty your new partner.<eos> That she had the makings of a detective was never in doubt.<eos> But I confess to having my concerns regarding her history.<eos> The many... traumas visited upon her.<eos> And I was certain that it would take time to develop her.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Mostly thanks to you.
And it's inside.<eos> I thought that maybe if you spoke to the super...<eos> You must think I'm an idiot, starting up again with a guy who cheated on me, getting sentimental about a flower he gave me.<eos> Well, I'm not here to judge you.<eos> You know what the really stupid thing is?<eos> Is that he gave these to all the girls.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Girls he was sleeping with.<eos> He would give them a yellow clivia. Just like mine.<eos> Mmm.
Simon's the only family I've got left.<eos> I know it's not an excuse. It's just...<eos> I didn't know he hurt those girls.<eos> But I wasn't surprised either. He's always been...<eos> different.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> No, I swear. He didn't tell me where he was going.<eos> He told me his own people were trying to kill him.<eos> You said he took something from the pharmacy, a medication?<eos> Esephera.
Man will cease to exist.<eos> One could believe he's talking about you.<eos> Perhaps you could apply the measurement to France?<eos> The topography of France is already begun.<eos> Splendid!<eos> Let's hope the size of our holdings isn't overblown.<eos> I regret, Sire the preliminary results indicate that France is not so big as we thought.<eos> You mean to subtract with your sums the lands I gained in war in the Spanish Netherlands?<eos> No one can argue with the truth, Sire.<eos> Not even a King.
-No, it was an accident.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> An accident in which someone died, cameron, While we were stoned out of our minds and driving a stolen car.<eos> I'm not going to prison.<eos> Have you seen orangeisthenew black?<eos> I'm not taking a shower wearing tampon sandals.<eos> What the hell are we gonna do?<eos> We can never tell anyone about this.<eos> Ever.<eos> Not your therapist.

Like a little... Cross made out of twigs or something?<eos> How about a neon sign that says, "buried dead body."<eos> We could leave our drivers licenses on it, idiot.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> I'm a good person.<eos> (sobbing) and the only reason why i'm actually agreeing to this Is because my dad just had his gallbladder removed And there's no way he can handle the stress right now.<eos> Nate, i don't care if she's the bang of the century.<eos> This chick has to go.<eos> (dog barking)<eos> Heel!

I will.<eos> I, Caroline Elizabeth Dawson, take you, Katherine Abike Mackenzie, to be my wedded wife.<eos> To have and to hold, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish...<eos> .. from this day forward.<eos> Caroline and Kate have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other.<eos> They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and the giving and receiving of rings.<eos> I now pronounce you spouses for life.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Aren't you at the...?<eos> The wedding?
He's younger than Gillian.<eos> And it's all been a bit of a surprise.<eos> ~ Uncle Gary.<eos> ~ Ah. Gosh.<eos> They're coming over for Sunday lunch tomorrow.<eos> Him and Felicity.<eos> ~ Did you know?<eos> ~ Course I knew.<eos> I was there when you arranged it.<eos> ~ So, Celia...
Celia said you were upset about this... .. baby business.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well. Yes. It's been...<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Judith's...?<eos> Gone.<eos> To stay with her sister.<eos> ~ In St Albans.<eos> ~ So that's...?<eos> Good, yeah.
My God, was I in love with her.<eos> I couldn't believe she existed.<eos> She was so, you know...<eos> Caroline.<eos> But then you realise all you've fallen in love with is this face.<eos> This lip, this eye, this nostril.<eos> It took me ten years to realise that actually... when you've get beyond the tantalising exterior... she's actually pretty boring.<eos> I mean, who the shit reads chemistry, for God's sake?<eos> I just think that people have a shelf-life with each other, and we should just accept that and learn to move on, so we can enjoy....<eos> ~ What?
For your information, lana...<eos> I skimmed it.<eos> And bully for you.<eos> Ah.<eos> God dammit! Where the hell is it?<eos> I assume on the back of my toilet.<eos> What, lana? Look at all the shit I had to pack.<eos> I don't know what people are gonna be wearing for apres-montee!<eos> S-- and ray didn't bring the gum!<eos> Ah. Witch...
[Continues laughing] Hilarious.<eos> Santiago, whenever you can, please drop of those case files.<eos> You got it, partner!<eos> Be right in!<eos> "Partner"?<eos> What is going on?<eos> Is this a make-a-wish thing?<eos> Are you dying?<eos> Is it from loneliness? I found a mistake in one of the Captain's old cases and he asked me to work it with him.<eos> As partners.
- I don't know.<eos> - No, I don't. Not as a rule, but professionally, it's not a good idea.<eos> Is that a rule?<eos> No co-workers?<eos> Didn't say that.<eos> I... I like co-workers.<eos> I... but the... the hospital, we have rules that are, um...<eos> Thank you for the update.<eos> You wanted a consult?<eos> Not me.
- No, I don't. Not as a rule, but professionally, it's not a good idea.<eos> Is that a rule?<eos> No co-workers?<eos> Didn't say that.<eos> I...

Well, you're my first friend that ever tried to blow me up in a drone strike.<eos> I had to make that call.<eos> You, more than anyone, know what we're up against here.<eos> Which makes you an asset.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if you want me to help you, then you better tell me everything.<eos> There are 29 known deaths in the United States in the last six months.<eos> All women who died from accelerated pregnancies.<eos> All of which trace back to the target.<eos> Your son.
And that... was the last time I heard his voice.<eos> You testify to Congress, you find out John and Julie are having an affair, and men with guns break into your house.<eos> They take Ethan away.<eos> - And then...<eos> - John is dead.<eos> And I... end up at RestWell Recovery Center.<eos> And Julie has Ethan.<eos> Yeah, I'm not one of those guys who wears a tinfoil hat, but...<eos> Molly, nobody is that unlucky.<eos> Not even you.
I care about losing Ethan, too, Charlie.<eos> That's my brother.<eos> I know.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Maybe we should go get some food?<eos> - Get your mind off things?<eos> - No, I can't take you out of the lab.<eos> There's new protocols after last week.<eos> Okay, I'm not saying we go on safari.<eos> Just up the street.
- Come with me?<eos> Ethan, do you think I want to go to war?<eos> I want to stay here and play video games and go outside, but that is not my function... is it, Charlie?<eos> So, no, Ethan, you can't come with me.<eos> You're not like us.<eos> You never will be.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> At least not today.
Thank you.<eos> Dorothy, don't do anything stupid.<eos> Please.<eos> I... feel...<eos> - Pain?<eos> - Fear.<eos> Now I get why humans fear death.<eos> - I don't want to die, Charlie.<eos> - Hey. Luckily, you're not going to.<eos> - At least, not today.
Ever.<eos> I can't remove your expiration date, Lucy.<eos> - You mean you won't.<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, I physically can't.<eos> Removing your expiration date would kill you.<eos> - It's a safeguard.<eos> - Safeguard from what?<eos> John Woods believed that nothing was meant to last forever.<eos> Not even a soldier.
Why should I believe you now?<eos> Do you really think, if I did it, I'd be stupid enough to leave a blood-stained knife in my caravan?<eos> Murderers have made many stupid mistakes, - you won't be the last.<eos> - I'm not a murderer.<eos> You had means, motive and opportunity.<eos> I'm charging you with the murder of Reggie Smythe.<eos> Could you hold these?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're a dab hand with the lock pick.<eos> Beginner's luck.
Then you went directly to the pub to give yourself an alibi.<eos> Why didn't you go to the police?<eos> After I'd already covered up what I did?<eos> How's that going to look?<eos> Besides, I thought it was a just punishment after what I did to Mr. Smythe - hell on Earth with Mr. Welkin.<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> You don't deserve hell on Earth, or anywhere else.<eos> This doesn't change anything.<eos> She killed Smythe, and if she doesn't want to go to prison, she'll marry me.<eos> And with great willingness of spirit.
- I didn't kill John Woods.<eos> I wasn't even sure he was dead until you told me.<eos> For all I knew, it was him on the other end of the game.<eos> That's a cute little story.<eos> Every single lead we have, everything that we have heard or seen, all roads lead to you, Mr. Calderon.<eos> Everything you think you know is wrong.<eos> Well, enlighten us.<eos> Quickly.<eos> What do you know about Taylor?<eos> Careful.
You invented the hybrid-virus.<eos> You chose your side.<eos> I made mistakes.<eos> They were more than mistakes!<eos> They were lives!<eos> MOLLY: We have to stop running and stand together.<eos> Your problems are not ours.<eos> Okay, look... look, in a few hours, a new virus is gonna be released on the world, and it's gonna kill humans and hybrids alike, and it's gonna spread.<eos> It's gonna be airborne, waterborne, and there'll be no end to its destruction.<eos> Our extinction...
All that we have in the world, we give to him.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> What's in your heart, Ananias, to make you lie to the Holy Spirit?<eos> What?<eos> You've kept for yourself some of the money from the sale of your house.<eos> What made you think of doing such a thing?<eos> !<eos> This is absurd.<eos> You've lied.<eos> Not just to us, but to God.
How many Jewish lives have fallen to the man I killed?<eos> That's not good enough.<eos> You cannot justify murder!<eos> Then why didn't you give me up to Caiaphas?<eos> Because only God decides who lives and dies!<eos> I will not be compelled to decide a man's fate!<eos> I will harbor you.<eos> But I cannot and will not force you to surrender.<eos> The foundation of what we believe in here is love...<eos> For all people.
Maybe that's why she wants me around.<eos> Because I'm like her.<eos> I'm not an adult.<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> We have Boaz, finally.<eos> Thank you for coming to me.<eos> It was a risk.<eos> No.<eos> Anything to at last get back to normality.<eos> Normality?
- Yes.<eos> You've been robbed.<eos> What are you doing holding this woman prisoner?<eos> I am a diplomat of the Kingdom of Bahrain.<eos> I demand immunity.<eos> Really?<eos> They were on your dad's list of acceptable groceries.<eos> For his heart condition.<eos> What kind of heart condition is addressed by rye and Haagen-Dazs?<eos> A broken one.
I'm surprised she didn't marry the prince and-and live in palaces with all those bathrooms!<eos> - All right.<eos> - At least Mom's not a fake.<eos> Stevie, this is between your grandfather and me.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Mom doesn't lie.<eos> She doesn't pretend to be better than she is.<eos> And she faces up to the things that she's done.<eos> - What are you even talking about?<eos> - You.
She still looks up to you, you know.<eos> There's a lot to look up to.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> W...<eos> Dad.<eos> What?<eos> Don't go.<eos> - Just please stay.<eos> - No, take me to the bus.<eos> The bus?
How?<eos> We've got 196 runs to make and we're down to eight men.<eos> ♪ West Indies first innings total was 326<eos> ♪ Just as usual... ♪<eos> Well played, darling.<eos> Thank you, Constable.<eos> I'll explain on the way.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> I see you've lost another captain.<eos> Thanks to you.
One picks things up.<eos> If you'll excuse me?<eos> Still here, Father?<eos> Yes.<eos> God's work, never done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Grayson, is it true you have access to the safe?<eos> Colonel and I both have keys.<eos> I've done the accounts since the old master's day.<eos> For the vineyard as well?
Why not?<eos> "Why not?" What do you...<eos> what do you mean?<eos> I mean, um...<eos> I mean, what... what about the lead?<eos> Well, apparently,<eos> Thomas busted this ex-special forces guy a couple weeks ago-- a courier with Effective World-Wide Solutions.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why do I know that name?<eos> Probably Afghanistan.
You won't settle it by ruining his marriage.<eos> Did you poison my father?<eos> It wasn't them.<eos> It was the duke of Guise.<eos> Your uncle will never betray anyone again.<eos> And so we mourn my brother.<eos> A man who always put his country first.<eos> Whenever it was profitable.<eos> And who always understood his duty.<eos> To himself.
There's more to it, of course.<eos> Are you worried you're pregnant with your attacker's child?<eos> You still have only one goal... a child to secure power, as your child increased yours.<eos> I just told you that I...<eos> And your first thought is how long you have to wait to be sure I am not giving birth to a rapist's child.<eos> Well... are you past it?<eos> Yes, I am past that fear, but I face others.<eos> Darling, I am sorry.<eos> But the man who violated you should not succeed in damaging your aspirations.<eos> Your aspirations, not mine.
- What toys do you like?<eos> - Planes.<eos> Hello.<eos> What do you want to do later?<eos> For me, later is now.<eos> What are you doing now?<eos> Right now, I'm building a bridge.<eos> The rest of the time, I do what I like.<eos> Is that good?<eos> So-so.
This isn't a plane. It's a train.<eos> Why go by train?<eos> I'm scared of flying.<eos> - What do you want to drink?<eos> - A Coke.<eos> Hide, then!<eos> Service.<eos> Yes, Madam?<eos> A whisky with no ice and a Coke with no ice.<eos> - Of course, Madam.
There you are. Finally!<eos> Where's your date?<eos> What, you don't want to show her off in front of Stefan?<eos> I'm afraid she doesn't find me nearly as fascinating as I do.<eos> But you have an accent.<eos> Anything you say is automatically fascinating.<eos> I'm afraid we found the exception.<eos> Told her I was a vampire, and her eyes glazed over literally.<eos> Pure and utter disinterest.<eos> Ha! Ha ha ha!
What's your life gonna look like if this comes out?<eos> Do you really think your fake husband's gonna stand by you?<eos> Read the report, Lou.<eos> Save us all a lot of embarrassment.<eos> Your leg's healing.<eos> The limp is better, which means you can save me a dance.<eos> One step at a time, you know?<eos> Which tie should I wear to the first party that I have been to in 20 years?<eos> Well, the blue one is the only one that matches that suit...<eos> And your eyes.
That's okay, Pop.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> I love her.<eos> All I want is to make her happy forever.<eos> Fine.<eos> I give you my blessing.<eos> But if you hurt my mom in any way, so help me God, I will cut off your son's testicles.<eos> Snip, snip, snip.<eos> And I'm not playing.<eos> Deal.
Yeah, well, just you wait.<eos> What did I say?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that you do these things to test us, to test him.<eos> Okay, does anyone think that this is getting a little bit out of hand?<eos> I left my bike. I was late.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The other tenants see you getting away with something like this, and they figure, "Oh, hey, what the hell?<eos> The manager's daughter can leave a bike..."<eos> Stepdaughter.
- Richie.<eos> Can you steal your mom's car?<eos> What...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you?<eos> Well, I have swim practice today.<eos> Please, Richie.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> Me too.
No.<eos> Give me the gun, Enid.<eos> Turn around and walk away.<eos> You're not gonna pull the trigger.<eos> I will if you make me.<eos> Let go.<eos> Asshole.<eos> You point a gun at me and I'm the asshole?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Out the back down the alley.
He never saw it coming.<eos> I was 23 years old, and with those four shots... I took control of all the crime families in the east end.<eos> By the time I was 30, I'd taken half the city.<eos> You got stones, Mr. Draco, that's for sure.<eos> Stones alone ain't enough, Gene.<eos> You gotta have brains too.<eos> And let me tell you...<eos> Big Frankie?<eos> He had brains.<eos> All over the room.
[laughs] wow, and here I thought<eos> She was kidding about the pig's blood.<eos> [laughs] no...<eos> It was-- it was calf's blood.<eos> [laughing] [cries] stupid, frickin' edie.<eos> I'll show her what arn's balls taste like.<eos> Wait, what the?<eos> Barry?<eos> Hey...<eos> You.
[laughing] [cries] stupid, frickin' edie.<eos> I'll show her what arn's balls taste like.<eos> Wait, what the?<eos> Barry?<eos> Hey...<eos> You.<eos> [body thuds] [lana] hello?<eos> Krieger?<eos> You in here?<eos> Hey, you!
Mm... 20 minutes?<eos> Dammit!<eos> Yeah, that is not good for you.<eos> No, turn around dick-nuts,<eos> I can still make the rehearsal dinner.<eos> After we rescue pam.<eos> Now, shut up.<eos> Oh, and un-shut up for a second.<eos> Is this the way to the grain elevator?<eos> Ah... Oh, yeah, right down that road.
[archer] piece of shit rental.<eos> [edie] you drive like a...<eos> Egg. I-- no, I don't, and also, shut up<eos> Because right now I'm going to explain<eos> What cyborgs are, and why they're a threat,<eos> To our entire way of life.<eos> [cyril] I mean, not now, obviously.<eos> But, someday.<eos> Someday soon... [snoring]<eos> Hm? Hey, you.
I'm sorry, Tyler.<eos> I got it.<eos> I'm guessing you're not here on a basketball scholarship.<eos> That's not a regulation trashcan.<eos> Hey. I saw your camera.<eos> I'm thinking about buying one.<eos> You like it?<eos> It gets the job done.<eos> What kind of photography are you into?<eos> A little bit of everything.
Don't.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> If I can get through to her, we save Bonnie's life.<eos> If not...<eos> At least I'll be with her when she dies.<eos> Hey. Is that an MM?<eos> - Where?<eos> - Right there.<eos> Little to the left, little to the left.<eos> Right there, right... Oh, ohh.
Which means it moved into her heart.<eos> Runs of V-tach!<eos> Okay, uh, 75 of lido.<eos> Let's get a repeat chest film!<eos> Page cardio!<eos> Brenda, no more surprises!<eos> It was a urine sample and two blood draws.<eos> I-I gave it to an intern, and I told her to...<eos> I found it sitting on a supply rack.<eos> - Which intern?
- Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Two glazed and a maple bar.<eos> I'd get rid of one of those before that animal comes to.<eos> I would have gotten dressed.<eos> I would have...<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - Gotten dressed.<eos> You look great. Really.<eos> Healthy.
Thought you were supposed to be helping me.<eos> Sorry, Mrs McCarthy, I was just re-living my youth.<eos> Oh, I suppose you'll be climbing a tree next.<eos> ~ No, no. Not with your gout. ~ Hm.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> Mrs McCarthy won't let me play anyway.<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> I wonder if I might have a word?<eos> Something of a delicate matter.
Only Jacob's become convinced it was murder by one of his own family.<eos> Could he be right?<eos> Absolutely not!<eos> They're delightful.<eos> How long have you known them?<eos> I met Georgina at a charity function for the arts several years ago.<eos> She's an aspiring romantic novelist, like me, although, frankly, her work isn't a patch on mine.<eos> Her structure's a bit overwrought and her language is too flowery.<eos> Back to the murder.<eos> Er, suicide.
My brother's death was a tragedy.<eos> You're turning it into a farce!<eos> ~ You all right?<eos> ~ I'm fine.<eos> If you don't mind me asking, which of your family do you think...?<eos> My uncle.<eos> The barbarian.<eos> I heard him arguing with my father in his lab a few hours before the murder, my father telling him he was "going to put a stop to it".<eos> The house sale?<eos> What else?
If I follow Mr. Harrogate out, they may not notice you.<eos> You could hide.<eos> - I'm not scared of them.<eos> - Harrogate!<eos> You come out now or I'll start shooting people!<eos> Stay calm. It's only money they want.<eos> - I'll show them what for.<eos> - Please don't do any...<eos> - And what do you think you're playing at?<eos> - Over there with the others!
Someone who you cared for, once... however briefly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not the one you should be asking for forgiveness.<eos> Thank you for telling the truth.<eos> I hope in time that you can understand what I did.<eos> I admit I made some mistakes, but... ..the thing is... I loved my wife very much, and...<eos> I'm sorry, son.<eos> No water for two days.<eos> Well done, Sid.<eos> My pleasure.
Ten, maybe.<eos> It seems he had an altercation with Mr Redhill shortly before his death.<eos> Yes.<eos> Regular theatre-goer, was he?<eos> Davies?<eos> Never set foot in the theatre.<eos> Right.<eos> Inspector Sullivan...<eos> Forgive me, surely the shot was meant for me?<eos> You?
~ Ah-ha...<eos> Your embroideries are wonderful.<eos> It's just a hobby.<eos> You should never play down your passions.<eos> That was Albert's favourite.<eos> I made that for our silver wedding anniversary.<eos> ~ Have you ever considered selling any of these?<eos> ~ No!<eos> Who'd want any of those things?<eos> Plenty of people.
Connecting rooms, eh?<eos> I'll...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can I just say, I think you have a smashing set of clubs. LAUGHTER<eos> Thank you.<eos> Actually, my coach tells me I have a wonderful grip too.<eos> I'm sure your all-round stroke play is excellent.<eos> What's your handicap?<eos> I have a weakness for chocolate.<eos> And married men.
Harry!<eos> Go!<eos> ~ The cleaner must have locked it!<eos> ~ What? !<eos> Harry!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Madam, this is the hotel's rodent control squad.<eos> We've had reports of rats in the room.<eos> Please, bear with us.<eos> Madame...?
Well, that sounds like favoritism, but there is a kernel of truth in it, and I would like to take this opportunity...<eos> To invite all of you to our grand opening gala.<eos> There is a dress code.<eos> It's risqué red carpet. Have fun with it.<eos> But take it seriously, okay?<eos> You come looking like crap, you're gonna leave looking like crap, 'cause I'm not gonna let you in.<eos> Excuse me, everyone, I have an interruption.<eos> Morgan, Beverly, and I are doing a walk-a-thon to raise money for a problem that affects us all... nurse obesity. What?<eos> You're all skinny as hell!<eos> Yeah, due to poverty.
Jake!<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> I don't suppose you know where he is?<eos> Oh, that's better!<eos> I just... I thought I'd get back into my running.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, I was quite the distance specialist in my youth. Mm-hm.<eos> So, er, to what do I owe this pleasure, Camille?<eos> Murder.
You wouldn't be the first to call me that.<eos> Arlen Schrader.<eos> You have some questions for me?<eos> That comment is constantly taken out of context.<eos> We'd be eager to hear an example of the right context.<eos> I didn't invent tort law, okay?<eos> We base compensation, in part, on the lost future earnings of the decedent.<eos> Then this murder might be the right context.<eos> Our killer used your principles to determine Henry Wilseck's worth and then left that amount in exchange for his life.<eos> Fair swap, in your eyes?
What's all this?<eos> You never come down here.<eos> I was just... uh, ruminating on the case.<eos> The noise wake you?<eos> No, actually it was too quiet. I couldn't sleep. Is that why you're down here?<eos> You were worried about the noise?<eos> Well, it did not not cross my mind.<eos> Well, you know you don't have to tiptoe around for me, right?<eos> I mean, I knew what I was signing up for when I said I wanted to come back.<eos> At my request,
She thinks Kit came back different this time.<eos> Kind of felt like we were dealing with the same thing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kit's been going through some stuff for sure.<eos> Um, you know, it takes him a while to get back to normal, but he always does.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And what about you?<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I'm okay...<eos> For the most part.
He got something inside him, too, right?<eos> You think this is what he felt like when he turned?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, he was human before he was...a monster.<eos> I get it...<eos> Why you did it, Dean.<eos> My dad wasn't my dad anymore.<eos> If I go down that same road...<eos> I want you to do that to me, too.<eos> That road?
But I can tell you're the kind of guy that doesn't take "No" for an answer.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Where's the money?<eos> I spent it.<eos> All of it?<eos> Already?<eos> I paid some bills, balanced my checkbook, and what do you know?<eos> Turns out I owed some other guys some money.<eos> A lot of money.<eos> What other guys?
I'm John.<eos> Dude, I hope you're here to rescue me because these dudes are not messing around.<eos> Your friend Harper sent me.<eos> Huh...<eos> I knew she was into me.<eos> [police sirens]<eos> You set us up!<eos> Dude, what is this for?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - For what?
It did, didn't it?<eos> Pretty unexpected.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You like the unexpected?<eos> I do... like to think of myself as adventurous.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm really glad I met you.<eos> Glad I met you, too.<eos> Excuse me, I, uh, need to...<eos> Uh, down the hall.
You're real sweet.<eos> Where you from, TJ?<eos> Baltimore.<eos> Moved here a couple weeks ago.<eos> Why'd you move?<eos> Mom got locked up.<eos> For what?<eos> Drugs.<eos> Sent me on the bus to my Aunt Christy, gave her money to take care of me.<eos> Christy?
We were face to face!<eos> Why did they murder him?<eos> Alex decided to apply his concept to speech.<eos> A lie detector.<eos> He did it for me!<eos> He knew you'd find out that he had lied about much of his life.<eos> He must have worried that you'd end up hating him.<eos> He must have worried about that moment every day.<eos> I would like to finish this particular adventure with you, Daniel Edward Holt, if you'll have me?<eos> Scottie?
We were role playing.<eos> She knew I workedat a high school.<eos> She thought it would be sexy.<eos> You get her last name?<eos> No.<eos> What about an address, a phone number, something? No.<eos> I went to her motel room, ok?<eos> She-- she was from out of town.<eos> Said she was here on business.<eos> What kind of business?
How did people around here feel about Mickey's cross-dressing?<eos> Some guys called him queer or whatever.<eos> Me, I never had issues.<eos> Guy wants to dress up as a chick, makes him feel good about himself?<eos> - God bless.<eos> You know what I'm sayin'?<eos> - I do.<eos> Anything out of the ordinary happen the last time he came in here?<eos> Well, fortunately, I got a photogenic memory.<eos> - Very fortunate.
Yeah, like I told Agent Brody, we've been monitoring Dominick Cole since he left the coast guard.<eos> Now, here, his last known whereabouts are near the Industrial Canal east of the Lower Nine.<eos> Let's pay him a visit.<eos> I know you didn't fly all the way down here just to give us an address.<eos> No, I flew all the way back down here because we've been waiting for Dominick to screw up so we could get our hands on him.<eos> Our case, our hands.<eos> You just watch.<eos> I like to watch.<eos> Easy, everybody.<eos> On my lead.
For now.<eos> I've been thinking about your friend, the, uh, doctor.<eos> Really makes one wonder.<eos> About?<eos> Professional roads not taken.<eos> I love the United States Coast Guard, and I love being out on the high seas, but every now and again, I think... what if I did something different?<eos> Like what?<eos> I'm told that with eight weeks' training I could transfer from CGIS to NCIS.<eos> In Washington?<eos> With Gibbs?
Give me a hand with this.<eos> Got it.<eos> Looks like a whole other tunnel system down there.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Pete!<eos> Pete!<eos> Is it possible, Lieutenant, that I am fully assimilated in this era?<eos> A man entirely comfortable in this time, this place?<eos> And go.<eos> Instant Gram.
"...dark, damned souls will be used to protect the Fenestella."<eos> So basically Jefferson and your buddies conjured something nasty - to guard the chamber.<eos> - Does Miss Dixon's journal say anything else about these damned souls?<eos> It's pretty scarce on details.<eos> But we're gonna find out more.<eos> Agreed.<eos> A reconnaissance mission is required.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> I see it.<eos> C-Q.
Just stop!<eos> You two just crawled out of an underground trapdoor looking like you finished a cage match.<eos> - Meaning...?<eos> - That I heard animal noises down there.<eos> I think you guys know exactly what's going on and are hell-bent on hiding it.<eos> - Mr. Riggs...<eos> - Calvin.<eos> Calvin, I appreciate you trying to help, but you cannot be down here right now... what are you doing?<eos> Calling my editor in New York.<eos> Then my contacts in the military.
Don't expect me to go easy on you Because you're trying to break this stupid record.<eos> Hey, can we go back to spoleto's "camp"?<eos> He invited me to dinner next weekend.<eos> Y'all think I should go?<eos> [mouths word] 'cause I did buy a new shirt.<eos> ¶ ¶ [elevator bell dings] - Hey, man.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> Big day coming up.<eos> What'd you get rebecca?<eos> - For what?
Why is it such a big deal to you To be the youngest person to a thousand?<eos> Maybe I like the sound of it, okay?<eos> I'm 45 years old.<eos> I know, I don't look a day over 38.<eos> All right, but when's the next time I get to be youngest anything anymore?<eos> All right, I'm affected by that too.<eos> You know, my hair is naturally gray.<eos> - Really?<eos> - All of it.<eos> - Everywhere.
This kid Walter, in my class, said that cops shoot people for no reason.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> No.<eos> But that's what he says.<eos> Tell your friend Walter to think before he shoots his mouth off.<eos> Danny...<eos> Trust me, that was the kid-friendly version, Linda.<eos> No cop steps on the street looking to take a life, Sean.<eos> But mistakes do happen.<eos> Yeah, tragically.
- to stay on as a client.<eos> - No. In fact, I told you to drop it, that defamation was hard to win, but that if you wanted to pursue it, we would do our best, and we did.<eos> And we are.<eos> No, you said you would do your best.<eos> And you... are not. Hello. Hi.<eos> Marissa.<eos> I'm the body woman.<eos> Really?<eos> The whole body?<eos> Or just parts?
The only thing.<eos> Then this little nothing of a kid makes his life hell.<eos> Not a mule from Columbia, or a Guatemalan assassin.<eos> Just a little kid, with his day trader parents.<eos> What do I do with that?<eos> You did it.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hold it!<eos> One at a time.
I love she's just... She's just not all...<eos> She's come out of the wrong door.<eos> - Well... - That's my PA, Kelly.<eos> LAUGHTER "Hats off!"<eos> Yeah, the 1st Marine Division used Waltzing Matilda, because of their relationship with the Australian Army in World War II.<eos> But there's no Australian military force that uses it officially.<eos> - Of course, they can play what they like.<eos> - They were trying to have it as their national anthem.<eos> But it was out-voted, I think.<eos> - By?
Let's go, move, move. Move.<eos> Team three around back.<eos> Move, move, move.<eos> Hold back, hold back.<eos> You can stay here and try to explain your way out of this.<eos> May be a little tricky considering your current state.<eos> Or you could stop fighting it and fighting me.<eos> Last chance, Vincent.<eos> You're either with me or against me.<eos> On my signal.
What, what are you making?<eos> Cat, this has gone...<eos> Do you want him to keep killing?<eos> Slaughtering innocent people for the next hundred years-- do you want that, too?<eos> We've got to put an end to this.<eos> Okay, I-I got to put an end to this.<eos> My life is over.<eos> And all I have to show for it are the people that I hurt.<eos> Catherine and Vanessa.<eos> Vincent.
And whatever my father's formula did to him made Liam think that we're them.<eos> Come on, it wasn't your father's fault, okay?<eos> He wanted more time.<eos> Time.<eos> That subject has been coming up quite a bit lately.<eos> How long you are going to live and how long I am not.<eos> Come on.<eos> I was letting it get to me.<eos> But to be honest, seeing how angry and bitter Liam is without love, I don't know who's worse off, me or you.<eos> Definitely me.
On the air in three, two... One!<eos> Good morning, friends and enemies.<eos> Welcome to The Oscar Madison Show.<eos> The Knicks won last night and the Celtics lost, so all is right in the world.<eos> Although I'm guessing Paulie from Boston will disagree.<eos> Morning, Paulie.<eos> You suck, Madison.<eos> And your Knicks got lucky last night.<eos> Well, you know who else got lucky last night?<eos> Me.
Oscar's not gonna be able to do his job if he loses his confidence.<eos> Well, I say we give him a chance.<eos> Because I for one have faith in him!<eos> So, last week, when you said you loved my risotto?<eos> I never lie about food.<eos> Please, don't talk to me about Carmelo taking too many steps to the basket.<eos> Does anybody remember a guy named Michael Jordan?<eos> He traveled so much he got bumped up to first class.<eos> For all his frequent... traveling.<eos> On a court.
Looks like.<eos> I think I'm gonna follow his lead, too.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My peace is helping people.<eos> Working cases.<eos> That's all I want to do.<eos> Is this about the mark?<eos> I'm done trying to find a cure, Sammy.<eos> Dean, Cass is so close.<eos> To what?
Move!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> What do we do?<eos> We should be halfway to Chartres by now.<eos> We can't miss this window.<eos> We've got to get 'em out.<eos> Let's get a closer look.<eos> Get in!<eos> Over there!<eos> Against the wall!
Now... just one sip.<eos> I told you I don't drink!<eos> (Aurora moaning) It's enough talking!<eos> Felix... is there something wrong?<eos> It's ok, it's ok.<eos> There's nothing wrong, do you understand?<eos> - But when he asks you... you can't tell him.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Tell... tell who?<eos> Drescher.
Actually, I might have something, evidence that a computer was in use.<eos> But there was no computer in the evidence log.<eos> But there was an open Ethernet line with an unusually high data transfer rate.<eos> Someone in that house was spending a lot of time online.<eos> Missing computer.<eos> This is good.<eos> So how... how do we find it?<eos> We have to isolate its BIA, its burned-in address.<eos> Once we have that, it'll get us to an IP.<eos> And to Mark.
Any other option, seriously. I mean, if she would have just chosen any other option...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> (scoffs) Are you actually blaming the banker<eos> For your behavior at the meeting?<eos> So can we get you something to drink?<eos> Just a juice.<eos> Juice.<eos> Juicy. I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with my girlfriend.<eos> Okay, we're done here.<eos> Now,onto importantstuff.
And I love you for it, but taking on Ryan Hardy and the FBI is crazy.<eos> I will make him suffer for what he's done.<eos> I think Joe Carroll might be taking care of that.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're awake.<eos> What am I doing here, Joe?<eos> Up.<eos> Up, up, up, up, up.<eos> What does it always come down to with us, huh?<eos> The truth.
Er, look, Camille...<eos> Erm, er, er, I know this is going to sound a little out of the blue.<eos> But I have been thinking long and hard about this.<eos> I-I go to sleep thinking about it, I-I wake up thinking about it, about you.<eos> Can't stop thinking about you...<eos> Do you have to do that?<eos> CRUNCHING Hey!<eos> Just rehearsing my speech.<eos> You're giving a speech, for who?<eos> Oh, er, no-one.
It's freaking me out.<eos> The last 72 hours have been pretty weird.<eos> I guess I'm a little off-kilter.<eos> Weird is kind of an understatement.<eos> I think it'd be great if we all just got back to normal, you know, stay on track.<eos> Great policy.<eos> Hey.<eos> You sleep okay?<eos> Yeah, you?<eos> So-so.
_<eos> Just let me be your DP.<eos> What's all this?<eos> A new shipment of gloves came in.<eos> I'm breaking in the leather.<eos> Got an extra rag?<eos> Uh, so, how did it go with the athletic director?<eos> The search is still on.<eos> Guess I'm not getting that job.<eos> At least not yet.
Nadav!<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> My daughter.<eos> Why?<eos> I was like, "Who is this dude walking in here with Emma's journal?"<eos> - Peter.<eos> - Rami.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Our loss.
I wake you?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I'm... great.<eos> You pissed off?<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> It's late.<eos> What do you need?<eos> I, uh...
No.<eos> We'll be ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> Take care of this.<eos> You might want to change into something more appropriate.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I wouldn't want to meet Prince Kenneth in a robe.<eos> Prince Kenneth?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> By reputation.
You first... in case they slipped something in it.<eos> That was, uh... nice, Reagan.<eos> Thanks, Chief.<eos> More.<eos> Come on.<eos> Erin, listen, I got RMP on the way to pick you up.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just get in the car.<eos> I'll explain on the way.<eos> On my way where?
That's enough of that.<eos> We've been seen.<eos> Who was that woman?<eos> She saw us together.<eos> She could tell anyone...<eos> it would mean our heads.<eos> She won't.<eos> Go back to the castle.<eos> Wait for me there.<eos> Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
We've been seen.<eos> Who was that woman?<eos> She saw us together.<eos> She could tell anyone...<eos> it would mean our heads.<eos> She won't.<eos> Go back to the castle.<eos> Wait for me there.<eos> Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!<eos> Hyah!
I'm married.<eos> Now and forever.<eos> It's wrong and scandalous.<eos> And you would be ruined.<eos> Aren't you already?<eos> It's not the worst thing in the world, is it?<eos> Is that your man now?<eos> Yes, but he's not my man.<eos> You judge apples by color.<eos> Also firmness.
I believe it's more like 4:20.<eos> Oh, Caroline, I love your new place.<eos> It's so fresh and pretty.<eos> It kind of looks like a douche commercial.<eos> You're right, baby.<eos> It looks exactly like a douche commercial.<eos> Okay. Can we stop saying "douche"<eos> in the fancy pastry shop?<eos> I agree.<eos> Not appropriate.
I was there.<eos> We were at the Wonder Vista Motel.<eos> Some guy burst in on us in bed.<eos> He grabbed Troy and he dragged him outside.<eos> Did you see the guy that did it?<eos> The room was so dark and it all happened so fast, but I ran to the window and I saw this big guy stuffing Troy into his truck.<eos> It wasn't Daddy.<eos> Well, why didn't you tell anyone about it?<eos> Who was I gonna tell?<eos> My father?
Like a woman who'd marry a junkie?<eos> Agreed.<eos> In college, Roger was charismatic, he was the life of the party, he just never grew up.<eos> Before the divorce, I would never have even considered him capable of murder, but... He hates me so much.<eos> Tucker's autistic.<eos> He's utterly vulnerable, you have got to find him.<eos> We checked the address that you had for Roger, he hasn't been there in weeks.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Is there somewhere else he'd go?<eos> A friend, a co-worker?
I'd like that.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Oh, we've got Charlotte.<eos> See you later, girlfriend.<eos> She's heading to Billy.<eos> You're a new face.<eos> I am Charlotte, your host.<eos> Are we having fun?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> I, uh...
Till the next time nothing happens.<eos> There will be no next time nothing happens.<eos> Understood?<eos> Understood, detective?<eos> - Oh! - Sorry.<eos> You think there's any chance she wizzled her way in here so she can keep an eye on us?<eos> Nah.<eos> Kinda like her.<eos> And I have nothing to hide.<eos> Me neither.
So the end result is like yoga.<eos> Sort of.<eos> Has anyone come in wanting to discuss breath play? No.<eos> That topic's forbidden, and any attempt gets a lifetime ban.<eos> Well, if you hear something, please let us know.<eos> I will.<eos> What?<eos> I dabbled my senior year.<eos> Ah, college.<eos> Ah, high school.
But we found the guy.<eos> The storage unit dude identified him, and he all but admitted it.<eos> All it does is tie Gish to the storage unit.<eos> We can't prove it was his or he was there.<eos> It was full of accelerants and stuff about Shay.<eos> Believe me, I wish I could give you a different answer, but I can't.<eos> My boss has been doing this for a long time.<eos> He knows what cases will stick.<eos> This one won't.<eos> At least not yet.
Because you're stronger together than you are apart.<eos> Is that how you felt with Rebecca?<eos> - That you were stronger together?<eos> - It doesn't matter. I crossed the primal line a long time ago.<eos> Who says you can't cross back?<eos> It's a one-way door.<eos> - You know that. - Maybe it isn't.<eos> For all I know, Vincent crossed the line and came back several times.<eos> Again,'cause of you.<eos> No. Because of Vincent.
Flash drive?<eos> We'll take it to DHS, see if they can I.D. any of the suspects.<eos> Maybe we ought to take a look at it first.<eos> Just so it's away from anyone who may be looking for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let us know what you find.<eos> Maybe then you'll finally tell us what you really know about this case.<eos> I like them.<eos> Wish we could tell them.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
So, you're saying they're the shooters?<eos> But they gave you Espinosa;<eos> why would they do that?<eos> We were already onto Espinosa's penthouse.<eos> If they hadn't teamed up with us, we would have had access to the flash drive anyway.<eos> So, they probably just wanted to have control over what we found.<eos> And since they're coming here right now, the question is-- what do they want?<eos> It's too bad.<eos> I actually like them.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
I didn't.<eos> I just noticed it was missing this morning.<eos> I thought it was stolen.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> He took Chloe.<eos> I had nothing to do with this, Tommy.<eos> You know me.<eos> Do I?<eos> You've been protecting Simon since he showed up.<eos> And not just him.
Help yourself.<eos> The candles are right there.<eos> Please.<eos> Kris, Matt.<eos> - (woman) Hello, Peter.<eos> - (Peter) Hello.<eos> I... Here you go, miss.<eos> - (woman) Thank you.<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> Ready for this?
Methamphetamines and an Asian roommate.<eos> Work late a lot?<eos> Uh, that and I kind of live here.<eos> So, anyway, if you could put all this... away... so that I could find it again, that would be awesome.<eos> You got it.<eos> (stutters) Hang on a sec.<eos> Just got to... clear out these dead soldiers.<eos> Thank you for your service, fellas.<eos> Do you want me to file these alphabetically?<eos> By date?
But no horrid dead mice.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> I figure you owe me one.<eos> I do?<eos> I'm always happy to help you, Jim, but I-I, I don't recall... The hospital.<eos> I saved you from Maroni's men.<eos> But I was only there because you arrested me.<eos> For attempted murder.<eos> Remind me again why I let you go.<eos> Enlightened friendship.
You had me worried there for a minute.<eos> I know you.<eos> You're Jim Gordon. Cop.<eos> Supposed to be a cold stone hard-ass.<eos> But you're Penguin's bitch, huh?<eos> Who the dickens can you trust anymore?<eos> He wants his money.<eos> How many times I got to tell you people?<eos> No. To Don Falcone, I'll pay.<eos> To that fruitcake leprechaun?
Ems called...<eos> Turns out she and Ben have managed to thwart Lady LeMarchal's attempts to rattle our collective cages.<eos> Yes, punches were thrown.<eos> She took Ben with her?<eos> Aw, Jack, don't worry about it.<eos> I mean, their little road trip was more... Revenge than romance.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who got punched?<eos> Kidding.<eos> Mostly.
Is "slop shop" one word or two?<eos> You know what you should write about?<eos> A very violent event involving your computer and a simple lady who snapped!<eos> Kids, get a mop!<eos> You're about to clean Cynthia's laptop off the floor!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Hands, time to get slappy.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Hi everyone.
Four lunatics and Barbara?<eos> Brother, you got no luck.<eos> I told you civilian life was better, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Actually, that's kind of why I'm here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Jim, you remember Scotty, my girlfriend.<eos> Fiancée.
What is it, Alfred?<eos> How you doing, Mr. Nygma?<eos> I got you an aspirin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Detective Gordon!<eos> Bruce.<eos> I heard the news. I...<eos> I was worried something happened to you.<eos> I'm very relieved.<eos> Me, too.
Crazy old blind man that lived alone.<eos> The clever crazy old blind man.<eos> If his father broke him out, why'd Jerome kill him, huh?<eos> He was probably playing this maniac shtick since you sent him away.<eos> He was just a kid.<eos> Every evil bastard in the world was just a kid once.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I don't think it was his father that broke him out.<eos> Well, cool.<eos> Back to square one.
I'm glad he's dead.<eos> Well, he's... he just left town.<eos> - He's not... dead.<eos> - Right, yeah, I know.<eos> Figure of speech.<eos> He's dead to you.<eos> Out of your life. Not dead, dead.<eos> I'm gonna use the restroom.<eos> You blew it, dummy.<eos> Nice work.
There is a cop killer on the loose.<eos> I cannot abide that.<eos> We will find the person who killed our brother, and we will put a stop to them using every legal method at our disposal.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Your fellow officer is dead, I can see it in your face.<eos> He is.<eos> I'm sorry to hear it.<eos> The bad guys in this town are changing.<eos> They're not playing by the old rules.<eos> Or any rules.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> How I ever let him lay a hand on me...<eos> I'm glad he's out of your life.<eos> Keep that guard up... jab, jab. Lead... jab, jab, right.<eos> - What you doing?<eos> - Alfred's teaching me to fight.<eos> I need you to take me to the Pike brothers.<eos> The firebugs from the Narrows?
- Ed.<eos> Whatever.<eos> My empire is in ruins.<eos> I'm a wanted man with no friends.<eos> And my mother... the one person I swore to protect is dead because of my weakness.<eos> Believe me when I tell you that this path you're on leads to nothing but destruction and pain.<eos> So... wanted or not... I'm leaving.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Rise and shine.<eos> Hell with this.
That symbol is from something called the Order of St. Dumas.<eos> They used to have an abbey downtown.<eos> Barnes just told me to lay off of Galavan.<eos> Well, then you probably don't care that the mayor's office tried to buy the abbey last week.<eos> - Galavan tried to buy it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Some urban development nonsense.<eos> New owners said no.<eos> It's a Chinese slap-slap joint now.<eos> Hell with it.
What?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> It sounded like you were talking to somebody in your apartment, and who besides...<eos> I was talking to my plumber.<eos> Well, have you heard from Kristen?<eos> I know she said she was sick.<eos> I was thinking of stopping by...<eos> As it happens, she's not sick.<eos> She lied.<eos> To all of us.
_<eos> Oh, can I help?<eos> I could test you or something.<eos> _<eos> Well, I could be your assistant.<eos> Can I get you anything else, Mr. Director?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Not for me.
Critical damage.<eos> There's a rumor the new captain'll be here today.<eos> Now, I don't know who Wuntch is sending us, but it doesn't matter, because we're a family, we're strong, and together, we can do anything.<eos> Nine-Nine!<eos> Nine-Nine!<eos> What's up, ding-dongs?<eos> I'm your new captain.<eos> - The Vulture.<eos> - No.<eos> Still hot.
- Oh, Yennifer...<eos> - Now, I see that as a positive story.<eos> Out of all the identities he could have stolen, he chose yours, and you want to know why?<eos> - Because I posted my annual income?<eos> - Because you posted your annual income, you moron.<eos> - Excuse me, is that takoyaki?<eos> - Yeah, from Senka, right down the street.<eos> - Oh, I love that place.<eos> The chef lets me take octopus hearts home for my dogs.<eos> - Oh, lucky!
Excuse me for believing in us.<eos> It'll be okay, guys.<eos> No need to worry.<eos> I just took a foraging class, and not to brag, I was voted Mr. Fungus.<eos> Aha, Mr. Fungus to the rescue.<eos> See, Sarge, everything's going to work out, and you don't have to stress all the time.<eos> Boyle, you really think you can find us dinner?<eos> Um, let's just say it's gonna be a "spore-gasbord."<eos> Something bad happened to Charles, didn't it?<eos> Big time.
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.<eos> Actually, it took me hours.<eos> I tied all my clothes together, tethered them to a log, and used it as a grappling hook.<eos> Managed to snag it in a root.<eos> Aren't you freezing?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Mainly because my skin is on fire from all the poison ivy in this tree.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> Dumb mistake.
Hello, Brian.<eos> Coming on a little strong there, buddy... and I'm digging it.<eos> How much to take this bad boy home?<eos> Actually, that's one of our more reasonable models.<eos> Oh. Holy Moses!<eos> That is much too much money.<eos> Well, you spent twice that for Mr. Met to come to your birthday party.<eos> Yeah, and it was worth it.<eos> Mr. Met used my bathroom.<eos> Number two.
- This is our case.<eos> You can't work it without us.<eos> Get your weird, hairless fingers off of it.<eos> Soren shaves his fingers for cycling.<eos> It cuts down on drag.<eos> Agneta is my biggest fanatic.<eos> Just as I am a fanatic of her slam poetry.<eos> - Would you like to hear some? - Would I like to?<eos> - I would hate to!<eos> - Your loss.
And that's how you calculate parallax distance.<eos> So you ready for the test?<eos> Oh, I took it this morning.<eos> I passed.<eos> What?<eos> It was nice how much you guys cared, so I actually opened up my textbook for the first time.<eos> Ya'll, astronomy is kind of interesting.<eos> And I am hella smart.<eos> Then why'd you make us do that whole dance?<eos> Two reasons:
I guess we are the better team.<eos> Why do people like these things?<eos> They're just shiny rocks.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> You should be happier.<eos> We found the jewels, we won.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> Why don't we go to a bar and drink in silence?<eos> Cool.
Please don't slam the door again.<eos> We have a bit of a medical situation.<eos> Well, I wish I could help, but unfortunately, I have a bit of a wooden duck situation.<eos> Excuse me, what now?<eos> Still on about the duck, Frederick?<eos> Years ago, when we moved in together, an antique duck decoy of his was misplaced.<eos> It wasn't misplaced.<eos> You threw it in the trash.<eos> And with it, our relationship.<eos> Oh, please.
Is she okay?<eos> Yeah, I was just telling her the entire duck story, now that it finally has a satisfying ending.<eos> No, everything's fine, but I am a little concerned about Sharon's blood pressure.<eos> And this is a terrible environment.<eos> I wouldn't call it terrible.<eos> We're surrounded by criminals, there's no bed, and you can hear the faint sound of someone screaming through all the vents.<eos> That's Hitchcock.<eos> His arm's stuck in a pneumatic tube.<eos> It's hilarious.<eos> In my professional opinion,
Are you a journalist?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What did your mother say when you told her you wanted to study?<eos> That I had lost my mind.<eos> And your friends?<eos> More or less the same.<eos> With them you can only talk about husbands, children or Paris fashion.<eos> It's hard to find a woman to talk about art, politics or important things.<eos> What a bore, right?
Exactly. Can you imagine what would happen if they succeed?<eos> Your graces excuse me, but... - what independence?<eos> - Ours.<eos> A empire like the Spanish fighting for its independence?<eos> Well, empire, empire...<eos> Two centuries after you France invaded us.<eos> No, that can't be.<eos> The world was ours.<eos> Are we sovereign now, or do we bow down to someone?<eos> Yeah, to the European Central Bank.
Two French guys aren't enough for one Spaniard.<eos> We die here.<eos> Two for two seems more fair.<eos> If you're alright with it, of course.<eos> It will be my honor.<eos> This man has hit a woman and is going to pay for it.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Alonso de Entrerríos.<eos> At your service.
I'm a complete failure.<eos> They put all of their ostrich eggs in the wrong basket.<eos> No.<eos> Now-now, you know...<eos> Well.<eos> My family can't afford to support me anymore, and I can't afford to live here.<eos> They're telling me I should come back home.<eos> Sorry, pal.<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> Oh. Okay.
We stayed up for a few drinks.<eos> 'She opened the door to her killer...'<eos> It was Halloween.<eos> She was killed in a road-traffic accident.<eos> So, what does that mean?<eos> The game they played, the, er...<eos> the questions and answers.<eos> Yes.<eos> The other statements?<eos> ~ And the sister thing.
There was no outdoor track on base.<eos> Now I can take you through primary school and get you a copy of my mother's last angiogram, or we can just get to it, and tell me your price.<eos> Have you tried the saltimbocca?<eos> Meat so tender, you'll swear it's alive.<eos> Be sure to try it.<eos> You didn't miss a background cue?<eos> If I had, local PD would be pulling a very handsome Asian floater out of the Tiber River.<eos> You said he was drinking tea.<eos> Do you remember if it was loose leafed or bagged?<eos> Loose.
If we have to leave suddenly, this is the meeting spot.<eos> [imitates Chinese accent] You ever think of putting in some carpet?<eos> It will open the place up.<eos> The price is 15 million euros.<eos> You've got to be kidding.<eos> That's three times its worth.<eos> I agree.<eos> But you will pay it, if you want it.<eos> I have other interested parties.<eos> Not for that rate.
Yeah, okay. Uh...<eos> Look, why don't you just go back to the hotel room?<eos> We'll field the call.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Langley knows it's your baby.<eos> Work's done here.<eos> So just, really, don't throw up in front of people.<eos> Are you sure you're okay?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I...
Well, at least we know the killers must be someone with privileged status on this cell block, right?<eos> Yeah, that's over 100 guys, and this shot could have been called from anywhere.<eos> Is there surveillance in this area?<eos> Not inside the bathroom itself but the hallway outside.<eos> All right, we'll need to review the footage immediately.<eos> You got it.<eos> Doing this over here is incredibly bold.<eos> It's practically a taunt.<eos> Or a message.<eos> To who?

And anyway there's lots she can do in the meantime.<eos> Just turn her on.<eos> I mean, activate her.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Wendy.<eos> Would you like to run a full demonstration of my capabilities?<eos> Uh no, that's alright, we umm, we read the manual, Wendy.<eos> Why does she talk like that?<eos> Umm, the factory default is set to something called "Aussie."<eos> Cool.
Without going into detail. The research equipment on this station is highly sensitive.<eos> You accidentally destroy the wrong control panel and the whole place could blow.<eos> So if we can't use force, then what?<eos> That's where I come in.<eos> There's not a safe or vault in this galaxy I cannot crack.<eos> Basically, I can get into anything.<eos> The next shuttle leaves Calliden Prime in twelve hours.<eos> It'll take you ten to get there. Good luck.<eos> I still don't like it.<eos> Me neither.
They've got Five.<eos> She's out there all by herself, helpless.<eos> It's up to us.<eos> Nobody's gonna do this for us.<eos> We have to do it ourselves.<eos> When they come through that door I say we take 'em down and we take 'em down hard.<eos> And we show them what the men of the Raza are made of.<eos> We may not have been able to help Two.<eos> But we can make the bastards pay.<eos> Damn straight!
They hired us to steal it.<eos> We do, deliver it, and once it's safely into their hands, Traugott triggers the device and Mikkei gets to take the fall.<eos> Does that sound about right?<eos> Huh, sounds about exactly right.<eos> Of course there's the question of whether you were playing both sides.<eos> Come on.<eos> Everyone knows we've been untouchable since our fallout with Ferrous.<eos> Well, things change.<eos> See, Ferrous Corp reached out to me to reach out to you about a job.<eos> Why us?
No, but many of my former colleagues were.<eos> I was to be involved in Phase Three but we never got there.<eos> You saw to that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you?<eos> Do you feel remorse?<eos> According to your scan, it's physiologically possible, but I can't help but have my doubts given the digital evidence recorded at the scene.<eos> Your actions were quite calculated and devoid of emotion.<eos> I, I can't remember.<eos> How fortunate for you.
So walk me through this, honey.<eos> Well, as you can see, every pumpkin in the patch is artisanal.<eos> Ooh, good.<eos> Love the warty white ones.<eos> They look like Number Five when she runs out of concealer.<eos> Then we move past the ice sculptures of demonic peeing cherubs and yes, they will all be peeing vodka and Red Bull.<eos> Love!<eos> And that brings us right over here to the corn maze.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Corn maz?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Where's your Mary Todd Lincoln outfit, Number Five?<eos> There can't be two Jackie Kennedys.<eos> You sold me down the river, bitch.<eos> You lied and told Munsch that I killed Ms. Bean.<eos> Well, you did kill Ms. Bean, but I wouldn't rat you out to anyone!<eos> Liar!<eos> Hester told me everything.<eos> And then Number Five said she was gonna turn you in, she just didn't know who to tell first,<eos> Dean Munsch or the cops.
Pick a side of the Eiffel Tower.<eos> Fine, Roger! You.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> So be it.<eos> Our footprints.<eos> In the snow!<eos> We're leaving footprints in the snow.<eos> The Red Devil's just going to follow the trail.<eos> Just walk backwards in our footsteps and we'll throw him off. Okay.<eos> In your own footsteps.
Is that how little you trust me?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> That's how little I trust you.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> Are you wearing a wire to try to get me to admit I'm the killer?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Actually, Daughter of Sam...<eos> I came here to apologize.<eos> Ambushing you with that stuff about your mom was mean.<eos> Even by my standards.
But why here?<eos> Ah. Well, I was disinvited to Thanksgiving at my in-laws' because they still think that I killed their son, my jerk-off ex-husband, so I'm kind of on my own.<eos> Plus, you girls have the best cooking facilities on campus, although it doesn't look like you ever use them.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> My family Thanksgiving sucked, so I came here.<eos> Mmm. Hey... since you already have a turkey, why don't we just cook here?<eos> I've never cooked before, but that should be fine, since I usually just pretend to eat.<eos> Well, I can cook and eat for the both of us.<eos> - But I demand that after we eat, we play charades.<eos> - Deal.
Uh... wh... why did you bring me here?<eos> Well, Pete, as you may or may not know, my best friend Boone was murdered.<eos> So we're here, reading his will.<eos> Okay, but what does that have to do with me?<eos> "I, Boone Clemens, in the event of my untimely passing,<eos> "do solemnly bequeath the following:<eos> "My awesome Johnny Cash poster,<eos> "where he's biting his lip and giving everyone the finger<eos> "because you know he just don't care about nothin'...<eos> "to Pete Martinez.
! "My awesome Xbox,<eos> "with the Kinect thing that I haven't figured out<eos> "how to hook it up but I hear is so friggin' awesome when you do to Pete Martinez."<eos> - Doesn't make any sense.<eos> - I...<eos> Please!<eos> Stop interrupting my dead gay friend Boone!<eos> "My HBO Go password to Pete Martinez.<eos> "The shoebox under my bed that's filled with bottles of lube<eos> "to Pete Martinez.

So,<eos> Chad Radwell invited me to join the Dickie Dollar Scholars.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't play golf.<eos> I don't do anything they do there.<eos> I don't "rage" on Tuesday nights or have competitions - about how many girls I can have sex with in one day. - Ugh.<eos> Sometimes I kind of side with the Red Devil.<eos> I mean, he's cleaning all the mess and filth of this place in a way no dean or exposé ever could.<eos> I, I...<eos> I-I'm sorry.
This is your fate, Johnny.<eos> It's time to own it.<eos> (Charlie) Honestly, any information you have is welcome.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where you been?<eos> México.<eos> Can you fax it over?<eos> Great.<eos> [whispering] I got a lead.<eos> - On Sid?
It's time to own it.<eos> (Charlie) Honestly, any information you have is welcome.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where you been?<eos> México.<eos> Can you fax it over?<eos> Great.<eos> [whispering] I got a lead.<eos> - On Sid?<eos> - Germaine.
For those of you who've just joined us.<eos> A government spokesman has confirmed reports that Britain is under attack.<eos> In 20 minutes, bombs will hit London,<eos> Washington, Tehran, Beijing and Berlin.
Evil robots.<eos> Mutant mice on motorbikes.<eos> This?<eos> This is just...<eos> I mean, I'd take your dad's balls over this.<eos> Oh, it's not that bad.<eos> This tuna's older than me.<eos> I miss sweets.<eos> I miss...fish fingers, nuggets.<eos> Like, super greasy pizzas.
A violin.<eos> That's so beautiful.<eos> Why is she learning the violin?<eos> It's a life skill.<eos> Yeah, but, firstly, it's not.<eos> Secondly, neither of us can play it so how we gonna teach her?<eos> She might pick it up.<eos> From where?<eos> We need to teach her something.<eos> Yeah, useful things.
But it ain't fair on Zulu.<eos> Zulu.<eos> A black dog.<eos> - Represent.<eos> - Nice.<eos> No hard feelings?<eos> Yeah, I'm not shaking your hand, man.<eos> - Is that cos it's been on Suzie's?<eos> - Stop now. That's an order.<eos> Cooch.
I was in California and I had, like, a blowjob scene and I was like, "For sure."<eos> $300 for a blowjob scene.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> You go there, you don't even have sex, cool.<eos> I go there and he's like, "Oh, yeah, it's a forced blowjob."<eos> And I'm like, "What?"<eos> Just one guy.<eos> One little camera on a tripod.<eos> I don't...<eos> Fuck!
I made a promise to the kid, if he could get me the recording...<eos> I could finally put that son of a bitch in jail.<eos> You were the only positive male role model he ever had.<eos> Someone had to be.<eos> [Indistinct chatter]<eos> I think Peter changed his last name to Folkmore.<eos> The officer's last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whenever Peter and his mother were in trouble, who did they call?<eos> Folkmore.
But I don't intend to stretch on my words, because in fact...<eos> Where the hell is the Queen's emissary?<eos> He'll come.<eos> Isabella was always a woman of her word.<eos> But if anyone else in this courtroom has something to say, he can speak.<eos> Who dares interrupt this service?<eos> An emissary from the Queen.<eos> She wrote this letter to Your Eminence.<eos> And she ordered me to show you this papal bull.<eos> A bull?
But art is not only technique.<eos> It's passion, It's... it's... having something to say.<eos> It's soul.<eos> And Dalí didn't have much of that.<eos> Although it has to be noted that he had one great virtue.<eos> What?<eos> He admired me.<eos> In fact, he copied my moustache.<eos> Safe travels, friends.<eos> You too.
Here's a map.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> Very good.<eos> A Ministry agent will be waiting for you there, Ortigosa.<eos> He will give you the necessary documentation about the period and more importantly, your student id cards.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You don't like "El tenorio"?<eos> The first time I saw it, I liked it but I got sick of it.<eos> They play it every year on the tv on All Saint's Day.<eos> For what reason?
How did you know I'd received a photo?<eos> I never said it here.<eos> That's true.<eos> And where did Alonso and I find the photos?<eos> In the theater.<eos> Exactly.<eos> An the last photo was given to me by Rosita, who plays doña Inés.<eos> She found it in her notebook.<eos> And the one who's had most contact with her has been you.<eos> Irene.
Be very careful, please.<eos> The Ministry treats its agents like Kleenex.<eos> It uses them and then throws them away.<eos> Please.<eos> It's never hurt me so much to tell someone that they've done a good job.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now leave me, please<eos> I need to be alone.<eos> Now who can we trust?<eos> No one.
It was good of you to ask Chris for the recipe for that tagine.<eos> I thought about asking them to wake their kid up so I could get his autograph.<eos> You should have!<eos> She'd have loved that.<eos> I'm really sorry about tonight.<eos> Don't be. They're awful.<eos> And actually I was really touched to see you go apeshit at someone for me.<eos> Well, I'm scared.<eos> ~ Of the not-cancer cancer?<eos> ~ Of everything.
Which will be wired up to my tablet.<eos> The tablet's camera will simultaneously send the data to Sylvester's laptop in the car.<eos> I have to stay in the car, alone?<eos> Would you rather be in the building with the gun-toting drug dealers?<eos> Enough.<eos> Go on, Walter.<eos> The laptop will then read the configuration of the photon bounceback and give us a rough image of what's around the corner.<eos> It's easy, so long as this diode works.<eos> So whether we walk into an ambush depends on the craftsmanship of a knock-off motel cuckoo clock.<eos> Effectively, yeah.
A play based on Angélica, a character from "Orlando furioso".<eos> "Why does it please thee so, perfidious lord, two hearts should with a different measure beat?<eos> Thou wilt not let me take the certain ford, Dragging me where the stream is deep and fleet."<eos> "Her I abandon who my love desires, While she who hates, respect and love inspires."<eos> Look, Lope, just a thing.<eos> Are you trying to steal my wife away while I'm standing right here?<eos> Julián, please.<eos> Far from it, my friend.<eos> We're just sharing our love.<eos> For literature.
But that's Irene.<eos> (SALVADOR) Yes.<eos> It's Irene.<eos> The happy wife of Doctor Nuria Celaya.<eos> Nuria?<eos> Surely that's not his name.<eos> In Spain, two women or two men can marry each other.<eos> Times change, you'll get used to it.<eos> Why are you showing us this?<eos> For two reasons,
- Thank God.<eos> - I haven't given you permission to talk.<eos> Who invited you to this party?<eos> Party? No. But perhaps your funeral.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I can take care of these louts by myself.<eos> He scares me when he smiles like that.<eos> For Santiago and for Spain!<eos> "Nah", just a bump, nothing serious.<eos> Good thing.
At first I counted the days, but there stopped being any sense to it.<eos> For what, if they're never going to release me?<eos> Do you want me to call a doctor?<eos> An 11th century doctor?<eos> No, thank you. (Coughs)<eos> What did they tell my wife?<eos> That you died on a mission.<eos> Did she believe it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.
He's the king's representative and his confidence man.<eos> He collects taxes, imparts justice and maintains order among the public.<eos> Now I understand his popularity.<eos> It's surprising that Díaz Bueno rose so high in such a short time.<eos> He doesn't lack gall.<eos> Look, Lázaro's about to start.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the Lázaro show.<eos> If my clever prose makes you laugh, it speaks well to your intelligence.<eos> If you do not laugh, remember: "Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat".<eos> (Laughter)
No, I do not.<eos> You could tell your life to someone who knows.<eos> It would surely be an exciting novel.<eos> Who would be interested in my adventures?<eos> Me, without a doubt.<eos> Where will you go now?<eos> To Toledo, with Friar Juan.<eos> We will both be safer there.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You too.
When you ordered me to interrogate the American. you wanted to know if I was capable of not seeing Leiva.<eos> You can leave.<eos> What are you doing, Julián?<eos> Do you know what is my favorite thing to do with you?<eos> Apart from what we just did?<eos> Apart from that, of course.<eos> Uh... Give me a massage?<eos> Take a nap with you.<eos> At any time.<eos> Me too.
Then we should go at once.<eos> Alonso, accompany Ernesto.<eos> Recruit a couple of armed men.<eos> Ah, and dress like soldiers of that time.<eos> I want to go with them.<eos> It might cost you your life.<eos> They are my team mates.<eos> I won't let them go alone.<eos> If Julián were here he would feel the same way.<eos> And Irene?
It's Salvador Martí.<eos> Send in the troops.<eos> Should we make some food and watch a movie... or do you want to go out to eat?<eos> Ramón left me a message.<eos> A problem's come up.<eos> Ah. I hope its not serious.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But since I left early, I don't want my boss to catch me.<eos> Damn, I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
He may bow and scrape to save his neck, but they won't, not unless we buy them off.<eos> Of course.<eos> But there still is a great deal of land to give away.<eos> I want to start by restoring some lands to the Protestants that Narcisse stole them from.<eos> As long as you take care to send the right message so soon after the castle attack.<eos> That's why I plan to only give lands to lords who have proven their loyalty.<eos> Like Lord Condé, you mean?<eos> Few Protestants have been as loyal as he.<eos> Especially after the attack.<eos> Condé.
He has feelings for you, and now everyone knows it.<eos> And you think that I encouraged him?<eos> Francis, have you not been hearing a word I've said?<eos> I can barely stand to touch my own husband.<eos> Why would I... ever encourage another?<eos> I know you don't think you will heal, but I know that you will.<eos> You are a survivor and the strongest person I've ever known.<eos> It may be too soon to talk about this, and it is excruciating to have to say this to you, given what you've been through, but, Mary, this notion of "separate lives... "<eos> Living separate lives is not a solution; it is a threat.<eos> And not just to our marriage, but to our rule.
Today, we are going to work on our history packets so, please get them out and work quietly at your desks.<eos> Has anyone seen Luke?<eos> Is he in school today?<eos> I saw him when I was in the hallway earlier.<eos> How about Kellen?<eos> Ms. Sarkosian, may I use the hall pass?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Ms. Sarkosian, may I go, too?<eos> No.<eos> One at a time.
I wanna show you something.<eos> Do you know why trapeze artists are able to perform such death-defying tricks?<eos> No.<eos> They practice with a safety net.<eos> People are more willing to take risks if they have something to fall back on.<eos> So I'm curious, Kellen.<eos> Are you Beth's safety net?<eos> No.<eos> Then I think you're ready.<eos> Ready for what?
I mean, not that your heritage is anything to be ashamed of.<eos> Look, I may not be from Pradesh, but, my expertise is legit.<eos> I know my chakras.<eos> But nobody wants their aura read by Brian from the Bronx.<eos> I wonder why.<eos> Hey, I provide a real service.<eos> Don't you feel better?<eos> No, I mean, now that you mention it, I kind of, like... I had this headache, earlier.<eos> You know who doesn't feel better?<eos> Dead Emma Baker.
Shalom.<eos> Shalom, shalom.<eos> Very good to meet you.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Oh, Rabbi Lev.<eos> He's the head and heart of our center.<eos> A dear Jew.<eos> Sorry, did I see a bathroom back there?<eos> Yes, just down the hall.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It's Debbie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who did you just call?<eos> Pastor Billingham.
Hello?<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Calling from a friend's phone.<eos> My cell's...<eos> She called me.<eos> Lynn.<eos> Look... we have a lot to talk about.<eos> Where are you, Peter?<eos> Not now.<eos> Not on the phone, all right?
[yelling] We should've gone then, I bet.<eos> [speaking urdu] [chuckling] where do you think you're going?<eos> Must...<eos> Protect...<eos> Baby.<eos> [slow clapping] What the...?<eos> Not bad.<eos> I'm gonna give you a seven.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Me, or him?
Many, many people.<eos> Much of it is frivolous, some of it is not.<eos> But every such purchase flows into a massive ocean of consumer debt.<eos> In this country alone, it adds up to $2.4 trillion, most of it owed to credit card companies.<eos> Horowitz did not work for a credit card company.<eos> True, but such corporations have a policy of giving up on trying to collect unpaid debt after 180 days.<eos> Someone's decided it's just not worth the effort.<eos> So they sell it on.<eos> They sell the debt?<eos> To who?
What was that for?<eos> I hate it when you're right.<eos> Is this about your dinner?<eos> It was totally a Meet the Parents thing.<eos> There really is no version of meeting someone's parents that doesn't involve actually meeting their parents.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> And Andrew's father was so... amazing-- he was warm and welcoming.<eos> He was obviously so thrilled that I was dating his son.<eos> I mean, it went about as well as you could possibly imagine.<eos> And yet...
One of you, however, does like to be spanked.<eos> Carry on!<eos> I thought you were sure one of them did it.<eos> Of the seven people in that room, three of them are women of small stature.<eos> One was a geriatric, and one was trying to hide the fact that he's nearly blind from the rest of his colleagues.<eos> And one, whose e-mails I happen to have read, was spending his evening in the company of his dominatrix at the time that Steven Horowitz was killed.<eos> The CEO was the only one who could have overpowered and bludgeoned a grown man, and he had the remnants of a peeling sunburn at the edges of his hairline.<eos> We'll confirm it, but I think he was on holiday at the time of the murder.<eos> Any one of them could have hired a killer.<eos> Unlikely.
Whatever. Let's make this fast.<eos> We just have a few questions.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> These two?<eos> They stole a portrait worth thousands of dollars from my office yesterday.<eos> Uh, well, we'll, uh, sort that out in a bit.<eos> First, uh, have a seat.<eos> We wanted to talk to you about...<eos> Steven Horowitz.
She's a French immigrant living in the United States with a visa from your old company.<eos> We bring in lots of people from overseas.<eos> Consultants, mostly.<eos> Ms. Desjardins is an assassin.<eos> After we I.D.'d her, we got a warrant to search her apartment and found the hemlock plants.<eos> She confessed to dosing my coffee, but claims it was a random crime that had nothing to do with you.<eos> So, how much are you paying her for that?<eos> Even if you could get her to admit that I paid her-- which, by the way, I didn't--<eos> I'm already in this prison until I die.<eos> Thanks to you.
So what seems to be the problem?<eos> How do you feel about a field trip?<eos> I'm the assistant curator of mammals here.<eos> Your problem concerns zebras.<eos> More specifically, the complete lack thereof.<eos> You've managed to lose track of your zebras?<eos> Someone broke in here and took them last night.<eos> Two females.<eos> They're on loan to us because we're experts in equine breeding.<eos> Breeding?
No, you can't go.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, you know how y-you think - that you're their boss and their friend? - Uh-huh.<eos> You're one of those things.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They hate me.<eos> No.<eos> Lots of people like you.<eos> Like who?
First thing out of her mouth, she's telling us what to do.<eos> Well, that stops today.<eos> We go in strong.<eos> We hold our ground.<eos> We let her know she's done pushing us around.<eos> Manny, why are you home so early?<eos> Did you let him skip school?<eos> No, mom.<eos> I was kicked out for punching a really misunderstood kid, thanks to you.<eos> Thanks to me?
Are you kidding me? !<eos> Okay, for God sakes.<eos> Hold--<eos> Would you mind watching my computer for me for a minute?<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Of course, dear.<eos> Hey, Mitch, I'm liking the new hat.<eos> It gives you some presence.<eos> What you getting at, dad?<eos> Nothing.
Luke, what have you done to your hair?<eos> !<eos> Claire, when you react like this, you're just giving him what he wants.<eos> Luke said that you knew about it!<eos> I didn't know about it!<eos> I said a parent knew about it.<eos> Phil!<eos> I know we're not there yet, but I've been researching annulments.<eos> Oh, we are there because you let our child get a mohawk!<eos> Sweet!
He wanted to extend the peace treaty between France and Navarre.<eos> Could have done it through diplomats, but he hasn't been here for years, and now that I'm king, I suppose he wants to pay me a visit.<eos> What's this?<eos> A map?<eos> There's an enclave of the Loire Valley.<eos> The hills there have the lushest orchards and vineyards in the realm.<eos> The poet Marot calls it the Eden of France.<eos> Well, it sounds glorious, but...<eos> I know how hard things have been for you.<eos> For us.
You will work where you're told.<eos> Who else?<eos> Philip...<eos> From Jerusalem.<eos> Is Philip here?<eos> You're in need of my help.<eos> Know my gift is for all.<eos> Let him pass.<eos> You have fallen into misfortune, and you have lost something of great...<eos> Personal value, yes?
Now, you make a very grave mistake if you think Tiberius will always protect you.<eos> Pilate, you will pay for your scheming!<eos> And you will answer to me!<eos> You will answer to me!<eos> Peter.<eos> This... this is everything that I own.<eos> I want you to use it to help spread the word of Jesus.<eos> Now, all I want in return is just...<eos> You know, just a few drops of the Holy Spirit...<eos> As a friend.
We know you're hiding!<eos> Blasphemer!<eos> Saul!<eos> Saul of Tarsus!<eos> Find the blasphemer!<eos> There are men at every gate, everybody's armed, and they're screaming your name.<eos> Barnabas, that was incredible.<eos> You turned the synagogue into a riot.<eos> Everybody needs to hear the gospel of Christ.<eos> Everybody.
Thank God you're okay.<eos> Captain Crane.<eos> Miss?<eos> Mills. Abigail Mills, Captain.<eos> You address me as if we've met.<eos> No, sir, we haven't met, yet.<eos> - But, um...<eos> - I was drawn from battle.<eos> Because I was told you had information concerning a Hessian soldier with a mark upon his hand.<eos> The Horseman.
Mostly written by people who are alive now.<eos> Washington, Jefferson,<eos> - Franklin.<eos> - If... and I stress "if" with extreme veracity... if I were so inclined, General Washington and Thomas Jefferson are in Virginia.<eos> - Not an option.<eos> - What about Franklin?<eos> Recently returned from France.<eos> Honestly, if anyone can back up my story, help us... it's him.<eos> Franklin will know what to do next.<eos> To Mr. Franklin!
I don't know.<eos> Of all the things you told me... and there are so many... my wife wanting me dead...<eos> Crane.<eos> Captain.<eos> It took a long time for you to understand her in the future, if either of us fully do.<eos> What you need to know is the Katrina that is here now,<eos> Katrina that traveled back in time, is not the same woman that you know.<eos> There was a time she was good and she loved you.<eos> She saved my life.<eos> Yours, too.
And then, it hit me like a ton of brick.<eos> You manipulate me to get apartment!<eos> You bad girls!<eos> No, listen, Dmitri, we're really, really sorry.<eos> Yes, please let us make it up to you.<eos> No. No apartment for you!<eos> I give to someone else.<eos> Someone who deserve it.<eos> What?<eos> No! Who?
- And counting.<eos> We're vetting more.<eos> They all want in.<eos> Well, look at you... this season's "it" girl.<eos> Everybody loves Liv.<eos> Such a popular princess.<eos> There.<eos> That's better.<eos> I can be nice to you, you know?<eos> Much nicer to you than Ian.
If the only thing standing in the way of my dream is a neanderthal with a low I.Q. and a gun, hell, I'm gonna let the odds play in my favor.<eos> I'm gonna make my dreams come true.<eos> Billion-dollar baby.<eos> I'm also coordinating with the Ramstein Air Force Base, the Pentagon, and US Africon, making sure no one briefs the press on casualties out of west Angola without clearing through us.<eos> Good.<eos> Our allies are, um...<eos> What?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> The allied command is linked through centcom.<eos> Centcom?
You've been sold.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> But...<eos> The auction's not over for another 12 hours.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> That's what's so great.<eos> These buyers came to me directly, offering cash.<eos> Cold, hard, roll-around-in-bed-on-it cash.<eos> So the auction's suspended, and your buyers are oh-so-excited by their purchase.<eos> Who?

All of them?<eos> They're innocent.<eos> We can't just let them die.<eos> Okay.<eos> You think they'll survive?<eos> I hope.<eos> Let's get it closed back up.<eos> Quietly, quietly.<eos> We were never here.<eos> Ah, probably better that way.
No, it can't be.<eos> I checked her dental records, too, Castle.<eos> It's her.<eos> I wish I could tell you it wasn't.<eos> I take it that the cause of death is blunt-force trauma.<eos> It looks like a massive skull fracture in the parietal region, but she just came in, so I've only done a preliminary exam.<eos> Once I've finished my autopsy, I'll give you a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Castle, I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Oh, barf.<eos> I want to slap that kid.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm Tammy with Wagstaff school news.<eos> Our top story... did a super lame ad take Jimmy Jr.<eos> From front runner to dumb bummer? (Buzzing)<eos> We got reactions.<eos> I felt like I was covered in something gross, and I wanted to burn my eyeballs.<eos> Basically.
And certainly not within a plausible time frame.<eos> So, and with all due respect, Madam Secretary, we stick with the Chinese.<eos> They're not your friends, you know.<eos> But then... they don't pretend to be.<eos> MATT (like Bob Schieffer): Madam Secretary, welcome to Face the Nation.<eos> Thank you, pretend Bob Schieffer.<eos> NADINE: Matt, not so much with the voice.<eos> - Come on. - DAISY: Oh, but he's so sadly proud of it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Your loss.
- But maybe that's behind your sudden obsession with Jason's security...<eos> And don't condescend to me, Henry!<eos> - We don't talk to each other that way.<eos> - If you had seen what I've seen, you would want him to have protection, too, okay?<eos> He doesn't need it.<eos> So, we either keep our word and let him go to school without security, or he stays home.<eos> Okay, so it's okay for you not to fight fair.<eos> Is that how we do it now?<eos> Is that it?<eos> On this one, yeah.

You had a little bit too much to drink.<eos> A professor found you passed out on the quad.<eos> I sort of remember that.<eos> It was like a spring break kickoff rave.<eos> I should get home.<eos> Actually, I need you to sit tight.<eos> We need to look after you for a while.<eos> You lost a lot of fluids last night.<eos> Ok?<eos> For the record,
All this.<eos> All of this death.<eos> See, at the last moment, I lost Faith.<eos> I didn't do as you told me.<eos> If I did as you said, perhaps none of this would've happened.<eos> Hush, now.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> And it was wrong of me to put you in such danger.<eos> Let us never speak of this again.<eos> To anyone.
But do not let your mother catch you at such playing, understand?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Hathorne.<eos> Greetings, my dear girl.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> It is I who am here to help you.<eos> Oh, I thank you for whatever kindness you may intend, but I'm rather busy at present.<eos> No one can replace your father, either in your life, or the life of the community.<eos> But someone must try.<eos> Sugar?
You do not even know what it is that you do know.<eos> I am deeply desirous of knowing who it was that performed the Grand Rite.<eos> My own triumph was stolen by that pestiferous, pus-headed killer,<eos> Increase Mather.<eos> You know Increase Mather?<eos> Oh, he and I danced a lively jig, and neither of us left it unmarked.<eos> I will tell you all my stories sometime.<eos> But it's not about me now.<eos> It's about you.<eos> Me?
Convent?<eos> Look at this little doggie.<eos> Oh, why are you so sad, Mark?<eos> You have no business being sad. You're here to entertain us.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, stand on your feet.<eos> I do you favour by noticing you at all.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> Do you think I should talk to you as if you were a gentleman?<eos> But I can't do that, Mark. You see... because you're an inferior person.<eos> No, madam.
I'm responsible for Carter's kidnapping.<eos> And that's what I'll never get past.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Oh, hey, buddy.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I'm supposed to get Carter.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry, we were up late talking.<eos> Family meeting in the living room.<eos> - About what?
I gave it my best effort... and I did everything I could think of... but it's still the same as always.<eos> When I think about my father, my brother, and your mother... I know that I shouldn't be feeling this way.<eos> So let's just...<eos> I feel the same way you do.<eos> Taxi.<eos> Why is it so hard to flag down a cab?<eos> Want to walk over to a busier street? We might have better luck then.<eos> Then we're going to have to walk for a while.<eos> Want to stop by my place for a bit?<eos> Your place?
I had to take care of him, so I started skipping school.<eos> Got into some trouble.<eos> When I got caught, they stuck CJ with Maggie.<eos> Did two years in juvie.<eos> When I got out, Maggie took me in.<eos> They got any idea who could've done this to her?<eos> Your hand-- why don't you come let me see it.<eos> Yeah, I get you're some type of doctor or whatever, but it don't really look like your patients do so good.<eos> Don't be a smart-ass.<eos> Hand.
'Cause you don't need to know them.<eos> I mean, how's that going to help the case?<eos> Well, how do I know that if I don't know the facts?<eos> You're just gonna have to take my word for it.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Bought you this.<eos> I thought you could do with some shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser.<eos> Anyone you want me to call - relative?<eos> Your flatmate Sharni?
Your wife met Indiana Hope there.<eos> They chatted for ages and then Karly went outside for 15 minutes.<eos> She's crying.<eos> I seriously don't know anything about this.<eos> Karly never mentioned anything about going to this bar.<eos> Nothing.<eos> So, can you tell me about this drawing, Faith?<eos> What do you like about it?<eos> Everything.<eos> Me, too.
You scare her and then swoop in as the answer to all her problems.<eos> We need to get inside that house.<eos> Not without a warrant, and we can't get one without proof.<eos> This is all conjecture.<eos> Then we need something that links the cult to Isabel, and let's look beyond the money for a second.<eos> Why would they want her?<eos> Could be something else.<eos> Is everyone ready?<eos> Just say the word.<eos> Ready for what?

According to the witness, Suzanne Taylor was taking the cash from the register while the store clerk bled to death.<eos> Taylor says she was never in the store and didn't know what had happened until she was arrested with her boyfriend.<eos> Which contradicts the witness' and the boyfriend's statements.<eos> The boyfriend died of cancer in prison three years ago.<eos> Great.<eos> So why is she being granted a 440 hearing now?<eos> Because the only witness, Carmen Thompson, who I.D.'d Taylor and McVeigh, was a crackhead.<eos> And the detective on the case, Detective Stevens, used her for three prior trials and two subsequent ones.<eos> You spoken to him yet?<eos> Over the phone.
And I need you to find Spike.<eos> I don't know where he is, and I think he might be with Tim.<eos> Tim?<eos> That drunk is still alive?<eos> 'Apparently.'<eos> And the court gave him custody.<eos> I don't even know where he lives.<eos> I don't even know if Spike's with him.<eos> I'm freaking out!<eos> Scotty!
I'm worried, Aaron. We got 4 hours until the deadline and no line of communication to the kidnappers.<eos> Whatever the Congressman's involvement, the clock's ticking on Sophie.<eos> Who's that?<eos> The Congressman's intern.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I can't tell you how much it means to me.<eos> Take care.<eos> I feel like I should be holding a telethon the way I'm asking strangers to donate money for Sophie's ransom.<eos> Have a seat, Congressman. We need to ask you about an intern in your office, Michelle Golovin.<eos> A former intern.
You think I'm dangerous?<eos> - Docs are worried.<eos> - Are you?<eos> You ran into traffic, man.<eos> You hurt yourself.<eos> No, I was running from, not to.<eos> I was running away from what I saw.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Uh, just a girl.<eos> Gloria.
Well, what good is the chip without the missile?<eos> Well, think of it like a cell phone, all right?<eos> If you steal my cell phone, then you have access to all my contacts, as well as a bunch of horrifying selfies I took on a roller coaster.<eos> But if it was the U.S. Navy...<eos> Then my contacts on the telematics would give you access to the whereabouts and activities of almost every military asset that we have.<eos> It's a seven-figure windfall if you could sell it to one of our enemies.<eos> You think this Zed guy's got it?<eos> Zed was stuck in the compound, bluffing that he was about to bomb the Navy.<eos> Allowing someone else to walk away with the telematics chip.<eos> Someone else, like who?
Could've been a sexy racehorse.<eos> Guys, where's Percy?<eos> Oh, I sent her for provisions.<eos> And I damn well better get reimbursed for it, too.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Oh, we'll get right on that.<eos> Coming in with some attitude.<eos> Well, let me lighten that load for you.<eos> Hate to spoil a party, but we got to talk.<eos> About you.
We're assuming this is why Australia did not send a delegate to the conference this year.<eos> They are a county in mourning, rather than protest.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Because we are well aware that some of our members of the Asian-Pacific nations are not entirely comfortable with the inclusion of China at this forum this year.<eos> On the contrary, Minister Chen, we need China in this discussion.<eos> Given that much of the framework is about counterfeit issues.<eos> We a... want to see some progress there.<eos> It's a little warm today isn't it?<eos> It's quite pleasant.<eos> Warm to me.
♪ You walk by ♪ This has been okay, right?<eos> Not too weird?<eos> No, no way.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> It has been fun, hasn't it?<eos> No boy drama, no girl drama.<eos> No giant check drama.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> I wish it could always be like this.<eos> Me too.
God, I love him, but has he got a mouth on him<eos> Oh, knows it all, loves to tell you your every mistake.<eos> Wouldn't have lasted five minutes in juvey, huh?<eos> Exactly!<eos> Thank you for not calling the police.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Whose clothes are these?<eos> Mine.<eos> I...
But this is a bad time.<eos> Work is kind of crazy...<eos> 'I don't care! '<eos> This is your nephew!<eos> This is family!<eos> What could possibly be more important than this?<eos> I can't tell you that. 'Oh, my God.<eos> You are unbelievable.'<eos> Tell me at least that you spoke with Rajesh.<eos> Scotty!
OK?<eos> But look, there's something else.<eos> 'You are all over the news.<eos> 'Some guy posted a video on the web this morning 'and he says that you're a terrorist helping him wage war on America!<eos> You're not, are you?<eos> Scotty, I'm a librarian.<eos> 'Well, why is he saying it? '<eos> Cos he's a publicity-seeking prick who hates me.<eos> 'And I think he's trying to find Spike, 'so me getting recaptured suits him...'<eos> Scotty?

A medically recognised recondition where dead people seemingly come back to life.<eos> There have been 38 cases... since 1982.<eos> They can't all be Jesus.<eos> The child is not the saviour.<eos> That was cool.<eos> 'Chaos in Poland this evening as footage emerges of an angry 'mob assaulting a Catholic priest.<eos> 'The mob, followers of the bizarre cult, were enraged 'when the priest publicly challenged their beliefs.<eos> 'The whereabouts and condition of the priest are unknown.<eos> 'It's yet another worrying episode of so-called Apocalypse Fever.<eos> 'In other news...'
Uh, I think this must be the place.<eos> Just a water for me, please.<eos> I'm surprised to see you here.<eos> You're here to check I'm not some crazy woman claiming to be holy, so relax.<eos> I'm not holy.<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You're going to join me, won't you, Sister?<eos> If I do, you will talk to us, answer our questions?<eos> Sure. If you answer mine.<eos> Scotty? In here.
Fucking H Christ!<eos> I am not the Messiah! Hey, hey...<eos> Inside voice. None of the Layla stuff is Mary's fault.<eos> Are we sure about the Messiah thing?<eos> I heard what I heard. Mary, God doesn't speak to people outside of Charlton Heston films.<eos> God definitely didn't speak to anyone in Slough in the '80s.<eos> You were unwell.<eos> No, not back then.<eos> I wasn't sick then. You heard a voice in your head, and you left a newborn baby in a cold, empty car park.<eos> Church car park.
Just because Katie Springer was like a walking advert for university didn't mean there weren't people who could do the same for Stamford.<eos> A lot of people think there's only one kind of Koi carp you can buy at the garden centre on Barnack Road.<eos> There aren't.<eos> There are six.<eos> Oh, bollocks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, this was getting ridiculous, I had to talk to someone who would understand about the offer.<eos> I wasn't thinking about it, because I didn't think I had anything to think about, but I haven't even told him.<eos> Told who?<eos> My boyfriend.
Don't tell anyone about this!<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Look, I don't go back for another week, so if you want to talk to me about this, then you can, OK?<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> An offer to read English at Bristol is fantastic, Rae.<eos> The Head of Department phoned to say how impressed he was by your passion.<eos> Said he didn't get the chance to tell you in person.<eos> Who else have you told?<eos> Well, everyone.
But they don't know anything else.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Sure enough.<eos> This is the green light.<eos> Tamerlane is a go.<eos> - Copy?<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Tamerlane is a go.<eos> Your little counterintel plan worked... we gave Andrew a little breathing room, and he made a call.<eos> To who?
Should I assume since you're here that the coup has failed?<eos> Yes.<eos> In part because of the information your government provided.<eos> If you hadn't come, we might have assumed the United States backed it.<eos> Minister Javani is dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> A tragic loss.<eos> Zahed was my friend.<eos> And partner.<eos> Mine, too.
I don't know Antoine well, but Louis is a friend to the realm and a friend to me.<eos> Not politically.<eos> Their line has been angling for the throne for gener...<eos> For generations, yes.<eos> You sound like Catherine.<eos> Why she hasn't assassinated them while they're here at court is a mystery to me.<eos> Catherine has called for a family luncheon.<eos> My family, not yours.<eos> You may stay, but I don't believe you're here to protect me, or for a post you know Francis has rescinded.<eos> Ma'am.
Quite a bit cheaper than traditional food, and really quite filling.<eos> I'm learning so much.<eos> Francis.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> When are Condé and Lola leaving for his home?<eos> This evening.<eos> Why?<eos> Bash has found some damning evidence against him.<eos> Frederic, the valet we were looking into, the one who had access to Henry.<eos> And the Bible.
Please, let me speak.<eos> I knew I was taking advantage of you, your regard for me, and you deserve better than that.<eos> It's done now.<eos> No need to apologize again.<eos> I am sorry, but I'm not here to apologize.<eos> I'm here to tell you the truth.<eos> Which I suppose I already did. Even before I even realized it.<eos> When I told you to call things off with Lola.<eos> I didn't want to lose you.<eos> Not to another or to...
Maybe one day, I'll see--<eos> They only have my body.<eos> You understand?<eos> What's going on?<eos> You remember when we got the news that Nina was convicted?<eos> You told me these operations sometimes go this way.<eos> I couldn't live with that.<eos> That is Oleg Burov admitting that Zinaida Preobrazhenskaya is a spy working for the KGB.<eos> Who's he say it to?<eos> Me.
I immediately got so... turned on.<eos> I was just ready-- ready to be responsible and accountable for all my own sexual desires.<eos> I was ready for him to go down on me.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Uh, Philip!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, I was- - I was a little surprised to see you here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- Oh. - Well, is everything all right?<eos> - Yes. Uh...<eos> I just like trading blinds.<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Can you call out the all-clear, R.D.?<eos> Roger.<eos> Hunter moving blinds, stand down.<eos> Roger.<eos> Did I say something wrong?<eos> R.D.?
What's the other news?<eos> Well, it turns out the fourth richest man in America is at your little shindig.<eos> Who?<eos> Reese Dipple.<eos> He's right behind Bill Gates,<eos> Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison.<eos> Reese Dipple?<eos> Yeah, you don't hear about him because his conglomerates are all unsexy businesses, like industrial gases, pulp and paper.<eos> He mostly gives to anti-choice causes.<eos> R.D.?
- Yeah.<eos> - Well, I'll see you later.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - See ya.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Hey, where have you been?<eos> You're late.<eos> By, like, three minutes.<eos> Do we know what this meeting is about?<eos> Something about my future.
Let's do it.<eos> Grant?<eos> I thought that was you.<eos> Reagan.<eos> Hey.<eos> Funny running in... to you here.<eos> I know, right?<eos> I can't believe we're finally meeting in person.<eos> Talking face to face.<eos> Instead of on Skype.
I'll help you and Taylor will help you.<eos> Your whole family is behind you.<eos> You don't have to go through this alone.<eos> You probably just want me to go to college so you can have me out of the house for four years.<eos> Well, that's definitely a perk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am telling you, that guy Dean falls asleep in every one of your classes.<eos> Come on, every class?<eos> 15 minutes in.<eos> Like clockwork.
Samir!<eos> Yeah. I'm a little preoccupied here.<eos> Talked it over with my partner.<eos> We think the best plan is to break back into the building, find ourselves a way to cut the power to the fence.<eos> All right.<eos> Ready to roll?<eos> I'm coming, I'm coming.<eos> I already told you, I'm a business management consultant.<eos> Hmm. Well, putting aside the fact you're operating your business out in Green Acres, not a lot of consultants run away from potential clients.<eos> Especially through a lake.
Huh? Okay.<eos> You can watch change, or you can be a part of it.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Oh, god. Ha-ha!<eos> (Laughs) - Hold this.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Kay, I will follow you anywhere!<eos> We need some sunscreen!<eos> I better hold on to these for when I have to arrest them later.<eos> Ok. Alright.
Under his command, 17 was one of the worst run houses in the city.<eos> That's why they shut it down.<eos> And yet, like a cockroach, he just keeps going.<eos> (Herrmann) He's a survivor, this one.<eos> He plays the angles, and he don't like to lose.<eos> Beth? What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I had to drop off Pat's notarized copy - of the divorce papers. - Oh.<eos> You had to?<eos> There was no other way to get it to him, huh?<eos> Like the U.S. Mail?
Someone drained my tank.<eos> Okay, I know you don't do drugs, so maybe there is something to what you're saying.<eos> I'll talk to One Police Plaza and arrange an appeal.<eos> I'll also put someone on this sabotage theory.<eos> I got it.<eos> Jake, when I find whoever did this to you, I'm gonna rip out their eyeballs and fill their sockets...<eos> I think you might be too close to this.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Santiago, Diaz: look into it.<eos> Noice.
- Bella is your wife?<eos> - Uh, no, my girl.<eos> Must be a very special girl. How long have you been together?<eos> Six years.<eos> A few breaks.<eos> - A lot of time on the road.<eos> - A lot of temptation.<eos> Remember the honey from Hotlanta, from the Pink Pony?<eos> Yeah, she was, uh... she was earning money for her graduate degree.<eos> Geopolitics.
They happen all over the country.<eos> It's a pretty big deal.<eos> What's first prize?<eos> Blindfold for your girlfriends?<eos> I'm kidding, I know you don't have girlfriends.<eos> Actually, this level of hair-art takes months of hard work and commitment.<eos> Well, quack, quack, Duck Dynasty.<eos> My left armpit could beat you both.<eos> Let me tell you something on behalf of women everywhere.<eos> We.
Actually, this level of hair-art takes months of hard work and commitment.<eos> Well, quack, quack, Duck Dynasty.<eos> My left armpit could beat you both.<eos> Let me tell you something on behalf of women everywhere.<eos> We.<eos> Don't.<eos> Like.<eos> Beards.<eos> Caroline?<eos> Beards?
'Cause they just let us walk in.<eos> Hello, girls.<eos> You can "Cease and Desis"" selling our T-shirts as of now.<eos> This is our attorney, Mr...<eos> Lu Su.<eos> And he is holding our Cease and Desist to counter your Cease and Desist.<eos> Okay, well, first, your lawyer looks like a teacher on a Disney show.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> And if you have anything further to say, you can take it up with my lawyer.<eos> Her dad.
Then?<eos> -At 10:42 p.m. 911 dispatch received a call from room 233 at the Piney Trail Lodge.<eos> It was Teresa.<eos> She didn't get any words out of her mouth, but she was found clutching the receiver.<eos> Bludgeoned to death.<eos> She was meeting this guy<eos> Cameron, there.<eos> There was a text from Cameron asking her to show up and bring<eos> "the stuff" belonging to this guy Sebastian.<eos> Also deceased.
It's safer for you in here.<eos> And safer for you.<eos> You know what this is?<eos> Bear mother.<eos> Bears are believed to be men that had taken on animal shape.<eos> Janelle.<eos> Hector. Thank you so much for seeing us.<eos> This is Detective Hank Griffin.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> You too.
Uh, we're investigating the murder of a high school maintenance man,<eos> Larry Killburn.<eos> Happened sometime last night.<eos> I know the name.<eos> This have anything to do with the racist graffiti they left on Simon's locker?<eos> Uh, we don't know yet, but we're hoping to talk to Simon about it.<eos> Might have a little difficulty finding him.<eos> He's on a power quest.<eos> That like a vision quest?<eos> Basically.
Hey, I'm sorry about your mom.<eos> I know how much that hurts.<eos> She died trying to save my daughter.<eos> This must be difficult, your life changing so drastically.<eos> You must have loved your Grimm.<eos> You sacrificed so much.<eos> I thought it was a sacrifice.<eos> I'm not so sure anymore.<eos> A Hexenbiest with your powers could be a very valuable asset to someone who respects them.<eos> Like you?
The stuff they said was not true.<eos> Actually, we believe that he was unjustly accused of several crimes.<eos> Yeah, and we are just looking to clear his name.<eos> It's a little late for that now.<eos> It might help you rest easy knowing that some of what was said about Jerry is untrue.<eos> All we would need is a sample of your DNA.<eos> That won't do you no good.<eos> Jerry wasn't my blood.<eos> You're listed as his mother.<eos> Not by choice.
Not by chasing him, not by playing his game.<eos> We need to take the game to him.<eos> Put this deep in your ear.<eos> All right?<eos> All the way in.<eos> The truth is...<eos> I lured you here...<eos> To watch you die.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Clear about what?
All of them.<eos> Maybe do Mom a favor and wear some knickers.<eos> Mom can piss off.<eos> Maybe do Dad a favor then.<eos> It's good to see you, Len.<eos> Robert loved you most.<eos> Hey.<eos> This sucks, huh?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, my God.
Yeah, I could definitely use one.<eos> 1942, it is.<eos> Some for you and... more for me.<eos> To Robert.<eos> And to the fading days of a crumbling empire.<eos> So er... How are things with the new boyfriend?<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> I tried to explain that to your mother.<eos> And did she threaten you and tell you to never see him again?<eos> Pretty much.
Because you don't believe in me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm considering it because I do believe in you.<eos> And because I want something more for you.<eos> What could be more than King?<eos> Love.<eos> A family raised beyond the tabloids and the walls of a castle.<eos> A life lived and not destined.<eos> I like Ophelia very much.<eos> Me too.
Not Agent Gibbs.<eos> Me.<eos> I cannot believe I am forced to defend myself once again for the actions of a criminal.<eos> A Russian criminal, Counselor, with whom you once had a working relationship.<eos> Once, Director.<eos> And we have paid dearly for that mistake, leaving Sergei now a man without a country.<eos> Freeing you up to play the victim.<eos> Not a victim, Gibbs-- a target, like you.<eos> For reasons that make sense only to Sergei.<eos> Reasons such as?
Come on, McGee.<eos> You know, if there is anything on these grenade fragments that'll lead us back to Sergei, I will find it.<eos> Yeah, Tony?<eos> Already?<eos> Okay, I'll be right up.<eos> Gibbs wants an update, and they just got back from the ship.<eos> You said yourself Gibbs is on fire.<eos> Like you've never seen before, Abby.<eos> We've seen it.<eos> Not like this.
Birth of some issues right there.<eos> What?<eos> Am I missing something?<eos> You think that's what's driving him?<eos> No wonder the guy's pissed off.<eos> Uh... Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Details.<eos> Now. Your predecessor at that desk,<eos> Ziva David, had a half-brother.<eos> Ari Haswari.
Between Jethro's wife number two in town and...<eos> I don't know, let's hit rewind or delete or whatever.<eos> I don't think we're a mistake at all, Tobias, and I pray you don't, either.<eos> I know we can work through the petty stuff.<eos> Jethro just texted me to meet him, but call me back as soon as you can, okay?<eos> I love you, Tobias.<eos> Call me.<eos> Every word.<eos> I agreed with every word she said, but instead of calling her right back, I chose to play it small.<eos> Petty.
There they were.<eos> Isabella!<eos> I never mentioned her to you because it didn't occur to me she was connected with the murders.<eos> Ever since I've been here, I've come across restless spirits of all sorts.<eos> They're all kind of...<eos> sad, harmless.<eos> And eventually, the poor things go to their final rest.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> S-so, you're just comfortable around ghosts?<eos> As a spiritual person,
Besides, he might not even be the.<eos> And how do we find out about this secret government agency that's supposedly interested in Grimms?<eos> Uh, probably not on the Internet.<eos> Maybe the Wesen Council knows something, although I doubt they'd tell me if they did.<eos> Trubel told Nick that Chavez is involved with this group, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, Chavez is the only name we've got.<eos> Then we keep digging.<eos> Any changes?<eos> Not for the better.
Why am I the lure?<eos> Eh?<eos> Why am I the lure for everyone's treat?<eos> Saku-chan?<eos> Hungry? - Yeah.<eos> Hey~we met you at the club the other day.<eos> right!<eos> no.<eos> are you guy free right now? Ore!<eos> You bored?
I'm just not certain it's the right thing.<eos> For Paige?<eos> No, for Philip and Elizabeth.<eos> She was much better with him before this all came out.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - I'll have tea.<eos> Okay, we have, uh, chamomile, earl grey --<eos> Just tea.<eos> Hot tea.<eos> - The same.
I talked it over with dad.<eos> We think you should go with me.<eos> It would be the only chance you'll have to meet your grandmother.<eos> But it's your choice.<eos> Martha?<eos> Mar...<eos> I'm sorry, Clark.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Martha, where are you going?<eos> To my parents'.
Excuse me.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I like duck.<eos> Just grab the potatoes.<eos> You're struggling with the fork. Just grab them.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> "I can read palms."<eos> "My brother wanted his read."<eos> "With my mouth I followed each line"<eos> "one after another"
Ruby's still making calls, but I just got off the phone with Ferg.<eos> He said 12 boxes of pharmaceuticals were stolen from the warehouse, all from the same Casper shipment.<eos> Zoloft, Children's Advil, and pseudo-ephrine?<eos> - Pseudoephedrine.<eos> - [Vic] Pseudoephedrine.<eos> Pseudoephedrine?<eos> Meth cooks use it.<eos> So I've been thinking, home invasion, stolen pills, ring a bell?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unfortunately.
- You mean magazines?<eos> - No!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - I don't.<eos> [chuckling]<eos> Like you said, we're on probation.<eos> Selling drugs would wreck that shit.<eos> So we're clean.<eos> - Who's taken over your drug trade?<eos> - No one.
We have started a chapter of Man Up at the community center.<eos> I am on the recruitment committee.<eos> [Merwin] Man Up?<eos> I heard that's like A.A. for wife-beaters.<eos> They do many things for the community, though domestic violence is certainly a focus.<eos> Why would you be asking me to join something like this?<eos> I am asking everybody.<eos> Sure, man.<eos> I'll check it out.<eos> Mondays at 8:00.
Get them to check it before you head out of town.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're gonna go to the casino.<eos> Um, I've been the designated driver for two days, and I need a drink, so... [sighs]<eos> What you got there?<eos> [Vic] Oh, Jesus.<eos> Ferg, put out an APB on that bus driver...<eos> Randolph Hale.<eos> He can't have got far, even if he hitched.<eos> Late teens, early 20s.
You're the brain trust.<eos> You figure it out.<eos> Cut the crap, Malachi.<eos> Tell us.<eos> You know, Mathias, I believe you arrested one of my guys... Curtis... couple of days ago.<eos> I think he didn't do it.<eos> Curtis was a drunk and disorderly.<eos> Oh, well, that's a matter of opinion.<eos> If I release him, you'll tell us who these men are?<eos> Deal.
Right.<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> Is that Peter Hoyt's blood on you?<eos> Wow. Um...<eos> Yeah, I-I guess, uh...<eos> I guess that's from when the sheriff and I were moving his body over to the Bronco.<eos> It could also be Jerry's because I-I carried him over to my car.<eos> He was pretty bloody, too.<eos> You ever get used to it?<eos> Dead bodies and all that?
Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause he just walked into my office... my former office... with Darius.<eos> And he looked scared.<eos> Darius claims to have an alibi for the time of the mugging.<eos> Not that I believe him.<eos> There is someone else with him... a man named Lane Potter.<eos> He is not a very good person.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> Only by reputation.
What happened?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I think I passed out.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Oh!<eos> What happened?<eos> I believe I have a .30-caliber slug in my thigh.<eos> We will need to get it out.<eos> How are we supposed to do that?<eos> The old-fashioned way.
Maybe.<eos> But the time for subtlety is over.<eos> Why don't you go arrest Sam Poteet?<eos> I'm sorry, uh, "new Hector"?<eos> Am I missing something?<eos> A copycat vigilante seems to have started working on the Res.<eos> Hm.<eos> About the Res...<eos> Yep.<eos> Mathias.
- They're all like that.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Screw you.<eos> Go back to zombie land.<eos> Give me the keys, or I'll say there were three of them.<eos> He'll end up dead just like the other two.<eos> I need it back before tomorrow night.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Shotgun.<eos> Mathias.
Madison.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> Carter?<eos> Yeah, it's true.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because it's not really my thing to tell, Tay.<eos> Crap, I'm sorry.<eos> I have a big mouth.<eos> I... I thought it was common knowledge.<eos> Not that common.
Um... do you want me to come to Bird's with you, hang out?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's cool.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> Okay, we are almost done.<eos> - All I need now is that nonstick pan.<eos> - Nonstick.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi!<eos> Hey, everyone.
See you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Walk me out?<eos> So, Max said that I can crash at his place for a couple days 'til I figure out what I'm gonna do next.<eos> He lives with a Bird?<eos> No, her name is Bird.<eos> Listen, um...<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> I think maybe I'm just jealous.<eos> Of what?
Girl code.<eos> Except sister code, and I broke it.<eos> If you ever need to talk, you know I'm here.<eos> I don't think I've ever felt as bad about anything.<eos> Like sick-to-my-stomach bad.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> The whole situation was just messed up, and if I could take it back, I would.<eos> So I hope that this doesn't ruin everything between us.<eos> I can't do this, I really do feel sick.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- Sorry to interrupt.<eos> - No, it's cool.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Uh, we just haven't really talked since you told me about your mom and I...<eos> I'm glad we talked about that, I just...<eos> There's been a lot going on since.<eos> I know.<eos> Um, I just feel really out of touch and I would like to be back in touch.<eos> Me too.
Party in the woods.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You know what, though?<eos> I forgot something.<eos> Max, could you help me, please?<eos> We can't tell her with everyone else there.<eos> Well, we'll just... we'll drive together and then we can talk to her, okay?<eos> On the way?
- Yeah.<eos> ♪ All units, I need an APB. for a red Mazda, Maryland plates,<eos> Victor, Bravo, Frank, 41-40.<eos> We're looking for three white males, one early 20s, two early 30s.<eos> Assume that they're armed and dangerous.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, what?<eos> Yes, to the new beginning thing.<eos> - I'm really sorry.<eos> - What for?
You're still wearing the necklace.<eos> Never took it off, huh? Hmm.<eos> I think you're still in love with me.<eos> You never filed for divorce, did you?<eos> What?<eos> You wish.<eos> You know, but staying married to you was a great way to keep all those... all those women hell-bent on marriage off my back.<eos> Look. I need you help.<eos> You've driven halfway across the country following these guys.<eos> All by yourself.
Me neither.<eos> It's been what, ten years?<eos> 11 years, five months, three weeks, two days.<eos> Now that Eddie's here, I figure you might want to disentangle.<eos> Called a buddy in Florida.<eos> Had him pull a couple of strings.<eos> You could have your marriage disentangled right here in New York.<eos> When did you do all this homework?<eos> Just trying to help a friend.<eos> Yeah, a friend?
I am so sorry.<eos> - No, it's good.<eos> - It was my bad.<eos> Come with me.<eos> We'll start your paperwork.<eos> Maybe you can tell me something about that broken coffee machine.<eos> Oh, yeah, so uh, Al did it afterwards.<eos> Maybe I'll get a hug, too.<eos> So, you're single again.<eos> Thanks to you.
Your profile did say "crazy hours,"<eos> and you're off to go save a life.<eos> What's hotter than that?<eos> Well, I'm glad I got to lay eyes on you in person.<eos> Well, maybe we can do it again sometime.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> First dates are overrated.<eos> Maybe we should just jump to the end of this one.<eos> Oh, I have to get to the pit.<eos> Me too.
- Okay.<eos> I called Derek.<eos> I'm laying here.<eos> I'm sleeping.<eos> A woman answered his phone.<eos> There are two empty beds.<eos> Pick one.<eos> One empty bed. I'm up here.<eos> A woman answered his phone?<eos> - Whose phone?
Yeah.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake.<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> O lift me from the grass.<eos> I die, I faint, I fail.<eos> Let they love in kisses rain on...<eos> On my...
- Oh, for God's sake.<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> O lift me from the grass.<eos> I die, I faint, I fail.<eos> Let they love in kisses rain on...<eos> On my...<eos> On my lips.
With your-- your-- your-- your-- your--<eos> Timing.<eos> Um, excuse me?<eos> Hello?<eos> Jesus, my ear balls!<eos> Um...<eos> Oh. So, here's the thing with that...<eos> I'll be seein' you two later...<eos> Guards!<eos> Gua--!
Jesus, my ear balls!<eos> Um...<eos> Oh. So, here's the thing with that...<eos> I'll be seein' you two later...<eos> Guards!<eos> Gua--!<eos> So... not great.<eos> Uh, could be worse.<eos> Coming, Your Majesty!<eos> Case in point.
- OK.<eos> - Sedate them.<eos> - I'll get some water.<eos> Water?<eos> You really are new.<eos> All we've got left are suppositories.<eos> Shall we start with the new guy?<eos> OK.<eos> You're gonna need gloves, mate.<eos> - Me? - Uh-huh.
They wouldn't even take that to the warden.<eos> It's underwhelming to say the least.<eos> Underwhelming is sort of the point of being incarcerated, no?<eos> A little effort's all I'm asking.<eos> You know, I remember when you were five, uh, maybe six, and I would take you to the parade, and I'd put you up on my shoulders so you could see the floats.<eos> Your mama-- she warned me that you'd had too much to eat and I'd better set you down.<eos> Well, the next thing I know, there's this big glob of warm puke sliding...<eos> All right, let's get to it.<eos> Get to what?<eos> The ritual.
It's shocking how people are so into themselves.<eos> They don't even bother to notice there's a murder.<eos> Okay, this is the moment right before Douce of Screwy crashed into your victim on the stairs.<eos> And as you notice, Petty Officer Patrice already had bloodstains on his shirt.<eos> Consistent with what we were told.<eos> Based on what you said about the mask, I zoomed in on his left hand.<eos> Let me enhance this puppy.<eos> There.<eos> That's serious.<eos> Tactical.
Oh, I'd like to, but, uh, you know...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I forgot.<eos> So you're going back to school tomorrow?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have an exam on Friday.<eos> And then you'll write again?<eos> Write?<eos> Me.
Wow. Well, they just awarded it to Thapa posthumously for extraordinary valor and self-sacrifice in defense of his country.<eos> India's also investigating a rogue group of spies for running unauthorized ops against America.<eos> Extremists that took advantage of a certain Gurkha's loyalty.<eos> And?<eos> And we know about the tracker you placed on Thapa.<eos> The CIA is not bailing you out, so, if you ever want to see daylight again you are going to list every one of their names, numbers and addresses before the night's done.<eos> So you can pay them a visit?<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Yeah, I've been, uh... I've been better.<eos> Your place or mine?
I love you, too.<eos> Let's just come clean.<eos> Voight'll respect us more if we look him in the eye.<eos> It's nobody's business but ours.<eos> Ordinarily, I don't allow for relationships in my unit, but Lindsay's spot's open.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I'm gonna respectfully decline Intelligence.<eos> Wasn't the answer I expected.<eos> It's just, I'm not ready to be off the beat yet.<eos> At least right now.
All right.<eos> You know Lieutenant Guthrie from Narcotics.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, Alan.<eos> - Hank.<eos> For the last 18 months, Narcotics has had an officer deep undercover with a robbery crew flooding the city with Schedule II prescription drugs.<eos> Three days ago that officer,<eos> Rick Manning, went dark.<eos> My undercovers check in with me every day.<eos> If not in person, then by phone.
And I love you. Oh, and I love that you love me, too.<eos> (chuckles nervously) So what are your plans?<eos> Well, right off the bat, I want to change my pants.<eos> I mean for your future, because this, my dear, is a game changer.<eos> Books like yours don't come across my desk every day.<eos> I think what we have here is very nearly perfect.<eos> I really only have one thought.<eos> One thought?<eos> Great. Well, as you have it, your main character is searching for spiritual fulfillment and sexual awakening, which I love...<eos> Me, too.
(sighs) Because I'm ten steps ahead of you.<eos> Oh, that's another character trait that you might want to add.<eos> Oh, you know what? Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, hey! Has anybody seen an incredibly tall, dark, handsome man ten steps ahead of me?<eos> 'Cause I have! (laughs)<eos> Of course, you know, it's a big change in direction.<eos> I'd have to read some pages before I could make the decision.<eos> Yeah, well, you could read some pages or you could just read the book.<eos> You played me.<eos> Like a big, British fiddle.
The US introduced a procedure a few years back where they take the fingerprints of everyone entering the country.<eos> But when they took Annette's... .. they discovered she had none.<eos> Identical thing happened to a Swiss woman in 2008, a certain Heidi Oppenheimer, who was travelling from Zurich to Boston, apparently to meet her boyfriend.<eos> She was stunned.<eos> She never knew she had no fingerprints.<eos> I mean, why would she?<eos> Now, I had heard about Ms Oppenheimer and her detainment, but what I didn't know is that when she went back to Switzerland, doctors performed tests on all of her immediate relatives, and they made a discovery.<eos> Adermatoglyphia runs in families.<eos> But I have fingerprints!<eos> Through the mother's side.
His wife fell in love with him when he came back because he was caring and loving, which he wasn't before.<eos> Larger penis probably didn't hurt.<eos> And I'm sure my feet are the same, Lana.<eos> My cordwainer would have said something.<eos> Well, whatever it is, for some reason I don't have to suppress my gag reflex now whenever you mention your cordwainer.<eos> Well, what should I call him?<eos> A shoemaker?<eos> What I'm trying to say is, you were different than you were when you dated the first time.<eos> More mature, maybe?<eos> And definitely more focused on me.
Well, what should I call him?<eos> A shoemaker?<eos> What I'm trying to say is, you were different than you were when you dated the first time.<eos> More mature, maybe?<eos> And definitely more focused on me.<eos> - Well?<eos> - As opposed to every single woman you meet in a bar or at a party or just merely walking down the street.<eos> I-- yeah.<eos> Uh. I'm sorry for that... time.<eos> Zzz.
I-- mother, she's a goddamn baby!<eos> No, I have to go, so-<eos> - I will.<eos> And if I find out you gave her diet pills, mother,<eos> No kidding, I will have you arrested.<eos> [moaning continues] do what?<eos> Who's havin' a rest?<eos> I heard you, now I gotta go, goodbye.<eos> [beep] hey, sleepyhead.<eos> [yawning] hey, you.
What happened between your bedroom and right now?<eos> Well, you were hysterical, lana,<eos> So I thought the best thing to do would be<eos> Inject you with a tranquilizer, drive you to a private airfield,<eos> Put you on a cia plane, fly you overnight to wales,<eos> And then that brings us to now.<eos> Huh.<eos> And I know drugging women isn't cool, at all,<eos> Ever, and obviously, I would never ever do that<eos> For any sort of sexual assault-y reason.
[dafydd] toast!<eos> Yes, come and have some toast, dafydd.<eos> Make him wash his hands first.<eos> Okay, so, what do we do about this?<eos> Well, apparently since we're seeing other people now, [lloyd] oh?<eos> Not you.<eos> Not us.<eos> I meant sleepy floyd here.<eos> Right, shit, he knows we're with the cia<eos> Thanks to your fat mouth.
No, not why is the lab in new mexico.<eos> Why are you going to tell us<eos> How this super top-secret shrink ray works?<eos> Because in less than 14 hours,<eos> You're all going to be miniaturized<eos> Down to the size of bacteria and injected into dr. Kovacs.<eos> [overlapping response] What if we don't consent to be dr. Shrinkered?<eos> Well there's a carrot and a stick here,<eos> The carrot being an one-time payment<eos> Of $1,000,000 each.
No, this is absolutely not<eos> That trademark character.<eos> This is-- michael?<eos> [scoffs] oh my god.<eos> Just a unitard with the systems of the human body on it.<eos> On a guy.<eos> On a guy named tv's michael gray.<eos> What? [clamoring]<eos> Earballs!<eos> Jesus!
That's a new one.<eos> Not my first boarding school case.<eos> Look at that, huh?<eos> So, you guys weren't friends with Molly?<eos> We're all friends.<eos> You just wanted her diary because you care so much about her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where were you four nights ago?<eos> Agent Booth, if you wish to question the girls, you must proceed through channels.<eos> Channels.
Man, everything leads back to that school.<eos> Cayla Seligman and Arianna Donas are a college admissions officer's dream.<eos> Okay, Cayla is the captain of the field hockey, basketball and lacrosse team.<eos> Arianna builds houses in Haiti on her summer vacations.<eos> I mean, somebody get these girls some wings to go with their halos.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't like 'em.<eos> They said that they were friends with Molly, but according to her cell records, she never texted or called them.<eos> Who did Molly call or text?<eos> Her parents.
Molly's parents deluded themselves into thinking that she was happy.<eos> I know what she went through.<eos> I just wish that... instead of convincing herself that suicide was the only option... if she had someone to talk to, if she felt safe enough to...<eos> She...<eos> I know.<eos> I have you now.<eos> Yup.<eos> I can tell you how scared I am.<eos> Scared?<eos> You?
I just wish that... instead of convincing herself that suicide was the only option... if she had someone to talk to, if she felt safe enough to...<eos> She...<eos> I know.<eos> I have you now.<eos> Yup.<eos> I can tell you how scared I am.<eos> Scared?<eos> You?<eos> Yes.<eos> Me.
Yes.<eos> But you don't need to meet Ted until you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Okay.<eos> I really want to know what you think of him.<eos> Your approval means a lot.<eos> The moment had arrived.<eos> Matty was alone at lunch.<eos> After royally screwing up my first attempt, nothing was gonna stop me now.<eos> Matty.
Um, this area's offlimits.<eos> Carolyn is my daughter.<eos> I'm very sorry, sir.<eos> All she ever tried to do was help people.<eos> Why her?<eos> Kev.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A-any luck on that press pass?<eos> - Who did it belong to?<eos> - No one.
But you heard him.<eos> We're never gonna in the Clement summer program with this.<eos> We need a plan B.<eos> So she was a freshman when Jackson was a senior.<eos> There might be some proof in here that they knew each other.<eos> Just for the record, I think you're jumping to conclusions, and I'm worried you're gonna end up disappointed.<eos> I'm just helping because I need to distract myself from the fact that Duke is supposed to be training. But instead, he's logged on to Stubbl!<eos> Why can't you just tell him you don't want an open relationship?<eos> Because I don't know if I can do monogamy.<eos> Holy [bleep].
No!<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> [ screams ] Metatron: My story began when i killed my brother,<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, okay, just, um -- just be there.<eos> Yeah. Got to go.<eos> [ beep ] Hey.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> Like a drunk baby.
I told you i would rather die Than let dean winchester use me as his personal punching bag again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Dean's not involved.<eos> You're gonna be my punching bag.<eos> The "b" team, huh?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Keys are over there.<eos> Chop chop!<eos> Are you sure this is the only way?<eos> Unfortunately. [ chuckles ]
I missed her so much, I watched a romcom while eating a whole box of her edible underwear.<eos> Still not talking to me, Sophie?<eos> For the last time, there's nobody else but you.<eos> - I use that phone...<eos> - Yes?<eos> To...<eos> Go on.<eos> - I use it to call...<eos> - Cut to the chase!<eos> My mother.
Well, that is a great deal of trust in a woman you hardly know.<eos> Well, there are some things and people one knows in a single glance.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You have a fine hand.<eos> You make a body look as beautiful without the skin as with it.<eos> I only wish my hand was as adept at uncovering the mysteries beneath the skin.<eos> This plague is... it's like no other.<eos> It's not transmitted by vermin nor by the simple cough, but some other means.<eos> Hathorne wonders if you really came to town to cure the plague or to humor some dark obsession with the dead.<eos> Both.
Oh, no, let...<eos> Stay.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> It'd be quicker.<eos> Stone, Ezekiel, why don't you check the card catalog and look for any references to a lost staff?<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll check the library annals, too, see if any previous Librarians had any experiences<eos> - with the Prosperity bloke.<eos> - Prospero.<eos> Whatever.
Off with your heads!<eos> Didn't see that one coming.<eos> Off... with... their... heads!<eos> It's another Fictional.<eos> He summoned the Red Queen from "Alice in Wonderland."<eos> No, that's the Queen of Hearts.<eos> Red Queen is from "Through the Looking-Glass."<eos> There's a difference?<eos> Off with their heads, off with their heads, off with their heads.<eos> Baird!
You sure about this?<eos> No.<eos> Just make sure the monster doesn't get the kids or Ezekiel or Stone.<eos> And you do what you have to do.<eos> Promise me.<eos> I promise.<eos> Find Lucy.<eos> Lucy?<eos> Hello?<eos> Baird!
Okay, uh, get him to the, uh, to the holding area.<eos> That's where everyone's taking selfies.<eos> Geotagging, graphics from the nearest cell towers.<eos> I can do this.<eos> I think.<eos> Oh!<eos> There's a woman following me.<eos> Wipe her.<eos> - Baird!<eos> Baird! - Aah!
Why are we still here?<eos> Why's this place trashed?<eos> Really?<eos> Still?<eos> Right.<eos> We're trapped in a video game Save Point.<eos> Each time one of us dies, it resets, okay?<eos> But the game is crashing, and I know the way out.<eos> So if you want to live, follow me.<eos> Back through the door...
Marianne...<eos> Antoine...<eos> I like you.<eos> How I like you!<eos> Solange...<eos> - I've lost a stocking.<eos> - You weren't wearing any.<eos> What's that then?<eos> Will you come?<eos> To my place.
Sorry.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> The one who lost the card game gets to choose.<eos> That's easy.<eos> Next month, you'll see.<eos> Next month.<eos> - Are you OK?<eos> - Better than that!<eos> - What's on your mind?<eos> - Why, you of course!
She wrote Marianne regularly.<eos> She said she was regaining her strength.<eos> After a few weeks, Dominique went to meet her.<eos> You're smiling.<eos> Yes, are you surprised?<eos> - Why are you hiding here?<eos> - I'm not hiding.<eos> It's a good life.<eos> I'm resting.<eos> A good life?
I feel as if I were dead.<eos> - The doctor will calm you down.<eos> - No, please. I'll calm down.<eos> I'm calm.<eos> See, I'm obedient.<eos> I'm perfectly calm.<eos> Darling...<eos> It's over, I'm here.<eos> Are you staying for dinner?<eos> Not with all these people.
- Hi.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> Yes, I got your message.<eos> And the flowers.<eos> And the picture of the goat that you gave to that African tribe in my name.<eos> Forgive me?<eos> (chuckles) So, did you buy goats for everyone in class?<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
Well, no.<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> - I'm very enthusiastic.<eos> - You are enthusiastic.<eos> And it's endearing.<eos> Anyways, you know, I'm sure you will solve this one too.<eos> I'm sure we will, Denny.<eos> When you get back to work.<eos> What?<eos> - Work.
Relax.<eos> Relax.<eos> - Look, I really need this job.<eos> - I'm sorry. I-<eos> - I can just--<eos> - Relax!<eos> - Come on, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - ...this job.<eos> I really--
You disappoint me, Harold.<eos> How long do I have?<eos> My friend needs to get to the hospital in 11 minutes or he's dead.<eos> I won't go.<eos> When they come, I won't go.<eos> And legally, they can't force me.<eos> Worthy doesn't care if the girl gets caught in the crossfire.<eos> Hey- - I got this!<eos> You want to get out of here alive, Pratt?<eos> Careful.
Please, please believe me.<eos> All right, I believe you.<eos> Root...<eos> Okay... Come on...<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Give it.<eos> The real thumb drive.<eos> There's no way you'd strike a bargain where you weren't the big winner.<eos> It's mine.<eos> Fair and square.
This is super weird for me.<eos> Captain.<eos> Captain.<eos> Anyways, you guys, my dad is the best pilot.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Tell them about Oregon.<eos> Okay, this one time I'm in Eugene,<eos> I'm hitching a ride in the jump seat of a commuter jet.<eos> I'm sleeping off a wicked hangover.<eos> Noice.
S. Holmes-- that could be a lot of people.<eos> Maybe there's a Steve Holmes out there, or a Sally.<eos> But we showed it to our handwriting expert at Q-DOC.<eos> I could have saved you the trouble.<eos> I'm the author of that note.<eos> There is no doubt.<eos> Oh, then you lied when you said you didn't know Maria Gutierrez.<eos> I did not lie.<eos> I do not recall her face and I have no memory of writing<eos> - to her.
- No, no, no...<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> Mom and dad are sitting outside with the neighbors they used to hate yukking it up like they're all best friends.<eos> And why?<eos> Because there's wine?<eos> No.<eos> Because of art.
But for the record, I don't take vanilla with my coffee.<eos> You will after you taste that.<eos> Oh, my God, this is awesome.<eos> When will they learn?<eos> Perfect timing.<eos> And what are we celebrating?<eos> Our win.<eos> "Our win."<eos> - I like the sound of that.<eos> - Me too.
Soldiers had access to Afghanistan's classified ops.<eos> I know one or two militant groups that would kill for that.<eos> No, they'd kill for it after they got what they needed.<eos> That's not what happened this morning.<eos> Unless... whoever killed Fahad already got what they wanted.<eos> Hey, Nell.<eos> Yep.<eos> You, uh, you busy?<eos> Yep.<eos> On a scale of one to ten, how busy?
That's not much to go on, Chief.<eos> How are you getting on, JP?<eos> The envelope's clean.<eos> Whoever gave him the cash wore gloves.<eos> Or maybe it's another lie.<eos> Is it me or are we going round in circles?<eos> Sir, it's getting late.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Shouldn't you be going home?<eos> Your father?
Am I really your daughter?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on? Breakfast.<eos> Come sit down.<eos> Two or three waffles, henry?<eos> Two.<eos> Good.<eos> You all set for your biology test?<eos> What biology test?
How bad?<eos> The leak proves you were embezzling company funds.<eos> What?<eos> That's-- that's ridiculous.<eos> The board is meeting in an hour.<eos> They're moving to fire you.<eos> Okay, call Mark.<eos> Tell him to stall.<eos> What networks are covering this?<eos> - All of them. - Uh-huh?
So why was your whole family home that night?<eos> We had dinner there every Sunday.<eos> Then where were you?<eos> Come on, Chase, what aren't you telling me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I've already told my side.<eos> So why are you hiding it now?<eos> I'm not hiding it.<eos> I told her.<eos> - Her?
They all had a picture-- girlfriend, wife, kid.<eos> After a while, I realized everybody I found, on either side, had a picture.<eos> They were fighting for something.<eos> They were dying for something.<eos> I figured maybe if I didn't have a picture to carry around with me I'd be better at my job, so when I got back,<eos> I broke things off with Jessica.<eos> Maybe you're right, then.<eos> Maybe this is the path you've been on all along, path that led you right here.<eos> Don't reach out to anyone, shut everybody out.<eos> - Not everyone.
Why is quoting movie lines such a guy thing?<eos> The freaky mannequin's arm is down.<eos> Which means they're in a holding pattern.<eos> Any activity in the apartment?<eos> Nada.<eos> The blinds are still down.<eos> - Where's Fisher already?<eos> - Maggie said he's on his way.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To the back entrance of the building.
I take it very personally.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> Please get your paperwork in.<eos> I will.<eos> I will do that today.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> You, too.
Leaving a widow named Lauren?<eos> Yes, sir, but nothing pops on NCIC.<eos> Don't we have a picture?<eos> Not as of yet, sir.<eos> Google Images was a blank and we're still waiting for the DMV to come back to us.<eos> What about these lightbulbs?<eos> They are legitimately, uh, donated by an electric company of Japan with U.S. offices in Flemington, New Jersey as part of a charitable tax break for foreign companies trading in the U.S.<eos> Do we have confirmation of any monies distributed by this Local Hero Fund to 9/11 families?<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> To any families?
I love...<eos> Love L.A. Ah, Maestro, me... me too.<eos> I miss home, though.<eos> Home New York or home Mexico?<eos> Both.
- Second... - Second.<eos> It makes your hair look like spun gold.<eos> Well, then, I guess we'll go with the second one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Gloria, we can't have a strike.<eos> Can't you just give them what they want?<eos> Can't afford to give them what they want.<eos> Well, you can afford those curtains.<eos> Thanks to my fourth husband, yes.
Theater!<eos> It's play acting!<eos> Tell the president I'm very sorry, but he needs to find someone else for the job.<eos> What if there was no body to find?<eos> You and I both know the best way to handle dead Lois is disappear her, and that's probably what the kidnappers did.<eos> That's what we'd do.<eos> Burn her.<eos> Dissolve her.<eos> Send her to the bottom of a lake.<eos> - In pieces.
Jake and Fitz are drinking in the locker room together, snapping towels, trading stories of conquest.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> Ethan remains utterly useless.<eos> An idea would die of sheer loneliness in that head of his.<eos> Cyrus, I don't care.<eos> Fitz, Jake, Mellie, the White House... it's all in the rearview for me.<eos> I need to move forward.<eos> I am moving forward.<eos> Moving forward.<eos> Towards what?
Blanket protection for future prosecution for any and all crimes related to your testimony.<eos> Hear about Sue Thomas?<eos> It's crazy...<eos> I feel guilty.<eos> Dirty.<eos> It wasn't wrong to sleep with her, not illegal.<eos> I refuse to engage in extortion or let others do so.<eos> I didn't slit her throat... a gory detail I wish the police hadn't shared with me.<eos> Didn't do anything wrong, did everything by the book.<eos> Letter of the law.
He has yet to publicly express his views on same-sex marriage, and he can't rock the boat with Mellie's senate campaign on the horizon.<eos> I can't pile on and bother the president with my hooker troubles, Liv.<eos> I just can't.<eos> I won't.<eos> A White House wedding?<eos> A gay republican White House wedding?<eos> Hosted by the First Lady... more importantly, the republican candidate for senator of Virginia.<eos> Olivia, what's up?<eos> You covering the first lady today, Peter?<eos> Unfortunately.
I guess I forget how much sometimes.<eos> Yeah, and everywhere I look, it's just that... maybe nothing's really changed except that he's not here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Um, this is Luke's long-form birth certificate.<eos> Came in the mail this morning.<eos> The name of the father is still empty.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, we've been living in such a blissful bubble, I haven't wanted to burst it, so...<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.
Uh...<eos> Really?<eos> Different people every week?<eos> How exciting and new.<eos> It'd be like "The Love Boat."<eos> Oh!<eos> Hey, mom, have a second?<eos> Already am.<eos> I wanted to give you a present.<eos> Me?
Two, I have a lovely little gift for you all, if you take me to him right now.<eos> We do not negotiate.<eos> Clara Oswald.<eos> I brought you complete control of the Doctor, giftwrapped.<eos> Better - canned.<eos> It is beautiful, my world, is it not?<eos> How did you get it back?<eos> The Daleks remade it.<eos> Like you, they have a strong concept of home.<eos> No, like you.

- Okay.<eos> - Tickle your tail feathers. - Mm.<eos> - Cup your coconuts.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Rock your rump.<eos> Poke your hontas.<eos> Wallop your wonderland!<eos> There's still bleeding from the short gastric arteries.<eos> I see it.<eos> - Close to the pancreas.
Nah, it's past midnight.<eos> Go ahead and clock out, I'll get Frankie and Meredith on it in the morning.<eos> We are keeping Crazytown overnight.<eos> Need a lift?<eos> Escorting me back to my cabin.<eos> Quite the gentleman.<eos> If I'm the gentleman I guess that makes you the officer.<eos> Tonight, I'm just Jennifer.<eos> You mentioned you had something to give me?<eos> About the case.
Mm. It's just a fact.<eos> Well, I'm shoving' off to take care of the book.<eos> Catch you on the flip-flop.<eos> Umm, about the book... she took it.<eos> She took it?<eos> Uh, yeah, she-she grabbed it on her way out, I guess she thinks it's gonna help her with her mom.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> I can take you to her dad's.<eos> All right, wipe your feet and get in.<eos> Sweet.
In fact, I can't really say.<eos> I've just heard him.<eos> A new thing, like silent dating.<eos> - You meet but you don't talk. - No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It happened to me once.<eos> No words. I followed a guy to his car,<eos> And then he went down on...<eos> Down on what?<eos> Breadcrumbs!
I probably sold drugs to his father.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Uh...<eos> The bed's all made up.<eos> If you're the hungry, the kitchen's there.<eos> And the bathroom's there.<eos> Just make yourself at home.<eos> Yeah. Thanks again.<eos> Okay, sweet dreams.<eos> Christy?
On your computer upstairs?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I, uh, I go to college, so I have a paper to write.<eos> And print.<eos> Yes, and print.<eos> Can't turn it in unless you print it.<eos> I am, uh, not in college, so I like to... Watch TV.<eos> Okay, sweet dreams.<eos> Night.<eos> Christy?
Okay... night!<eos> Sometimes we... Like to heat up soup in bed, so I'm just gonna grab the microwave.<eos> Our little dope fiend up yet?<eos> She's gone.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Went back to the boyfriend.<eos> Aw, damn.<eos> Well... we did what we could do.<eos> Yeah. I just had a good feeling about this one.<eos> Me, too.
No, I'm... I think that's a bad idea.<eos> Look, if I was you, I would go to Port authority and get on a bus right now.<eos> What?<eos> What, you want me to just leave right now?<eos> When they find out I saw it, they will kill me.<eos> I know, and they'll kill me, too, if they find you here.<eos> You've gotta go.<eos> Are you serious right now?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> [Whispers] Sorry.
I want to live better.<eos> I work my ass off so I can live better and you can live better.<eos> My father and me worked hard for 40 years to build this goddamn business.<eos> That's why we came here to this country, and now you may have smashed it to pieces with one brainless act.<eos> It was time to send a message.<eos> A message to whom?<eos> What was the message?<eos> What you may have done is start a war with Mr. O.'s young punks. That's what you may have done.<eos> And who's gonna clean it up with them?<eos> Huh, who?

And the sooner he can pin this on somebody, the happier everybody's gonna be.<eos> Whoa, whoa, I'm not a killer, Terry.<eos> - You know that.<eos> You know me since I was 4.<eos> Come on.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> - Come on, come on.<eos> - Five years in the joint.<eos> - People change, right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, change for the better.
- Oh, it's wonderful.<eos> Some people might find it cramped, but it's really not.<eos> For example, we have a pullout couch in the main room, and I only have to move the kitchen table a few feet to open it up. All right, that is an exaggeration.<eos> - It is not that small.<eos> - It's a one-bedroom.<eos> So, where does your daughter sleep?<eos> She's in with the boys.<eos> But they must be teenagers by now.<eos> - James just turned 13, all right?<eos> - Shame on you.
No.<eos> I'll come with you tomorrow.<eos> Let me play the bad cop.<eos> And if he doesn't have all the money?<eos> Then he goes.<eos> Plain and simple.<eos> We're done doing favors for this fat bastard.<eos> I don't care how far you go back.<eos> This isn't gonna go over well.<eos> Too bad about him.
Yeah, he's dead.<eos> Wow, that's ultimate trouble.<eos> We need to ask you some questions.<eos> Are you usually around?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I work out of my pad, when I work.<eos> I'm a day-trader.<eos> Buy low, sell high.<eos> It looks like, uh, Spears lived here alone?<eos> During the days, at least.
XO set a three-sailor liberty party rule.<eos> Needed Pete to round out our group.<eos> Luckily, we were able to talk him into coming along with us.<eos> Went to the Quarter to check out this band Tiny Universe.<eos> Karl Denson.<eos> That guy's the man.<eos> Pete enjoy the show?<eos> Thought so, but... during the set break, Pete says he's stepping out for a smoke, never came back.<eos> You guys follow protocol?<eos> To a T.
I'd be more honest.<eos> How 'bout you?<eos> The debate.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> And the closeted charge.<eos> I would answer it.<eos> You still can.<eos> No one thinks it's wrong to be gay.<eos> Can I tell you a secret?<eos> Who else but your opponent?
It's the God's honest truth.<eos> Wh... why didn't you say that?<eos> Well, we didn't want to lose the gay vote and... besides, it makes you look weird.<eos> What person in this day and age takes Jesus Christ seriously when he says, "you can't divorce"?<eos> Not someone you want to get a beer with.<eos> You are...<eos> Better than I am.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Unfortunately.
Everyone else gets a brand-new body, and I'm still grinding away in this one.<eos> Don't you see, Stan?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> In every life, we find each other.<eos> So even if we don't spend all our time together, we're gonna spend all of time together.<eos> So, we're dying, but it's...okay?<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> But what about the kids?<eos> There will be others.<eos> To the next life.
You psycho.<eos> Therapy?<eos> I don't need therapy.<eos> I lived when I should have died.<eos> So what?<eos> Just goes to show, you never know.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I-it's like that skydiver whose parachute came detached, and then he fell in the swamp and died, and his parachute ended up landing at this school, but they'd already bought a parachute for their gym class, so they ended up with two parachutes.<eos> They only needed one.<eos> Jesus!
I have begun to wonder why modern magicians are unable to work the magic that they write about.<eos> In short, gentlemen, I wish to know... .. why is magic no longer done in England.<eos> It is a long question, Mr...<eos> Segundus.<eos> Magicians study magic, the history of magic. We do not perform it.<eos> You don't expect an astronomer to create stars, eh?<eos> Or a botanist to invent new flowers, eh?<eos> It is a child's question, I appreciate, but no-one else...<eos> Classical magic, sir, is not a thing for the gentlemen of this society.<eos> Nor any... gentleman.
He is the Secretary of State for War.<eos> Remember what a gift it is that you offer, then I am sure he will be your friend.<eos> 'You, sir, are an embarrassment to your party' and to this whole house.<eos> Our forces are hopelessly outnumbered by the French.<eos> We stay in Salamanca and be massacred, or lead our troops over the mountains and leave them to the snow.<eos> This is a final disgrace.<eos> The final act of a criminally incompetent government.<eos> Shame upon you.<eos> Shame!<eos> Order.
The cards of Marseilles.<eos> Shall we see your fortune?<eos> Curses!<eos> Curses upon your neighbour!<eos> For the present, your actions are governed by a hermit - Norrell.<eos> We knew that already.<eos> Ah, this one tells me you've weighed your choices and made a decision.<eos> This one tells me what it is - you're going wandering.<eos> You've a message to deliver.<eos> To him.
I shall call it... ..'Tis Pity She's A Corpse.<eos> Who in the world are you?<eos> I am the greatest magician of the age.<eos> I... I am the man who is destined to restore magic to England.<eos> Well, obviously you are that, or I should not be here.<eos> But who are you?<eos> What magic have you done?<eos> Who was your master?<eos> I had no master, I taught myself... from books.<eos> Books?
.. what would be my reward?<eos> ~ Oh, my wishes are the most moderate things in the world.<eos> I simply wish to be able to aid you in your endeavours.<eos> To advise you in all matters and to guide your studies.<eos> Oh, and you must take care to tell the world that your greatest achievements are due, in large part, to me.<eos> W... Were I the sort of magician who entrusts his business to other persons then I would...<eos> But I fear, unfortunately, that I have no notion to employ you or indeed any other member of your race ever again.<eos> Well... this is most ungrateful indeed.<eos> Perhaps I would do better to speak to the other one.<eos> ~ The other who?

You having a problem with Vicky?<eos> She's good, Jack.<eos> But she's not you.<eos> You're not coming back, are you?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> My instinct would be to run, take off, go somewhere and start over, become someone new.<eos> That is what you did, Jack.<eos> Except I didn't run away.<eos> I ran to something...<eos> My son...
That's what I'll appeal to.<eos> You'll be outnumbered, outgunned, alone.<eos> - I can handle it.<eos> - If you can't, you're dead.<eos> If I can't... We're dead.<eos> [cell phone beeps] [gun cocks] I love you.<eos> And if this ends in tragedy, It will be because we were fighting back.<eos> Victor Dobrynin.<eos> It's a nice place.<eos> My compliments.
It's better than millions.<eos> So, for sake of peace... My answer is no.<eos> Black dagger will happen.<eos> You cannot kill the Rezident.<eos> And because you know about Black Dagger<eos> And you're working against it... You will die.<eos> I'm sorry you couldn't see things my way.<eos> Victor... [man shuddering, grunting]<eos> No, no, please. You are alive for one reason... To deliver a message.<eos> To who?

- There's no bargaining.<eos> - I'm not. It's not for me.<eos> I want protection for my family.<eos> You know the SVR will stop at nothing to get to me.<eos> All right, I'll tell brock to put a protective detail On your parents' home.<eos> I'll sell it as surveillance, in case you go back.<eos> - What did you find?<eos> - Oleg zhulov.<eos> The guy who spilled the beans about Black Dagger<eos> To irina semovetskaya?
(grunting) Watch it!<eos> Trying to mow.<eos> The city's making me do this.<eos> Hey, neighboreeno.<eos> (groans) Maude and I know how hard it is to be dealt a pair of little jokers.<eos> Daddy, may we please go tuck ourselves in for naps now?<eos> Now, you know you can't tuck yourselves in till you're 18.<eos> Go get Mommy.<eos> (humming happily) I'm sorry you had to witness that.<eos> Me, too.
Sorry, I've been watching a lot of Sherlock.<eos> Knock it off, boy. I don't have any meat for you.<eos> Get down!<eos> Wait!<eos> Santa's Little Helper was in the yard last night when the smoker was stolen, but he didn't make a peep.<eos> Why?<eos> "Natural Peanut Butter."<eos> What if someone gave this to the dog so he'd be licking instead of barking while they took the smoker? !<eos> You got a clue, boy!<eos> A clue!
I don't...<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Which one, like, the anger vibe or the animosity vibe?<eos> - I - don't have any drugs.<eos> Who said anything about drugs, dude?<eos> I can't just walk in here and tell my favorite bass player of all time, which is what...<eos> Bam texted me 30 seconds ago.<eos> I know you have pills in one of these bags here, man, so don't tell me that you don't?<eos> They're prescription pills prescribed by my doctor<eos> - for very specific reasons.
You with us?<eos> We haven't heard a lot from you, Alex.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I'm afraid the truth about how I'm feeling wouldn't be very helpful.<eos> This is the right place for you to speak your truth.<eos> And the right time.<eos> Honestly, I'm angry.<eos> I mean, I don't understand, Scarlett.<eos> It's like you're trying to hurt me.<eos> Us.
Be right back.<eos> Holden, I've brought you an apple juice and an orange juice.<eos> Wasn't sure which one...<eos> Holden?<eos> Holden!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> I need my mommy.<eos> Baby, I am your mommy.<eos> My other mommy.
A friend.<eos> My name's Alex.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Just some stupid guy with a big hard-on.<eos> We were trying to find our purpose.<eos> So you're not upset because he's dead?<eos> Killing him was nothing.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> I sort of feel sorry for him.<eos> Me, too.
This is wrong.<eos> I don't want to kill anymore.<eos> They made me kill my parents.<eos> Duh!<eos> We ate all our parents; that's why nobody's looking for us.<eos> I miss my mom.<eos> Madeline, it's been, like, four days.<eos> Your spots are coming back.<eos> You have to drink.<eos> All of you.
Three people died and they dismiss - because of a technicality.<eos> - The system, man.<eos> March was right.<eos> The law had nothing to do with justice.<eos> John!<eos> You're a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Why the glum face?<eos> A splash of brown plaid will set you right.<eos> He would have been ten today.<eos> My boy.
He's doing drugs again.<eos> This is the job you signed up for.<eos> This could really screw up his life.<eos> And his last drug test had come in clean, but given this new allegation by the "Boston Post," he will be tested again.<eos> - How's it feel to make news?<eos> - It feels...<eos> Fricking great!<eos> That's how.<eos> How's it going today, John?<eos> The usual?
You know what that means?<eos> No coffee.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> You are refusing to serve me because I wrote an article reporting the truth?<eos> - I don't serve traitors.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> - I'm filing a complaint.<eos> - Of course you are, 'cause you're a nark.<eos> Next.<eos> - Regular. - Ugh!
Stiles.<eos> Yes. Okay, we followed him out here.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> That I'm a stalker, huh?<eos> That I'm crazy, totally paranoid?<eos> None of this is new information.<eos> Now you're gonna try to at least give him the benefit of the doubt?<eos> I give people the benefit of the doubt.<eos> I've given a lot of benefit to a lot of people.<eos> Like Derek?
It's a lion with a goat coming out of its back and a tail that ends in the head of a snake.<eos> That's right, Sydney.<eos> Do you want to read us the full Wikipedia entry off your phone?<eos> But that does get us into the next topic of mutation.<eos> As you know from the reading, DNA is a fragile molecule.<eos> Isn't it, Scott?<eos> Or did you miss last night's assigned reading?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Kind of or yes?<eos> Mostly yes.
Well, it's about time.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, hey, you're making some change.<eos> 22 years later, but I accept your apology.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oh, give me a goddamn break.<eos> She slept with everybody, plus she was way into Johnny.<eos> Who said she was into Johnny?<eos> She did.<eos> To who?

I've nothing to say.<eos> Don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I can tell you what you need to know.<eos> "The finding of river corpses, or floaters as they are colloquially known, "whether of natural or unnatural origin, "is not an unusual phenomenon in the working life of Wapping's river police.<eos> "But the discovery last week of a most singular example of that watery species "has caused no little consternation.<eos> "Even amongst those stalwarts of public service.<eos> "For unlike its more ordinary brethren, "this particular example appears to have been derived not from one "but from numerous victims,<eos> "All of which raises the question, why on the eve of the Anatomy Act, "has the disclosure of this monstrous artefact "been suppressed for over a week.<eos> "What public interest is being served by denying Londoners "the knowledge of a diabolical surgeon in their midst, "acting in apparent imitation of Mary Shelley's infamous madman,<eos> "Victor Frankenstein.
It could be.<eos> Or a warning.<eos> Might even be a call to arms.<eos> It could mean, "Come here, they're vulnerable, help yourself."<eos> Wait a minute, though.<eos> Wait a minuet. You know what this means?<eos> It means that they're not a natural phenomenon.<eos> It means that someone is deliberately getting people killed, hijacking their souls and turning them into transmitters.<eos> What do the coordinates lead TO, though?<eos> - To us?

Fashion has become toxic here at Wagstaff.<eos> Believe it or not, even I have been the recipient of what some people call a "fashion thrashing'."<eos> (urinating) Wha...<eos> What?<eos> ! Wh-What?<eos> "More like sweater mess"?<eos> That night, I was upset.<eos> But instead of lashing out in anger, I turned to the needle.<eos> That's right.<eos> The knitting needle.
Newspaper?<eos> 'We have now been cleared for takeoff.<eos> 'Please remain seated until the seatbelt sign has been turned off.'<eos> ~ Newspaper?
Oh, sorry, go on.<eos> ~ Frank decides to take me off the job and send me to Buckingham Palace to test security as a fake footman.<eos> Once I'm in, he tells the guards I'm a reporter who's lost his mind and is trying to get to the Queen.<eos> You're trying to tell me you haven't?<eos> I'm trying to tell you Frank is dirty, he tried to set me up.<eos> I got away by the skin of my teeth and the only reason I came here was to throw myself at the mercy of the one person in the world<eos> ~ I could...<eos> ~ Time's up.<eos> ~ .. trust.<eos> You.
I might have missed a wing, but it doesn't seem to have a toilet.<eos> That is where you're wrong, old son.<eos> Nice.<eos> And can you point me in the direction of the shower?<eos> ~ The bucket?<eos> ~ All mod cons.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> ~ Great. Shall I put the kettle on?<eos> ~ You're holding it.<eos> Cordless.
If there's one thing I'm good at, it's finding parrots.<eos> That's if there's one thing I'm good at.<eos> And trust me, if there is, it's finding parrots.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But as well as being the most annoying person you will ever meet, he is the best investigator I have ever worked with.<eos> ~ Much as I hate to say it, Woody is your man.<eos> ~ Thanks, B.<eos> ~ We'll split the fee 70/30.<eos> ~ 80/40.<eos> Deal. Right.
And what is in here?<eos> This is for you and the lady at the front desk, you naughty man.<eos> I cannot condemn you, I have done worse.<eos> I just sometimes... I sleep at the surgery, that's all.<eos> I'm having a bit of trouble at home.<eos> ~ You're married?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Me also.<eos> Oh, what is this?<eos> Piracetam.
~ Money.<eos> Damn.<eos> I was going to say money, I panicked.<eos> Delightful Don stole the pensions of half the western world.<eos> I'm going to find out where he keeps his money and I'm going to steal it back.<eos> I get it.<eos> Steal from the rich and give to the poor.<eos> ~ Half right.<eos> ~ There was me thinking you were jealous<eos> ~ of Donald's relationship with his parrot.
Lorenza?<eos> GRUFFLY: Si!<eos> Blimey, how do you do that?<eos> Lorenza, have you cook-ed my sausages?<eos> She says they be ready in five minutes.<eos> Another close call for Employee Of The Month(! )<eos> But I think we have a winner.<eos> Yum, yum.<eos> All right, Bev?<eos> Usual?
Fine.<eos> Right up until the point I had to jump off the ferry to be rescued by a hen party on a giant banana.<eos> ~ Sounds pretty good.<eos> ~ Yeah, it was pretty good.<eos> You look like you could do with a Jaeger-tini.<eos> Dive in.<eos> Here you go, my son.<eos> Get your laughing gear around that.<eos> Not for breakfast, thanks.<eos> Oh, well. Your loss.
I thought you'd never ask.<eos> Ready?<eos> Three, two, one...<eos> And you're back with me.<eos> Any requests?<eos> Si!<eos> Any other requests?<eos> Yes, er, "Great Fernando", I have one, tell the boss to give me a raise.<eos> You will give a significant raise to your tall, gormless barman.<eos> Who?
Over here! Choose my wife. See if it works on her.<eos> And sleep and act like a dog and leave.<eos> Amazing.<eos> The power of the mind.<eos> What about you, sir?<eos> No.<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, you owe it to yourself.<eos> And me.
♪ Oh, no<eos> CROWD: ♪ Oh, no<eos> ♪ Oh-h-h-h no<eos> CROWD: ♪ Oh-h-h-h no<eos> ~ ♪ Oh, no ~ CROWD: ♪ Oh, no. ♪<eos> You've got the wrong guy.<eos> Why would I push Elton Juan off a balcony onto his head?<eos> Cos I saw how he treated you.<eos> You think I killed him because I was jealous?<eos> Of that two bit copycat lookie-likey?
Ooh. That's clever.<eos> I work with what you give me.<eos> I'm gonna take you down.<eos> With what... your crutches?<eos> Can we get back to the dead guy?<eos> You said that you found someone who could tell us why Richie missed work yesterday.<eos> Yes.<eos> I pulled his phone and financials.<eos> There were no charges on his credit card yesterday, but he made a call... the only call he made from his cell all day.<eos> To whom?
Work injury?<eos> Medical malpractice?<eos> We're here about the murder of Richie the Pitbull.<eos> Sure, I was at that diner last night.<eos> This urgent meeting that the two of you had... - what was it about?<eos> - I'd hardly call it a meeting.<eos> I went in to get some pecan pie, and I saw him sitting there.<eos> So the meeting wasn't planned?<eos> Well, maybe he was planning on meeting someone else, but when I saw him in that booth, he was alone, - and we got into it.<eos> - About what?
You will spy for me as a team. Both you and Stahma.<eos> I bet you're thinking there must be a catch.<eos> Well...<eos> Bebe.<eos> "The ship began crumbling around them "in a violent monsoon of terra-rock.<eos> "The Kaziri was in self-destruct mode!<eos> "Wounded, bleeding, there was no way "Nolan could make it out on his own.<eos> "So Irisa hoisted him over her shoulders...<eos> "As his hot, human blood mingled with hers, "she pulled the man she called 'Father' to safety.<eos> "To freedom.
What happened to the Omec ships? They were sabotaged.<eos> Our leadership told us that your vessels had a design flaw.<eos> The Votanis Collective sent saboteurs, Indogene shape-takers, on a suicide mission.<eos> The Votans feared that the Omecs would steal this paradise, this Earth, out from under them.<eos> They set bombs, destroying our ships from within.<eos> But you survived.<eos> My ship, the Tsuroz, was lucky. When the explosion happened, my daughter and I were on a space walk.<eos> Our vacuum suits protected us, we were able to repair the hull.<eos> The others on the ship, however, died from exposure.<eos> Oh, Rayetso.
I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Before I jump to conclusions, does "swamped at the club" mean something other than the obvious?<eos> It's...<eos> Tony, um...<eos> The thing with Louise...<eos> It's not a traditional marriage.<eos> Then why lie to her?<eos> This isn't how I work, Nolan.<eos> I won't be the other man in someone's marriage.<eos> Okay, I just...
Statistically, it's unlikely he will have a wicked outing.<eos> Wicked! Ha-ha!<eos> I'm telling you, it's so great living with a genius.<eos> You are very fortunate to have me.<eos> I'll get Christine ready for preschool.<eos> All right.<eos> Christine...<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Listen, I gotta make a bet.<eos> Arastoo!
I'm at this place, Jasmine and Rose, and I'm telling you, they have the best orange blossom ice cream you've ever had.<eos> Well, Hamid must be feeling pretty well if you're getting him ice cream.<eos> The lab results just came back.<eos> Not one glioblastoma.<eos> So he's in full remission?<eos> That's amazing.<eos> It also means, one week from today, I will be coming home.<eos> I am so happy.<eos> For your brother, for you... and for me, because I've missed you so much.<eos> Arastoo?
There's this guy...<eos> I don't want to scare you, but I think he's following me.<eos> Have they dug up your record?<eos> I have no record.<eos> Officially.<eos> Hold on, I think I can lose him.<eos> Arastoo, are you there?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> I don't know who that was, but...<eos> Arastoo?
I don't want to scare you, but I think he's following me.<eos> Have they dug up your record?<eos> I have no record.<eos> Officially.<eos> Hold on, I think I can lose him.<eos> Arastoo, are you there?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> I don't know who that was, but...<eos> Arastoo?<eos> Arastoo!
And if you brought him to an abandoned surgical center rather than a real morgue, that means you're operating outside the law.<eos> It is unwise to threaten me.<eos> This is not a threat.<eos> This is an offer.<eos> We're here to help you.<eos> You already have one forensic anthropologist.<eos> I can offer you a great coroner in Dr. Saroyan.<eos> Yeah, and an entire Jeffersonian forensic team.<eos> And the FBI in exchange for Arastoo after we solve your murder.<eos> Arastoo!
Swap places.<eos> Are you listening now?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, love.<eos> And, Chrissie, I'm sorry too for what I said about you and...<eos> ..your lady friend.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Lady friend?
Someone else placed a bomb on this van.<eos> Maybe the van's owners have an idea how this happened.<eos> Well, Demir Malki was hit with shrapnel from the blast.<eos> He's in surgery.<eos> And his brother Dogan is in custody at the FBI's Undercover Task Force offices in Mar Vista.<eos> Let's go talk to Dogan.<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> I got one stop to make.<eos> How far back should I go?<eos> All the way back.
He planted a bomb inside of a van, and then he blew them up.<eos> My uncle?<eos> You're sure it was him?<eos> Yeah, he confessed.<eos> He also said that he has another attack planned, and that it's gonna be carried out in the next two hours.<eos> which is why I'm here.<eos> So, if you can tell us anything, if you know anything that can help us... now is the time.<eos> I do want to help.<eos> Okay.<eos> My uncle.
Naveed was your responsibility... and you failed.<eos> It all makes sense now.<eos> That's why you've never gone to visit him since he was arrested.<eos> It's why you can't bear to speak with him on the phone.<eos> He reminds you of your failure.<eos> You can't stand to face the monster you've created.<eos> No!<eos> Or maybe you can't face yourself.<eos> Maybe you've been lying this entire time.<eos> But not just to me.
With a car full of explosives.<eos> I'm just saying, give Sam time to do his job.<eos> Detective Deeks, if that truck reaches our driveway, I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> The man who put you up to this-- this is for his own personal vendetta.<eos> This has nothing to do with your beliefs.<eos> He's taken advantage of you.<eos> You two have a mother, right?<eos> What will she think if you do this?<eos> You got your whole lives ahead of you.<eos> On my mark.
Kaleidoscope and facial rec firing on all cylinders.<eos> Kensi and Deeks en route to Malee's house.<eos> What about Blaze?<eos> Comms are dead, not responding to texts.<eos> Where's the safe, Wyatt?<eos> It's in the bedroom down the hall, on the left.<eos> Check the kitchen.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad?<eos> Sorry,
I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Lot of good "sorry" does me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look... At... Me.<eos> There she is. First casualty of your misguided mission.<eos> But what's another human life to you?<eos> Anything's worth it, as long as you two make it out alive.<eos> And how's that search going?<eos> Any closer to a cure?
Making deals with witches, opening Pandora's box down there?<eos> You're the reckless one.<eos> You'll do anything to keep clinging to that doomed brother of yours.<eos> How many more will die, Sammy?<eos> You know it.<eos> You have to be stopped!<eos> And the only one who can stop you is you!<eos> Do it, Sammy!<eos> End this farce once and for all!<eos> Vanesce!
What are you saying?<eos> Nothing you don't already know.<eos> This is where you wanna be -- your happy place.<eos> And you don't really wanna leave.<eos> Rowena: "Arcam confutare..."<eos> "To silence the box..."<eos> Mm.<eos> "Sitim restinguere..."<eos> "Slake its thirst..."<eos> "Sanguine nostrum."
Did you check her credit cards?<eos> They wouldn't send me her records.<eos> Okay, I know you need to be somewhere far away from all of us, but let me get my laptop.<eos> I'll teach you how to hack into her credit card records.<eos> It'll help you get a lead on your mom.<eos> Show me, but then I'm gone.<eos> Hey, listen,<eos> I don't think these guys snooping around are F.B.I.<eos> You know, I-I think they're -- they're hunters.<eos> I-I'm sorry.
Maybe you should stay here.<eos> So you wanna bench me again?<eos> Hmm.<eos> All right. Fine.<eos> I'll stay and babysit.<eos> But if anything happens, anything at all...<eos> Yeah, we'll call you.<eos> No fighting.<eos> Yeah, tell her that.<eos> Both of you.
There's still no trace of her.<eos> Well, if the Winchesters don't have the book, she's got it.<eos> So if you're so worried that your cousin will fail, report in with Eldon and back his effort.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Wow.<eos> Hey.<eos> Well, you look like crap on toast.<eos> I just haven't... really been sleeping well.<eos> There's a woman you haven't mentioned?<eos> A woman?
I thought it was our only chance to get you free of the Mark, so I grabbed it.<eos> I made it real clear how I felt.<eos> You ever consider that?<eos> Dean, listen...<eos> And then you pulled Cass into it.<eos> And Charlie.<eos> Charlie loves you, Dean.<eos> We all love you.<eos> You're gonna give me what's mine.<eos> Mine and my family's.
Watch out!<eos> Get back!<eos> Everybody, back! Get back!<eos> Clark?<eos> Parrish?<eos> Clark?<eos> I'm telling you guys, we've been down this one before.<eos> What the hell are we doing?<eos> We're running up and down this place.<eos> Up and down tunnels.
Beth!<eos> Malia, if you need to use the restroom, it's one at time.<eos> And if you're planning on leaving class, I'd consider your recent drop in grades.<eos> She needs help.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You know what's going on. Don't you?<eos> I know that I'd like to see you get through senior year with passing grades.<eos> You know more than that.<eos> I think you need to focus more on your schoolwork.<eos> All of you.
Moving fast.<eos> Copy, what's your speed?<eos> 45 to 50.<eos> Advise that suspect is too large to be human.<eos> 10-4, Unit 5, back off and maintain eyes.<eos> Dispatch to all units, be on the lookout for suspicious bipedal animal.<eos> Unit 8 to Dispatch, advise coming up on Taft, animal is back on all fours and...<eos> Holy...<eos> Unit 8, it's Stilinski. Report.<eos> 10-4, Sheriff.
What is it?<eos> I need to check on something.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> It's not working, is it?<eos> She should be showing signs of improvement.<eos> Hayden?<eos> Call Val...<eos> My sister... Valerie.
See what else you can find out.<eos> Detective West, sir.<eos> Yes, Officer...?<eos> Spivot.<eos> Patty Spivot.<eos> Captain Singh mentioned there may be positions available on your anti-meta-human task force.<eos> Yeah, everybody quit.<eos> There is no task force anymore.<eos> Well, I know someone who's interested in being on it.<eos> Me.
I think you two have a lot in common.<eos> She talks about you all the time.<eos> She's so proud.<eos> - I'm thrilled that we're finally meeting.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> ! - Don't be rude.<eos> - 35.<eos> He's young enough to be my brother.<eos> Does he have access to your financial information,<eos> - your pension fund?
Because your uncle Stefan compelled you to forget to keep you a secret from your other uncle...<eos> Damon...<eos> After he killed your parents, and you would have shared their fate had it not been for your other uncle.<eos> That's who you were taking me to?<eos> Well, actually, no.<eos> The good brother recently went bad, and I was hoping to leave you in the care of the bad brother, who actually is less bad now than the good brother. I don't understand any of this. I can try repeating it, luv, but it won't be any clearer the second time.<eos> Look. You wanted to know who that woman is?<eos> She's the most dreadful person I've ever met.<eos> Unh!<eos> No sick passengers!
Everyone's dead.<eos> Where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She told me to come find you.<eos> She wants you to feed on me to complete your transition.<eos> After feeding on the charlatan,<eos> I searched all over that ship for that woman, but she was gone.<eos> Her promises of a new life and a new family were lies.<eos> She made me a monster and then abandoned me.<eos> For what reason?
- According to a neighbour I spoke to, it had quite a few incarnations over the years -- private house, British Rail records office, hostel, DHSS...<eos> So this is either a very shallow grave, or, if the body was put here before the cellar was built, a very deep one.<eos> Except we don't know what the ground level was when he was buried.<eos> What would be your gut feeling?<eos> Richard III or five years ago?<eos> - Could be talking 5,000 years!<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Bones can survive incredibly well in certain types of soil.<eos> - But we do know he died very young.<eos> - By modern standards.
Oh. Thanks, Mr Wilton.<eos> - Put the kettle on, love.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Night, miss.<eos> - Night, love.<eos> Hello?<eos> Here we are.<eos> I know you'd never think of it like this, but...<eos> I reckon he was lucky.<eos> Your son.
No idea.<eos> They wouldn't tell me.<eos> Very old case, I guess, but er... hey, I put in a good word for you so you should be all right.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Yeah, thanks.<eos> 'Anyway, they wanted it pronto...' .. so I'm sure they'll be in touch soon.<eos> Yeah. OK.<eos> Thanks, Geoff.<eos> - Er, yeah.<eos> - 'Well, night then, Robert.'<eos> Yes, night.
So, like you, I'm... I'm... I'm struggling.<eos> Are you sure it was your husband, Claire?<eos> Am I sure who was my husband?<eos> You said, you think you saw your husband putting a body into the ground.<eos> Are you sure it was him?<eos> When did I say that?<eos> Why don't you just tell me who it is, Eric?<eos> How can I tell you who it is, if I didn't know he was down there?<eos> I didn't say it was a man.<eos> Oh, please.
- What would Jeanette need money for?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I need an advance.<eos> - You got 28,000 yesterday.<eos> You've gambled it away.<eos> - We have an old house in Skåne. - Yeah.<eos> Jeanette told me about it.<eos> That's why I need an advance.<eos> You've gambled the house away.<eos> To whom?

I don't know the time of death.<eos> There.<eos> I was in the cemetery.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I'd gotten an email telling me to come.<eos> There was someone who claimed to have information about the case but no one came.<eos> - And you went alone?<eos> - Yes. It was a demand from the sender.<eos> But you said something.<eos> To your supervisor, for example.
- (Man) Hands up!<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Move over to the car!<eos> - Hands up! Hands up!<eos> - Get over to the car.<eos> (Halstead) Drop the bag.<eos> Get on the ground.<eos> Knees on the ground.<eos> Hands above your head.<eos> Up on the red car.
I got a plan.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> And you...<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> You know that?<eos> Alvey.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I'm sorry I put you through this.<eos> Me too.
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - I'm in pain.<eos> I can't fucking take it anymore.<eos> - Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> - I'm ready.<eos> - I want to die.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> Fuck no!
Why?<eos> My mom.<eos> Fucked up.<eos> Dude, I'm sorry.<eos> That sucks.<eos> Man, I want to get so fucked up right now.<eos> How 'bout tomorrow?<eos> Done.<eos> May peace be with you.<eos> And also with you.
You need anything?<eos> Really?<eos> Sure.<eos> I haven't washed my hair for days.<eos> Come on into the bathroom.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You see my funny note in the pill bottle?<eos> Yeah, I left you a funny response.<eos> Brought you more tea.<eos> Christy!
When they capture him, I'll arrange for an interview.<eos> - Oh, and if he says no?<eos> - He...<eos> Wait.<eos> While you two work this out, we still need a wolf to examine.<eos> We saw one a couple hundred yards back.<eos> It's just been shot.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No more bats.<eos> At least not in here.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> We reduced the size of the clot considerably, but unfortunately, it was too little too late.<eos> The damage was too severe.<eos> The child slipped away during surgery.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> ♪ Nearer my God ♪<eos> ♪ To thee ♪<eos> ♪ Nearer ♪<eos> ♪ To thee ♪
The Honourable Hugh Atkins.<eos> The trial judge?<eos> So the Crown's contention, if you can credit it, is that he wrote the poisonous letters himself.<eos> ~ They must have entered a motive?<eos> ~ To attract attention.<eos> I ask you, you've never met a shyer lad.<eos> ~ Extraordinary.<eos> ~ Ah, unbelievable.<eos> ~ It does seem unlikely.<eos> ~ Unlikely?
Yes, I suppose we will.<eos> Sir Arthur, if I may be so bold.<eos> You had your doubts before but now you're struck by the timing of his arrival so soon after our violent intruder.<eos> Compounding this, mud spattered his boots and his trousers as it does mine.<eos> Conclusion - he's the man I chased into the woods<eos> ~ and the brute that bloodied your nose.<eos> ~ Well? Three things factor against it -<eos> ~ his poor eyesight, his limping gait and his honest face.<eos> ~ His face? I heard him tell his story, Woodie and I believed it.<eos> Every damn word.
~ You're hurting me.<eos> ~ Oh, no I'm not. I'm not hurting you.<eos> If you want Sergeant Upton to hurt you, all you have to do is ask.<eos> I'm going to be a solicitor.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> A so-li-ci-tor.<eos> What a big word for a little mongrel like you.<eos> You think you'll be a solicitor if Sergeant Upton says you won't?<eos> So you believe Upton targeted George to avenge his sister's dismissal?<eos> At the very least.
~ No, we can walk.<eos> ~ There's no lock.<eos> ~ What are we waiting for?<eos> ~ Sir Arthur, I really think - ~ Ssh!<eos> From the wounds on the animals I'd say we're not looking for an ordinary knife or blade. Rather something unusual and specific.<eos> Cuts only the skin and not the gut.<eos> I'll er, go check upstairs.<eos> No, no, no. Sir Arthur...<eos> Sir Arthur, why don't I conduct this search?<eos> ~ Alone?
The families?<eos> The wife's family.<eos> Whatever took it into their heads.<eos> Your daughter insists upon marrying a Parsee, can't be talked out of it.<eos> And what do you do?<eos> You give the fellow a living in deepest Staffordshire.<eos> And no doubt his patrons saw it to demonstrate the universality of the Anglican Church.<eos> Hm. Please.<eos> And then to introduce two half-caste children<eos> ~ into the neighbourhood.
He nursed a grudge against Fred Brookes.<eos> Harry nursed one against you and together they went around settling their scores.<eos> But Fred Brookes didn't serve a sentence of three years for a crime he didn't commit.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> I think I need some air, Woodie.<eos> I'm gonna walk.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> ~ If you're sure?<eos> ~ Yeah, I am.<eos> Waterloo, please.
All right. All right.<eos> - Ricky! Ricky!<eos> - All right, listen.<eos> Look, look. You did a good job.<eos> Brandon, you did a good job today, man.<eos> Way to keep your head up.<eos> Who's next? I got you.<eos> - Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!<eos> Wait a minute. Y'all, wait a second. What do you want it to say?<eos> "To Shawn.
I should be able to confirm that.<eos> Doctor... this may have something to do with the Archibald Brooks' case.<eos> I'll see what I can find.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> And how do you suggest we proceed?<eos> We ask around.<eos> The door to the coal shed was open to the yard.<eos> Somebody saw something.<eos> And you think they'll talk to us?<eos> A homosexual and a disgraced police officer?
A crumble of the crumble?<eos> Caroline won't let me eat anything because of my big photo shoot.<eos> [sighs] Hurry!<eos> No chewing, no enjoying.<eos> Just swallow.<eos> Spit that out!<eos> No!<eos> I said spit that out!<eos> You're a model now!<eos> Shame on you!
Well, there's always house calls.<eos> Oh, you're serious. Carolyn, i would like to move this along.<eos> The sooner we can get this place back to normal, the better.<eos> Are you asking me to release a patient before he's ready?<eos> Of course not. But we all know that being ready - ...is subject to interpretation.<eos> - Well, as his surgeon, It's my interpretation that he's ready to be released When i determine he's ready to be released.<eos> Of course.<eos> So, tomorrow, then.<eos> Thank you, carolyn.<eos> Always a pleasure.
This case is good.<eos> It's right.<eos> Huck, Jake, all of the people you've hurt and tormented over the years, they want justice.<eos> They deserve justice.<eos> And that's the only way the Republic stands.<eos> Justice is, in fact, the point of the Republic.<eos> And I may care about him...<eos> Mm. But as you said, I will never allow a person to get in the way of what I know to be right.<eos> Tomorrow, the world as we know it changes.<eos> For the better.
What's wrong?<eos> You have to do something for me, okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> I have to get off the ship.<eos> I need you to get me an abortion.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - No one.
I used to think he was making them up.<eos> Thought you were some kind of myth...<eos> Till I met you.<eos> Yeah, he wants you to think that.<eos> Wants you to wonder.<eos> He talks about you differently than he talks about the others.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Like he misses you.<eos> He was the closest thing to a father I ever had.<eos> Me too.
- Tom is ok.<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> Stop saying he's ok.<eos> I'm telling you he's not.<eos> What about tomorrow?<eos> I'm doing dubbing.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> I have a read-through, lunch, and I'm meeting my agent.<eos> Can you call your mother?<eos> Or your sister?
You got to let it go.<eos> There's too much at stake.<eos> Alex. Hey, did you make it back okay?<eos> Michelle said you didn't answer her texts.<eos> He was escorting his own cutout.<eos> I let him get away.<eos> Fadi's dead.<eos> I screwed up everything.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Darkness.
One more.<eos> My wife texted. If I'm not there for bedtime, she'll have my head.<eos> Is that Sacha?<eos> My God, he's huge.<eos> Time passes, huh?<eos> He plays linebacker for his football team.<eos> Not hockey.<eos> Treason, I know.<eos> - Buh-bye.<eos> - You as well.
So we get eight hours of cops scouring the city.<eos> We get to use their eyes too.<eos> Look, I have to go.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been lying to you.<eos> About what?<eos> Everything.
Everything about you is real to me.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I do.<eos> I know that... how your hair falls in front of your face like now, but you never move it, because you'll only have to move it again.<eos> I know that you blow on your coffee three times before you take your first sip.<eos> I know that you crinkle your nose when someone pays you a compliment.<eos> I know that when you kiss your tattoo to remember your sister, you blink twice to hold back the tears.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> You have to turn yourself in.<eos> - To who?
Yes. There can be no doubt.<eos> It is the countess Anne told me of.<eos> And as her ship bears down upon us from the wine dark sea, the boiling increases.<eos> Oh, I should have known.<eos> The way the hag kissed you... that is the German witch's way.<eos> It's one of her signatures.<eos> - Calm yourself.<eos> - Calm myself?<eos> You never heard or heeded the stories the elders told, never interested yourself in history.<eos> No, only in the future.
Then guard me well.<eos> Haul in the sail!<eos> Like brass to fire, like stick to flame, heed my words, know my name.<eos> Faster than light, dark corners seek.<eos> Lick to flame, my vengeance wreak.<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire below!<eos> All hands on deck!<eos> Fire in the hold!<eos> All hands!

For the future of the grand rite, let us trade words for now, not wounds.<eos> I will admit you're impressive for a common Essex witch.<eos> Has our hive not survived when so many others have perished?<eos> Yes.<eos> But your strength is also your weakness.<eos> You are, as you said, a hive filled with lovely, little bees, but no true queen.<eos> You are in reality mere sister drones, little, meek equals whose power is shared.<eos> Why, you're like the foot of a pyramid.<eos> But you will make a fine and mighty base for one more naturally designed to rule.<eos> You?
Suit yourself.<eos> I'm fetching my boy from his nurse.<eos> You're welcome to walk with me.<eos> I thought you said we were going to see your nurse?<eos> Her lodging is upstairs.<eos> - John.<eos> - Bill.<eos> Porter?<eos> Thank you, and another one for my friend, Mr...?<eos> Nightingale.
No, I just wanted to bring this back.<eos> Tell her it was delicious and sweet of her to take pity on us,<eos> - culinarily*** speaking.<eos> - I will tell her.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, I should probably thank you.<eos> Nick's helping Anthony work out to get ready for the run.<eos> - Me?<eos> - I know he's doing it mostly just to get out of being grounded and get out of the house at night.<eos> - At night?
Everyone has.<eos> You're a us attorney.<eos> I am.<eos> Perhaps you could help me with a witness for a case that I'm prosecuting.<eos> Ashley?<eos> Yeah, she's staying at Grey house.<eos> - I know.<eos> - She's a witness?<eos> She was until she skipped town a few days back.<eos> Unfortunately,
So, you'll be leaving soon, going back to New York?<eos> My plans might change.<eos> Well, what on earth could Middleton have to lure you away from the big city?<eos> Family, of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> So, we still on for tonight?<eos> We have a date.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> It was a pleasure talking to you.<eos> Oh, you too.
What do you want me to tell you, John?<eos> I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> What made you remember?<eos> I died.<eos> I had a-- a problem.<eos> Michael took me to his grandfather's.<eos> He said he could help.<eos> He gave me, like, a--<eos> My son took you to meet his grandfather?<eos> Yeah, Virgil.
Let's go say do svidan'ya.<eos> - Morning, all.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Nadine tells me I have a very full schedule today.<eos> Uh, yes, we're starting with the Russian war games off the Alaskan coast.<eos> They began this morning.<eos> A flotilla of some 50 different vessels and aircraft.<eos> They're technically within their rights.<eos> The maneuvers and test firings are taking place on international waters and outside American airspace.<eos> Still insultingly close to our northern borders.
Tell the Russians they have two hours.<eos> Two hours for that sub to be gone.<eos> Or we take it out ourselves.<eos> By whatever means necessary.<eos> Which the Russians will view as an act of war.<eos> And this isn't?<eos> Can't say we didn't warn them.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> So we're gonna pay tribute to Mr. Helsinger just like nothing's wrong.<eos> Yes, ma'am.
The victor.<eos> But St. Nick represents compassion.<eos> He's the one you turn to when times are tough.<eos> Of course, we've trivialized him in the West, made him into the precursor of our modern-day Santa Claus.<eos> What is your point?<eos> Thought that maybe we would light a candle together.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm in no need of miracles.<eos> You may be.<eos> Not me.
'Tis a great honour for me to aid you in the trial of this witch.<eos> Indeed, Richard, but use not the word witch until she hath made her confession.<eos> We must give the hag a fair hearing.<eos> Witch, witch!<eos> She must be here.<eos> Shall I let them in, your honour?<eos> Very well.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Want to see her burn!<eos> Order!

She called a burner phone.<eos> So that's a dead end.<eos> Actually, we caught a break.<eos> That same burner was used to call another burner phone that was seized in a drug bust two days later.<eos> The owner of that phone is serving ten to 15 in Cumberland.<eos> So is he willing to give up his burner buddy?<eos> DOJ is making him an offer as we speak.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You keep me informed, okay?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.
We have to move fast.<eos> Let's get ready to log-roll her.<eos> All right, everybody get into place.<eos> Watch those I.V. lines.<eos> We need sterile towels.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna pull the frame.<eos> - Warren, you catch her, okay?<eos> - On it.<eos> All right.<eos> On my count.
Not when there's work to be done.<eos> Listen, I, uh...<eos> About that...<eos> I brought the papers and an apology.<eos> You were right.<eos> It wasn't about you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Despite my reputation, I do know how to listen. Want to talk about it?<eos> Uh...
Caroline.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I missed me, too.<eos> Thank you for getting me back.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ok. Now, we got a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it.<eos> Elena, just have a drink.<eos> You're not going to pass out.<eos> Bonnie, the switch is on the left-hand side<eos> - on the back.
Leith.<eos> It's been weeks since we last spoke.<eos> I was beginning to think you were avoiding me.<eos> Because I was.<eos> I am.<eos> But Princess Claude insisted on a shopping trip to town.<eos> And what the princess wants, she gets.<eos> Can I just say how sorry I am, about the way things ended with us?<eos> How's business?<eos> Thanks to your generosity.
Quickly becoming<eos> Francis's right-hand man.<eos> No offense. None taken, but how is this my concern?<eos> Well, it concerns you in that you and I are still husband and wife.<eos> You said you'd grant me an annulment if the right man came along, and, well, he has.<eos> You're sure about him?<eos> Renaude? Sure as I can be.<eos> I'll talk to Francis.<eos> Good luck to you.<eos> You, too.
They all checked out.<eos> Perfectly.<eos> Too perfectly?<eos> A year ago, Liam was awarded an N.S.F. post-doctoral fellowship in emerging third world cultures.<eos> - Impressive.<eos> - And worrisome.<eos> Here's a picture of him receiving the award.<eos> You think it's him.<eos> It's hard to tell from the picture, but my gut says, "yes," and if there is even a chance...<eos> Flash drive.
You think we're gonna listen to you, Jim?<eos> You ran this town into the ground.<eos> No, Roger, I didn't.<eos> I risked everything to set you free from those cocoons.<eos> Because I love this town.<eos> And I'd do anything for it.<eos> I'll get you back on your feet.<eos> But first things first. We need answers.<eos> For you, for all of you.<eos> For my son.
I said it was my fault.<eos> Look, there's a lot of hurt people in there.<eos> Christine wants you to go in and help out.<eos> Eva.<eos> Barbie is suspicious.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Remind me again why we're lying to everyone.<eos> I'm doing this for your own good; you're not ready.<eos> For what?
Where did they take her?<eos> There's only so many rooms here.<eos> It's gonna be all good, okay, man?<eos> Anxious for the results.<eos> Where'd you get these bad boys?<eos> I gave them to him.<eos> Name says they're for "Jessie Gordon."<eos> Christine asked everyone to hand over their medications.<eos> To start a dispensary.<eos> Dispensary.
Or, you know, maybe it's...<eos> you know, not that.<eos> So you're telling me that those seizures that we had when we said "the pink stars are falling..." meant that we were prophesying the end of the world?<eos> Look...<eos> I probably have no idea what I'm talking about.<eos> Even if we survive whatever's infecting us, the whole world is gone.<eos> There's no future for us.<eos> We have nothing to look forward to.<eos> Maybe we should just join them.<eos> The kinship?
- Stop!<eos> - You are keeping me from doing my duty.<eos> Where are they going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But look at them.<eos> They look like ants marching in a line, doing whatever Queen Christine ordered them to.<eos> Just a bunch of mindless drones, only caring about her kinship.<eos> Don't let me get like that.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> All the way to the bitter, apocalyptic end.
Well, how the hell did he find us here?<eos> We met him at the school and we thought he was still human.<eos> Grab everything you can.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Now.<eos> Kyle.<eos> The rest are at Coggins' Funeral Home.<eos> Gather everyone you can and go there.<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> Christine.
Oh, and, Hektor?<eos> Don't get any ideas about double-crossing me.<eos> Hey, hold up.<eos> - Let me in!<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!<eos> Come on.<eos> She's kicking.<eos> Wow.<eos> Christine made it happen.<eos> With the help of some very young devoted women.
The government couldn't touch you.<eos> And those files?<eos> Just an insurance policy.<eos> I need to see my father again.<eos> You owe that to me.<eos> All right, Lily.<eos> If the cure works, I'll... I'll get us out.<eos> Eva?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You in pain?
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> Tony...<eos> Despite appearances...<eos> I can be pretty low-maintenance.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm sorry, Nolan.<eos> It wouldn't be fair to you or to me or to my little boy.<eos> Well, I wish I'd met you a year ago.<eos> Me too.
Yeah, the feds are embarrassed.<eos> Had no case without him.<eos> They didn't feel they want nobody to know the dead body popped up in the prosecutor's car.<eos> So I heard.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Andre!<eos> Welcome back to the Empire, son.<eos> Congratulations, Pop.<eos> You beat the rap.<eos> Yeah. Thanks to you.
I called this morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I really appreciate you coming home on your lunch break to help me with the nursery.<eos> - Thanks, babe. - No problem, baby.<eos> Thank you for carrying our boy.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Who's at the gate?<eos> Oh, that's Anika.<eos> She's actually coming over to see the nursery.<eos> Again? Yeah.
From here on out, I go by Hakeem.<eos> Think I'm in love, but we still homies, right?<eos> I still think you dope. So what did you have to tell me? ANIKA:<eos> Rhonda's pregnant.<eos> I've always wanted a grandson.<eos> Babies are like kryptonite for Lucious.<eos> Really.<eos> Where to? Loretha!<eos> Our sister Carol is on a bender.<eos> COOKIE:
My apologies for keeping you waiting.<eos> Please.<eos> It is an honor to be in your home... and a pleasure to see you again.<eos> May I introduce you to my son, His Royal Highness Prince Liam.<eos> - It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> - The pleasure is mine.<eos> I would like to present you with this handcrafted bow and arrow.<eos> The bow steady and true, like your father.<eos> The arrows strong and sure like the son.<eos> Alone... ineffective.
Page five.<eos> I'm glad you weren't.<eos> For more reasons than just the headline.<eos> - Thanks, Dad.<eos> - Fashion Week, eh?<eos> - Makes everyone crazy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I heard something like that.<eos> Son... I asked you here... because I know the effort you've been making.<eos> The dedication to the Crown.
What did we send over, Crystal?<eos> A chess board.<eos> Uh, made out of human teeth.<eos> Well, anyway, can I sit over there?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is it really made out of human teeth?<eos> So I thought I'd get together with you to talk before the crowds descended on you, you know what I mean?<eos> Everybody with their hands outstretched.<eos> "Me, me, me, me!"
It's something here.<eos> Alicia, you offered Finn the job because you like him and he's maybe even a good lawyer, but he doesn't do anything important for you.<eos> You mean he doesn't do anything important - for you.<eos> - Next time - say it to my face, jackass.<eos> - Oh, but I have said it to your face, Blanche, I have said it to your face.<eos> Stupid son of a bitch.<eos> Everything all right here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Giving Finn the job will be seen as a slap in the face by every senior attorney in your office who was passed over. Every woman.<eos> Every... African-American.
You killed Michelle.<eos> Now, here's my problem.<eos> The reason I can't put a bullet in your head is because you scrubbed her apartment, and disposed of the body,<eos> and that means at least one other person out there knows exactly what you know, and that's a threat to me and my employer.<eos> And that means we need to have... a different sort of conversation.<eos> Alex, who helped you clean the apartment?<eos> That's level one of pain.<eos> Timur here can take you all the way to ten.<eos> But no, wait I think you'd be dead by ten, right?<eos> Usually eight.
Stay, please.<eos> I can't.<eos> That's enough sex questions for now.<eos> Well, just explain why people want to have sex with animals.<eos> You've completed your detention.<eos> I hope you've all learned a little something About yourselves today,<eos> And i hope i never have to see you here again.<eos> You're dismissed.<eos> hey hey hey hey So, where do we go from here?<eos> Home.
I can get you there a lot faster than the bus.<eos> Come on, it's late, all right?<eos> I just want to help you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> Where to?<eos> Oh, you can just take a left up here.<eos> So, um, how old's your little boy?<eos> 6.<eos> Oh, mine, too.
Is that ok?<eos> Daniel, we know you're in there--<eos> Get back!<eos> I've got hostages!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> They'll kill you.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Just let us go.<eos> Let you go?<eos> To them?
Your days...<eos> On the bright side, at least I won't be in prison.<eos> Well, that's a plus.<eos> I take it you haven't dated an ex-con before?<eos> Mm, the whole bad boy thing never really appealed to me.<eos> Well, except when Marky Mark was in those underwear ads.<eos> Joelle you can trust me.<eos> I know I can.<eos> I'm just still getting used to all this.<eos> To you.

Ark...<eos> Arkady.<eos> Arkady!<eos> Interrogation room.<eos> Now.<eos> I feel like I'm talking to my kid.<eos> But this is so much more comfortable.<eos> You've got couch, canoe... coffee...<eos> It's fresh?<eos> Double shot.
How much?<eos> Well, for you, uh, 15% good cop discount.<eos> Okay?<eos> - What is happening?<eos> - You heard the man.<eos> I get a 15% off good cop discount.<eos> This thing is vintage.<eos> You can't find these online.<eos> You know who's gonna love it?<eos> My little brother.
Mm, no.<eos> Uh, or Beth Laws?<eos> Ah, um... That rings a very, very vague bell.<eos> But no, not really.<eos> How about Frank or Frankie Cross?<eos> Nope.<eos> Sorry, I'm not been very helpful, am I?<eos> That's not a problem.<eos> Uh, Jo Jo?<eos> No, sorry.
Not a lot, actually, for your dad.<eos> - Bit freaked out, I guess?<eos> - Yes, yes, I guess.<eos> - So, shall we come in and see him?<eos> - Let them just finish their tests, then I think they're gonna discharge him anyway.<eos> - So don't worry.<eos> Normal service will be resumed shortly. - (LAUGHS)<eos> (REPETITIVE THUD)<eos> Thought you might be here.<eos> Sorry.
I just...<eos> Fine, so, what do we do?<eos> Mate, I'm not quite sure you're getting this.<eos> We are only speaking now because if by some small miracle you do get the story stopped, it will help us.<eos> But however this pans out, you're done.<eos> Seriously pissing off a Prime Minister is not a good career move.<eos> 'Not a good move at all.'<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> (Sorry.)
In case you hadn't noticed, this isn't actually about you, Bella.<eos> I'm not saying it is.<eos> I'm just saying, as a human rights lawyer, torture is a little bit of a bugbear of mine and having a father accused of lopping people's fingers off<eos> - is, you know, a tiny bit awkward.<eos> - God, you're a sarky bitch sometimes.<eos> All I want to know is if it's true, Dad.<eos> Did you give this Pinion man money?<eos> Did you do what he says you did?<eos> No.<eos> On both counts.
Kara.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I'll be just a minute.<eos> Miss Grant sent me for layouts and she doesn't like to wait.<eos> Well, she can wait a minute.<eos> Have you met Miss Grant?<eos> Yeah, what is she gonna do?<eos> Fire me right after hiring me?<eos> Her loss.
It's a good thing your high school boyfriend didn't know what he was doing or you'd be hanging laundry outside a mobile home in Stockton.<eos> No, he could've gone down on me like an oboe player.<eos> I still would've gotten out of that dump.<eos> That a thing, oboe players being good at giving head?<eos> - Is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Well, they use their lips and their mouths.<eos> - Eh, musicians are overrated. - Mm.<eos> - God, I miss him. - Mm.<eos> The old Pernell.
No.<eos> You paid the bodega guy $200 for them.<eos> And his shirt.<eos> Ooh.<eos> That explains why I have a triple XL Scarface hoodie on my couch.<eos> Eh, worth it.<eos> It was a pretty fun night.<eos> Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for cancelling the party so abruptly.<eos> There was a non-emergency emergency.<eos> Your loss.
He found her body in the alley.<eos> Stitching affects you.<eos> It makes you different for a little bit.<eos> Sometimes people get hurt.<eos> You forgot the cheese.<eos> Well, good morning, Camille.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> Fine.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> You?
You claim to have been framed by a woman named Claudia Sanchez.<eos> Or whatever her name really was.<eos> - She made everything up.<eos> - She make up the Ponzi scheme?<eos> The $128 million you stole from your clients to fund your lifestyle...<eos> The ranch, the private jets...<eos> Look, I've told this story a hundred times.<eos> We were sleeping together.<eos> She had access to everything...<eos> My phone, computer, passwords.
But that was nothing.<eos> The way she moved the money, her knowledge of how it worked, issuing false statements, creating shell companies.<eos> I hired the best defense money could buy, and after they looked at the evidence against me, they recommended I cop a plea.<eos> Beretta 21A Bobcat.<eos> Packs a nasty bite.<eos> If I ever have to use it, that's exactly what I want it to do.<eos> I pled guilty to a crime I didn't commit.<eos> That's how good she was.<eos> And the money she took, most of it belonged to my clients...<eos> Teachers, doctors, pension plans.
Nothing.<eos> They asked about Brian.<eos> Said nothing about me?<eos> I told them that the two of you were friends and they should talk to you about him.<eos> They think he killed Christine.<eos> No.<eos> Now they think I did.<eos> Did you?<eos> - Aah! Call the police! Aah!<eos> Aah! Up against the wall!
Hey, so how much of what went down tonight was, You know...<eos> We're a specialized unit.<eos> Well, i'm thinking about sticking around.<eos> I talked to someone at chicago med.<eos> They need er doctors.<eos> Whoa, no more breast implants.<eos> Son of a...<eos> I did cleft palates, too.<eos> But no one mentions the cleft palates.<eos> My bad.
Josh, I am sorry.<eos> I am really, truly, very, very sorry.<eos> And you for...<eos> I forgive you, Gabi.<eos> Josh, you did not have to say that.<eos> So, where do we go from here?<eos> How about we go back to doing what we do best?<eos> - Being friends.<eos> - I would love that.<eos> Me, too.
That's the name of our band, "One hit from making it big."<eos> Have you heard any of their music?<eos> No, but I heard him tapping on the table and he's very talented.<eos> So, uh, Sarah, do you want to help me with dessert?<eos> Yeah, and if that's code for "let's talk about the boys," hell yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gabi mentioned you met, uh, at her place.<eos> Do you live nearby?<eos> Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Hey, Dora, let go of Timmy's hair.<eos> There is no possible way that Prima could have deleted the e-mail.<eos> - Okay, so what's your theory?<eos> - Well, unfortunately, my theory involves ASA Geneva Pine, who was having an affair with Prima at the time.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> - No. I mean, you know, she didn't tell anybody.<eos> You know. I mean, for...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can you...<eos> For obvious reasons.
Oh, my God.<eos> Listen, Peggy, I know that you are reluctant to go back home, but I think it's gonna be good for the book and for you.<eos> What the hell's wrong with me?<eos> Nothing!<eos> You're perfect!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> I think I need to run around.<eos> It's been 30 miles.<eos> Ah, you and me both.
I don't know... I don't know how this is gonna go.<eos> But if it goes badly...<eos> You and the president won't protect me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And, finally, these are the appointments for our CVE Summit at the White House.<eos> What time does Dr. McCord testify?<eos> 2:00.<eos> Walk with me, Blake.<eos> Yes, ma'am.
Whew. Thank you.<eos> No, let me rephrase that.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Secretary McCord, you are not dismissed.<eos> HENRY: "The truth is like a lion.<eos> "You don't need to defend it.<eos> Let it loose, and it'll defend itself."<eos> See? I listen to you.<eos> - Mmm, Augustine.<eos> - And Augustine.
No, let me rephrase that.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Secretary McCord, you are not dismissed.<eos> HENRY: "The truth is like a lion.<eos> "You don't need to defend it.<eos> Let it loose, and it'll defend itself."<eos> See? I listen to you.<eos> - Mmm, Augustine.<eos> - And Augustine.<eos> And Aquinas.

Yeah, yeah.<eos> Well, I just wanted to say what we talked about yesterday, it's totally fine, there won't be any repercussions.<eos> Thanks, George.<eos> You know, this is a pressure cooker environment.<eos> We've all snapped at certain points, so don't dwell on it.<eos> Speaking of which, I've got to go and talk to the trustees about, erm...recent events involving me and Liz, so I wondered if you could, er, do me a favour, take Michael through his induction?<eos> Michael, this is Andy.<eos> He's going to sit in on your first call.<eos> Pleased to meet you. Hi.<eos> Hiya.
~ Amanda, sweetie?<eos> ~ Yeah?<eos> I need these contacts out before we go again.<eos> I can't have red eyes, I'm on stage tonight.<eos> Yes, sorry, Anne.<eos> I'll go and fetch the solution.<eos> Keep pressing on that.<eos> So, are you treading the boards at the moment, Anne?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything good?
Will do. Sorry.<eos> Will someone mop up that water, please?<eos> That's how accidents happen.<eos> Erm, I really do need you back in your hutch, I'm afraid.<eos> ~ Hutch?<eos> I'm not a gerbil!<eos> ~ Carl, all good?<eos> ~ Who wanted water?<eos> ~ Me!<eos> ~ Er, me, please!
Hello.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You had us all worried there for a minute.<eos> Sorry, I don't know your name.<eos> Spirit of little boy.<eos> Er, no, we changed that.<eos> Remember?<eos> I'm sad.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry about that.
Sorry, I don't know your name.<eos> Spirit of little boy.<eos> Er, no, we changed that.<eos> Remember?<eos> I'm sad.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Erm, well at least you're all right now.<eos> ~ I didn't like it.<eos> ~ No.
I was quite capable of dispensing of George in my own manner.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But I prefer to have George in my pocket, not yours.<eos> And I promise, his corpulent carcass will remain hidden...<eos> So long as you behave yourself.<eos> What kind of man woos with blackmail?<eos> It is not the beginning of love that matters... it's love's end.<eos> And trust me, I know how our story ends. It ends like this...<eos> "and they lived happily ever after"...<eos> Madam.
And what if he or she has a child?<eos> Your great-granddaughter.<eos> Six years old.<eos> Imagine how clean that blood is.<eos> What's her name, and where is she?<eos> Why would I tell you that without something in return?<eos> We both want to survive, so let's make a deal.<eos> You let me go, save me a place in here, and I'll get the girl.<eos> A living, breathing blood bank.<eos> Deal?
- Where have you been?<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm sorry. I had to...<eos> - Arnie, we have to talk.<eos> - Not here.<eos> Please, just listen to me, please.<eos> I love you. I love you and I miss you.<eos> And I can't function without you and I...<eos> Look, I think it's stupid that we should throw away something as good as us just because...<eos> Scotty?
The media aren't allowed in.<eos> But we understand the Saviour team have been working through the night to make sure that everything goes to plan.<eos> The hopes of the entire human race rest on the shoulders of these men and women.<eos> One can only imagine what's going through their minds right now.<eos> These pictures are coming live from the Saviour craft, sir.<eos> Well, not exactly live.<eos> There's a time delay because of the distances involved.<eos> Of course.<eos> Could... could you explain to me the exact sequence of events?<eos> Scotty?
Oh, I see.<eos> But you must understand, the first ingredient for intimacy is trust.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> All right, let's check out these cool pillows.<eos> Comfy.<eos> Uh... why don't you both sit down?<eos> Actually, I have to use the restroom.<eos> Please.<eos> You're here, so be here.<eos> But I really...
To each other.<eos> But I'll probably listen.<eos> ♪ It was late last night ♪<eos> ♪ I was feeling something wasn't right ♪<eos> ♪ There was not another soul in sight ♪<eos> ♪ Only you, only you ♪<eos> ♪ So I walked along ♪<eos> ♪ Though I knew That there was something wrong ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause the feeling I had Was so strong ♪<eos> ♪ About you ♪
You're at Mutiny because you believe in what they're doing now.<eos> I'm at Mutiny because I'm a 55-year-old ex-con who can't get a job.<eos> You're an extremely valuable asset.<eos> Please, Joe.<eos> I can't take such a large amount of sunshine up my ass.<eos> It makes me itch.<eos> We're going to need to pitch this program to nine different global subsidiaries.<eos> That's gonna require serious sales acumen.<eos> We want you on that team.<eos> We?
It's me.<eos> I need your help.<eos> She's alive, Harold.<eos> We wrote her off for dead, but she's alive.<eos> We don't know that, Ms. Groves.<eos> Except we do.<eos> I just talked to her on a call originating from the city.<eos> Can we take just five minutes and talk this through?<eos> The last time we had this conversation, I actually listened to you.<eos> And to the Machine.
Yes.<eos> We're really sorry.<eos> Big time.<eos> Aren't we, Kyle?<eos> You know, wasting police time is a serious matter.<eos> And I think we're all grateful to Sergeant Taringa for kindly agreeing not to take this matter any further.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's been no missing girl reported?<eos> No-one local?
Whoa, hold on. Wait.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I'll be cool. I promise.<eos> Hiya.<eos> Can I buy you a drink, apologise for this morning?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Dries explained.<eos> I'm sorry you had such a bad experience.<eos> It sounded awful.<eos> Worse for her.
It's a long con.<eos> Is that a bandana you're wearing?<eos> Ashok, really, you are so lazy.<eos> It's a foulard, not a bandana.<eos> And also... my eyes are my best feature.<eos> The Queen who would be King.<eos> Subtle.<eos> Well, at least she didn't glue a horn onto a horse this year.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> You?
I like Jocelyn.<eos> I always have.<eos> Course, she hates me right now.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> It's not about her.<eos> It's about PJ.<eos> Well, if it was about PJ, you'd let him go.<eos> You wouldn't put Jocelyn through this.<eos> I think it's about you.<eos> Me?
He wouldn't just disappear without telling me.<eos> I'm not angry with you.<eos> I was gonna tell you.<eos> You were just trying to find the right time.<eos> Maybe there isn't a right time.<eos> It still would have been good to hear it from you.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess you have a decision to make.<eos> We.
How'd you sleep?<eos> Not much, you?<eos> Some.
Amongst all the lies you've heard here this weekend, recognise one truth...<eos> "no fuss"<eos> is the best piece of advice you will ever be given.<eos> I prefer it down here.<eos> - She won't like it.<eos> I don't think she will.<eos> You cared about him.<eos> You cared for him.<eos> If he had a problem, he came to you, didn't he?<eos> Not her.
Cycle continued.<eos> By the time I was a senior in high school, I was drinking every day.<eos> So, you were an alcoholic?<eos> Still am.<eos> Sober 22 years.<eos> How come you never told me this before?<eos> I wanted to be a moral example.<eos> Today, I have decided that I should be me and you should be you.<eos> So, you've been to rehab?<eos> Thanks to Pritchett.
There's nothing to worry about.<eos> It's just a little bumpy air.<eos> That's all it is.<eos> Air, by nature, should not be bumpy.<eos> Just look at the flight crew.<eos> If they're up and smiling, then everything is fine.<eos> Yes, well, they're up, but they are not exactly smiling.<eos> Dad, it's a long flight.<eos> You should really focus on something else, or it'll seem even longer...<eos> For both of us.
I warrant they will hang for this!<eos> - So what's wrong with Clara, then?<eos> - There's nothing wrong with her.<eos> - Why haven't you made her immortal?<eos> - Well, look how you turned out.<eos> She'll die on you, you know.<eos> She'll blow away like smoke.<eos> - Save your breath.<eos> - How old are you, Doctor?<eos> - Older than you.
Just give us the post, Medal.<eos> Whoa!<eos> It's like being punched in the face by an orange!<eos> There's a package for you, Towerblock, and a letter for you, Mac.<eos> Is anyone else thirsty?<eos> It's from my da'.<eos> He's still not talking to me.<eos> How can a drink make you thirsty?<eos> This is like when I went to the beach.<eos> Oh, mint!
Then why do we have these awesome wristbands?<eos> Please don't fuck this up, Dad.<eos> I'm fucking it up?<eos> Well, not yet, but... you're showing potential.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I'm an asshole.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I like it here.<eos> Me, too.
Honey?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> I... I gotta go.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> Evening, officer.<eos> Can I... can I help ya?<eos> You sure can... by obeying the sign and moving your vehicle.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> I can't believe I didn't see that.<eos> Uh, sorry.
- It's a blowfish.<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> It acts like a cell phone tower?<eos> You're a genius.<eos> What?<eos> Come on!<eos> You're a genius.<eos> George, you don't have to do this.<eos> If you hadn't lied to us, we wouldn't have to.<eos> We?
Giving kids what their biology neglected.<eos> So it's a genetic deformity?<eos> Possibly, but not conclusively.<eos> It's most common in Navajo Indians.<eos> What's so striking is how alien it looks.<eos> I assure you that is simply a random coincidence, Mr. O'Malley.<eos> You mean, unrelated to your previous work experience?<eos> Far, far from that experience.<eos> Do you miss it at all?<eos> The X-Files?
You want this over, then say it!<eos> It's for you.<eos> Wayne Henry Gilchrest, Jr.<eos> Also known as Holy Wayne.<eos> Claims he can hug the pain out of people.<eos> You don't have to feel like this anymore.<eos> I can't.<eos> You're all suffering and no salvation.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you just like I promised.<eos> Christie!
Get off me!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Hey...<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Tell your mom Meg says hello.<eos> It's a great piece.<eos> A special occasion?
And then they came to kill him.<eos> We got away, but we had to split up.<eos> He asked me to protect this girl, a pregnant girl.<eos> She gave birth... and then she just left the baby.<eos> Just abandoned it in a fucking rest stop bathroom.<eos> The baby, she was crying and I didn't know what to do.<eos> I was alone.<eos> So I looked up at the ceiling and said, "Help."<eos> Not to God.<eos> Not to anyone.
Who, Patti?<eos> Wake the fuck up, asshole.<eos> Feed the fire.<eos> What well?<eos> I'm supposed to assassinate her.<eos> No, you're not a fucking assassin.<eos> Whoa. Whoa. Don't fucking put it out.<eos> I'm still talking to him.<eos> You've got to take her to the well.<eos> What well?
Oh, yes, please, Gladys.<eos> You know what's crazy?<eos> I feel like I was sitting on the toilet the last time I met you.<eos> That is crazy.<eos> No, that's déjà vu.<eos> That's the mind taking an event you're experiencing in the present moment and mistaking it for a memory.<eos> The mind.<eos> You cannot trust the mind, for it will play tricks on you.<eos> And we all know who tricks are for.<eos> Kids.
The... but I was... I was so thirsty.<eos> Okay.<eos> She locked me out.<eos> Looks like you're locked out, too.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Kevin.<eos> You here on business or pleasure, Kevin?<eos> Uh, business.
We're waiting on a visual confirmation from Arika's plane, but we believe it was a direct hit.<eos> As Consul, I should have been notified.<eos> With Michael gone, we're a city without an archangel.<eos> That leaves us vulnerable to attack.<eos> So when the intel said that Gabriel was in the aerie, I took the shot.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> It's never that simple.<eos> Something your father understood.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> If, for any reason,
I would have told you that Alex Lannon was in there with Gabriel.<eos> When you bombed Gabriel, you killed Alex.<eos> Sorry to be the one to tell you, Claire.<eos> I know.<eos> You said it yourself, David.<eos> I have the military.<eos> All intel comes to me.<eos> I'm the daughter of General Riesen.<eos> The army is still loyal to me.<eos> Not you.
How many staff do you have?<eos> Well, there's Mrs Tonkins. She comes in three days a week.<eos> And she has to manage everything?<eos> We do have a man outside every now and then.<eos> But that's why we need you.<eos> In your advertisement, you spoke of a position of trust, Sir Michael, in a prominent household.<eos> This is a very prominent household.<eos> Can you doubt it?<eos> We have entertained not just the Connaughts, but the Fife princesses!<eos> Both of them.
- Then tell him.<eos> - It's too late.<eos> The damage has been done.<eos> You don't believe me anyway.<eos> Mrs Hughes.<eos> Can you pop up to Her Ladyship's room for a moment?<eos> - Whatever for?<eos> - Lady Mary has a surprise for you.<eos> A surprise?<eos> For me?
Two months of good behavior or eternal fucking damnation?<eos> You don't sound like any preacher I've ever met.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> And you sure don't seem gay.<eos> Well, I don't know what you think a gay person is supposed to seem like, but make no mistake, I like cock.<eos> Hey, thought you were gone.<eos> Oh, no, just ducked out for a sec.<eos> Oh, I'll get that for you.<eos> Oh, no, no, that's okay.<eos> You...
Now I can stop using yours.<eos> What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> So did you make plans to see him again, or is he just gonna send you a postcard?<eos> Good night.<eos> Hey, um, just a heads-up.<eos> Beverly Torantino dropped by.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> She was pretty upset.<eos> About?
Like Uriel?<eos> We found her body, Gabriel.<eos> She was killed in the bombing.<eos> Bourbon is whiskey.<eos> I am still alive.<eos> I'll gather the army.<eos> Dad, you don't want to sleep through your own death.<eos> Trust me, that last burst of adrenaline is killer.<eos> Aren't you excited?<eos> Excited about what?
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> It's all good. Hey.<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> Let me take this off.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> "always look for the highest perch."<eos> That's what you told me when you gave me this.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because you'd have done the same for me.<eos> Back then, at least.
I-I don't know, but it sounded like Jacob had turned on his phone so I could hear him being accosted by... two men.<eos> What two men?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look, it might not be anything.<eos> He had money, Alicia, uh, for his business.<eos> Let me call the police.<eos> Why did he call you?<eos> What?<eos> Why you, Alicia?<eos> Why not me?
Sorry.<eos> The Democratic Committee has asked me to run for president.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> That's great.<eos> When?<eos> Uh, well, I'd have to start - making trips to Iowa next week.<eos> I'll be one Metro stop<eos> - away. - Actually, it's not to win.<eos> The logic is, I would run to make myself a viable candidate for vice president.<eos> Cool.
I'm really sorry that things got messed up.<eos> I wish we had the chance to... do it over again.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'll never see you again?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I, um...<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Damn you!
- Listen, calm down.<eos> ...someone has to watch Nick.<eos> - Well--<eos> - And that someone, somehow, is me.<eos> 'Cause I don't know where your ex-wife goes.<eos> She's helping sick people.<eos> Is this about Liza?<eos> - What?<eos> No, it's about you.<eos> - Me?
Oh, could you spell that for me?<eos> S-A-L-A... you're not even looking.<eos> Oh. Yeah, no, here it is.<eos> Um, Ofelia.<eos> - Mr. Manawa?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> A word, please.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - Yeah, you, too.
- Trade?<eos> What do you expect--<eos> - We wait.<eos> Once they find out he's missing, we call.<eos> We tell them where to go.<eos> We tell them where we're gonna meet to trade.<eos> And then when they come looking?<eos> I don't like this either, but... my father's right.<eos> It's the only thing they understand.<eos> Gracias.
I'm not sick.<eos> I swear, I swear.<eos> Hold.<eos> Easy.<eos> Let me have the boy.<eos> I'll keep an eye on him.<eos> - Hey, hey! - Take this as collateral.<eos> Where's the other one?<eos> Las Vegas, I think.<eos> - Tragically--
With your blessing, of course.<eos> - Keep him occupied in body and mind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will ride to the woods, My King. You have my word on it.<eos> Although, with the sequester...<eos> Allow them passage in court.<eos> At once!<eos> Madame, some privacy for Her Highness.<eos> I will need a moment to compose myself.<eos> Of course, Madame.
Come on.<eos> Let's hang another 1,000cc bag.<eos> Not working.<eos> Shit!<eos> - You want to call it?<eos> - Hell, no, I don't want to call it.<eos> - I need ice.<eos> - I can pat you down, Doctor.<eos> I got some...<eos> No, for him.
Of course.<eos> How could he resist?<eos> We've been hearing that you spoiled Gwen's luncheon.<eos> Good work (! )<eos> I couldn't have known she was planning<eos> - to lie her way through it.<eos> - That's not it though, is it?<eos> You resent her luck.<eos> You're jealous.<eos> Jealous?
I guess, you know, life happened.<eos> Kids?<eos> Marriage?<eos> Yes to the kids.<eos> The marriage not so much anymore.<eos> Mm. What about you?<eos> Is there a mrs. Witch doctor back home?<eos> There was.<eos> She wanted a husband who was treating mother issues Instead of digging into demons of past lives, So she left me for her therapist.<eos> Mm, sorry.
You got a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> Uh, i was thinking about Cleaning out will's room this weekend.<eos> Wow.<eos> Are you ready for that?<eos> Are we ready for that?<eos> Well, sophie seems to think so.<eos> She suddenly feels the need for foreigners in the house.<eos> Right, an exchange student.
That's pretty hard to do.<eos> I think what you're doing Is you're helping people who are in pain.<eos> Isn't that what it means to be a doctor?<eos> Condescending, but i'll take it.<eos> I really think if you just give it a chance...<eos> I did, remember?<eos> And they had very different perspectives.<eos> Well, there's got to be a reason for that.<eos> We should regress them together, at the same time, See what happens.<eos> We?
That's what makes the data so important.<eos> I can tell you what you're going to see...<eos> Nothing.<eos> There is no "next."<eos> And I'm not gonna let them paw through his entire life to find something that doesn't exist.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Ethan was a scientist.<eos> Don't you think he would want us to keep looking if it led to a new discovery?<eos> But that's not for anyone to say...<eos> Not you or me or Ivan Turing.
They all expect me to perform.<eos> Sometimes I just can't.<eos> I use techniques to read people.<eos> When the power isn't in me, I just... I-I-I tell people what they want to hear.<eos> Are you saying you fake it?<eos> I'm saying that I've got so good at these techniques, I'm not certain what's real and what isn't anymore.<eos> Aren't I the last person you should be confessing that to?<eos> You're a highly respected doctor moonlighting as an investigator into the afterlife.<eos> You of all people should appreciate the sanctity of a secret that can ruin a career.<eos> Another round.
Take your time. Call me if you need me.<eos> Hello?<eos> I feel like I just stepped into a high-end furniture catalog.<eos> Well, when you're paying $5,000 a month rent, Buzz, you're gonna buy the good stuff.<eos> He's 20 living this way, got to have a smartphone somewhere.<eos> Tao: Buzz. In here.<eos> Well, this room seems kind of empty.<eos> Not completely. I found a laptop but no cellphone. I think we should call S.I.D. to... oh.<eos> What was Kyle shipping?<eos> Electronics, perhaps?
My name is Alfredo, and I'm an addict.<eos> Wow, um... first time I said those words, I was 33 and didn't think I'd make it to see 34.<eos> If you told me then that I'd be getting my five-year chip now, I'd have thought you were high. Honestly.<eos> But... here I am.<eos> And it's because of people in this room.<eos> You guys gave me my life back.<eos> People like Libby...<eos> Tom...
I hate that you have to put up with all this scrutiny, just because you're my girlfriend.<eos> Girlfriend, huh?<eos> Paper!<eos> Read all about it!<eos> Read all about it!<eos> Royal scandal!<eos> Nothing against Jack and the Beanstalk, but I preferred the last guy.<eos> Jasper's been reassigned.<eos> And I've given him a few days' compassionate leave.<eos> Compassionate leave?
- We don't know.<eos> Apparently bad.<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> Cyrus, I will not perjure myself or lie to the authorities.<eos> I'm a member of Parliament.<eos> You did lines of blow off my dick last week, Holloway.<eos> - Don't get all sanctimonious now.<eos> - I won't do it.<eos> You will do it, you flimsy bastard, or you will find yourself in a world of shit.<eos> What, like the King?
I will gravely castigate those who betray the Crown.<eos> I will gravely castigate those who betray the Crown.<eos> All this I promise to do, so help me God.<eos> All this I promise to do... so help me God.<eos> And now, before God and Man, with a kiss you will seal your place in history and take your place upon the greatest Throne on Earth.<eos> Stop!<eos> - Kiss the book. - He will not kiss the book and he will not occupy the Throne because he is not fit to do so.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> Turn around and walk away, or so help me God, I will have you arrested and imprisoned for treason.<eos> With what authority?
He's so cool.<eos> All right.<eos> If you really want me to feel comfortable here maybe there's another way.<eos> What about the-the KlĂźf?<eos> You can use it.<eos> I'll just take yours.<eos> Thank you for making room for me.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I like our place.<eos> Me, too.
All right. Put that in a jar for Mr. Turing.<eos> Just a few more tests, uh, then we close up.<eos> Uh, move your fingers, please.<eos> Perfect.<eos> What's your favorite band?<eos> Backstreet Boys.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> It's the Grateful Dead.<eos> Always has been.<eos> Mine too.
How?<eos> I wrote him a nice, honest reference.<eos> Which is exactly why they won't let him in the country.<eos> Well, it's too late to change it now.<eos> And even if it isn't, it's against my principles to just lie.<eos> Yeah. I mean, you know what the Taliban do to 'terps that they capture, but... your principles, yeah, they come first.<eos> Yeah, I get that, ma'am, I really fucking get it.<eos> Cha-a-a-a-arge!<eos> And fork!<eos> Not the bollocks!
So unless you wanna pick up a screwdriver and pitch in, we got work we've gotta do.<eos> Okay, well, I'll probably head over to the Landing in a little bit if you guys want to meet up for lunch.<eos> - Yeah. Sure thing.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> Ah, here he is.<eos> Joe, this is Jesse Evans.<eos> Oh, welcome.<eos> It's great to meet you.<eos> You, too, man.<eos> You, too.
Some ideas need a larger ecosystem.<eos> Give a buffalo a million acres, it thrives.<eos> Stick it on a desert island, in four generations, - it's the size of a poodle.<eos> - That's a charming anecdote, but I work for a living, so can we move this along, please?<eos> - We violated no copyrights.<eos> - We own proprietary algorithms...<eos> You were making it up as you went, at least admit it.<eos> - Connecting subscribers in discreet - The Source does a version of that...<eos> - Delphi, CompuServe.<eos> - communities...
Would you ask Albert Einstein why he would work on his files from home?<eos> No, because he's dead.<eos> Josh, a situation has presented itself.<eos> It seems that my mother thinks you're my fiance.<eos> Ha, ha, ha!<eos> Isn't that funny?<eos> - No.<eos> - But here's the funny part, she likes me because she thinks you like me.<eos> You know who really likes you?<eos> Alan, your actual fiance.
Gibbs,Gibbs,Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.<eos> You know I don't like to be kept waiting when I have news.<eos> Abbs, I was on my way down.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Um, okay, so I finished analyzing Qasim's knife-- the blade pattern is not consistent with the wounds on Captain Landis.<eos> It's not the murder weapon?<eos> No.<eos> But... I found prints on the handle that don't match Qasim's.<eos> Guess who they belong to.<eos> Well, who?

We owe it to all of them.<eos> Where were you assigned, Agent Bishop?<eos> Pakistan and Afghanistan.<eos> How long?<eos> 18 months as an NSA analyst.<eos> Computer nerd.<eos> Not much of a threat to anyone.<eos> But you've seen it up close.<eos> Who did you lose, exactly?<eos> A coworker.
You see that now, right, Dwayne?<eos> I deserve respect.<eos> I have a name.<eos> Why don't you say it?<eos> That why you went after my people?<eos> Respect?<eos> Had to show you, Dwayne.<eos> Mess with the bull... get the horns.<eos> And yet, here you are in my interrogation room.<eos> By choice.
Pick it up.<eos> What?<eos> Your weapon.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> I'm not resisting, friend.<eos> I'm not your friend.<eos> What, you gonna shoot me?<eos> An unarmed man?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to defend yourself, which is more than what you gave her.<eos> Your girlfriend, right?
Looks like whoever did this left a hell of a fingerprint.<eos> Traced back the IP address to none other than yard manager, Jonathan Warren.<eos> Guy we talked to at the docks.<eos> The guy that promised the footage but never delivered.<eos> Where can we find Warren?<eos> Got called by JPSO.<eos> When they told me it was Warren, I knew to notify you.<eos> Small caliber round to the skull.<eos> Working on time of death.<eos> Ready for this?
BONNIE: Fine, I'll make some money!<eos> Anybody here want to have sex with me and my daughter? !<eos> I was joking.<eos> Yeah, real funny.<eos> You have any idea where we are?<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, maybe we should call someone to come get us.<eos> Who are we gonna call, Mom?<eos> !<eos> Who?
Anybody here want to have sex with me and my daughter? !<eos> I was joking.<eos> Yeah, real funny.<eos> You have any idea where we are?<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, maybe we should call someone to come get us.<eos> Who are we gonna call, Mom?<eos> !<eos> Who?<eos> Who? !
Ugh, what a little bitch!<eos> I was just thinking the same thing.<eos> We dated for two years, and she's gonna introduce me as her friend?<eos> Well, Liam just went with his new friend to the bathroom to have sex.<eos> We can't let them treat us like this.<eos> We have to make them pay.<eos> Yeah, but they'd know it was us, and I can't get caught with blood on my hands.<eos> Not real blood. I mean, metaphorical blood, because, to be clear, I'm not killing anyone.<eos> What if I got revenge on your ex and you get revenge on mine?<eos> Deal?
Later renamed the Mystery Shack.<eos> Finally, I'd found something I was good at.<eos> For once, being a liar and a cheat paid off.<eos> The old me was dead.<eos> And I faked a car crash to prove it.<eos> By day, I was Stanford Pines, Mr. Mystery.<eos> But by night, I was down in the basement, trying to bring the real Stanford back.<eos> I couldn't risk anyone learning the truth and sabotaging my mission.<eos> So I lied to everyone.<eos> The town, my family, your parents.
No, of course not.<eos> You guys, look, the point is we know for sure.<eos> Andrew was adopted, which means he might be older than we think he is.<eos> He could be that other kid in the home movie.<eos> Wait, so before he was a Campbell maybe he was a DiLaurentis.<eos> You probably heard, my dad is trying to decide how many people he can sue at one time.<eos> It's the kinda challenge he enjoys.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about him.<eos> About your family.<eos> Our family.
Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.<eos> Doesn't look like anybody lives here.<eos> Maybe that's what Charles wants people to think.<eos> If he's still alive..<eos> ...why would he do this?<eos> To me, to us?
But maybe try not to do it while you're getting shot at, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here you go... straight rye.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> More for me.<eos> To sense memory.<eos> You still ticklish behind the knees?<eos> All right, she's got $40,000 on her.<eos> That's 500 units.<eos> 80 for each.
- Which one is her desk?<eos> - Umm... wait, this is it.<eos> Alright.<eos> What am I supposed to be looking for?<eos> Well, she's furnished an underground bunker so I'm guessing she must have a stack of receipts the size of a phone book.<eos> So, Ezra came to my house.<eos> I came really close to telling him.<eos> Telling him what?<eos> About why we're here.<eos> Everything.
You're working for A.<eos> You and Lesli Stone are going down.<eos> We have what we need and we're giving it straight to the police.<eos> This college will prosecute.<eos> I'm just trying to save you from yourselves.<eos> Cut the crap, Mona!<eos> The only thing you're trying to protect is Lesli's vendetta against us.<eos> Yeah, which is crazy because we had nothing to do with what happened to Bethany!<eos> Yeah, we had never even heard of Lesli's friend until she was found in Alison's grave!<eos> Her friend?
And we need to talk.<eos> Can you just call me back?<eos> Emily?<eos> It's Claire, Sara's friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> That girl, Sabrina told me that you weren't working here anymore.<eos> I was just about to leave.<eos> Y-you were looking for me?<eos> And Sara.
Emily?<eos> It's Claire, Sara's friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> That girl, Sabrina told me that you weren't working here anymore.<eos> I was just about to leave.<eos> Y-you were looking for me?<eos> And Sara.<eos> I-I went by her mom's a few times but she wouldn't tell me where she was.<eos> At least not right away.
- Just hold still.<eos> - What's going on up there?<eos> - Um...<eos> - What's with the Band-Aid?<eos> - Just..<eos> If you could hold your questions until afterwards that would be great, okay?<eos> Okay, I wanna tell you everything.<eos> I'm going to tell you everything but I need you to promise me one thing first.<eos> You cannot tell anybody, including Tanner.<eos> - At least not at first.
'I didn't have him down as a wolf.'<eos> I heard shouting for help.<eos> Joyce has got what she wanted - the closure of the WI.<eos> You can't enlist.<eos> - You can't stop me.<eos> I'll just get the girls.<eos> - The girls?<eos> This is Great Paxton's new Women's Institute.<eos> Look after me.<eos> ...left.
Oh, no worries.<eos> I'm Margo.<eos> I'm mentoring for the next couple of weeks.<eos> I actually used to go here, but I just graduated from Emerson film school last semester.<eos> Awesome.<eos> You know, I could really use your help.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Have a great weekend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You too.
I'm fine.<eos> Tom, I said I was fine. I know you did.<eos> That hurt?<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't want to regret anything.<eos> What could you possibly regret?<eos> Not saying yes.<eos> Yes to what?<eos> You.
- The dye we inserted highlighted-- Who do you work for?<eos> I'm in the middle of-- Get out!<eos> - Harold--<eos> - I know about Andropov.<eos> That the drugs you gave me came from him.<eos> There never was a clinical trial, was there? - No, no.<eos> - It was all a lie.<eos> Please, please, please!<eos> They threatened my family. Your family?<eos> And what about my family?
Posted it two minutes ago, taken in the Shaw Neighborhood at 9th and Q.<eos> Area's controlled by the 18th Street Gang.<eos> If they're there, it's for protection.<eos> Call Vice.<eos> I want the location of all known safe houses.<eos> Roll all units.<eos> This ends now.<eos> - FBI!<eos> - FBI!<eos> Hey! Hey! Against the wall!
It's their best song.<eos> We have a great rapport.<eos> You should do my podcast.<eos> Jimmy!<eos> Great party!<eos> I have a girlfriend.<eos> It wasn't really my intention to get into education, but when I substituted that first day, it just kind of... clicked.<eos> Remember when you had that birthday party and we locked you in your bedroom 'cause you were yelling at your guests and threatening suicide by cop?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Unfortunately.
! We have a mouse? !<eos> I think he lives in the laundry room.<eos> No, the-the garage.<eos> He made a-a little nest out of Jimmy's unsold books.<eos> Sorry, let me get this straight.<eos> We have a mouse crawling through the food that we ingest, and not only do you two know about it, but you're absolutely unbothered?<eos> - He's kind of cute.<eos> - Yeah, if he's not bothering anyone, who cares that he's here?<eos> I do!<eos> Me!
- It's not the only thing.<eos> - But it is getting serious.<eos> Dinner with Evelyn Napier at the Criterion?<eos> Doesn't sound very serious to me.<eos> I used to go to the Criterion with Michael.<eos> Do you have to put a damper on every restaurant in the capital?<eos> As a matter of fact, I have very happy memories of it.<eos> Send him my best wishes.<eos> I hope to see him again soon.<eos> Oh, Evelyn?
- Am I not right?<eos> No.<eos> You push in here, into my home, uninvited, in order to call me a grubby, little gold digger?<eos> You've got a nerve!<eos> Mary!<eos> Mary!<eos> She loves him but she can't control him.<eos> That's what frightens her.<eos> He's stronger than she is, really.<eos> Or as strong.
You see, I don't feel I could spend my life with someone I don't trust.<eos> - Who didn't trust me.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm terribly sorry, of course, but that doesn't mean much, does it?<eos> The truth is, my life was about to be perfectly wonderful and now I've thrown it all away.<eos> - I'd better go if I'm to catch my train.<eos> - Yes, hurry.<eos> I doubt we'll meet again so I want to say good luck, and everything else that goes with it.<eos> Good luck to you, too.
Well, you got what you wanted!<eos> Bertie has left for the train and Edith won't be the next Marchioness of Hexham!<eos> - Well, that's not what I wanted.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> I still can't believe she'd never told him.<eos> How was I to know that?<eos> - Don't play the innocent with me.<eos> - I didn't mean it.<eos> Don't lie!<eos> Not to me!
- It was my own fault.<eos> - Well, I liked him.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Your sister hasn't been helpful.<eos> Mary and I are locked into a kind of lifelong struggle and I don't know, it's hard for an outsider to understand.<eos> Who invented families?<eos> That's what I'd like to know.<eos> - What time is Miss Jones coming today?<eos> - Five.<eos> For tea.
Oh, no, he had to go to a funeral.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you hear about the two men who were killed by the tree last night?<eos> - Yes, terrible tragedy, huh? - Hmm.<eos> Turns out, they were both felons.<eos> Really?<eos> We found guns, drugs, and stolen merchandise in their vehicle.<eos> Oh, my goodness, what would men like that be doing in Ladner?<eos> We found something else too... a slip of paper with an address.<eos> What address?
A serious bout of heavy drinking - some extreme sports, perhaps?<eos> Probably not in that order.<eos> And see your parents.<eos> They love you.<eos> When Charlotte left me, I just think they were so disappointed...<eos> They love us... more than we know...<eos> Mm. I'm fine, fine... ~ Anyway<eos> - I just think that... ~ There's a shout on.<eos> Reaper drone's come down, and we get to blow it up.<eos> Mint!
Really funny(! )<eos> We were being nice!<eos> ~ Simon!<eos> ~ Boss, just give him a minute.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll sit next to him on the plane, have a heart-to-heart.<eos> Right. OK, one more thing...<eos> No, no, no, like it or not... .. I got the best souvenir.<eos> Mac, there was no competition, it was just...<eos> Nice!
Did I say that?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Those are boxes of audio cassettes.<eos> My only crime is loving Rod Stewart.<eos> ♪ We are sailing<eos> ♪ We are sailing<eos> ♪ Home again<eos> ♪ Cross the sea<eos> ♪ We... ♪<eos> Your loss.
That's got to be like a four hour round trip - and then another four to Leeds!<eos> What can I say?<eos> Me and your missus really hit it off.<eos> She's like the sister I never had.<eos> You've got a sister!<eos> ..Who's dead to me - as are my parents.<eos> See you in the car.<eos> Oh, shotgun!<eos> Oh, when I get home, I'm going on a Greggs-crawl.<eos> Lucky you.
Are there any other respectable business?<eos> Yes, I almost forgot.<eos> - Do you have some talent, right?<eos> - Where's the rest?<eos> A good day.<eos> So you 're going to be moralizing all day,<eos> Or you are interested in a deal? I might have some information you need on the eve of New Year.<eos> I hear you.<eos> - Do you know the types of Silver Street?<eos> - unfortunately.
These people have a name?<eos> Choinski Management.<eos> They own, like, half of Greenpoint.<eos> All done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Feel better?<eos> Safer, I guess.<eos> Any history of violence between you and Trevor?<eos> Not toward me.
It was a beautiful night.<eos> I have to get to work, okay?<eos> Kasim?<eos> Your backpack, it's leaking; what's in there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Show me.<eos> You're not my mother.<eos> I'm your father's wife, and I asked you a question.<eos> It's just some stuff, okay?<eos> Work stuff.
Well, yeah, that... would have been nice.<eos> But I tried.<eos> Like, three times on the phone.<eos> "Mom, I met this guy named Bernard."<eos> But you were always distracted, and then... when you came home, you had enough shit to deal with.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm not very good at this, I know that.<eos> I mean, I-I feel like I can deal with the details of life.<eos> I can get things done, but... the emotional stuff, I'm just having a hard time figuring that out.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.
We're just starting to get our lives back, figuring out how to be a family again.<eos> I know.<eos> But you're not hearing me.<eos> They've already taken so much away from us.<eos> I'm not letting them take this.<eos> They can take so much more from you than that.<eos> Anyway, it's blood money.<eos> Yeah, but it's mine.<eos> And I'm still an-an Al Fayeed.<eos> Half of me, anyway.
- Did you use protection?<eos> - Ugh, yes.<eos> Every time.<eos> You know, condoms are only 98% effective, even when used properly.<eos> Well, then lucky me.<eos> I'm top 2%.<eos> It took Jake and I a year to get pregnant.<eos> I had to time the ovulation,<eos> I had to put a pillow under my butt to create a downward flow.<eos> Okay, plen of info.
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> I know you paid Alicia 100 bucks for her picks.<eos> Loser.<eos> - Good day for you, huh?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You closed the case, and... you got me on bribery.<eos> Well, I can't really take the high ground seeing as how I paid her 200 bucks to give you crappy picks.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Boy is on fire, huh?<eos> Thanks to you.
- And therefore...<eos> - We assumed it was one instruction.<eos> Go to the courthouse to get my lawyer.<eos> But Kyle's lawyer hasn't been in court all week.<eos> Yeah. Why would a person go get someone when they could just call or text them?<eos> Exactly.<eos> It was two instructions.<eos> Get the lawyer.<eos> And go to the courthouse.<eos> For another reason.
We do as rehearsed.<eos> ~ Hello?<eos> Katy...<eos> ~ Sorry, Megan.<eos> You're lying. I know you are.<eos> (You're pregnant.)<eos> No! No.<eos> ~ I would have told you.<eos> ~ We didn't tell anyone.<eos> Well, apart from you.
Doesn't matter what it feels like.<eos> He's not dead, and this place isn't over.<eos> Hey, we're here.<eos> So, what are we gonna do, gorgeous?<eos> Gonna get in there, see what's happening on the other side.<eos> We can shoot out this lock.<eos> We shouldn't waste the bullet.<eos> You won't need to.<eos> Lock-picking is within my skill set.<eos> You all right?
April's starting this clinical trial that may or may not save her life.<eos> There's no way that my little movie is going to matter - next to her wedding. - Mmm.<eos> It's not easy being April Carver's sister.<eos> - Keep talking.<eos> - Let's just say, feel lucky you didn't share a boyfriend with her.<eos> Whatever happened with you and Dominic anyway?<eos> It ended so quickly.<eos> Um, well, long story short, he didn't want me as much as I wanted him, so I had to get out.<eos> I'm over feeling unwanted.<eos> Thanks, daddy issues.
Please don't, like, mess with anything.<eos> I won't, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I should... I should thank you.<eos> It probably sounds dumb, but I have to write this paper for my independent study and I had no idea what to do.<eos> But now I think I'm gonna do it on what happens to kids when they're separated in the system, - like you and your brother.<eos> - Glad I could help.<eos> Okay, well, I'll be back first thing in the morning to open up, so...<eos> 'Night.<eos> 'Night.
~ It's all I ever wanted.<eos> What about you?<eos> Before I went into protection, I was a detective.<eos> ~ I'd like to do that.<eos> ~ So do it.<eos> ~ Isn't it really hard? I mean...<eos> ~ If I could do it...<eos> This... is all it takes to be a truly brilliant detective.<eos> Right, so, you've caught me and you think I'm guilty of a serious crime.<eos> ~ Against the wall! ~ (CHUCKLES)
- I have no idea what you're...<eos> - You used to work for Mellie.<eos> You knew her key code.<eos> You had access.<eos> You leaked those photos to Sally Langston.<eos> ♪ Our love is here to stay ♪<eos> ♪ what you think ♪<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Who have you told?<eos> The president?
Have we met?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Not officially.<eos> I'm Louise.<eos> Louise Ellis?<eos> Oh. You've been leaving me messages about the funeral.<eos> Yes.<eos> It was pressing that I talk to you because, as I may have mentioned, I would like to include some photographs and mementos of your mother's amazing life to bring solace to those she left behind.<eos> I...
Very funny.<eos> On behalf of Amanda and myself, I'd like to take a moment to remember the people we love who couldn't be with us today...<eos> My brother Declan, who always encouraged me to be the best man that I could be...<eos> Emily Thorne, to whom we both owe our lives and who brought my...<eos> My beautiful son Carl into this world.<eos> And my father Carl Senior, and our friends Aiden and Ben.<eos> And finally...<eos> David, who we lost earlier this year.<eos> We miss you all more than words can say.<eos> - To David.
Aw!<eos> I consider myself lucky.<eos> Most morality tales don't have a happy ending.<eos> For some reason, karma saw fit to spare me, but not without leaving deeply etched wounds.<eos> Is she going to make it?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> What she went through was extremely traumatic, but the surgery was a success.<eos> Your sister owes you her life.<eos> But she can never know how.<eos> Or rather, who.
Previously on Tyrant...<eos> It's over.<eos> Tomorrow morning they're carrying out your sentence.<eos> All we know here is blood and violence and revenge.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> This life we have, it didn't cost you anything.<eos> But I paid for it.<eos> Everything.
But then I remembered... I only had two days to clear my name.<eos> We headed back to L.A.<eos> I wanted to pay a visit to an old friend at the city morgue.<eos> After I dropped Delores and Dizzy off at my flat, I drove down to the city morgue.<eos> The dude that ran the place was an old army buddy of mine,<eos> Gary Dunhill.<eos> Rock Banyon, you old son of a gun.<eos> What brings you to my dead corner of the world?<eos> I need your help, friend.<eos> Just like the old days.
- Dallas, Dallas.<eos> - What?<eos> Did Wardell mention anything about a scientist named Wilbur Stygamian?<eos> Yeah, I might've done it with him.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> But I know I did it with Zoot Sims.<eos> Did it with Shorty Rogers, Eric Dolphy...<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> I mean, did, uh... did he mention doing business with a guy named Stygamian?<eos> Styga...
So, uh, what do you say?<eos> Want to grab a drink, maybe dinner?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Me no like to hang with work people.<eos> Well, I got to hand it to you, Quagmire.<eos> That Quagfest was some party.<eos> Yeah, except I got molested in the House of Mirrors by either one man or 100 identical men.<eos> Could've used a heads-up on that one.<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you who might want a heads-up:<eos> Liam Neeson.
Too chatty.<eos> Did you get a good look at him?<eos> Not really.<eos> It was night.<eos> He was a white guy.<eos> He was wearing a cap.<eos> Was there an emblem on the cap?<eos> No, just a black ball cap.<eos> What kind of car was he driving?<eos> Subaru.
He must have stolen another car to transport her to his burial ground.<eos> Burial ground?<eos> How many others?<eos> Seven remains so far... they're working through the night.<eos> - They're still digging.<eos> - The bodies have been there for years.<eos> It's down to skulls and bones.<eos> We're looking at dental records.<eos> Two hits so far.<eos> Any of your cold cases?
No, he did not.<eos> He did, however, say he was sure that she must have suffered.<eos> No doubt.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant Benson.<eos> You don't like me, do you, Sergeant?<eos> - Objection.<eos> Relevance.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Dr. Yates, confine your questions to the case.<eos> Okay, the case.
- You ever been to Spirit Lake?<eos> - In Connecticut? No.<eos> Well, not to brag, but I have mad gambling skills.<eos> I paid for my first car through online poker, at 16.<eos> - Isn't that illegal?<eos> - Totally.<eos> But this isn't.<eos> And hey, what better way to get over your breakup than to be around a bunch of girls who just want to have fun, right?<eos> As long as you don't use the phrase "girls just wanna have fun"<eos> -in front of any actual girls.
-Um, all the records are out here.<eos> -Not in Dominic's room.<eos> -Actually, there's another record player in my room.<eos> I was just telling Layla all about my other records.<eos> Come on.<eos> So, wanna see if we can find some beer?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Cool.<eos> Me too.
♪ Elementary 3x22 ♪ The Best Way Out Is Always Through Original Air Date on April 30,<eos> You hated it.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say "hated."<eos> I just never understood bands that are that angry.<eos> They are not angry.<eos> They're young.<eos> You're old.<eos> You act like I don't know you got a few months on me.<eos> If you are trying to talk me out of going back to my place, boy, you are doing a good job.<eos> Your place?
She was a patsy.<eos> We can't know that for sure yet, but we looked under every rock in her life when we thought she was on the run.<eos> Nobody leapt out as wanting her dead.<eos> Criminal judges, on the other hand, collect death threats as an occupational by-product.<eos> There were too many suspects on one side, not enough on the other.<eos> What most interests me, however, is the killer's choice of Trey McCann as coconspirator.<eos> McCann wasn't exactly a contract killer, so we think whoever hired him knew him well enough to think he would do it.<eos> I remembered...<eos> McCann's last gig was at a max facility in South Jersey, and it's owned by another for-profit company.<eos> Correctional Administration Group.
If we're right, I don't imagine that would play too well with your shareholders, would it?<eos> Then again, were it to reach the media that C.A.G. was hindering an investigation into a judge's murder, can't imagine that would play much better.<eos> Mr. Franklin, we have no interest in exposing your company's secrets.<eos> We only care about Trey McCann and his associates.<eos> You help us... how he came to know those associates never has to come to light.<eos> Tell you what--<eos> I will set you up in a room with the files on McCann.<eos> You can take as long as you like, but... nothing in writing leaves this building.<eos> If it does, the NYPD can look forward to a lawsuit.<eos> Fair enough?
This is, uh, Joan Watson.<eos> You know Detective Bell and Mr. Holmes.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> Everyone, come on in. I'm sorry I'm so pressed for time.<eos> No, it's us who should be apologizing to you.<eos> We're the ones who rescheduled on you this morning. It's not a problem.<eos> Happy to help the NYPD any way I can.<eos> Well, you must be busy, what with the new contract to take over the state prison in Union County.<eos> You got a lot riding on that, huh?<eos> As much as anybody here.
Right now, some other cop is arresting him, saying I gave him up.<eos> You want us to turn against each other, but we won't.<eos> We didn't do anything.<eos> But you did, as a matter of fact.<eos> You both got master's degrees.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, you both have your degrees in agriculture.<eos> But this scarlet academic hood that you're wearing denotes a degree in theology.<eos> It belongs to your lover, Everett Keck.<eos> Like many a theology major,
I can be there by, uh, noon tomorrow.<eos> - Where will you be?<eos> - Um,<eos> I need a public place.<eos> Somewhere crowded.<eos> Safe.<eos> A public place, somewhere crowded!<eos> Club Cachette, Rue Pasteur.<eos> Club Cachette, Rue Pasteur.<eos> - 12:00, noon.
Did you actually read the article?<eos> Because she says horrible things about me.<eos> Very well-crafted horrible things.<eos> Deep beneath that seething disdain she respects you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Supergirl, I mean.<eos> Her assistant, no, she couldn't give a rip about.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Right in the face.
Brandt, what the hell are you doing?<eos> He's one of them, chief.<eos> He makes things shake.<eos> So you brought him here?<eos> Yeah, we're gonna lock him up.<eos> He was resisting arrest.<eos> Guys...<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Dave's vision led us here...<eos> To him.
Back in '83,<eos> I woke up on that beach beside the Colorado kid.<eos> I thought I killed him, but...<eos> If this body is the same as his, then...<eos> Then you didn't him any more than you killed Joe Sena.<eos> You're just somehow connected to whatever did.<eos> So you need a new recruit, chief?<eos> Gonna need to see your resume first.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Not by choice.
How are we in the future?<eos> We have some rough times.<eos> You never gave me a break...<eos> Not once.<eos> That right, huh?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I was always afraid I was being too soft on you.<eos> You were trying to get me ready to do the job you'd been doing.<eos> When the Troubles came back, I didn't think I was ready, but it turns out that I was...<eos> Because of you.
Focus on what's ahead of you.<eos> That's right.<eos> Only thing I see in my rearview mirror is a handsome, eligible man who bowls in the 180s and makes one heck of a mock apple pie. (chuckles)<eos> Exactly. Thanks, man.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> Ah, glad I could help.<eos> Mike?<eos> Yeah.<eos> (choking up): I miss my old squad car.<eos> All right. Okay. All right.
You sure?<eos> Take your ski mask off... nice and slow.<eos> Aah!<eos> You'll be back!<eos> Pervert!<eos> Oh, why are we starting so early?<eos> Time to take this to the next level... moving targets.<eos> Ooh, that sounds like fun.<eos> What are we going to do... shoot some skeet?<eos> Pheasant.

That's quite a calendar.<eos> Actually, that one was all Whitney.<eos> Funny.<eos> Thought your application would be in already.<eos> And I thought you were only staying here for a year.<eos> I am, but with something like this up for grabs, it would be ludicrous not to throw my hat in the ring.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Do you want to throw your hat in early?<eos> I have to give the junior residents a tour<eos> - of the hospital, and I...
Sorry? "Thing"?<eos> - It's a thing?<eos> - Yeah, w...<eos> What do you think, that there's some inherent nobility in being working class?<eos> Marx said so.<eos> There you go.<eos> I knew it.<eos> You like trying to prove to me how smart you are, don't you?<eos> I got nothing to prove to anybody, especially a...<eos> A what?
and it's not that she's a stranger.<eos> Okay... It's great that you're feeling sympathy and you're eager to help.<eos> But, why does it have to be my house?<eos> Why?<eos> Okay, since you are the homeowner, you make the decision.<eos> If you call CEO Byun and tell her, that's the simplest way.<eos> What she does to her after is none of your concern, right?<eos> Why are you all doing this to me? Huh?<eos> I'm the only one that's trash?<eos> Oh, gosh! Really?
Your parents won't think of it that way as well.<eos> I'm sure they want you to stop thinking about what could've been.<eos> If anything... this whole time... you did so well on your own... and you worked hard.<eos> That's what they'll think.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> I want to get up. I thought... there would never be a reason for me to come here again.<eos> But I think I made the right decision to come here today.<eos> I'm glad I came here with you. From now on, whenever I hear the word amusement park...' I'm going to think about you.<eos> Me?
Good-bye. - Sizable sav...<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry, um, what was the question again?<eos> The names of some friends I can interview?<eos> Just to get a fuller picture?<eos> Can I have a think on that?<eos> Sure.<eos> Um, why don't we turn to...<eos> Will Gardner?

It's a lot of work.<eos> Oh, not really.<eos> - So, how's it going? - I don't know.<eos> They're trying to throw out the alibi.<eos> You know what?<eos> We're better lawyers now.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> We were young.<eos> Yeah, but there's still something I miss about it.<eos> What?
No, I think it's... neutral.<eos> Kalinda's gone.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you see her?<eos> No.<eos> Did you?<eos> She's not really one for good-byes.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.
He was worried about the photo array.<eos> That would be my guess.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Thank you for coming in, Detective Hardy.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's my job.<eos> In what way did the eyewitness, Evan Houston, I.D. my client?<eos> Was it by lineup or photo array?<eos> - Photo array.
Your aid?<eos> I have new allies.<eos> Do not worry your cowardly mind.<eos> I've already sent him back from whence he came.<eos> But his specter proved quite useful.<eos> Apparently our Countess has a weakness...<eos> Her ancient, rotting corpse is the secret to her longevity.<eos> Increase told me where to find it, and at the right moment, it and she will be mine.<eos> You trust him?<eos> Rather than you?
I owe you no explanation.<eos> This is my home.<eos> Now get out of it.<eos> I have this morning received a communication from Boston telling me of your banishment.<eos> Our elders forbade your returning to Salem.<eos> It's of no consequence.<eos> I was... meant to come back.<eos> You believe the law does not apply to you.<eos> I live by the law, sir...<eos> The highest law.
We'll be working out of this office.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> DA has set up a special task force to assist with the Kent investigation.<eos> All right, well, we're just getting started, so if we need a warrant or anything, we'll let you know.<eos> It's not gonna work that way, Danny.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I have instructions to ensure this investigation follows the letter of the law, so when charges are brought, they stand up in court.<eos> So you're here to babysit.<eos> On whose orders?
You wanted to see me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your boss tells me you asked off the Kent investigation.<eos> That's right.<eos> You mind telling me why?<eos> All due respect, I can't work a homicide in tap shoes.<eos> Meaning?<eos> And you know what it means.<eos> I'm sorry you find proper procedure such a burden.<eos> Proper procedure?
So why are you here?<eos> Well, um... we've been bucket listing and we've got some news for you, Jamie.<eos> After having several small sherries...<eos> David here... has asked me to be his good lady wife.<eos> We're getting married!<eos> No, Mum, you're not.<eos> I forbid it.<eos> Our family's already weird enough without that as my step-dad.<eos> I told you he'd be like this.<eos> Like what?
All right.<eos> I have three rules.<eos> One... listen to the nurses.<eos> Respect the nurses.<eos> Do whatever the nurses say.<eos> You may think you know more than the nurses.<eos> You do not.<eos> Two... your life is now all about me...<eos> Charge to 200.<eos> Not about you or your boyfriend...
We ready?<eos> Start the clock.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> I said no.<eos> I know what you said.<eos> If anything goes wrong in that O.R., it jeopardizes our entire surgical program.<eos> It could be the boy's only hope.<eos> I don't need you to defend the technique to me, Richard.<eos> I need you to follow orders.<eos> Orders?
I baptise thee, Katherine, in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> To you, gentle Father we humbly commit this child, so precious in your sight.<eos> Welcome her into your presence where there is no sorrow nor pain, but the fullness of peace and joy with you for ever and ever.<eos> Amen.<eos> Mr Marlott?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I know how prayer can prompt unwanted thoughts.<eos> Perhaps it might help you to share them.<eos> My wife and daughter died... on account of my carelessness.<eos> How terrible for you.

Phil-ibustering?<eos> Get it, Phil?<eos> 'Cause your name is Phil.<eos> No, yeah, I get it, Carol. Uh-huh. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> We cannot let that vote pass.<eos> - Not on our watch.<eos> - There's too much pork in that bill.<eos> - Way too much pork.
Speaking of my brother. Have you heard anything?<eos> The good news is, we have every reason to believe he's alive.<eos> There's no death certificate issued under his name, no john doe that fits his description.<eos> I mean, look, I can keep running his name through the system, but I gotta be honest-- unless he commits a crime, it's not easy to find someone who doesn't want to be found.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Verizon say neversettle.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> I- - I mean, hi.<eos> Anyhow, when Lena met Stef, Stef and I became fast friends.<eos> and then, lucky for me,
Never got shot at.<eos> And we can't say that, can we?<eos> We can talk about it though, you know.<eos> I know I need to.<eos> It's important.<eos> It's important for me, that's for sure.<eos> I didn't remember much after it happened.<eos> - But now sometimes...<eos> - You dream about it?<eos> Yeah, me too.
Well, leave it on my desk if it turns up.<eos> And no, no, I don't need anything. It's all here.<eos> - Hi. - You didn't buzz.<eos> Was I meant to?<eos> Obviously.<eos> Hi.<eos> You haven't changed.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't think I can.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Your loss.
I've put all my energies into this tower.<eos> I'm its midwife, so to speak.<eos> It looks like the unconscious diagram of some kind of psychic event.<eos> That's good.<eos> Can I use that?<eos> By all means.<eos> Of course, I'm a modernist by trade but you, a doctor, will understand one prescribes as required.<eos> That folly out there is for my wife.<eos> Her chief distraction is the careful cultivation of an intense sort of nostalgia.<eos> For what?
I've seen you at the gym, haven't I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You set a very good pace.<eos> So do you. Well, it takes a certain determination to row against the current.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Ah, Simmons, how are you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Won't be needing that.<eos> Cheap bastard.<eos> Wall?

Well, it takes a certain determination to row against the current.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Ah, Simmons, how are you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Won't be needing that.<eos> Cheap bastard.<eos> Wall?<eos> So, how long were you stuck?<eos> Not long, in the scheme of things.
Exactly.<eos> - Thank you, Helen, very much.<eos> - I wanna go home.<eos> I suspect Laing here has been charged with disseminating propaganda amongst the lower orders.<eos> The dangling carrot of friendship and approval.<eos> Look, Toby, try to fit in, all right?<eos> You want people to like you, don't you?<eos> The children were turned away from the pool this morning<eos> - for being too noisy.<eos> - Under whose authority?
So?<eos> How do you even know Scheibe?<eos> - Do you play?<eos> - No.<eos> No, somebody I used to know, she played him a lot.<eos> Okay, you want the gun, Charlie?<eos> - I'll give it to you.<eos> - All right. Fine, good, give it to me.<eos> But I want something back.<eos> The truth.
And it only took you, what, two weeks to become the Army's puppet.<eos> Come on. Enough fun, enough fun!<eos> I don't care what deal you made with the colonel.<eos> You are never stepping foot in the tech area again!<eos> What did Charlie mean when he said a deal with the colonel?<eos> Does that have to do with Frank's enlistment at all?<eos> I mean, sort of a quid pro quo?<eos> I mean, if you figure that out, let us know.<eos> Frank's not exactly in the business of explaining himself to us.<eos> Or to anyone, apparently.
Any mistakes, you're back on the jitney to whatever junior college you crawled out of.<eos> All right.<eos> Hello. Oh.<eos> A mandatory sit-down with our resident ink-slinger.<eos> Just before the clock strikes.<eos> You look like you need a drink.<eos> No, I'm back on land again.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - Seltzer and lime, please.<eos> Really?

All right, all right, all right, all right!<eos> You're gentlemen from Japan, not stevedores.<eos> Uh, if I can have everyone's attention for a minute?<eos> Eugene has been assigned to a post off-site.<eos> Which means the role of Ko-Ko is gonna have to be recast.<eos> If they give it to Dale, I'm gonna commit hara-kiri.<eos> Fortunately, we do have a man in the wings who has really stepped up and become a fine thespian over the last year.<eos> So, let's hear it for our new Ko-Ko...<eos> Jim Meeks.<eos> How about that?
I said I was sorry.<eos> I guess we all have things to atone for, right?<eos> Something you want to say to me, Charlie?<eos> I would like to... address an injustice.<eos> No!<eos> You bastard.<eos> You were right.<eos> I kept you off the test group for personal reasons.<eos> It had nothing to do with your talent.<eos> What personal reasons?
"I have loved you with a white-hot passion.<eos> Shrink not away from me."<eos> We have rules for a reason.<eos> If people see us talking...<eos> The Samurai gird for battle.<eos> Not with swords, but with pens.<eos> There's a petition going around.<eos> F.D.R. is forming a committee to decide how the gadget gets used.<eos> We want a seat at the table.<eos> We?
Boobs.<eos> I want boobs.<eos> 11 years on this planet, and I-I've never squeezed a fun bag.<eos> So you want to get to second base?<eos> Okay.<eos> I can give you some advice.<eos> - I don't want advice!<eos> - Shh.<eos> I want Dora.<eos> Dora?
Oh!<eos> I've been stabbed.<eos> I know too much.<eos> Oh, and here's your prize.<eos> Time's up, Pastor.<eos> Attention...<eos> I just want to say, it's... it's been a great fair so far, hasn't it?<eos> - Come on, give it up. - [applause and cheering] Yeah.<eos> And we owe it all to one person.<eos> No, not me... not MLK.
Gallagher is not a magician.<eos> He's a prop comic... and a genius.<eos> And I want my money.<eos> - Dora...<eos> - Now!<eos> Buddy, please... before Donna gives my spot to someone else.<eos> All right!<eos> All right.<eos> I'll go get it... right after I tend to a church member who's in desperate need of help.<eos> (Buddy) Me.
I feel sick. I could be sick.<eos> I should go home.<eos> Come on, you two!<eos> - Yeah, yeah!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Do you want to go now?<eos> I'm really suffering.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> No, I'm sure it'll be fine.<eos> I just...
I want a house with you, my career with you.<eos> Uh, maybe someday a dog, maybe.<eos> It's all supposed to be with you.<eos> I th... I thought you got that.<eos> I didn't think I needed to say it.<eos> So, when I say that I can't say no to my friend, it doesn't mean I'm saying no to you.<eos> I want you and all of it with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I just...
That was Uncle Jamal, not Ahmed.<eos> Sins of the father can't be blamed on his children.<eos> Right?<eos> Sammy.<eos> - (softly):<eos> Mom. - Sammy.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> So, where are we going?<eos> Uncle Yaser.<eos> Who?
Sins of the father can't be blamed on his children.<eos> Right?<eos> Sammy.<eos> - (softly):<eos> Mom. - Sammy.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> So, where are we going?<eos> Uncle Yaser.<eos> Who?<eos> This old queen. (chuckles)
Gabi, first, let me say that I appreciate that you actually came up with<eos> - a sensible plan. - I know. I know.<eos> But there's just one problem.<eos> I don't want strangers staying in my place, touching my things, sleeping in my bed with their drool and their parts.<eos> But Sofia...<eos> No, Gabi, the answer is no.<eos> Nobody can stay here.<eos> We may have a little bit of a situation.<eos> You rented out our apartment?<eos> To really cool people.
Gabi, you were so right.<eos> I mean, I have no money, no job, and I'll probably still have to move home to Florida, but I love my new smoky eyes.<eos> Aww, and I love your new attitude.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm just saying, you know, these past few months of you trying to get a job has made you kinda negative.<eos> Well, what can I tell you?<eos> Everything in my life sucks.<eos> I'm just saying I think you need to start shaking things up.<eos> Think outside the box. Start saying yes to life and new things...<eos> Like that guy over there.
- I don't care about the truck.<eos> - So then it's...<eos> Gabi?<eos> No.<eos> It's not about Gabi.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe I never thought about this.<eos> - Are you into her?<eos> - What?<eos> Me?
This is not gonna be easy, but I want you to know that I'm here for you, okay?<eos> - There she is, right there. - (Gasps)<eos> JoJo?<eos> (Gasps) What the hell?<eos> Did you bring her down here to do her happy dance and rub it all in my face?<eos> JoJo, you need help.<eos> I don't need any of her help.<eos> I actually got a job.<eos> A rich lawyer's on his way to hire me as his sexy paralegal.<eos> Oh, please, girl.
- Yeah.<eos> Wait, can we call it "Food. Yeah"?<eos> No, of course not, but don't get ahead of yourself.<eos> We have to impress this blogger first.<eos> She has over 5 million followers, but if she likes you, my investor will like you, and if she doesn't like you, well, your dream dies.<eos> You know what I just realized?<eos> What your failure as a parent is.<eos> You say you want to motivate me, but all you do is make me afraid of failing, which makes me fail.<eos> If it wasn't for you, I would've been the model,<eos> Model U.N. U.N.
And now I don't give a shit about the sneaker business.<eos> Well, I would have understood.<eos> Would you have?<eos> Look, Harvey, I appreciate what you did for me.<eos> If I'm ever back in business, you'll always be my lawyer.<eos> I'll always be your friend.<eos> - Louis, do you have a second?<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> What animal are you gonna call me now?<eos> An iguana?
(man) Squad coming out with the two firefighters.<eos> We need a medic!<eos> Got it.<eos> Two tugs, let's get her out.<eos> Okay.<eos> (Boden) Dawson, where are you?<eos> (Dawson) Chief, the room's lighting up.<eos> I can't get back to the window.<eos> Heading to the front.<eos> To the front.
We'll drink ourselves overboard, huh?<eos> Yeah. Sounds like a plan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is this?<eos> Yo, Chief Boden.<eos> Danny Borrelli.<eos> Jimmy's big brother.<eos> I'm over at Engine 67.<eos> Listen, uh, Jimmy told me about the whole misunderstanding<eos> - earlier... - Misunderstanding?
I don't know who I can trust.<eos> For all I know, they could be payin' him off.<eos> You gotta get Carter from under them, Hank.<eos> It's just a matter of time before they bust this whole unit and take him down the tubes with him.<eos> [cell phone vibrating] [male clears throat]<eos> Why don't you just shut it off?<eos> I can't.<eos> It's work.<eos> What'd you talk me into last night?<eos> Oh. Everything.
This is good.<eos> We stick to the plan.<eos> Carlos won't be able to resist.<eos> He'll purchase Paloma. and we'll follow him to Malvado's hideout.<eos> Carlos Madrigal.<eos> Leave the door open, anything'll walk in.<eos> Diana.<eos> So nice to see you.<eos> I need something... exceptional.<eos> Right to the point today.
But where is it now?<eos> Shall I trust a wasp not to sting?<eos> No.<eos> I will see my son first.<eos> No.<eos> No, you will tell me first.<eos> Or what?<eos> You have nothing to threaten me with.<eos> I'm dead, already destined to return to Hell.<eos> But you... you...
Human evil.<eos> And if so, it could be anyone, and they are more than likely hiding amongst us.<eos> So for the moment, I beg you, say no more of this.<eos> The last thing we should do is attract their attention.<eos> Look, the key is to understand what they're doing and to try and figure out how to stop them.<eos> But say too much too soon, and it'll be they who stop us forever.<eos> Here is where the witches would lead all of Salem, all the country, all the world...<eos> Into the open mouth of Hell.<eos> At last, you see the truth, my prodigal son.<eos> Truth?
Or perhaps, her love for her son is simply stronger than yours.<eos> Far from being her strength, it is her fatal weakness.<eos> And I have loved you in ways no woman ever has.<eos> Let us not be divided.<eos> Not now that we are so close to the goal.<eos> Your goal, you mean.<eos> I've begun to wonder whether my turn will ever come.<eos> Was not the star in the east once a sign of true redemption for all humanity?<eos> And perhaps this glorious comet from our lord... Promises hope.<eos> Salem... The new Jerusalem.
Why so philosophical on your wedding day?<eos> I fear Cotton is engaging in something dangerous tonight.<eos> I'm quite certain he is.<eos> Then you know what it is?<eos> All too well, which is why my errand with you now.<eos> If you are to ever see your husband again, you must heed me.<eos> Do you ever speak anything but threats?<eos> I promise you, my dear, it is not my threat but the countess' you must fear.<eos> Tonight, I will engage her in a kind of battle.<eos> Of wills, if nothing else.
I don't understand.<eos> He told me nothing, and you speak in riddles.<eos> Then I shall speak plainly.<eos> The countess herself told me that she would kill Cotton before all other puritans.<eos> You do not know this witch as I do.<eos> You cannot... you must not trust her.<eos> But instead, I should trust you?<eos> I do not ask you to trust me.<eos> Trust no one.<eos> Only yourself.
Nothing is lost if he yet lives.<eos> Fire runs through my veins like blood, and I will burn it before you even have time to blink.<eos> You began this vital rite, Mary.<eos> You alone unleashed a plague to devour hundreds of your kin!<eos> Not kin.<eos> Puritan hypocrites who branded my friend, drove away my love, and forced me to give up the only joy I had left!<eos> We all make sacrifices, Mary, and in these courageous acts, legends are born.<eos> No.<eos> I wanted freedom.<eos> For all.
No, Basil.<eos> We're a credit to both of them.<eos> Oh, and you should know.<eos> I'm a very big fan.<eos> So, you must have thought I was dead for a while. - Yeah.<eos> - How was that?<eos> Longest month of my life.<eos> It could only have been five minutes.<eos> I'll be the judge of time.<eos> Ice creams?
And Ahmos?<eos> Daliyah, I'm sorry.<eos> We have to go.<eos> SAMIRA: What are you doing?<eos> Answer me, Bakru.<eos> - (Daliyah whimpers) - Why have you left your post?<eos> Abu Omar told me to bring her to him.<eos> SAMIRA: I don't believe you.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Bakru.
!<eos> She went to rescue Jeff, and now they're gonna dissect her, too.<eos> Get me to that ship!<eos> Something tells me this isn't hair removal!<eos> What ... nothing?<eos> I'm trying to keep it light here.<eos> - Stop right there!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Brothers, we must stop the collection.<eos> - Hubbub, hubbub.
Get me to that ship!<eos> Something tells me this isn't hair removal!<eos> What ... nothing?<eos> I'm trying to keep it light here.<eos> - Stop right there!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Brothers, we must stop the collection.<eos> - Hubbub, hubbub.<eos> - Peas and carrots, peas and carrots.<eos> - Hubbub, hubbub.
Congratulations again.<eos> Just...wow.<eos> Guess what!<eos> You coming with me, too!<eos> Aw, we can't right now.<eos> We're clearing out Roger's clothes 'cause his closet's too small.<eos> Why don't you use this closet?<eos> Nothing in here but umbrella!<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Yay!
I think he likes her, but he's kind of awkward around her.<eos> Cameron, you can relate to that.<eos> - We're in the same class. - Oh, we are?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, that lab was killer.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> Oh, here.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - Yeah, you too.
You've got pixie dust on you.<eos> - And in my eye. Great.<eos> - Wait. I...<eos> You look like an angel.<eos> You look like a hero.<eos> No, but, seriously, thank you for helping me through the last couple of days.<eos> Well, that's what heroes do.<eos> Then again, you would know.<eos> Kelli is alive because of you.<eos> - Because of us. - Okay, fine.
Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.<eos> You've made me your brother-in-arms, and I thank you for that.<eos> And Kate.<eos> Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.<eos> And then you walked through the door.<eos> And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right... you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.<eos> This is because of you.<eos> Because of us.
You didn't mention that Stef was white when you started dating her.<eos> What?<eos> How am I supposed to have a conversation with Nate now?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Don't you think it would be just a little bit offensive with his black girlfriend sitting in the next room?<eos> No. It shouldn't, should it?<eos> I think it was a brilliant way to shut me down.<eos> Really, Lena?<eos> You think he's dating an African-American woman just to prove to you that he's not racist?<eos> Or to himself.
What I do have--clinical depression, social anxiety.<eos> A day job, a night job, confusing relationships.<eos> Others depending on me.<eos> Taking down the largest corporation in the world.<eos> And I chose it all.<eos> This line has wanted to own me my whole life.<eos> Biosynthesized in some lab in Mexico, packed into a pill, shipped to the states where it was packaged with a logo and taxed by the government, stolen by a bribed guard, sold to a Vera henchman, then oversold to Shayla, and then to me.<eos> It needs me just as much as I need it.<eos> The moment was destined, every choice bringing me closer to this one line.<eos> This line.
How does that not sound the most selfish thing I could think of?<eos> Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Busy day, Padre?<eos> - Oh, no rest for the wicked.<eos> Ditto.<eos> New reports coming in every day now.<eos> Ah, yes, it's all beginning to get predictably nasty.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> - And you.
Sorry, Peter.<eos> We had to trick you guys or you wouldn't have come.<eos> No. You can't make me.<eos> I'll get hit with a coconut so I lose my memory of this.<eos> Aah!<eos> I remember everything!<eos> I was abused by my dad!<eos> Lois, I can't believe you tricked us into coming on a couples counseling retreat.<eos> I do not like being lied to.<eos> Me neither.
If I wanted to give her a depressing name, I would've gone with Phantom Menace.<eos> And she doesn't hate you.<eos> She just feels like you don't put enough energy into the relationship.<eos> And she is not gonna let herself be a bit player in your grand drama.<eos> At least that's what she insinuated to me.<eos> Sorry, New Hope.<eos> I can't be trusted with secrets.<eos> I am serious about this.<eos> I think someone's feeling sorry for herself.<eos> - Who, me?
DI River?<eos> On... On seeing and approaching the car, DI River identified it as the same...<eos> Yes?<eos> So, you are confident Mr Riley IS Jackie Stevenson's killer?<eos> No, we cannot confirm that, but the vehicle he was driving has been identified as the vehicle driven by DS Stevenson's killer.<eos> Well, I ask Detective Inspector River, you are confident there will be justice, Inspector?<eos> All murderers are punished eventually... unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.<eos> For now, we have no further comments.<eos> Thank you. Thank you very much indeed.<eos> Psychs.
I hate carnations.<eos> * I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that * Oh, no It's not the things you do... *<eos> Don't let her bully you, and don't eat anything.<eos> It'll be out-of-date, frozen shit.<eos> - Hello, Frankie.<eos> - All right?<eos> No-one got to bed till it had gone five.<eos> Will you hurry up?<eos> The service is at St Mark's.<eos> At the top.
Blue Mondeo.<eos> And that looks like...<eos> She never told you?<eos> She never said?<eos> He was right. Jimmy was right.<eos> I missed it.<eos> You didn't think you were the only one, did you?<eos> That's lovely.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Straight through.
Thanks.<eos> Telemarketers.<eos> I swear there should be tougher laws against them.<eos> Well, if you hadn't turned down the chance to run for State Senate, you could have passed some.<eos> Wow. I love this.<eos> I'm gonna cherish this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, I have got a meeting at 1PP.<eos> - Knock 'em dead.<eos> - Thanks.
Nice to finally meet you. Bring it on in.<eos> Come here.<eos> Great news, huh, Ricky?<eos> My wife's sleeping with my brother, not my personal chef... what a relief.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> Y-y-your wife is having an affair with your brother and you're happy about it?<eos> Hell, I got four other brothers, but my chef is one in a million.<eos> His spicy clams are to die for.<eos> Thanks again for solving my case, Ricky.<eos> You and your associate.

She's ignoring me.<eos> Just like every other woman in his life.<eos> Shut up.<eos> So, your wife is not answering her cell, and we need her authorization for more officers down here.<eos> Is she with you?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She's at a meeting at 1PP.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We're working on a case.<eos> You interested?
But it's not without its charms.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Love your accent, by the way.<eos> Very posh.<eos> Where did you learn to speak like that?<eos> Not from the slums she grew up in.<eos> And definitely not from your mom, who's at the tail end of a 20-year prison bid.<eos> Oh, then not wanting to follow in mum's footsteps, you joined the metropolitan police service.<eos> - And that was an epic fail. - Yeah, they booted you out because of your tendency to cut legal corners.<eos> Allegedly.
- I don't know!<eos> Come on, Castle.<eos> No woman is worth dying for.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where is she? !<eos> I believe that you're telling the truth.<eos> I do.<eos> I believe that you're telling me the truth.<eos> But unfortunately, that means it's time for you to die.<eos> Sorry about that.
But unfortunately, that means it's time for you to die.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Lights out.<eos> Castle. Are you okay?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Why haven't you called?<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Kate, what's going on?<eos> I...
No, no, I'm... I'm... not going anywhere near Bobbi.<eos> Fine. I'll take it to her myself.<eos> Wouldn't want you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.<eos> Yeah, I know that's sarcasm, and I'm choosing to accept your thoughtfulness at face value.<eos> Mack, you should head downstairs, assist Skye with intake.<eos> - Daisy.<eos> - Daisy. Damn it.<eos> Hard for us to get used to, huh?<eos> Mm... no.<eos> No, just you.
Oh, of course not.<eos> Nepotism bad.<eos> Actually, we can do it right now if you want.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Now, can you tell me the difference Between regular coffee and decaffeinated coffee?<eos> Regular coffee has caffeine?<eos> Oh, you totally had me.<eos> Come in this afternoon and we'll get you started.<eos> Nepotism yay!
So, you're pretty new to k.C., right?<eos> Eh, moved here last fall.<eos> Where are you from originally?<eos> Oh, you know... All over.<eos> Cool.<eos> What was your favorite place to live?<eos> (sighs) I don't really have one.<eos> Well, what was one place that you liked?<eos> Well, I actually like kansas city.<eos> Me too.
- Who else?<eos> Who else?<eos> - Well, how did you come by this bruise?<eos> I banged it.<eos> - Pat!<eos> What have you been telling people?<eos> - I haven't told anyone anything.<eos> But people aren't blind, and they're not deaf.<eos> Well, whatever you think you've seen and heard, you're wrong.<eos> All of you.
And I let her live there.<eos> I should know better. Why don't I learn?<eos> I take in strays because they're sad.<eos> They're lonely and homeless.<eos> The truth is strays are flea-ridden creatures who pee on your stuff.<eos> Am I a stray?<eos> I mean, she acts like I'm some kind of animal, when who does the dishes?<eos> Me.<eos> Who makes sure the piles and piles of dirty laundry are fluffed and folded?<eos> Me.
Mother of David Brindsley?<eos> Yes.<eos> Telegram for you.<eos> Oh, you...<eos> You must have the wrong address.<eos> Please.<eos> - I'm very sorry.<eos> Left...<eos> left, right, left...<eos> left...
Any of them could be out for revenge.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Use it to help us find who did this.<eos> There is no time to waste here, people.<eos> Booth done sit in this office ten years.<eos> Believe me, I wish he was here.<eos> So what was Booth doing with a gun?<eos> He didn't need it to teach at Quantico.<eos> Must've been one hell of a problem if he didn't come to me.<eos> Or me.
It's not really a to-go situation.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> It's not for people to just take it and go.<eos> This isn't New Orleans.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I just took Dr. Ramusami to the train station.<eos> What's up with you, man?<eos> Nothing much.
You'll be wearing mech suits to defend yourself.<eos> This is what they look like, just in case you'd like to know.<eos> Um, but honestly, most of this is gonna be done in post.<eos> It's kind of meaningless.<eos> We really don't even need you here.<eos> It's gonna be 99% CGI.<eos> But having said that, let's go to your marks.<eos> Action!<eos> They're coming!<eos> Battle stations.
I mean, she volunteered, so...<eos> You don't take volunteers on a sinking ship, Paul.<eos> Just saying.<eos> - Hey, Mike.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Canang sari.<eos> It's a daily offering.<eos> An offering to who?<eos> Gods, ancestors, demons.
In exchange, he gets a prepaid cell phone, no return address.<eos> Couple days later, the shipping container shows up at the port.<eos> He goes to the port, puts a cargo box from the container into his trunk.<eos> He doesn't know what's in it.<eos> He just knows there's 50K payable upon delivery, so he waits for the phone to ring.<eos> And today, when we were in lockup, it rang.<eos> Mike, are you okay?<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - Just a sec.
Remind me never to work for you.<eos> They seem to steal less if they fear mutilation.<eos> Oh. Give us a hand, will you?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> Just... Here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, I was, uh, actually wondering if maybe I could get you to put your realtor hat on for a minute.<eos> You mean the charm of drunken roughnecks on your porch is wearing off already?<eos> Yeah, well, for me, at least.
Don't even think about taking on another job until you get Nirvana 22 up and running.<eos> We'll get right on that, Mr. Briggs.<eos> Very good.<eos> Thank you, Bobby.<eos> Looking forward to working with you.<eos> I mean, owning all parts of the process, it just... It makes sense.<eos> Rock Springs response is a great investment on its own.<eos> It's a 10 bagger in 2 years.<eos> You mean 10 times the investment.<eos> At least.
Where's Billy?<eos> What the hell happened out there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I told you to take him out there and show him around, not give him an MMA demonstration.<eos> You told me this was our play, that we were doing this together.<eos> We're bringing it online together.<eos> Capitalizing it is my department.<eos> You said this was my birthright.<eos> Shouldn't I have a say on who's gonna be involved,<eos> - or at the very least...
One thing, Wick.<eos> If you're gonna be in this with me...<eos> I mean, really in this...<eos> You got to stay focused.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You've got to eat, drink, and sleep oil.<eos> When you go to bed at night, you got to dream about oil.<eos> When you rise in the morning, you got to be thinking about oil.<eos> You can't let anything...<eos> Not a woman, not even a good woman...
I'm a soldier. I can handle myself.<eos> I'll be fine, I swear.<eos> Okay. Just be careful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is this?<eos> Is this some kind of a trick?<eos> You're... me.<eos> Well, now you're just stating the obvious.<eos> It's time you and I had a little conversation about our destiny.<eos> Our destiny?
It's not enough, Michael.<eos> What are you holding on to, David?<eos> There's no one left to fight for except yourself.<eos> Survive.<eos> Your humanity is hanging by a thread.<eos> Cut it.<eos> Bow down to me.<eos> All the horrible things I've done...<eos> You're right... about me.<eos> About everything.
Wear a fucking band on my wrist or something.<eos> Nah, man.<eos> Just... just... Just live life and don't be so fucking scared of everything.<eos> Man: Last call, guys.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> We're not done drinking.<eos> Are we done drinking?<eos> - Back to your place?<eos> - To my place?
I'll call you about the shoot, okay?<eos> Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - You know what I want you to do? - Hmm?<eos> I want you to call me about this photo shoot 'cause I'm... I'm very intrigued by it.<eos> I'm very intrigued by it.<eos> But also, um, I would like to thank you for your generosity... And also...<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And...<eos> Goodbye to you.
Just drive on over and get what you need.<eos> They've got sodas, beers, gummy worms.<eos> You know, kinda like Benny's, but, you know, uh, no dead father figures lying' on the floor.<eos> Send them boys to hell, Frederico.<eos> Look, you guys wanna take out Malvado, rob him blind, go ahead.<eos> It's only gonna help me do what I gotta do.<eos> - Which is what?<eos> - He's got something that's gonna put us all in a world of trouble.<eos> - I gotta get it back.<eos> - No dice, homeslice.
- We can't.<eos> I gotta fix this.<eos> You can't fix it, because it was sabotaged by him.<eos> I didn't...<eos> - What the hell did you do?<eos> - You said it yourself.<eos> We can't trust these snakes.<eos> Loyalty is most prized, Greely.<eos> But your loyalty was not to us.<eos> This half-breed?
Should we find you an attorney and call off this wedding?<eos> No, it wasn't Danny.<eos> You can't answer that unless you revoke your rights. Thank you, Captain.<eos> Okay, then I don't plead the Fifth.<eos> It wasn't Danny who hit me.<eos> It was Lisa.<eos> But that is not like her.<eos> She almost never hits me.<eos> - Your fiancée has hit you before?<eos> - Not in the head.
- Are you better?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tell me... why did you kiss me in the car?<eos> I wanted to.<eos> And because of... your charm, your attentiveness, your nature, full of life.<eos> Your finesse, your look, your capacity for joy, and also...<eos> Also, you're very beautiful.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm dining with friends.<eos> "Friends"?
Oh my...<eos> My lovely little Pascal.<eos> May I?<eos> Wow, that's...<eos> That's a lot of muscle! Oh dear...<eos> She's not keen to share!<eos> Even in hard times.<eos> She could help her feckless friend a bit.<eos> No?<eos> Her feckless friend.
And take you by the hand<eos> And stay with you till morning<eos> Share your bohemian lifestyle<eos> But why should I delude myself?<eos> Young man, come, look at me<eos> Bastien, say hello.<eos> See the wrinkles on my face<eos> Bastien, Lucas, Jeanne.<eos> - Hello, Bastien.<eos> - Hello.
But, honestly, I don't really care what you say or you do, short of slapping nuns.<eos> I need to know that you're being straight up with me.<eos> - 'Cause if I go to bat for you, I'm gonna need to know everything.<eos> - You got it all, okay?<eos> - You sure?<eos> I promise you I didn't do shit.<eos> - Damn! - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Cannonball, baby!<eos> What the fuck?
- There, we're friends.<eos> - All right.<eos> Vamonos, mis amigos.<eos> - Let's go talk shop, yeah? - All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> The fuck am I doing?<eos> I think as we begin to take a closer look at player safety, there will have to be some rule changes.<eos> The players and fans say that you've been firm but fair, but what happens when you start penalizing these guys for the new contact violations?<eos> Well, there will be an adjustment period for everyone. But this is what is best for our players, for the fans, and for the future of our game.<eos> - For the future of the game?
- All right.<eos> Vamonos, mis amigos.<eos> - Let's go talk shop, yeah? - All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> The fuck am I doing?<eos> I think as we begin to take a closer look at player safety, there will have to be some rule changes.<eos> The players and fans say that you've been firm but fair, but what happens when you start penalizing these guys for the new contact violations?<eos> Well, there will be an adjustment period for everyone.

Shit, you know how much I love trains.<eos> Let me tell you something, I think it's the fucking league.<eos> Oh, shit, that's for real, man.<eos> Eyes and spies. 'Tis the world we live in.<eos> You sound really fucking weird right now.<eos> That's probably just our connection.<eos> - How'd it go with Reggie and Vernon?<eos> - Oh, Reggie's right here. - Say hi.<eos> - What up, though, Spen...<eos> - Spence?
Blue said that the wand is at the center of Storybrooke, so we're here at the clock tower, the geographic center of Storybrooke.<eos> But there's nothing here, except, you know, the clock.<eos> Well, slow down and tell me what you want from me.<eos> You cast the curse, you made the town, you must know what Blue meant.<eos> Of course.<eos> The fairies breathe love and hope, right?<eos> So when a fairy talks about the center of Storybrooke...<eos> She means the heart of Storybrooke...<eos> Granny's.<eos> Granny's.
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't let you cast this.<eos> You're his fairy godmother.<eos> Why won't you let me save him?<eos> Because the cost is too high.<eos> You're trying to create something that never should be...<eos> A terrible curse, a dark curse.<eos> It will save my son.<eos> It will send the child destined to destroy him far away, to a land without magic.<eos> Not just that child...
As someone who has made the very same decision,<eos> I know a lie when I hear it.<eos> You sentenced me to a life of cowardice.<eos> I altered your fate so that we could be a family together.<eos> Everything I did was for you, to protect you.<eos> It's a vile, dangerous world, son.<eos> Because of villains like you... and me.<eos> Then you know that, if my choice was wrong... I did it out of love.<eos> I'm sorry I caused you pain.<eos> And what about Gideon?
He's blocking our efforts to learn the truth, and we're not gonna let him get away with it!<eos> Justicia!<eos> No more!<eos> No more!<eos> Justicia!<eos> Jones passes to Major, who scores!<eos> Oh, Major, baby! Hey!<eos> What are we, in high school?<eos> Geez!<eos> - Right at home.
This is the most serious call of the day?<eos> A noise complaint?<eos> Sorry to disappoint you.<eos> It's not all action all the time, Nicky.<eos> 85% of the job's just dealing with the public.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> We got a call about loud music coming from this apartment.<eos> Everything okay, ma'am?<eos> Yes. Hello, Officer.<eos> No problem at all.
- What?<eos> - Mom thinks when talk stops in a group, it's either 20 minutes before or 20 minutes after the hour.<eos> It's true.<eos> Nah, that's bunk.<eos> Plus I see more long faces than the finish line at Belmont.<eos> Some of us had a long week, Pop.<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty much all talked out myself.<eos> Yeah, well, that's what happens when you talk out of both sides of your mouth.<eos> What? Ixnay.<eos> Nothing.
What, since she wasn't arrested for aiding and abetting a domestic act of terrorism?<eos> No, I haven't, and I don't think that anyone else should, either.<eos> Shelby, she's part of the team.<eos> We can't ignore her.<eos> We can try.<eos> Just for that crack, you're driving.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> DéjÃ vu.<eos> For you, sure.
The great Alex Parrish has never been unmoored.<eos> You're a national hero.<eos> You'll always be wanted somewhere.<eos> Me, well, truth be told, MI6... didn't really want me.<eos> They just wanted to use me as long as they needed.<eos> Even Charlotte couldn't get me back in there.<eos> So I took a job.<eos> It was private security for Barclays.<eos> That's why I was at the G20.<eos> Nothing glamorous.
I will be professional.<eos> I will, too.<eos> Maxine wants to know if you want to come over for dinner next week.<eos> That's a little weird.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Freedom of speech?<eos> I totally agree.<eos> So... if you don't mind, I will just tell her you're busy.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Good night.
Farrell Putnam, the so-called "Death Star" law firm which Kotite hired to defend him.<eos> They've got offices all over the world, including here in New York.<eos> So, while I pop in on them, you and Kitty go and visit the widow Durning.<eos> This is her address.<eos> Why don't you take Kitty?<eos> I know you two have a lot to catch up on.<eos> I'm surprised we got a meeting with the managing partner so easily.<eos> Well, I didn't identify myself as Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, but rather Sherlock Holmes, son of Morland.<eos> He and a firm like this could do great, evil things together.<eos> About last night...
He was a paranoid schizophrenic.<eos> That didn't come up in any of our research.<eos> Well, of course it didn't.<eos> It was a best kept secret at the firm.<eos> When he was on his meds, he was one of the finest legal minds on the planet.<eos> When he was off them... well, let's just say he was prone to outbursts.<eos> What kind of outbursts?<eos> Ranting, raving.<eos> "The Russians are talking to me through my television."<eos> That sort of thing.
This one Archie's playing with drowned in the bathtub.<eos> And this one in the kitchen dined on arsenic.<eos> That mess on the floor is doll vomit.<eos> Where's Sherlock?<eos> He's gone back to the precinct to get what he's working on.<eos> Is there something wrong?<eos> Where did you get that from?<eos> A trunk in the guest room.<eos> Why?<eos> No reason.
There's just, like, a 50/50 chance that's a Victorian sex toy.<eos> Ooh, ooh. Come on, you've got to hear this.<eos> So the next voice you're gonna hear is Tom Saunders.<eos> He's the attorney who defended Eli Kotite.<eos> No.<eos> I object, My Lord.<eos> To what, Mr. Saunders?<eos> Mr. Saunders, you said you object.<eos> - I do, to all of it.<eos> - "All of it"?
So?<eos> Anson Gephardt clearly went rogue a long time ago.<eos> He couldn't use proper DIA channels to influence this election, so I submit that he persuaded one of Saunders' corporate clients to help him.<eos> Why does a Middle Eastern affairs analyst care about Venezuela?<eos> That's a good question, but it's not the question.<eos> I'd like to know which of Farrell Putnam's clients was so keen to keep President Orozco in power that they decided to grease the skids with blood.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> You gonna go knocking on the doors of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, asking if they were accessories to mass murder?<eos> We're gonna darken one doorway, and there won't be any knocking.<eos> Anything promising back there?
Would I?<eos> You said we should dig into the files to see if they could help us figure out Gephardt's next move, but he's made his next move:<eos> put the files online.<eos> Do you really think he's finished?<eos> I don't know if he's finished.<eos> I just- - Are the files really the best way to find him?<eos> He gave them to literally everyone.<eos> Would he really have done that if there was a clue in them as to his whereabouts?<eos> Maybe they're just an excellent way of avoiding talking to me.<eos> Oh, for goodness' sake.
Ooh, that was a big one.<eos> I think you got a little linebacker in there.<eos> No way.<eos> He's a sensitive soul.<eos> I'm thinking... poet.<eos> I hate to break it to you, honey, but you're carrying eight pounds of pure American bull rider right here.<eos> No, painter.
But, hey, have a great day.<eos> Your daughter loves you.<eos> Say "I love you."<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on, I can handle your dad.<eos> - No, for my blueberry pancakes.
Come on, I can handle your dad.<eos> - No, for my blueberry pancakes.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well...<eos> Your wife's death wasn't an accident.<eos> I think Gideon killed her.<eos> Miranda Riggs!<eos> El Paso, Texas.<eos> September 15, 2015.
You're Snapchat gold.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Man...<eos> I-I get what you're doing here, Rog.<eos> It's "Dad" or "sir."<eos> And what am I doing?<eos> You're worried I'm about to graduate, and you want to bond.<eos> I get that.<eos> But what about a ball game?<eos> Too many other people around.
I want everyone ready to go soon as we land.<eos> Got it, Lieutenant.<eos> Herrmann, bring the rope bag.<eos> You have to expect the worst.<eos> Help!<eos> [panicked shouting] We're gonna need every company in the city.<eos> Hey, what is this place?<eos> A club?<eos> The place just went up! [coughing]<eos> - How many inside?
Take her to Baghdad.<eos> - Copy.<eos> - Tachypneic and tachycardic.<eos> Sats are marginal.<eos> Hey, Lexi, I'm here.<eos> She's awake.<eos> She's awake.<eos> Natalie, with me.<eos> What kind of body surface area are we talking?<eos> Sixty percent.
And now you've got a simple incendiary device.<eos> Drop the bag on the floor, you step on the bulb with your heel, and just walk away.<eos> Chemical reaction would start right away.<eos> Instructions are easy to find with a quick Internet search.<eos> Kelly, hey. There is someone to see you on the amp floor.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I can't imagine what the last 24 hours have been like.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You came all the way up here to check on me?<eos> Sort of.
We had lunch last week.<eos> I said, you know, you've given this guy two years.<eos> It's time, you know, to pursue your own dreams.<eos> And so I went back that next day and she had her bag packed.<eos> So I opened the car door but, uh, she just shook her head.<eos> She was crying.<eos> You know, she couldn't leave him.<eos> "He needs me, Dad."<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> Yeah, for a lot of people.
- six months ago?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He kept me out of that stuff.<eos> When he killed himself at the firehouse, he had an unregistered gun.<eos> Why would he be walking around with that?<eos> He was being threatened.<eos> - By who?<eos> - He didn't say, but he started to get really paranoid.<eos> Threatened about what?<eos> Money.
All right, Lindsay and Halstead should be right there.<eos> - Have them respond.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> - [gunshots] - [grunting, shouting] Get out of the way!<eos> Stop, police!<eos> 5021 George.<eos> Armed offender fleeing westbound on 29th Street.<eos> Get me some cars!<eos> Out of the way!
They were able to identify the logo on the right shoulder of the suspect's jacket.<eos> The brand is ForeRange.<eos> The cargo jacket looks like the one the suspect is wearing.<eos> There's five retail stores in Chicago that carry the brand.<eos> They're sending me the last six months of security footage and all their cash and their credit card transactions.<eos> All right, Kev, what's up with the tip you got on K.D.?<eos> Yeah, we got 85 registered gang bangers with those initials in our database.<eos> And I cross-referenced the initials K.D.<eos> with everyone who's contacted Kimball's phone.<eos> Nothing.
And that guy had been by here three times to talk to Barry.<eos> He was bringing nothing but bad news.<eos> Next thing you know, 39 young people get called home way before their time.<eos> I'll go get you that license plate number.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Boss, ran the plate.<eos> Came back to a Kade Davis.<eos> - Kade Davis?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 26 years old, 5'8, 170 pounds.
Appreciate it.<eos> Boss, ran the plate.<eos> Came back to a Kade Davis.<eos> - Kade Davis?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 26 years old, 5'8, 170 pounds.<eos> No criminal history, though.<eos> - Get a photo array together.<eos> Him.<eos> No doubt in my mind.
And this guy stood... stood next to me.<eos> He was wearing a dark jacket and a... and a hat.<eos> And he was holding a paper bag.<eos> He walked over to the side and he... he dropped the paper bag on the floor.<eos> And then stepped on it.<eos> Then he kicked it behind the couch.<eos> He... he started to walk away and then the bag burst into flames.<eos> Do you remember anything else about him?<eos> Uh, he was a little bit taller than me.<eos> So, 5'8, maybe.
The biggest client at your mama's former firm.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I just got off the phone with him, and he fired the firm because I left.<eos> What?<eos> Dad, you're gonna die.<eos> Two dozen Wagyu Kobe Ribeye.<eos> That's the meat of kings.<eos> It's-it's like he can read my heart.<eos> What does he want?<eos> What?
Not anymore.<eos> I just got off the phone with him, and he fired the firm because I left.<eos> What?<eos> Dad, you're gonna die.<eos> Two dozen Wagyu Kobe Ribeye.<eos> That's the meat of kings.<eos> It's-it's like he can read my heart.<eos> What does he want?<eos> What?<eos> What?
Okay.<eos> Okay, I know that wasn't Todd, and I'm the only one in here.<eos> So who are you performing for?<eos> I think I just like doing it.<eos> Okay, that's weird, but whatever.<eos> Well, you might want to call Todd back, because that info you asked for...<eos> Outgoing calls from our bullpen?<eos> I noticed two curious international calls from one particular extension.<eos> We have a leak, don't we, Captain?<eos> Which extension?
Now, the city attorney would like to have a word with you, so I will give you the office.<eos> Please try not to break anything?<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> It was policy.<eos> And I wanted to protect you.<eos> I know how you react when people you care for are threatened, hurt, or worse.<eos> Look, the situation with Palmer... it's not what you think.<eos> For your sake...
What's up?<eos> Something wrong?<eos> I have to tell you something, and I think once I do, you're not gonna want me to stay.<eos> Well, I doubt that, but you can give it a shot.<eos> When I was in your trailer and I saw the photo of your wife Miranda, I thought I recognized her, like I'd seen her before.<eos> And I should have said something to you, but I didn't.<eos> I was really hoping I was wrong, but it turns out, uh...<eos> Where have you seen her before?<eos> In a DEA file.<eos> Ten months ago, uh,
We've received reports of hate crimes and protests over the veto of a registry in multiple cities.<eos> Our latest poll says that in the wake of the bombing...<eos> Nice shirt.<eos> Than ever before and would even consider...<eos> Good morning.<eos> - How long you been up?<eos> - Long enough to know your job is about to get a little bit harder.<eos> A matter of national security?<eos> All my texts are, even the ones from you.<eos> Especially the ones from me.
Then you won't be here.<eos> Got it.<eos> No, I won't be able to fix it.<eos> Well, you haven't been able to fix it thus far, have you?<eos> I want a meeting.<eos> Now.<eos> I want to call a truce.<eos> Get here before 3:00.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Anything?
We brought you along thinking you were an FBI agent.<eos> Look, I went to Quantico.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I sure hope so, because we'll need to operate under Miranda's nose to get the proof that gets us a mistrial.<eos> All right, juror names should be easy to find on the FBI server.<eos> Setting up a secure site to send names to the bunker.<eos> All right, Owen and Ryan can do a deep dive into the jurors, see if there's any evidence that they've been compromised, evidence we can use to question them.<eos> As FBI agents, we just say we're investigating credible threats.<eos> What do we tell Miranda?<eos> Nothing.
This is my associate Jane.<eos> We have some questions as a part of an ongoing investigation.<eos> We're looking into a courier service.<eos> I know the best one.<eos> Speedy Ace, same day in Manhattan.<eos> Place your order with me by noon, get it wrapped and ready by the end of the day.<eos> Have you ever worked with a courier by the name of Lelantos?<eos> Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I mainly deal with Ethan or Ed.<eos> How about this symbol, hmm?
Well, he probably never imagined that his girlfriend would be the reason he'd go down.<eos> Nope.<eos> I think you were right.<eos> Could you do a background check on Oliver?<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah. I mean... hopefully, there's nothing, but at least I'll know.<eos> Okay, what's his name?<eos> - Oliver Kind.<eos> - Birthday.<eos> November 6, 1979.
You sure nothing's missing?<eos> I was telling the truth, I honestly don't know.<eos> I do.<eos> This looks like research that Azoff was doing on one of the items I assume he stole.<eos> He took a photograph of it in this room, presumably to help him sell it, but it's not here now.<eos> We've been working under a misconception, that the Lady Frances was a woman, but it's not.<eos> It's a stolen vintage guitar.<eos> Worth around $5 million.<eos> So Azoff was shot over a guitar?<eos> Uh, not just any guitar.
This is a mistake!<eos> You got the wrong guy!<eos> No.<eos> We know you took her.<eos> You're keeping her somewhere.<eos> And the gentleman you took her from would like her back.<eos> It's got a good beat.<eos> I think the jury's gonna dance to it.<eos> Mr. Wolf, you want us to prove you were the last one to own Frances?<eos> No problem.
He killed Jameel in 2005.<eos> He wanted to kill you as well, but you went to prison.<eos> Now that you're out, he's just picking up where he left off.<eos> A few weeks before Jameel got shot, we went down to Atlantic City, met up with some dudes he knew.<eos> The first night we needed some money, so we held up a liquor store.<eos> The owner killed one of the dudes, and that dude's brother blamed me and Jameel, said he was gonna kill us, so we got our asses out of there.<eos> We came home and we didn't think nothing else of it.<eos> And then Jameel got killed.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.
If you say so.<eos> Shit dive, by the way.<eos> I'm 5p short.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You all right, Jenny?<eos> It's been a long time since anyone's asked me that.<eos> Really?<eos> I owe you 5p.<eos> Maybe we could get that coffee.<eos> How about a carrot cake?
I told you not to come to the hospital any more.<eos> - I didn't mean anything by it.<eos> - This is serious, Sam.<eos> Kathy's been suspended.<eos> She's in a real state.<eos> Well, she's always in a flap.<eos> Maybe she made a mistake?<eos> But I know her. She's a brilliant nurse.<eos> She does like a drink.<eos> No more than anyone else.
I've done something terrible.<eos> You can tell me.<eos> You can tell me. It's all right.<eos> I told Sam his dad is dead.<eos> And he's not.<eos> Right.<eos> So where is he now?<eos> Glenford prison.<eos> How long's he been inside?<eos> 12 years.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's not though, is it?<eos> My mum died.<eos> People say it gets better, but it's just shit.<eos> - I don't bite.<eos> - I know.<eos> What is it about you?<eos> I can't put my finger on it.<eos> On what?
Everything's going to be OK.<eos> You'll see.<eos> That looks nice.<eos> - Leg or breast?<eos> - I told you not to bother.<eos> Breast, then.<eos> It's the best bit.<eos> There you are.<eos> How much did that set you back?<eos> 20 quid?
There you are.<eos> How much did that set you back?<eos> 20 quid?<eos> It's only Christmas once a year.<eos> 25?<eos> Gran, let's not worry about that now.<eos> I'll worry about what I bloody well want.<eos> And my turkey, right, Bill?<eos> That's right. I found the tin.<eos> Just the tin, mind.
Still strange without Mum.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here's to her.<eos> Mum.<eos> I'm not going to toast that bloody woman.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Just cos she's dead doesn't make it less true.<eos> Mum, please.<eos> Chrissy doesn't need this. I don't want another repeat...<eos> Of what?
Yeah.<eos> Here's to her.<eos> Mum.<eos> I'm not going to toast that bloody woman.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Just cos she's dead doesn't make it less true.<eos> Mum, please.<eos> Chrissy doesn't need this. I don't want another repeat...<eos> Of what?<eos> The whole last 20 years bit?
You know it was the nurse, the nurse that looked after you so well.<eos> - Well, that's her job. - Yeah.<eos> And that's why I came back here, to look after you.<eos> - But every single time...<eos> - Oh, you didn't have a choice.<eos> You were on your uppers.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> Being honest, it was partly that. But I wanted to be a good son, and I thought that Chrissy should have a grandma.<eos> She's turned out all right. Despite her mother.<eos> Right, two weeks.
Zoloft, prozac, celexa, paxil,<eos> Luvox, latuda.<eos> I've dabbled.<eos> Tandy, we can't make her take pills.<eos> What about shock therapy?<eos> It worked wonders on my grandma.<eos> My grandpa always said that before, She was like, "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba," And then afterwards, nothing.<eos> Guys, we're not giving her drugs.<eos> Okay?<eos> Or shock therapy.
I mean, come on, this is ridiculous!<eos> Todders, what's wrong?<eos> Seriously?<eos> We don't know what we're doing And we never will; we're not doctors.<eos> Hey, we'll figure it out.<eos> Oh, we'll figure it out?<eos> Like we figured out how to do an appendectomy on phil?<eos> Yeah, that worked out great.<eos> Or we are just gonna figure it out when babies start Popping out of that one.<eos> Huh? Or that one?
But right now, she needs something more important.<eos> She needs her mother to rest.<eos> All right.<eos> I just need some air.<eos> I wish we had what we needed to help Emma to give her a chance at a happy ending.<eos> ♪ Good morning, friend ♪<eos> [Gasps] ♪ Oh, my dear, there's something wrong ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause all my words ♪ ♪ Are coming out in song ♪<eos> ♪ A rhythm stirs ♪<eos> ♪ Deep inside my soul ♪

Blue.<eos> You granted the wish.<eos> But it didn't work.<eos> The Evil Queen took the song from us.<eos> No one can do that.<eos> It's still inside you.<eos> It's still inside everyone.<eos> But I'm afraid its magic was never meant for you to use against the Evil Queen.<eos> Then, who was it for?<eos> Emma.
Uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to "occupant," but with our apartment switch, it's unclear whether it's yours or mine.<eos> What's it for?<eos> Roofing.<eos> Yeah, it's yours.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> "Just throw it out."<eos> Speaking of occupants, I'm given to understand<eos> Raj will be moving into my old room.<eos> Yeah, for a little while.<eos> What about his dog?
I mean, it's unfair; people just assume I'm going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.<eos> But you are, aren't you?<eos> Oh, I'm outraged.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> Well, that's been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it.<eos> And that someone else is not me.<eos> And you know how I feel about people who aren't me.<eos> There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room.<eos> For me, too.
Wow.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Yes, this is remarkable.<eos> So we're agreed:<eos> it's complete garbage.<eos> By the way, your name can go first.<eos> I mean, I'm glad they're getting along, but it's starting to make me uncomfortable.<eos> Well, are you worried he's like another man in her life?<eos> A little, until I saw them in matching tops, so...<eos> Nice. 174 diapers.
Well, why wouldn't this be a safe place?<eos> I mean, he's surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.<eos> I don't want to speak for Leonard.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I...<eos> But when you're insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.<eos> You know, you're really sensitive about this kind of stuff.<eos> I'm a good listener. Yeah.<eos> Hey, Olsen twins...<eos> What?
What are the odds of running into you here?<eos> Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.<eos> Uh, what's new?<eos> Oh, tons of stuff.<eos> Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> That's what my dermatologist said.<eos> No, on-on getting engaged, good for you.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> How about you?
Of course, the first time I say it right, he's not even here.<eos> I love that little guy.<eos> Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.<eos> Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.<eos> Cool, I'll check with Sara.<eos> Sara, pull up my calendar.<eos> It never works for me.<eos> I've been thinking about our recent humiliation.<eos> You're gonna have to be more specific.<eos> At the hands of those teenagers.
Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.<eos> Well, if you're really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.<eos> Hey!<eos> I thought you were sweet on me.<eos> Okay, fine, let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.<eos> Let's say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you've accomplished but for who you are as a man.<eos> Wouldn't that be a life well-lived?<eos> You're so cute.<eos> I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.<eos> So many warnings.
What is your freaking address in akron?<eos> One-sixth of an inch avenue, Tandy's penis is tiny city, ohio.<eos> You know what...<eos> You know what, where you live?<eos> You live on the intersection of, You don't know what you're talking about street. And, mind your own business boulevard.<eos> God!<eos> I don't know why you don't want us to help you.<eos> We'll find your place.<eos> And by the way, my penis is way larger. Than one-sixth of an inch.<eos> Well, larger than one-sixth of an inch.
I mean, first of all, she's dealing with. The pain of adoption.<eos> And then, they don't let her. Into any of their family pictures.<eos> How brutal.<eos> Look what you made, you monsters!<eos> Tandy, she's not adopted.<eos> You know, melissa, this is not funny.<eos> Okay?<eos> Why won't you let us help you?<eos> We need you to take us to your house.<eos> Good night.
Okay.<eos> All right, let's get you home.<eos> Isn't this a gorgeous spot?<eos> This is where tandy helped me. Rediscover hope for the future.<eos> And subsequently where we performed. The loving act for five full minutes.<eos> Well, that's good to know.<eos> It's been under five for a while now.<eos> It's something we're working on.<eos> Tmi, carol.<eos> "Too minimal information"?
Oh, when are you leaving?<eos> This afternoon.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll drive straight to the airport from work.<eos> If you need anything, just call Mum.<eos> Boys weekend.<eos> Yes!<eos> The one with the cheese in the crust.<eos> There's a number for it on the TV.<eos> No pineapple.
Yes!<eos> The one with the cheese in the crust.<eos> There's a number for it on the TV.<eos> No pineapple.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, you get me that number, okay?<eos> Yep.<eos> You're late.<eos> What's with you?<eos> Nothing.
Sorry, Simon who?<eos> - We don't know anyone named Simon.<eos> - No, I know...<eos> I know a Simon Heywood.<eos> I went to university with Simon.<eos> He was...<eos> Simon was my boyfriend for three years.<eos> What?<eos> That fucking loser?<eos> - What the hell?
"Frightened school boy, son of prominent stockbroker Joe... "<eos> Look, I don't want Sam seeing any of this.<eos> Yeah, well his friends are going to find out.<eos> Okay, I'm going to ask you one question, and I want one answer.<eos> Have you been in contact with this guy?<eos> Why would I lie?<eos> In the last seven years, since Sam, have you seen him?<eos> God, Joe, I swear to you, I have no idea what's going on.<eos> Has he ever met Sam?<eos> Before yesterday?
Come on.<eos> I promised Sam I'd take him to school tomorrow.<eos> Great.<eos> Um, did you miss anything this weekend?<eos> What?<eos> The conference.<eos> It seemed like it was important to you.<eos> I'm sure I'll survive.<eos> Okay, I'm going to bed.<eos> Okay. Night.
- Yeah.<eos> Can I use some Cabcharges do you think?<eos> I mean, it's definitely work related.<eos> - Go and ask Jeannie about them.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Is this mine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Gorman wants to see you, he said when you're ready.<eos> Uh, call Detective Staszic, and these ones are from last week.<eos> From Friday.
Did you bring that... ?<eos> I was the opening batter yesterday.<eos> I got 40 not out.<eos> I'm better at batting.<eos> Should we get some pizza for dinner?<eos> Sure.<eos> You wanna come?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Go on, go upstairs and get some shoes on.<eos> No pineapple!
Ask for some money?<eos> I mean, you must have talked about us.<eos> Me.<eos> Us.<eos> Your son.<eos> Joe, she told me that you're one of Angelique's regular clients.<eos> That's not true.<eos> What is true is you... you have sex with prostitutes.<eos> You won't touch me.<eos> For fuck's sake.
No, no, I... I've touched it.<eos> I moved my eggs from here to here, you see? Hm.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, it's been nearly a week.<eos> Just talk to her.<eos> You do recall my last conversation with Rapunzel didn't go quite as I had hoped?<eos> Uh, Fred, you confined her to the walls of Corona under martial law.<eos> If that's a daddy-daughter conversation, I would hate to see what a talking-to is.<eos> Just because it was a difficult choice, doesn't mean it wasn't the right one.<eos> Come on, Cass! Those dreams are trying to tell me something!<eos> - Ever since that night...
Listen, kid! We gotta get outta here!<eos> No, no!<eos> No, I've got three pumps to shut off, and I can't let this happen again!<eos> Look out!<eos> No, there's no time!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I am not going anywhere without you.<eos> I love you, Rapunzel.<eos> I love you, too. More than you will ever know.<eos> What the hair?
What happened?<eos> Dad, I'm sorry.<eos> Not again, Varian.<eos> - But, Dad...<eos> - Is everybody okay?<eos> Quirin, what do we do?<eos> It was terrible.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get those test results, Blondie.<eos> I should never have kept a secret from you.<eos> From now on, no more secrets.
I heard there might be a job opening up for a nurse.<eos> Let me check.<eos> Uh-uh. Must have been filled.<eos> Kelly, there is someone to see you.<eos> Came all the way up here to check on me?<eos> I heard about this opening for a pediatric nurse.<eos> You're the one who took the job at Med.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, that's it?<eos> No eggs? No sausage?
We need to get him to the hospital right now!<eos> [groans] If he dies on your watch, that's murder of a public servant.<eos> You will fry. I ain't taking responsibility for this.<eos> I ain't do anything to him!<eos> Let him go and I'll get you out of here.<eos> You want to bust out?<eos> I'll bust you out.<eos> And we can armor the squad with stabilizing plates and we can "Mad-Max" our way out of here if you're crazy enough to do it, but you gotta let Herrmann go.<eos> [groaning] [siren wailing] They're releasing a hostage.<eos> - Who?
Take care of him.<eos> He caught a ricochet.<eos> ♪ Gunshot wound to the neck.<eos> Judging from the blood loss, it doesn't look like it hit an artery.<eos> ♪ Airway's clear.<eos> No strider.<eos> Pulse is strong.<eos> JB, can you hear me?<eos> I need you to squeeze my hands.<eos> ♪ Nothing.
I mean, everybody loves a party, even racist fascists trying to overthrow the government.<eos> So, ugh! Unpart your hair.<eos> Definitely get rid of that sweater.<eos> This is gonna work.<eos> Oh I'm totally gonna help.<eos> Then let's get started.<eos> It's time to take them down once and for all.<eos> Thank you, Senator Warren.<eos> You will be a welcome addition to our luncheon next month.<eos> Bye.
Yes, we want you to throw an engagement party for us to use as a backdrop for a matter of national security.<eos> And I'm supposed to just blindly accept this?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.<eos> Right now, outside those doors, there's a vast conspiracy threatening everything you care about, and we're the only ones fighting it.<eos> You want to know what I've been doing?<eos> I've been playing superhero, only I-I'm failing.<eos> Like Ben Affleck as Batman.<eos> And I need you.<eos> We need you.<eos> - Well, not Caleb.
You're starting to like this, aren't you?<eos> Little bit.<eos> We are going to divide and conquer... which means seating all the Collaborators at separate tables<eos> We just can't afford to have them confer with each other in any way.<eos> Done.<eos> Peter Theo is now close enough to his college roommate, we might catch something on the Mic, but far enough from his ex-husband that, hopefully, he won't get distracted.<eos> Damn.<eos> You're good.<eos> Yeah, you're Prime Roster material.<eos> How about it?
I'm not letting you out of my sight.<eos> Hello.<eos> You again.<eos> I was hoping to see you here.<eos> Nimah, right?<eos> You're buying me a drink.<eos> Um, but drinks are free.<eos> Did you contact Winter?<eos> I'm picking my moment.<eos> What about your target?
Well, that's not what my people say.<eos> I'll see you at the finish line.<eos> Henry, America's had statesmen who couldn't put aside their differences.<eos> Their arrogance watered battlefields with the blood of an entire generation.<eos> Let's be better than those men.<eos> Let's not start another Civil War.<eos> Some differences are too great to be set aside, Madam President.<eos> The vice presidency...<eos> It's yours.<eos> Too late for that.
Hey, nothing's pulling me away.<eos> Oh, your secret job?<eos> This Third World War?<eos> The people you work with?<eos> I want to marry you because I'm the best thing that will ever happen to you and you know it...<eos> Not because you're afraid.<eos> Don't marry me out of fear.<eos> All right, good news, folks.<eos> Alice Winter is willing to bring us<eos> Christian Kelly and Warren Shepherd.
I know you don't think Ryan's plan's the way forward.<eos> I don't, but I couldn't fight the tide because my strategy wasn't the way forward, either.<eos> So, what?<eos> That's it?<eos> We're out of options?<eos> There's, um...<eos> There's still a way we can win, but it's a big risk.<eos> We turn an asset.<eos> But we've already tried that.<eos> Not one of them.
It's better I did.<eos> See you at the bunker.<eos> Well that worked.<eos> It did.<eos> Well, we should get dressed, head to the bunker.<eos> Actually, I think it's time that I head back to school.<eos> I'm pretty sure I've done enough damage to keep Thanksgiving interesting, you know, maybe even Christmas.<eos> And, besides, if I stay, then we both have to keep this whole charade going, and, uh...<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> So, um... till next time?
Your transfer to Black Rock Prison is set for 0600 hours.<eos> You taste different.<eos> - For the greater good.
I love watching you work!<eos> Professional but caring.<eos> This is my job.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay...<eos> I know it doesn't seem like anything special, trying to convince Bill Lippencott to stop driving without a license or looking for security footage to figure out who was flying a drone over<eos> - the girls' dance studio.<eos> - But...<eos> But what?<eos> Nothing.
- Umm, their movement is like erratic, and they tend to dissipate a lot, and, um, we have no idea where they are.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we go back to hunting them oldfashioned style.<eos> Emphasis on the we.<eos> I'm gonna have to take a rain check.<eos> - Got prior commitment.<eos> - There's a...<eos> There's a creepy condo site that Nicole's gotten calls about.<eos> Some weird random noises,<eos> - disappearances.
Tell me about it, yeah.<eos> I am such an asshole.<eos> I don't know why I brought that up.<eos> I'm...<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> Feels like yesterday to me.<eos> And now you're a...<eos> - cop.<eos> - Eww! God, no.<eos> Yeah, kind of.
So I've got to ask:<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> Well, there's something about this place that attracts those citizens I need to keep my eyes on the most.<eos> You know, the dregs of Purgatory.<eos> So, when Shorty's was declared abandoned and needed a new owner, I thought of you.<eos> I can respect that, even if it is lazy as shit.<eos> You got the cash to pay the taxes to get her up and running or not?<eos> I am a man of means.<eos> I will find a way.<eos> - So many layers.
Yeah.<eos> I miss him too.<eos> Even if he is a demon lizard.<eos> Dead demon lizard.<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Dolls will make it through, Okay?<eos> I know it in my heart.<eos> This annoying positivity thing, always been there or just a byproduct of banging a hot redhead?<eos> Less banging, more cold shoulder?
How long before this thing eats its way out of the can?<eos> Pretty sure if I get off, it's gonna eat its way through me!<eos> - Not if I shoot it.<eos> - You sure Peacemaker likes you again?<eos> - I beg your...<eos> What? - Your aim's never been super.<eos> - I'll try.<eos> - You'll try? !<eos> Come on, KungFu Princess!<eos> Ready?
Come on, KungFu Princess!<eos> Ready?<eos> Okay.<eos> Waves, don't!<eos> Told you I'd dead it.<eos> - It's dead, right though?<eos> - Sucked its last dude dry.<eos> So many jOkayes, can't even choose.<eos> Hey.<eos> Goo alert.
What if Willa can't leave?<eos> Look at this room.<eos> Yeah, it's a freaking museum.<eos> We never let her go.<eos> She was our sister.<eos> And an Earp.<eos> Who chose to turn against us.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know how to exorcise something bad, Earp or not?<eos> Lots of fire.
Five minutes.<eos> - Okay, sorry.<eos> - You brought the booze, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Don't use all the whisky and start the fire?<eos> They're really doing it.<eos> Should we stop 'em?<eos> You can't stop an Earp, son.<eos> Not without some buffalo tranquilizers.
As long as you work for me, Rosie, you can rest those weary legs.<eos> You cannot sell this sludge in here.<eos> We'll not have any of your hipster elderflower concoctions.<eos> We are buying better bourbon.<eos> Case closed.<eos> Show me your setup.<eos> Your real setup.<eos> Those spiders, Earl, they were all drawn here to guard... that thing.<eos> Which means when we toOkay out the eggs, we cleared<eos> - a path for whoever...
That makes one of us.<eos> Doc, I...<eos> I have this... gut feeling something is coming and it's bad.<eos> I should lock up.<eos> Apparently, being a businessman involves some soulsucking activity called inventory.<eos> - You keep the bottle.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm going to need a dedicated generator<eos> - and way more ventilation.
Well, before you get any ideas, um, we got a little surprise for you.<eos> We made you a care package. I brought you some clothes. Aw, Wendy.<eos> Oh!<eos> These are very... cats. I love that sweater. And I found you some apartments on Craigslist.<eos> Oh, and there's even one for free if you're willing to let someone massage your feet while you eat.<eos> Oh, there's got to be a catch. Aww, you guys are so sweet.<eos> I thought this condo was the symbol of everything I worked for this year, but I was wrong.<eos> - [alarm sounding] - Oh, no!<eos> The petting zoo people know that I violated my restraining order! I took a chance coming here!<eos> Ugh!
We just have to be willing to walk away.<eos> Do we look like people who are willing to walk away? I mean, I don't even know where my pants are.<eos> Van, she's taken care of your entire life for ten years. You know what? I don't even remember what Jackie looks like anymore.<eos> Hey, who here wants to go swimming with dolphins?<eos> - This guy!<eos> - Yes! Ooh. Jesus Christ!<eos> Oh, that is not the dolphin room.<eos> Ha!<eos> [suspenseful music] [dramatic music]<eos> Oh, my God.
We know someone who knows these trolls.<eos> May I?<eos> These hackers are part of a larger network of troll farms in Russia.<eos> There's a declassified report by MI6 on them.<eos> Look who wrote it.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Well, it's been a while, hasn't it?<eos> Nice to see some familiar faces.<eos> Oh, I didn't know it was "bring your son to work day."<eos> Hmm? What?
Well, do right by me, it won't be the last time.<eos> Dayana, give us a moment.<eos> All right, I'll get us some food.<eos> I'm sorry, Malory.<eos> We won't be able to fulfill our promise to you.<eos> What?<eos> You said you'd protect me, that I could get some kind of a deal.<eos> Unfortunately, it turns out I don't have the authorization I thought I did to make that offer.<eos> But we want to help you get out of town.<eos> Out of town?
Out of town?<eos> What do you...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The people who are after you, they may not stop.<eos> You need to get farther than they can find you.<eos> Don't contact anyone.<eos> Don't use a computer.<eos> Change phones every two weeks.<eos> Pay as you go, you understand?<eos> No Internet.
Alex Parrish not in control of the situation.<eos> You see, you are capable of change.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really came.<eos> Someone told me it'd be a nice gesture.<eos> Okay, you're not supposed to say that out loud.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> So, where's your boyfriend this week?<eos> Europe?<eos> Asia?
If I hadn't prosecuted him, he would never have been committed to the hospital in the first place.<eos> You went with the case you were handed.<eos> The gas canister and the starter were right there in his apartment.<eos> Arson?<eos> Yeah, turned homicide.<eos> Set fire to his landlord's apartment, or so we thought.<eos> Even an "A" student gets a "B" sometimes.<eos> This would be an "F".<eos> We've all gotten one... or two.<eos> No, not me.
Allegedly.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, of course I'm okay.<eos> It's not like I'm a damsel in distress.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter who you are, threat's a threat.<eos> You know I carry a gun...<eos> So do I.<eos> And if it were me, I know what I would do.<eos> Keep him locked up.<eos> For your own sake.
It's your reputation, too.<eos> Have you asked yourself what you're gonna do if Kindler is released, and hurts someone, kills someone?<eos> That'll be blood on your hands, Erin.<eos> Right over here.<eos> Why am I here, Detective?<eos> There's just a couple things that aren't adding up.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Is this about the epinephrine?<eos> Well, you stole it. Is that right?<eos> Out of necessity.
A year and a half.<eos> So you know each other well.<eos> We're pretty close friends.<eos> You guys know how it is.<eos> Yeah. Except I don't text my partner at 2:00 in the morning.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We dumped Owen's phone.<eos> Phone calls, texts. Even videos...<eos> How long?<eos> Around six months.
You never thought to tell anyone about this?<eos> Like I said, it was just one of our morbid jokes.<eos> You see enough of what we see, and what's "normal" starts to change.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> For Matthew Kindler, it's not beyond a shadow of a doubt.<eos> It's not even beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> The bar is set at a very low "clear and convincing evidence" that he's dangerous.<eos> So it's not good enough some doctors, experts in their field, are calling this guy a menace?<eos> To another doctor, maybe.<eos> Not to a lawyer, clearly.
I didn't solve it.<eos> Oh, you don't think you would've?<eos> I've said it a hundred times.<eos> I'm happy right where I am.<eos> I say actions speak louder than words.<eos> If I wasn't on patrol, I wouldn't have got that 911 call in the first place.<eos> Come on, Jamie. What is it?<eos> Can we just have a drink?<eos> Fine.<eos> Actually, no.
Yeah.<eos> Phot... photo's fine.<eos> I think we should pay this fire house a visit.<eos> I'll read the report.<eos> I've got plans.<eos> Hm. Waverly nearly died to retrieve this.<eos> Long as I'm back before dark.<eos> I mean, to check on her.<eos> She's sick, right?<eos> Hungover.
We need to find Wynonna.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't kill you right here, right now.<eos> For starters, I'm tied to a chair.<eos> Again.<eos> - I know what you are.<eos> You're an hour late and an Earp short.<eos> It jumped into Wynonna last night.<eos> It's gonna hurt her and everyone else.<eos> Where was the first place we met?<eos> Outside Shorty's.
It's just, I left three messages.<eos> Three unreturned messages?<eos> Waverly needs space.<eos> She's dying under the weight of your... expectations.<eos> Waverly's not... the white picket fence in Purgatory girl you want her to be anymore.<eos> You know Wynonna, you're really mean when you drink before noon.<eos> And you drink before noon too often.<eos> Hope your Tinder game's solid.<eos> She didn't deserve that.<eos> What, the truth?
No demon residue left here to find.<eos> The Order took care of that.<eos> Sorry, who are they?<eos> And do you think they might share?<eos> Holliday met them this morning.<eos> The muscled-up firefighters.<eos> What do they want<eos> - with demon goo?<eos> - They're a danger<eos> - to one of yours.
It's Mikshun!<eos> We're looking for the Heir.<eos> That's just some girl.<eos> That girl has the demon inside her, which will spread like a virus if we don't destroy it.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You.<eos> History books will have no mention of our names or our deeds.<eos> We've lost too many brothers in this fight... but there is no higher calling than protection, and there is no greater service than preservation.<eos> Tonight, we will eliminate one more threat.<eos> One more demon.

Oh, creepy clowns!<eos> Those are really hot right now.<eos> - Wynonna, take a day off. - Ooh.<eos> Get a spa treatment.<eos> Purgatory doesn't have any spas... unless you count the jacuzzi Willie drives around in his pick-up.<eos> - Go shopping?<eos> - Why?<eos> Do my clothes look tight?<eos> Hi!<eos> - For you.
- Go shopping?<eos> - Why?<eos> Do my clothes look tight?<eos> Hi!<eos> - For you.<eos> - Yeeeah!<eos> Question.<eos> Why does my coffee taste like it was brewed in Nedley's hat?<eos> Because it's not coffee, it's Soothing Sunshine herbal tea.<eos> Caffeine free.
You might want to sit down.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I feel fine.<eos> I'm totally fine.<eos> I was actually talking to Jeremy.<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure.<eos> So this is good news, right?<eos> I mean, no more blood contract!<eos> - Yeah, no more backup either.
Doc, do you want a snack?<eos> I'm gonna get...<eos> I'm gonna get you a snack. Okay.<eos> Hey, uh, Wynonna. You wanna grab coffee with me?<eos> There's something I wanna discuss with you that's... personal.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - How about she meets you there?<eos> Yeah, we've got stuff we need to discuss.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.
Hey!<eos> Those were for me.<eos> You know what they say, "You snooze, you shall lose."<eos> You and Rosita weren't snoozing.<eos> I mean, you were.<eos> But, you know, you fell asleep... entwined.<eos> It's a new thing.<eos> It's casual.<eos> Of course.<eos> No strings, right?
Tell my family...<eos> I love them.<eos> Rebecca?<eos> Rebecca, can you hear me?<eos> Talk to me!<eos> Sorry.<eos> NYPD.<eos> Let's move!<eos> NYPD is here.<eos> No sign of the gunman.
She knows if you're doing something, it is for a good reason.<eos> She'll find a way to survive it.<eos> I don't want her to survive it.<eos> What I mean is you will find a language, a way to talk about it without really talking about it, until it becomes just another contour of your relationship.<eos> No.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> She knows that I lie now.<eos> Maybe she will forgive me, but even if she does, like you just said, she'll say she forgives me, but she will never really trust me again.<eos> I have destroyed the one good thing in my life for this.<eos> For nothing.
Well, the Nimah that we know... wouldn't wait for the phone to ring.<eos> She is right.<eos> When is she not right?<eos> You gonna be okay here by yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got stuff to do.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> - All right.<eos> Well, good night.
You gonna be okay here by yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got stuff to do.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> - All right.<eos> Well, good night.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Good night.
I need to clear things up so me and Uncle Monty can be friends.<eos> (sighing)<eos> Cassandra: Ugh!<eos> These berry stains are impossible.<eos> I just don't get it, Cass.<eos> Why can't Rapunzel let it go?<eos> Okay, so one person doesn't like her. Who cares?<eos> I know!<eos> I mean, only one person does like you, and you're okay with that.<eos> Exactly...
(laughs wryly) Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?<eos> Honestly, I don't care.<eos> Look, it doesn't matter anyway, okay?<eos> No matter how hard I try on that final tomorrow, your dad will cook up some cheap shot to make sure I fail.<eos> He wants me out, end of story.<eos> You know, for someone who spent most of his life breaking the rules to get what he wants, you're having an awful lot of trouble dealing with someone who is breaking the rules to get what he wants.<eos> (snoring)<eos> (sighs exasperatedly) Where is Eugene?<eos> The rules are simple.<eos> Obstacle course.
- Whoa!<eos> It's Princess Rapunzel!<eos> - Huh? - Huh?<eos> (kids cheering)<eos> (grunts, laughs)<eos> (hoots)<eos> Wow, Cass. What is all this?<eos> Nothing. I'm warming up for the Challenge of the Brave this morning.<eos> It's just a competition to find the toughest warrior in all of Corona.<eos> No big deal.
I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> You need to focus.<eos> No distractions.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Sorry. I forgot a good luck hug!<eos> - (grunts)<eos> Oh, right.<eos> It's not a place for hugging, I'm sorry.<eos> Good luck!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!<eos> Wait, stop!<eos> We're supposed to be friends!<eos> A friend wouldn't be so oblivious, Rapunzel.<eos> You have no idea what this contest means to me.<eos> I mean, you're a princess, you've got nothing to prove.<eos> To you, this was just a fun way to blow off a Saturday, but to me, it was a chance to show everyone that I am more than just your lady-in-waiting.<eos> And just when I thought I might get even the slightest bit of respect.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Respect?
Want a medal?<eos> No, really, want one?<eos> There are like 25 of these things.<eos> Let's just get out of here, Arnwaldo. Hey!<eos> Don't call me Arnwaldo.<eos> Besides, don't you at least wanna know whose basement this is?<eos> No. No, I don't.<eos> It's the Baron's.<eos> The...<eos> The Baron?
What are...<eos> What...<eos> What is anyone doing, really?<eos> I mean, that's the question here, isn't it?<eos> Hey, ladies. Looks like one of you ladies dropped your lady's ring.<eos> Your valuable...<eos> lady's ring.<eos> Eugene, where did that ring come from?<eos> - It came from...<eos> - Our orphanage.
You're just a big baby! Why don't you go cry to your mama?<eos> No.<eos> Dad.<eos> Ah, why did he bring up the samurai?<eos> We will avenge you, father.<eos> And we will never forget you.<eos> I be back, and in me prime no less!<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, you live!<eos> Eh, kind of...
You are too blinded by Aku's hate.<eos> You won't change.<eos> What do you know of me, everything I have endured up until this moment?<eos> You know nothing, samurai.<eos> - You are just a lowly, soulless pig.<eos> - Very well.<eos> I will show you.<eos> Please sit.<eos> - Well, when do we start?<eos> - In the morning.
16th, 17th, 18th centuries.<eos> There.<eos> We are criminal banished from our world.<eos> We hear that Aku welcomes those that are like us.<eos> Most enthusiastically.<eos> Your new home will be coordinates 6-12-71.<eos> - It is occupied.<eos> - Is that a problem for you?<eos> No.<eos> No problem.
No problem.<eos> The innocent and weak always preyed upon.<eos> Catastrophe.<eos> Devastation.<eos> Carnage.<eos> Enough.<eos> I've seen enough.<eos> Do you believe now?<eos> What can we do?<eos> - Nothing. - What?
Chemistry, a bit of physics, a bit of maths.<eos> Wow.<eos> My dad used to work in a bank.<eos> He couldn't understand why I couldn't do maths.<eos> He used to brain me.<eos> Turns out I'm dyslexic, dyspraxic, the whole fucking lot!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - He didn't know.<eos> Your accent, where's it from?<eos> Liverpool?
I'll come back, block the hole, get you a price for the damp-proofing.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And thanks again for...<eos> I mean it.<eos> No problem.<eos> I won't charge.<eos> Thanks for the drinks.<eos> No problem.<eos> You, erm...
Exactly.<eos> You're privileged.<eos> You've probably never been in a room where your family's reputation didn't precede you.<eos> You've never known what it's like to have someone look at you like whatever comes out of your mouth next better prove you belong.<eos> So what can I do?<eos> I just want to know where my sister is being held and what the charges will be when they're filed.<eos> You have access to Roarke's office.<eos> I don't have access to everything.<eos> But I will find out what I can.<eos> For you.
Roarke is widowed, so affairs are off the table.<eos> He dates age appropriate.<eos> His porn search history is vanilla.<eos> And there are no Tinder, Grindr, or Whiplr accounts matching his age, weight, and body type in the D.C. area.<eos> Even adjusting for ego.<eos> And there are no suspicious cash withdrawals from any of his accounts, no mysterious activity in his pattern of life that points to prostitution.<eos> Raina, your research turn anything up?<eos> Earth to Raina.<eos> - Anything on Roarke?<eos> - Nothing yet.
Why are you asking me?<eos> I respect your work.<eos> I was worried you might not respect me after the other night.<eos> For a second, I forgot about that.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's great.<eos> We talked on the phone all last night, made plans to spend the summer together.<eos> Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Nothing.
I don't know where he stands anyway.<eos> He's gone silent since the engagement party.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> You spoke to him?<eos> Well, he reached out to me.<eos> He said he can maybe help use Roarke's influence to find Nimah and tell us that she's safe.<eos> And you believed him?<eos> Raina, that was a complete manipulation.<eos> What did he ask for in return?<eos> Nothing.
I walked into Langley and forced a man I deeply respect to resign.<eos> He was nothing but good to me, and that's how I repay him?<eos> Just be thankful that's all they wanted.<eos> How do you know?<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Maybe that was just to lower my guard.<eos> I am about to walk into the FBI.<eos> But you are one of them now.<eos> There are no alternate plans.<eos> No tricks, no secrets.
You got this.<eos> You really think she has a chance?<eos> Right now, she needs to believe it.<eos> Octavia kom skaikru, step forward.<eos> Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion.<eos> Ilian kom trishanakru.<eos> Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion.<eos> What are you trying to prove?<eos> I'm here for trishanakru.<eos> Not you.
This final champion alone will tell us which clan is meant to survive in the crypt of bekka pramheda, and which clans are meant to perish in praimfaya.<eos> I'm luna kom flokru, and I'm the last of my clan.<eos> We know who you are...<eos> The natblida who ran from her conclave.<eos> I'm not running from this one.<eos> Accept this sigil, luna kom flokru, but with your clan gone, who will you fight for?<eos> I fight for no one.<eos> I fight for death.<eos> When I win... No one will be saved.<eos> Lincoln's tattoo.
How could you even say his name?<eos> Lincoln would be ashamed of you.<eos> Lincoln was a fool.<eos> He believed that we were all the same...<eos> One clan, one people.<eos> And where did that get him?<eos> Look around you.<eos> This is what mankind chooses to do with its final days.<eos> Another battle?<eos> More blood?
- You did buy me drinks once.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Of course, that was when I didn't have an ID or any money or any memories at that point.<eos> Well, well, all right.<eos> That doesn't count.<eos> What's that?<eos> My team's been piecing together the shredded documents from Sandstorm's forger.<eos> We got another name.<eos> Devon Penberthy, arrested and placed in county jail two weeks ago for transporting weapons across state lines.<eos> Presumably for Sandstorm.
Put me in, Coach.<eos> No. The same goes for you.<eos> Yeah, but there is less of a chance and it's worth the risk.<eos> We've got to stop playing defense if we want to get ahead of them.<eos> All right, but we have to take major precautions.<eos> I want you to get Tasha a false ID with rock-solid backstopping... and some way to be able to call out.<eos> I'll get you a burner phone, but you're gonna have to smuggle it in.<eos> Got it.<eos> Tasha, you're gonna be in there alone with a lot of dangerous criminals.<eos> No gun, no badge, no backup.
You compromised this mission, Jane.<eos> We could have been following up on Emma's case.<eos> We could have been finding out who was in on that cover-up.<eos> No, look, just let me work with Dr. Sun and Roman and maybe I...<eos> Do you really think I'm gonna keep letting you run with this?<eos> You get out of my office.<eos> Devon.<eos> Riva.<eos> - So, what are you in for?<eos> - Stupid drug charge.
3, 2, 1...<eos> Go!<eos> Okay, I guess I weigh as much as a fridge.<eos> Devon, no!<eos> It's over.<eos> We got 'em.<eos> We know you're in Shepherd's inner circle.<eos> We know that you're involved in the ambush that left 12 FBI agents dead.<eos> Devon is gonna go down with you unless you start talking to me.<eos> Nothing?
We just found a new angle on Parker.<eos> Devon's pregnant.<eos> Our medical report matches the one done while Devon was in jail.<eos> - How many weeks?<eos> - Five.<eos> And judging by the look on your face, I'm guessing you had no idea.<eos> If I were you, I'd be doing everything I can to make sure that my kid wasn't born in a supermax.<eos> No, you could have doctored these reports.<eos> This is your one chance to do the right thing for her.<eos> For your child.
Whoever gives me the code will save the director's life... and their own.<eos> It's okay.<eos> This is how we win.<eos> By staying strong.<eos> Very well.<eos> No!<eos> I know Weller's code.<eos> I deliver a new one to him every morning.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Briana.
It's okay.<eos> This is how we win.<eos> By staying strong.<eos> Very well.<eos> No!<eos> I know Weller's code.<eos> I deliver a new one to him every morning.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Briana.<eos> Briana...
We gotta keep moving.<eos> Why are they here?<eos> Do we know what Shepherd wants?<eos> Well, my lab, for starters.<eos> Clearly, there's something in there that she can't get from any other terminal.<eos> Wait.<eos> The Homeland Security Intranet.<eos> What?<eos> No, that's a closed circuit, highly encrypted system.<eos> Not from my lab.
We got Shepherd.<eos> Roman.<eos> This is Borden's lab.<eos> He backed us into a kill box.<eos> We're trapped!<eos> They're never gonna surrender, you know that.<eos> So you know what that means.<eos> Jane... you take Shepherd.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good?
We have to tell these people what's really going on.<eos> No, it's too risky.<eos> What if they're with Shepherd?<eos> Let's at least loop in these soldiers.<eos> No. Sandstorm's everywhere.<eos> - Do you understand that?<eos> - Okay, but we're in an underground bunker with no weapons and no phones.<eos> What other choice do we have?<eos> Look, if we trust the wrong person, it's over.<eos> Not just for us. For the whole country.
We have to find him.<eos> Weller wouldn't want us to focus on him.<eos> He would want us to focus on Sandstorm, so that's what we're gonna do.<eos> We gotta figure out where Shepherd's going to attack next.<eos> Yesterday, Sandstorm targeted seven buildings simultaneously.<eos> All government facilities.<eos> There's gotta be some other connection that we're just not seeing.<eos> Maybe we're asking the wrong questions.<eos> I mean, what does Shepherd want?<eos> Besides mass terror?
Watching TV is taking it easy.<eos> Tasha, I'm serious.<eos> Hey, look, I gotta go.<eos> - Wait, is something else...<eos> - No, there's nothing.<eos> We're just trying to make sense out of yesterday.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> We know the CL-20 came from you.<eos> We know that Shepherd is planning a massive attack in D.C. using nuclear material.<eos> Nuclear material?
The glider just launched.<eos> What?<eos> How long until...<eos> We have 30 minutes until it strikes the Capitol.<eos> Patterson, what happened?<eos> I couldn't hack it in time, but the glider appears to communicating with a homing beacon.<eos> Is there some way that we can clone the beacon and send the glider to the ocean?<eos> That's what she's trying to do.<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> 29 minutes until the point of no return.
It's okay.<eos> Sergeant Jeffords.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's me, Sergeant Jeffords, from the precinct.<eos> I'm the guy whose damn complaint you don't want to submit, and I can't think of one damn reason why!<eos> Everyone.<eos> This is Sergeant Jeffords.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm sorry for interrupting your dinner party.<eos> No problem at all.
Oh. They made you a "thank you" card.<eos> Pretty sure my nose isn't quite this big, especially with all the racial sensitivity talk, but I appreciate the effort.<eos> Sergeant Jeffords.<eos> A moment of your time, please.<eos> I came to a realization after you stormed out last night.<eos> I wouldn't say I stormed out.<eos> I shook hands with both you and Kevin before I left.<eos> And Kevin and I agreed that you squeezed significantly tighter than necessary.<eos> I guess I was a little worked up.<eos> With good reason.
- Did this come out of her? Charles, how grossed out should I be right now?<eos> - No, that's the Boyle family sourdough starter.<eos> It's fed us for 140 years.<eos> The bread it births is succulent and firm... tang for days.<eos> - I hate so many of the words you just used.<eos> Charles, if it's so great, why would she give it to me?<eos> I barely knew her. - You know what, she probably got you confused with my cousin Tina.<eos> He was always her favorite.<eos> - Tina is a boy's name?<eos> - Yeah, short for Christina.
- Well, this is the Department of Records, so I'm going to make an educated guess and say she came here for a record.<eos> - Ooh, not sure you're qualified to make an educated guess.<eos> - Okay, I know where you're going with this, the Theory of Relativity question.<eos> Uh, he's got crazy hair, super smart, Jewy name.<eos> Eisenberg!<eos> Jesse Eisenberg.<eos> - Sit down!<eos> - Look, I know lots of things.<eos> I know the names of every Transformer.<eos> Yeah, even the Dinobots.
You'll just get the weekly blasts, like the rest of our acquaintances.<eos> - It was an accident, she didn't mean it.<eos> - I'm sorry it had to end this way.<eos> Charles, I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> - But you brought Gina into this family, and you're also banished.<eos> What?<eos> - Oh, there you are, thank God.<eos> - Hey. - How'd you find me?<eos> - January 14th, 2014.
- And worst of all, you're standing here applauding yourselves for it.<eos> - Shame.<eos> - Are you blind?<eos> This place looks amazing.<eos> It looks like a Swedish airport.<eos> Everyone's gonna love it.<eos> - Just keep telling yourselves that.<eos> - Shame. - Shame.<eos> - Well, everyone I talked to checked out.<eos> - Any luck on your end?
That seems rather odd.<eos> - Does it? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I'm sorry, I gotta leave now.<eos> I've got some work to do.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> - When it comes to George, I'm getting hints of guilty with undertones of lying.<eos> - Oh, yeah, and a strong bouquet of "up to no good."<eos> Wine terms.<eos> - And then you release the jack.<eos> And voila.
- Doing what?<eos> - Oh, doing you.<eos> Oh, God, I'm so sorry.<eos> I mean, way to go. I'm sex positive.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> - George and I have been in a relationship for two years.<eos> Raymond doesn't know.<eos> Please don't tell him.<eos> I'm asking you as a friend.<eos> - As a friend.
- I know you're sleeping with George.<eos> - Oh, come on, man.<eos> - Raymond, I can tell that you're upset.<eos> - I am because you withheld information from this detective about an ongoing police investigation.<eos> - All right, I don't think this is actually about police stuff.<eos> Maybe we should all just take a deep breath and consider not arresting our moms.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - You're unarrested, mother.<eos> And Detective Peralta, since you two are such good friends, why don't you handle the case on your own?<eos> Good day.
- Yes, we do.<eos> - Really?<eos> You like those new stools, huh, Charles?<eos> Oh. There we go.<eos> - And, Rosa, how was your snack?<eos> - You know what really chafes my crack?<eos> We spent years crafting that break room into something special, something comfortable.<eos> - A place with so many stains that the new ones just blended in.<eos> - Where the couch cushions were so worn down, they comforted all butts, large or small, flat or juicy.<eos> - Juicy?
They're undercover cops.<eos> - Floppy Foot's a cop?<eos> - Crap, that's Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins.<eos> - I know.<eos> - She's literally my hero.<eos> Hello, Lieutenant Hawkins.<eos> - You idiots just ruined a three-month operation.<eos> - My name is Detective Ignatius Pennyfeather IX.<eos> That's I-G...<eos> Nacious.
Sorry, it's... muscle spasm.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - Diaz, you ride?<eos> - Yeah, I got a supercharged R1.<eos> - Engine?<eos> - 4-stroke, in-line four with dual overhead cams.<eos> - Wow, that's a lot of bike.<eos> I ride a custom-6 L-capacity superbike.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Like, 180 horses?
Morning, Lieutenant Hawkins.<eos> Hey, have you ever considered going by Lady Hawk?<eos> Pretty sweet flick.<eos> Matty Broderick,<eos> Shelly Pfeiffer, Alf Molina.<eos> Not to be confused with Alf, Alf.<eos> - We all love him.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> We ran background checks on all the employees of the three banks that were hit.<eos> - Nothing interesting.
What the hell?<eos> Is she drinking coffee?<eos> Boyle, no.<eos> - What're you doing, you psycho?<eos> - What're you doing?<eos> You shouldn't be drinking caffeine.<eos> That can stunt the growth of your ba... - No, no, no, no. - by, your baby.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> Nothing.
- Lost count.<eos> And you still have no fear of me.<eos> I'm trying to read your womb vibe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> The daddy's your Property Brother, isn't he?<eos> - It's a Property Baby.<eos> - Charles, you know I legally can't answer.<eos> Do you want me to have my baby in jail?<eos> All right, no more questions.
It's all of it.<eos> All. Of. It.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's like an Eagles concert down there.<eos> Nothing but whites.<eos> Understood.<eos> You got white pubes.<eos> There's no need to stress out.<eos> The lawyer's very confident.<eos> Not good enough.
Plain as day.<eos> They're sitting right there.<eos> Let the record show, she's pointing at Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz.<eos> Okay, the jurors found that super compelling.<eos> Just an update.<eos> Thanks, Gina.<eos> So, like, you're not making a good first impression.<eos> Right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No doubt.
In toto, yes.<eos> Some good news.<eos> I spoke to the judge, and he's giving us an extra day to review the new evidence.<eos> What are they gonna find in one day?<eos> Face it, man, we are going to jail.<eos> We might as well start hiding razor blades under our tongues.<eos> Here.<eos> You can have one of mine.<eos> How long has that been in there?<eos> - Since grade school.
- Thank you.<eos> And now I'm about to hack your world into pieces, old man.<eos> That'll show you.<eos> No.<eos> Just do the thing with the bank.<eos> - That'll show me. - Whoa.<eos> Looks like someone was a catalog model in Japan.<eos> Whoa! Those boots.<eos> That slicker.<eos> The no pants.
Terry needed the yen!<eos> Babe, are you sure we're in the right place?<eos> This looks like where they shot "The Village."<eos> Amy, don't say things like that.<eos> You're gonna scare me.<eos> You know that.<eos> I think Langdon's wife's been secretly visiting him.<eos> She posted a photo in March of a snowstorm, but there was no snow in New York.<eos> The picture was geotagged right... here.<eos> "Flaxton Hill Farms."
You follow Tom Brady?<eos> Just so I don't look like a creep following his wife.<eos> Plus, he only posts pictures of him practicing and wearing them ugly-ass Uggs.<eos> Wait, I can't believe they let your old ass on the 'Gram, Dennis.<eos> Motherfucker, there's no age limit looking at fine-ass women.<eos> Is this you with all the Pam Grier pics?<eos> That's my Woman Crush Wednesday every day.<eos> Because she ain't no Ashley Graham.<eos> And I hate to break it to you, but she ain't looking like this anymore.<eos> Hey, careful, boy.
Fuck Brady.<eos> Fuck him.<eos> I'ma unfollow his ass any motherfucking way.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'ma set up a practice of my own.<eos> Just fucking go to...<eos> Hey, T!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Grab me a group together. And not that busted-ass quarterback from last time, all right?<eos> Who, JaMarcus?

So, what did the boss say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> What the fuck kind of story is this?<eos> You see, it's not about what the boss said; it's what he didn't say, Joe.<eos> He didn't say anything interesting at all.<eos> - So, after 30 years, my dad finally had a chance to sit across from the man who was running everything.<eos> And you know what he saw?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. Nothing special.
Champagne, champagne, Thank you.<eos> and for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice.<eos> No bendy straw, some party.<eos> Hey, a-a toast.<eos> Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project.<eos> And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.<eos> Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.<eos> Without me.
Cheers.<eos> You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.<eos> Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.<eos> Without me.<eos> To success without Raj.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.<eos> Yeah, I'll definitely live long enough-- vitamin C.<eos> First thing tomorrow morning, we're back at it.<eos> Without me.
Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go...<eos> Got to go.<eos> Morning.<eos> I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.<eos> Are you feeling okay?<eos> Not really.<eos> Apparently grief can make one less regular.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.<eos> Oh, the-the more details, the more sorry.
Of course.<eos> I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that...<eos> Okay, a simple yes will do.<eos> You have to go.<eos> I know, but what if Sheldon...<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while.<eos> It's not like you two are very physical.<eos> Hey, you don't know what goes on behind closed doors.<eos> A lot of lectures?
"Which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"<eos> So you're keeping busy?<eos> You're not lonely?<eos> Oh, not at all.<eos> I've had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and-- oh, I had lunch with Dr. Nowitzki.<eos> Who's he?<eos> Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.<eos> Oh. Really?<eos> Uh, when did you meet her?<eos> Many years ago.
- What? - Fish need water.<eos> - Van, it's hard enough getting people to take me seriously when they think I'm the person who validates their parking.<eos> I think at your age being entrusted with parking stickers speaks to your character.<eos> I know an office doesn't really mean anything, but to me it's a symbol of how hard I've worked to get here.<eos> It's like the pride a butler feels when he gets a second pantry.<eos> - Oh, they love that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Emily, nothing would make me happier than to give you your own office...<eos> But...?<eos> - No buts.
Oh, it's one of the many things we keep from you.<eos> Like the secret bathroom on the sales floor that's always empty and... does not exist.<eos> - I don't know why I said that.<eos> - Mmn-hmm. We make sure Van wins every month because there was one time he didn't.<eos> Recognize this lady?<eos> - No.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Kate won her first month here.<eos> So, when Van caught her taking a "company croissant"<eos> from a staff meeting home with her...
God...<eos> Was that even you, Dr. Dre?<eos> Are you even a doctor?<eos> He hasn't moved all morning.<eos> It's like watching an iguana.<eos> - Ew. - Well, you broke him, Emily.<eos> That's not the way a man who wants to live sneezes.<eos> Trust me, this is better for everybody in the long run.<eos> We can't keep tip-toeing around his ego.<eos> His ego?
You're here to interview to join DISA, not criticize it.<eos> "All citizens' rights and privileges shall not be suspended unless, when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety shall require it." - And that's just one of the amendments.<eos> - I know them well.<eos> "Rebellion," "invasion." That can mean anything.<eos> That's a blank check for the federal government to suspend our rights for any reason.<eos> The world has changed, Iris, and this country has to change along with it.<eos> I've made my choice, and you've made yours... clearly.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Not at all good to see you, Alex.<eos> ♪ In the boat ♪

I'm on the line.<eos> So I wanted to tell ya, Aku, Jacko has lost...<eos> Huh?<eos> What?<eos> Forget it!<eos> Usually me and the boys would rip your head from your body, but looks like somebody already did us the favor, eh?<eos> So in lieu of that...

Running away will not solve your problems.<eos> That's totally true.<eos> But killing yourself solves all your problems.<eos> It actually does.<eos> It even solves world's problems.<eos> For you.

I have seen that film about 174 times, and I have never, ever thought that, ever.<eos> Well, it completely ruined it for me, that.<eos> Well, I've never noticed, cos I'm too busy watching the Swayze.<eos> He's gone, and all.<eos> - Oh, my God, yeah.

Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah, so listen, um...<eos> You know, like she's calling notorious criminal Al Capone to tell him she gave him Syphilis.<eos> That's... that's pretty awkward, right?<eos> Although she was probably a prostitute.<eos> And why you'd give your phone number to a prostitute...<eos> So... so what else?<eos> You know how pissed off Figgis is gonna be when he finds out you walked off with his million-dollar payday?<eos> Roughly the same as if he finds out about your new Chinese sister-wives?<eos> Oh, goody.
Oh, hey!<eos> How 'bout that taft-hartley act?<eos> Man: Show us your tits!<eos> I mean...<eos> Oh, jeez, I'm getting wet!<eos> Will you hurry up?<eos> Hang on.<eos> I got everybody's but mine. Uh...<eos> Here it is!<eos> Oh, my God.
Right?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Uh, do what now?<eos> I said, what the hell's going on here?<eos> It's a... a prisoner... prisoner transport.<eos> Uh, taking these reefer addicts over to Newton street...<eos> - Oh, well...<eos> - For treatment and counseling.<eos> Nope.<eos> For what?
Just make sure that she's holding the newspaper with nine fingers.<eos> Aw, goddamn it.<eos> Well, actually seven. What?<eos> You know, not counting her thumbs.<eos> And then, obviously, bring me her severed finger and the photograph so that I may compare the two.<eos> [sighs] Yeah. Um, obviously.<eos> Father, say good-bye to Charlotte's ostensible kidnapper!<eos> [sighs] So I guess that's a no on the bourbon?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good-bye.
Tell me before, so help me God, I put a bullet in your big fat stupid face!<eos> First of all, that's just hurtful.<eos> And second of all, it doesn't matter where she is, just where the ransom money is.<eos> Hmm. Presumably with the Vandertunts.<eos> So all we gotta do is... insinuate ourselves into this whole deal, like we're there to help, and steal the ransom during the exchange.<eos> Yeah. It's a piece of piss.<eos> Now, aren't you glad you didn't shoot me?<eos> For now.<eos> Although I'm sure at some point I'll regret that decision, so... why is there blood on the barrel?<eos> What?
Now, aren't you glad you didn't shoot me?<eos> For now.<eos> Although I'm sure at some point I'll regret that decision, so... why is there blood on the barrel?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> That's, um, hot sauce.<eos> Well, why is there hot sauce on it?<eos> With a couple of hairs stuck in it.<eos> - Oh, sweet Christ.<eos> - What?
Well, what does one do with a twenty-dollar bill?<eos> - Buy a single orange?<eos> - That's... just make sure the money's at the drop by midnight, and that you follow my instructions to the letter.<eos> Mmm, like a reverse scavenger hunt.<eos> And once we have the money, we'll arrange for the return of your sister.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yes. Sorry. I forgot that part.<eos> - And that's a firm firm?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And no cops, at all, anywhere.

Sorry. I forgot that part.<eos> - And that's a firm firm?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And no cops, at all, anywhere.<eos> No police.
- You'll say what?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Ah. A man of mystery.<eos> Well, you know, mainly in the sense that I try to solve them, you know...<eos> - On your own.<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, since my partner died.<eos> - Which I actually should really...<eos> - I meant without the police.<eos> Without the who now?
- Nothing.<eos> - Ah. A man of mystery.<eos> Well, you know, mainly in the sense that I try to solve them, you know...<eos> - On your own.<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, since my partner died.<eos> - Which I actually should really...<eos> - I meant without the police.<eos> Without the who now?<eos> "No cops, at all, anywhere,"
Repeatedly.<eos> Oh, yeah. My mother used to do that.<eos> Well, you better not have been snooping on me, mister.<eos> Are you... pfft!<eos> Come on! I wouldn't do that!<eos> So, Archer's the bagman for a kidnapping, huh?<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Because you know what happens to snoops.<eos> - They get... poops?<eos> - What?
Well, you better not have been snooping on me, mister.<eos> Are you... pfft!<eos> Come on! I wouldn't do that!<eos> So, Archer's the bagman for a kidnapping, huh?<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Because you know what happens to snoops.<eos> - They get... poops?<eos> - What?<eos> It's just that the kidnappers were extremely clear on that point.<eos> No police, at all, anywhere.
Because you know what happens to snoops.<eos> - They get... poops?<eos> - What?<eos> It's just that the kidnappers were extremely clear on that point.<eos> No police, at all, anywhere.<eos> Well, of course they're gonna say that, but trust me...<eos> I trust him.<eos> He brought me a finger.<eos> Only you.<eos> What?
I thought I made it pretty clear to the little weirdo that I didn't wanna see any cops near the drop.<eos> I guess you can't blame the guy for trying.<eos> Plus, it's not like I can't handle Figgis and Poovey.<eos> But I may have to wait them out.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You paid for an hour.<eos> Well, that's my whole point.<eos> It may take a lot longer than an hour... well... and I'm not paying you any extra.<eos> - What? - But feel free to hike the five miles back to sunset in those heels.<eos> What the hell?
What the hell?<eos> Who brings a hooker?<eos> Okay. Here's the topiary garden.<eos> Which I wish I could buy it so I could burn it to the ground.<eos> Topiary.<eos> My God, what rubbish.<eos> Shrubbish!<eos> - So freakin' weird. - Hmm.<eos> Well, I suppose that looks like a mushroom.<eos> What?
Uh, no.<eos> A raw egg?<eos> No.<eos> Black pepper?<eos> No, Trinette's concussion!<eos> You think I got a concussion?<eos> Maybe, with your crazy jibber-jabber about Spanish omelet ingredients!<eos> Huh? Oh. No, dummy.<eos> Those are just Jerry-rigged ways to fix a leaky radiator.<eos> Whaaat?
The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.<eos> Same with an egg.<eos> Ya crack it in, it cooks on the way to the hole.<eos> Bull...<eos> Shit.<eos> Aw, come on. That's common knowledge.<eos> It is absolutely not.<eos> Why do you think it's called the "potato compartment"?<eos> Why do I think the glove compartment is called the "potato compartment"?<eos> "Glove compartment"?
I just wanna get some hot water!<eos> Well, you'll be in hot water if you try to sneak off before Archer comes back with that ransom money.<eos> I heard you! Tsk!<eos> You make being kidnapped just awful.<eos> There's a reason they say "kidnapping victim" and not "kidnapping winner."<eos> What's that?<eos> Don't you have a house to haunt?<eos> No.<eos> And what is that? What do you have?<eos> Nothing.
And the bag that contains it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, then, I guess I'll be on my way.<eos> Really? No!<eos> Aw.<eos> Figgis, get your ass out here!<eos> No.<eos> I'm protecting the ransom money.<eos> From what?<eos> All these witnesses?
He's gonna, he's gonna, we gotta...<eos> You're not a vegetarian, are you? - We gotta, we gotta, we...<eos> - What?<eos> Ngh!<eos> - Snap out of it.<eos> - Ow, Jesus, that hurt.<eos> - Right? - Ow! Come on, I snapped already!<eos> I know. I know. That one was just for me.<eos> And that one was for the Chinese ladies. Yeah, so about that...<eos> Trexler!
And you're telling me this crazy Nazi can turn people into robots? Yes!<eos> With metal bones!<eos> Motor oil for blood!<eos> Like the, the tin man!<eos> Okay, a, the tin man's not a robot...<eos> The tin man is a... A magical being!<eos> Like a leprechaun, Pinocchio, an enchanted nutcracker.<eos> Whatever!<eos> He doesn't have a heart!<eos> Just like that sick bastard out there!
And since Archer was kind enough to leave his keys in the ignition... get in!<eos> Umm... We'll just take my car.<eos> No, actually, you'll come with me!<eos> - To where?<eos> - What?<eos> My headquarters!<eos> What, like some drag club?<eos> For the... I'm not a transvestite!<eos> I'm a treasury agent!<eos> What?
No, actually, you'll come with me!<eos> - To where?<eos> - What?<eos> My headquarters!<eos> What, like some drag club?<eos> For the... I'm not a transvestite!<eos> I'm a treasury agent!<eos> What?<eos> And you two are under arrest.<eos> What?
Ow! Goddammit, woman!<eos> Do you have any idea how bad that is...<eos> I swear to God, if I have to stop this car...<eos> Good idea! Here, lemme give you a hand with that!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Can somebody, please, shoot him? Um...<eos> Goddammit. - I'm out.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - I obviously am.<eos> - Me too.
Wait, wait, wait, what was that?<eos> - Halberds!<eos> - No, no, no, no, did you...<eos> You said your partner's name was woodhouse?<eos> Yeah, why? Woodhouse, the dope-fiend detective.<eos> What... you... yes!<eos> Why? Because, and I'm sorry kid, I don't know how to break this to you, but...<eos> But what?<eos> Mother killed woodhouse.<eos> What?
I put your boys back together.<eos> You get me that lead.<eos> - Tell me about the Earp Curse.<eos> - Revenge for the death of our boys.<eos> Then I threw you down a well.<eos> Decades in the dark.<eos> I can't end the curse unless I send every single revenant back to Hell.<eos> Triangle's not only a prison.<eos> It's also a sanctuary.<eos> - For who?

- Of course it matters.<eos> - I haven't seen anything.<eos> - OK.<eos> I mean, besides, are you sure you really wanna know?<eos> No!<eos> But if I'm not an Earp, I have to.<eos> In the meantime... - why don't you distract me? - Oh!<eos> Just the ladies I'm looking for.<eos> So, I had an idea.<eos> About your sister.
It's right near Juan Carlo's chop shop.<eos> Enjoy your righteousness and your protein shakes.<eos> Waverly wants you to join her at Shorty's for nachos.<eos> Oh! Sounds good.<eos> I just gotta...<eos> Thought we've done this dance before.<eos> You know I'm not a bad guy.<eos> And you got into my truck... after you decked me.<eos> You said you have answers.<eos> About the venomous vixens.
When am I?<eos> Not even gonna put up a fight?<eos> - Doc.<eos> - Well, I'm amenable to betting<eos> - horses and wives.<eos> - Doc.<eos> Doc!<eos> I'm in a vision quest.<eos> A spiritual awakening and... walkabout, if you will.<eos> General weirdness.
Well...<eos> Robert.<eos> When you have a message from Wyatt Earp for me... you tell it to me in a private.<eos> The letter... is from the Padre in Purgatory.<eos> The sheriff there is a madman.<eos> Unhinged.<eos> A terror upon its citizens.<eos> Wyatt wants you to ride with him to Purgatory.<eos> Purgatory is a lost cause.<eos> For God sakes!
She needs to see the past if we have any hope for a future.<eos> Hey, don't do anything stupid, OK?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Are you certain this is gonna hold?<eos> It would take a force of nature to shatter it.<eos> Say, dynamite?<eos> I'm more worried about your demon husband.<eos> And you.<eos> She knows.<eos> About the demon's sons.
Wyatt Earp killed my poor boys.<eos> He will pay for it.<eos> But I have priorities.<eos> Should my demon husband get free, it'll be me running for my life.<eos> His funeral is my freedom.<eos> We need more than earth to hold him though.<eos> Do we have a choice?<eos> Pour this upon the talismans have given you.<eos> The key is to use iron.<eos> Or silver.

You know, you ever thought about sitting down with us over dinner?<eos> Explaining a few things?<eos> I'm not allowed to interfere.<eos> - This isn't interfering?<eos> - Oh, indeed it is.<eos> But... at this point, I'm no longer afraid of the consequences.<eos> The almond smell... it's not amaretto.<eos> It's gangrene.<eos> Fatal, I'm afraid.<eos> Even for me.
- Was?<eos> There was a gunshot.<eos> I'm going in. Call backup or tactical or whoever's hiding in the bushes.<eos> There's no one in the bushes.<eos> I have been blackballed by HQ.<eos> They ignore my reports and my messages.<eos> This is my one shot to get back in...<eos> My sister's in there, you bitch.<eos> Anything happens to her, I'll give you one shot.<eos> Right between the eyes.
- Anything?<eos> Anything.<eos> I want a girl.<eos> Edwin Earp, the One Year Wonder.<eos> Grandpappy put down 70 revenants in 300 days.<eos> With the help of BBD of course.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Whatever's in his briefcase has Lucado creaming her granny panties.<eos> Only thing between us and it are five numbers.<eos> June 18, 1940.
Only thing between us and it are five numbers.<eos> June 18, 1940.<eos> Edwin's birthday.<eos> I googled it.<eos> OK.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's... a plate.<eos> Are we going to give it to Lucado?<eos> Hell no!
I googled it.<eos> OK.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's... a plate.<eos> Are we going to give it to Lucado?<eos> Hell no!<eos> You lost... nearly lost a hand over it.<eos> We should talk about the... demon goo...<eos> At the arch.
Hey.<eos> You need to learn this, OK?<eos> 'Cause the Widows are not playing to lose.<eos> Well, hell hath no fury like two bitches whose demon husband got shot by your... ancestor.<eos> Sounded a lot snappier in my head.<eos> You know, I still can't get over Constance being their sisterwife.<eos> Her outfits were so fiercely nonpolygamous.<eos> And turns out she was the nice one.<eos> Demon Clootie rises, the other two are going to wreak havoc.<eos> So much revenge.
Better than anything Black Badge has ever given me.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, I guess you can give me at least like, six months' worth now, right?<eos> - Nuh.<eos> - Because me coming here once a week isn't convenient for either one of us, right?<eos> The serum goes bad after eight days.<eos> This is the winning formula.<eos> Hey, I hate to pull rank, but...<eos> Since when?
Well, I could mix you up a cocktail that will make birth feel like you're on a giant swan floatie being handfed chocolate by Chris Evans.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Captain, my Captain!<eos> Hey, handsome.<eos> You know you don't have to rock a straight razor<eos> - anymore, right?<eos> - He claimed that he "tripped" on something at the salt flats.<eos> - Some... thing?<eos> - And now I am going for dinner.<eos> At Wynonna's.
- And now I am going for dinner.<eos> At Wynonna's.<eos> Cool.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> And I'll be in my truck.<eos> Well, feel free to lock up early.<eos> Sure.<eos> Aren't you gonna say goodnight?<eos> Goodnight.
I saw your body.<eos> I'm the reason people shouldn't pick up hitchhikers.<eos> Rosita...<eos> What did you do?<eos> What did I do?<eos> I got frostbite.<eos> I almost froze to death coming back here for you!<eos> It's OK.<eos> I'm here to save you.<eos> - From her?
Smoking?<eos> - It makes my hair smell gross.<eos> - Drinking?<eos> This... this whole thing<eos> - took me by surprise.<eos> - I'm here to assess your health and the baby's, not to judge.<eos> Sorry, judge is sort of a trigger word.<eos> You're very nice.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Umm, what about genetic testing?
- I hate myself a phantom more.<eos> - Phantom?<eos> You're the one who evaporated into thin air, Holliday.<eos> But... justice delayed is still justice served.<eos> Nothing from this earthly world can...<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - How did you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Take my keys, you drive.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.
I see you more as the snake.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Come on, no fair!<eos> I have "cankles"!<eos> Door prize.<eos> - He's a bad guy, right?<eos> - You are so pretty and I like you so much!<eos> You are drunk!<eos> And in trouble, OK?<eos> Both of you!
I bet the doctors have questions.<eos> Yeah, they're being handled.<eos> You knew, the Gardner house.<eos> Something wasn't right.<eos> There's nothing you could have done.<eos> You saved her life.<eos> Couldn't save the real Beth.<eos> Beth might have been the lucky one.<eos> They kept them alive like this.<eos> Faceless.

- We can try. - No!<eos> No.<eos> They're not taking another one. Not today.<eos> Whatever it takes, Dolls.<eos> Oh God, this can't be happening.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Oh, but it is.<eos> Beth.<eos> No, not Beth.
OK, but this is good, right?<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, you've already been experimenting with the venom?<eos> Well, creating a vapor guard against their mist, yeah.<eos> But... this is a whole different Quidditch game.<eos> I don't need Star Trek references.<eos> I need you to tell me what to do.<eos> Get more venom.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And a test subject.
Let me worry about a test subject.<eos> Yeah, and I'll speak to Ewan and his jokers in The Order.<eos> They know Juan Carlo.<eos> Juan Carlo knows the Widows.<eos> Yeah, and in that case, they bit him, meaning his body's pumped full of venom.<eos> Might also help.<eos> Gross as that sounds.<eos> Man, I've seen you eat.<eos> I don't get grossed out.<eos> OK, what about us?
I talked to the toxicology specialist.<eos> They're still trying to ID the poison.<eos> You called it in, right?<eos> You were with her when it happened?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I found her.<eos> She'd already been bitten... or... something, I don't know.<eos> So, how did you guys meet?<eos> Rock climbing in Nevada.<eos> Not far from Vegas. Oh.
What?<eos> No! No, hey!<eos> I know you're not strictly like us, but you're one of us.<eos> And this stuff could kill you!<eos> You know damn well there's only one thing that can kill me.<eos> Hey, hey, Rosita! Come on, I'm gonna have to have you stop...<eos> Please, this is not what I signed up for!<eos> Some of us don't have a choice.<eos> Your girls gave Mercedes a hell of a fight.<eos> Not hellish enough.
Your girls gave Mercedes a hell of a fight.<eos> Not hellish enough.<eos> I saw Peacemaker on the bar.<eos> Tell you anything?<eos> Just that you've been keeping a supernaturally well-endowed secret from me for a very long time.<eos> I'm sure you can understand why.<eos> And I assume she is now helping to perfect the anti-venom?<eos> Do you have a better idea?<eos> She can't die, Doc.<eos> Not from that.
And where do I put this?<eos> The gift table... honey, get up and enjoy your party!<eos> Get in the bounce house.<eos> Go in the bounce house.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Do you want to take your purse inside?<eos> Oh, I'll keep it.<eos> I'm waiting for a call from my doctor.<eos> - Ooh, what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.
AIDS, cancer, diabetes.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Wow, oh, I don't know,<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I appreciate the concern.<eos> Well, I want you guys to enjoy yourselves.<eos> Molly's mom has bruises on her chin from filler.<eos> You're gonna want to check that out, but don't stare, okay?<eos> Have fun, there's wine inside.<eos> Wine... its ten a.m.
You're gonna want to check that out, but don't stare, okay?<eos> Have fun, there's wine inside.<eos> Wine... its ten a.m.<eos> There's Melissa.<eos> Oh, there she is... in all of her glory.<eos> She looks smaller in person.<eos> What does... how much of that stuff did you watch?<eos> I like, scanned it, you know, for research.<eos> Really?<eos> Research.
- I know.<eos> What, are they worried she's gonna use our kids for fluffers?<eos> I don't... yes.<eos> What's a fluffer?<eos> What if her kid's here?<eos> Well, the sex talk will be easier.<eos> - 'cause they can just play a video of mom.<eos> Who sent that email?<eos> It's an anonymous email, a fake person...<eos> Horselover3000.
You see this?<eos> Hang on one minute, Charlie, will ya?<eos> - Philip Byrden withdrew 1,500 quid the night he went missing.<eos> - And?<eos> - There was no money on the body.<eos> - Could he have posted it to his kids?<eos> - What?<eos> When?<eos> - Could he have had an envelope<eos> - and some stamps with him?
Who are we looking for here - - Postman Pat? !<eos> Why are we looking for anyone, Mac?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Maybe someone was putting the squeeze on him.<eos> Three jumpers at the bottom of that quarry in the last two years.<eos> Yeah, I know, but you don't think...<eos> - .. that there's something just a little bit...?<eos> - Charlie. - Mac?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, nothing.
It's fine, mate.<eos> In this experiment, it's advisable to use the minimum amount of solvent possible.<eos> Can anyone tell me why?<eos> Daly?<eos> - To maximise the yield?<eos> - Exactly so.<eos> So, the benzoic acid does not remain in solution on cooling.<eos> Now, who's going to tell me, is benzoic acid an ionic or a covalent compound?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Covalent?
- No, sorry, I don't know where he is.<eos> - Well, if you had a sec,<eos> - I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.<eos> - I have to feed the kids.<eos> We can do it here, or we can do it at the station.<eos> All right, let's do it here.<eos> When did you last see James?<eos> A few nights ago.<eos> What's "a few"?<eos> Two nights ago.
Thanks.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Just the bill.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Listen... .. you do know that after everything you've been through, it would be recommended that you really try to see someone like a counsellor.<eos> Nah.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> I'll tell you why?<eos> Because I don't have feelings, Mac.<eos> - Not proper ones.
James Morecroft.<eos> Did you arrest him?<eos> We didn't, no.<eos> - What's in here?<eos> ! - Stay away from there, do you hear me?<eos> !<eos> You're all right.<eos> Can I tell you the weird part?<eos> I don't have feelings, Mac.<eos> - 'Not proper ones.
OK?<eos> Come with me.<eos> You're going to need stitches.<eos> Have you got a name?<eos> Do you want me to call someone, like your mum, your dad?<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Here, hold this.<eos> Let me get you something.<eos> What do I have?<eos> Oh. What about some spaghetti hoop...?
What do I have?<eos> Oh. What about some spaghetti hoop...?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What are you doing in there?<eos> Oh! Goodness!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who's there? Jaysus!<eos> You have been in the wars, haven't you?<eos> - Yeah, a bit.
When?<eos> He said it's only matter of time.<eos> The Garda can't do nothing to stop it.<eos> What did you have to chase her around for?<eos> Who?<eos> That Paula one.<eos> I knew it from the minute you saw her.<eos> I knew it.<eos> When are they going to let you back?<eos> No idea.
- Right, where to now, girls?<eos> - Hall of mirrors.<eos> I'll tell you what it is.<eos> I'm looking into the case of a missing girl from the early '90s.<eos> You look so tiny!<eos> Madeleine, where's Orla?<eos> I thought she was with you.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Orla?
!<eos> Do you not know that? !<eos> - Paula?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> ! - Jesus Christ!<eos> She just pissed off!<eos> - ORLA CRIES<eos> - Yeah, OK. You all right?<eos> - Mac, I saw him!<eos> - Who?
- Some of our group patients didn't respond well to his treatment, so they started coming to see me privately.<eos> - Privately or secretly?<eos> - If what you're asking is if I knew it was a violation of our agreement, then yes, I did.<eos> But these people were hurting.<eos> - And you couldn't in good conscience turn them away.<eos> - No, I couldn't.<eos> - Paula, you have my word, this stays between you and me.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oliver, tell me you found something.<eos> - Nothing.
- Okay, look, Donna, I'm only gonna tell you this once.<eos> Harvey asked me to handle a matter for him.<eos> It's personal.<eos> He trusts me with it. Now, if you trust me at all, you'll take my word for the fact that Harvey and I are on good terms.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I trust you.<eos> - Harvey Specter. - We didn't have a proper introduction the last time we met.<eos> Holly Cromwell.<eos> - What do you want, Ms. Cromwell?<eos> - So much for formalities.
- Harvey.<eos> Everything okay with you and Louis?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> - 'Cause he said he was handling a matter for you, but he wouldn't tell me what it was, and five minutes ago I saw the two of you having an intense discussion.<eos> - Everything's okay, and it wasn't an intense discussion.<eos> It was a strategic meeting, so you don't need to get involved.<eos> - I wasn't trying to get involved.<eos> I was coming to tell you that Rick Dunn's been waiting in your office for 15 minutes.<eos> - 15 minutes?
- I know that, Louis, but it is my duty to keep bringing it up to you.<eos> Otherwise, why are we seeing each other?<eos> - Okay, then, Doc, honestly, I don't think that's it.<eos> - Then you shouldn't have any trouble doing what you know you have to do.<eos> - Holly, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm Donna Paulsen. - Thanks for meeting me so early.<eos> We can go over the deal points informally, but I will need my lawyer to take a look at the contract before I sign.<eos> - Actually, I have a few questions for you first.<eos> - What kind of questions?
How does dinner tonight sound?<eos> How does having it at my place sound?<eos> You're a crafty one, aren't you?<eos> What?<eos> I've got some steaks I've been wanting to throw on the grill.<eos> No, you want to have dinner at your place 'cause it's the closest restaurant in the city to your bedroom.<eos> Did you read that in "Zagat's"?<eos> No, I read your mind.<eos> Then what time am I thinking?<eos> How about 8:00?
Chase, I'd like you to meet our newest senior partner,<eos> Alex Williams.<eos> Two senior partners just to sign a contract.<eos> Seems excessive.<eos> It would be, but we're not here to sign anything.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He must think I'm pretty dumb.<eos> People always underestimate a pretty face.<eos> Maybe he just thinks you're dumb.<eos> 'Cause of the droopy eyes.
The breathing exercises.<eos> It's the only thing that's ever worked for you.<eos> What would I do without you, Doc?<eos> No need to go down that road, my friend.<eos> Now, picture yourself near the ocean, laying in the sand.<eos> Isn't it lovely?<eos> I got to say, that was pretty fun.<eos> I agree.<eos> I always wanted to pretend I had a friend at the DOJ.<eos> Not a bad first day.
It means the only reason they were able to wale on him for as long as they did is 'cause they didn't have enough of us on duty that night, 'cause the prison doesn't give a shit about anything except its bottom line.<eos> So what did you do?<eos> So I told him he could have the money, but if--if he tried taking those albums, we're gonna have trouble.<eos> This was lovely.<eos> But I have an early morning tomorrow.<eos> I think I should get home.<eos> Paula, what's going on?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Really.<eos> Nothing?
And that is not something that I thought my friend would do to me.<eos> Well, you know what, I never thought I would say this, but maybe you weren't ready for your new position.<eos> Well, you know what, Donna?<eos> Maybe neither were you.<eos> Dr. Lipschitz, I, uh-- I know you're in a session. I just wanted to say that you were right.<eos> Uh, I was overreacting.<eos> I do not have a problem with Alex.<eos> And, uh, if I ever get triggered again, I have the deep breathing.<eos> Anyway, thanks again.<eos> Auf Wiedersehen.
There is...<eos> Hmm!<eos> Yes!<eos> This is the area that controls respect of authority and veneration to God.<eos> Oh, my goodness, Caroline,<eos> I can feel your cerebellar.<eos> I've never one felt like it.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> The cerebellar is the seat of... amativeness.<eos> Of loving fondness and marital... congress.
Maybe with some of your wife's urine.<eos> - Ahh!<eos> - Ah, the mentalist has decided to grace us.<eos> Where have you been, listening to someone open their mind?<eos> No, I've been at... .. at the... lecture.<eos> William, this is Maggie.<eos> She's got a fancy for my surgery skills.<eos> - And this is, sorry, what's your name again, love?<eos> - Rebecca.<eos> - Oh, Becky.
- And this is, sorry, what's your name again, love?<eos> - Rebecca.<eos> - Oh, Becky.<eos> Girls, this is William, he's an alienist.<eos> - You won't know what that means.<eos> - Neither does he.<eos> - No-one does.<eos> Unclench, sir.<eos> Down the hatch.<eos> No, no, no brandies.
- No, I'm not!<eos> Or, shall we try a smatter of this?<eos> - Just come on sale, it's called Va Peru.<eos> - Oh, it looks fancy.<eos> It will restore health, energy and vitality.<eos> Oh, what's in it?<eos> Red wine and cocaine.<eos> The Pope likes it, he's endorsed it.<eos> - What does cocaine do, any side-effects?<eos> - Nothing major.

- Robert...<eos> Think what your reputation will become if you operate on a member of royalty and they don't feel pain.<eos> - Is this to improve my fame or yours?<eos> - It's to help the patient.<eos> What if you get the dose wrong?<eos> If you get the dose wrong and he dies?<eos> I'm trying to stop you doing to the Duke what you did to Smiles.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> You kill many more people than I do.<eos> - What?
He...<eos> What happened, Caroline?<eos> (He touched me.)<eos> He touched me like this.<eos> - Caroline...<eos> - William?<eos> - It is best if I leave now.<eos> - Oh.<eos> We will speak again soon, I'm sure.<eos> Good day.
He touched me like this.<eos> - Caroline...<eos> - William?<eos> - It is best if I leave now.<eos> - Oh.<eos> We will speak again soon, I'm sure.<eos> Good day.<eos> - That is the toilet.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Good day to you.
I take you didn't hear about what happened between me and Harvey.<eos> Rachel, what did he tell you?<eos> He didn't tell me anything.<eos> He asked me where you were and what you were working on, and I had to lie to his face.<eos> - Rachel, I...<eos> - Did you hear me? I had to lie to Harvey's face.<eos> Yes, I heard you, and I'm sorry.<eos> I don't want to hear "I'm sorry."<eos> I want to hear that you're dropping this goddamn thing.<eos> - Rachel, I...
They just threw us off of it.<eos> What the hell's the difference?<eos> The difference is it's a good case, and somebody else can still take it. - We just have to...<eos> - Stop bullshitting me!<eos> Now, you told me to turn down that settlement.<eos> I trusted you, and now it's over.<eos> No, it's not over, and I know I told you to turn down that settlement, but you told me you weren't doing this for the money and...<eos> Yes, I know. I told you I was doing it for justice.<eos> But I also told you I have a son and two other daughters, and you convinced me the only way to heal was to keep this from happening to someone else, and now I have nothing.<eos> No money, no justice, no healing.
No, that's for the order to come in.<eos> We just need a day for the installation.<eos> No, I won't be there myself, but I promise you he'll do a great job, and you'll be nice and cool for the rest of the summer.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, what... yeah, yes, that's right.<eos> I'm staying in tonight. All right, great, well, I will be in contact with you next week to confirm.<eos> Okay, thanks, Ms. Rosas.<eos> Yep, all right.<eos> Okay, bye.
She called her a whore.<eos> A degenerate. She refused to take Cora in.<eos> Cora was lucky to have you.<eos> I wasn't much better than they were.<eos> There were signs.<eos> I ignored them.<eos> What about that one?<eos> It was just easier when we went for pizza.<eos> Why don't we do something with your hair?<eos> Just for a change.
There's an explanation there somewhere.<eos> I didn't even notice her.<eos> None of us did.<eos> I remember I... I changed the music.<eos> Frankie was in a band when he was in med school, and I had the... the tracks on my phone to surprise him.<eos> We were just kidding around, and... next thing I know, she's there, screaming.<eos> Did Cora say anything during any of this to you, or anybody else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> What about before all this?
Did Frankie ever mention Cora's name, or any other women that you might not have met?<eos> He only ever talked about his colleagues... residents from the hospital.<eos> Well, maybe he knew her, but he didn't tell you about it.<eos> You mean, was he cheating on me? Is that what you're asking?<eos> Fact is, most people have secrets... even the most unlikely ones.<eos> There was a girl... that Frankie mentioned.<eos> He wouldn't talk about it with me, but... he told his friends, once, that he had some sort of intense connection with her, but there was something wrong with her.<eos> And then some sort of accident happened, and... it almost ruined his life.<eos> When was this?<eos> Five, six years ago.
Maybe it's a friend or one of your family.<eos> They've got TV cameras following them every minute of the day because of you.<eos> And they're in pain.<eos> And you're just gonna leave them there for the rest of their lives, with no explanation for what you did.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> I met Frankie on July 3rd.<eos> It was five years ago.<eos> Where were you?<eos> It was at a bar, on Route 6.<eos> Carl's Taproom.
I have faith that He heard you and He'll spare your sister.<eos> But... you have got to be stronger than this.<eos> I know that it's hard, but we can't give Him reasons to punish us.<eos> One bite of this chocolate, and He could take Phoebe's life.<eos> Okay.<eos> Show Him you understand.<eos> I can feel you brooding from across the room.<eos> Smiling on the inside.<eos> The usual?<eos> Medium-rare?
Frankie went to work for him for two months that summer.<eos> I have the registration paperwork in my office somewhere.<eos> He wasn't even on this coast!<eos> - Yeah? - Thought you should know this.<eos> - I was just gonna call you.<eos> - Been trying to track down Cora Tannetti's hospital records after that car accident.<eos> You know how she says she went to Saint Amelia's?<eos> They have no record of her.<eos> Checked all over the state.<eos> Nothing.
I can hear you.<eos> I'm armed, and a lot less happy than you are... so you want to stay well out of my way.<eos> Whoa! Oh!<eos> Ha!<eos> Reflexes like a cat.<eos> Unh!<eos> Either someone left a statue of a Speaker down here, or...<eos> Cyclops!<eos> Stone-eye cyclops.<eos> Right out of the family bestiary.
Torches that light by themselves that exactly fit descriptions written by my great-grandfather.<eos> Descriptions of the inside of Dracula's castle.<eos> I don't know what's down there, but it's not a messiah.<eos> I'll leave you all to it.<eos> No, no... nonsense.<eos> Please, stay with us for as long as you like.<eos> I cannot begin to repay what I owe you.<eos> You're leaving tonight, remember?<eos> Well, uh, yes.<eos> Until then.
You are here to fight us?<eos> You're here to convince the people that nomad black magicians are good for Gresit, and it is the presence of men of God that brought the night hordes upon us?<eos> - You know...<eos> - Silence!<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're a wreck.<eos> You stink.<eos> You can barely keep your eyes open.<eos> What do you expect to achieve against us?<eos> Absolutely nothing.
Don't forget... spread the word.<eos> Shit.<eos> The whip's consecrated... for fighting vampires and demons.<eos> Swords!<eos> There's an army of us!<eos> An army... from hell!<eos> The... catacombs again.<eos> I think we're deeper than I went before.<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh, for God's sake.
- Yeah.<eos> You saw how painful it was.<eos> No, I didn't, I was asleep the whole time.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> If you do get it, if worse comes to worse...<eos> - Mm-hmm? - I'll just pee on your dick.<eos> Please stop talking. What? You think I woke up this morning,<eos> I was like, you know what I'd like to do?<eos> No, but sometimes, you know, when you're in a relationship you have to do things for your partner, you know?<eos> - Yeah, it...
Well, well, well.<eos> You must feel pretty good about yourself.<eos> Oh, you mean because I just helped a blind man find a bathroom?<eos> Yeah, I feel pretty good.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> We'll just have two lattes and you got, like, a blueberry muffin?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Nine dollars...
My instinct is it's an impulse steal.<eos> Right?<eos> Me too, I mean, he was wearing a leather jacket.<eos> I won't even splurge on a leather jacket.<eos> Well, maybe we shouldn't be spending so much money on chicken.<eos> Maybe we should be stealing it so we can afford a sweet leather "J".<eos> Hey, do we know any single ladies?<eos> She says apropos of nothing.<eos> - Sorry... any ladies for Kyle?<eos> - Ladies of the night?
- That'd be fun.<eos> If Tilda Swinton is in it, I'm there.<eos> How's it feel to throw out a sentence that's never been uttered by another human being before?<eos> You know what's an underrated movie?<eos> - "Coneheads".<eos> - "Coneheads".<eos> Oh, yes, that's right.<eos> You mentioned that before, Uncle Richard, yet again.<eos> But just listen... the reason why Tilda is so great...<eos> "Tilda"?
You ran out of bagels?<eos> Uncle Richard had an extra half.<eos> Leon, this is what happens when you buy one bagel per person.<eos> It should be more than enough.<eos> I probably have some wheat bread or something I can put out, I don't know.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Why can't you just buy enough bagels?<eos> Does Leon look sick to you?<eos> - No, why?<eos> - No reason.
I drove home, I'm gonna see her again next weekend. Sorry... what?<eos> - Hmm? - Yeah, I'm gonna need you to just walk me through the "She asked me to put ice cubes up her butt" part again.<eos> Oh... I thought I just did.<eos> How is it that we always end up talking about buttholes at this poker game?<eos> Because we have the best poker game.<eos> I have to be honest.<eos> I really like Miss Shelly.<eos> - She's smart, she's funny. - Right, yes! She's cool.<eos> I guess the only weird thing is she ordered a six dollar bottle of water to drink at dinner, but was perfectly fine with the ice cubes I drank out of her ass being tap.<eos> "Ass cubes".
Hey, Barry.<eos> Mike.<eos> Leandra, will you set up that Caracas call for 2:00?<eos> I'll put it through.<eos> PowerPoint files from these documents in two hours, please.<eos> All right?<eos> What?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Two hours.
It ain't melting at all, Bud.<eos> No, no, look. It ain't even hot.<eos> What?<eos> Feel it. Feel it.<eos> I've never seen anything like that.<eos> Do you know what kind of metal this is?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Barry.<eos> Sorry, this is rude.<eos> Damn hot with all these bodies.
In a situation like this, it's normal for a handful of folks to panic and overreact.<eos> Would you agree with that?<eos> So why don't you consider that you might be one of those people?<eos> All right?<eos> I brought some bottled water from the cafeteria. Why don't you guys grab yourselves some?<eos> Not getting jack up here, either.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Keith!<eos> I see one!<eos> Who?
Who?<eos> Right there!<eos> Look!<eos> In the window.<eos> The security guard from this morning.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Help us!<eos> We're stuck! We're trapped!<eos> - Help us, please! - Come on, man!<eos> What the fuck?
So just relax and take the day off, man.<eos> Consider it a present from corporate fucking America.<eos> Oh, my God! What the fuck?<eos> Somebody's shooting!<eos> Get down.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Shit!<eos> No, Mr. Norris. Be careful!<eos> No. It's okay.<eos> What the hell?
What are you doing?<eos> What the...<eos> The bone...<eos> Jesus.<eos> His head exploded from the inside.<eos> What?<eos> The tags.<eos> When we start working here, they put tracers.<eos> They implanted them in the back of our heads.<eos> For insurance.
Mr. Milch, we would like you to answer a few questions.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What is this?<eos> I'm sorry, we're not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the experiment, Mr. Milch.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We're part of an international organization, Mr. Milch.<eos> Some of the greatest thinkers in the world, who believe social scientists must be allowed to study human behavior unfettered by conventional concepts.<eos> And believe me we've learned an incredible amount about the human mind and behavior since we started these experiments.<eos> Why?<eos> What for?
I get the point.<eos> You've been banging on about it since I've been out of nappies.<eos> Sign me up.<eos> Good lad.<eos> Good lad.<eos> Made you a nice cup of tea.<eos> Thanks, Mum.<eos> No more downhill, then?<eos> Not exactly a career, is it?<eos> Not even for fun?
Would you like me to visit you?<eos> I probably won't be here that much, to be honest.<eos> What with all the training I mentioned and...<eos> Do you have the key for the...?<eos> I'll get it off you later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes!<eos> What a doddle.
But wondered if I could get some advice and tips.<eos> How do you land, exactly?<eos> - You been jumping long?<eos> - Since yesterday afternoon.<eos> I know, I'm already on the 40.<eos> I'm a fast learner.<eos> How old are you?<eos> I'm 22.<eos> In Norway, the time to be starting jumping is when you are six years old.<eos> - Six years old.
Yes, okay.<eos> Well, there's a lot to be thinking about there so... I'm gonna just get to it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stupid Englishman.<eos> I bet he's dead by the weekend.<eos> No messing about this time.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> So, you're the mystery elf who's been hacking up my slope, huh?<eos> Just you?<eos> No pickaxe?
When I want advice on how to drunkenly plow snow, I'll look you up.<eos> Don't even think about doing the 70 meter.<eos> I don't want to have to clean up your mess when you break your neck.<eos> Whatever.<eos> What would you know about it, anyway?<eos> Get off my slope.<eos> Bronson Peary.<eos> Interstate youth champion 1968.<eos> Then the Olympic Squad under Warren Sharp.<eos> - The Warren Sharp?
What a lunatic.<eos> Wanna see how it's really done?<eos> Watch this guy.<eos> Number 2 in the world.<eos> And he knew what he was doing.<eos> You don't stand a chance.<eos> Hi, Bronson.<eos> You truly are a great Olympian.<eos> Always drink milk when I'm in training.<eos> Calcium.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Just helping.<eos> Up, back, forward, down.<eos> Up, back, forward, down.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - Up, back, forward, down.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Fell in love with this sport.<eos> It started with this little baby.<eos> This little 15 meter little vixen.
- Up, back, forward, down.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Fell in love with this sport.<eos> It started with this little baby.<eos> This little 15 meter little vixen.<eos> You manage to land that because it's meant to hook you into the sport... otherwise you wouldn't bother trying.<eos> The 40 meter, when you stack you get bruised, which I don't need to explain to you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The 70 meter... you break bones and you're lucky if you can walk again.<eos> The 90 meter.
Edwards. 49 meters.<eos> It's a practice jump.<eos> You don't need paperwork for a practice jump.<eos> At Oberstdorf we do everything to the letter.<eos> - I could've done two jumps by now.<eos> - Relax.<eos> Focused, not tense, remember?<eos> Focused, not tense.<eos> I did it. 61 meters.<eos> Without a headwind or breakfast.
You've got to give me another run.<eos> - We do everything to the letter.<eos> - You keep saying.<eos> But it doesn't help me.<eos> The British Olympic Association are trying to stop me, but I have to do this.<eos> This year 61 meters.<eos> Next year it'll be 71 meters.<eos> Then it's too late.<eos> I am going up that hill to jump and you are going to record my distance.<eos> No more jumping.
- Don't be silly.<eos> You've had knock-backs before and it's never stopped you.<eos> Dust yourself off.<eos> Mum, you don't understand.<eos> I'm never going to the Olympics.<eos> That was my one chance and I blew it.<eos> So I'm gonna work the week out for Petra and then I'm coming home.<eos> Good.<eos> Get the van back sharpish, and I don't ever wanna hear about ski-jumps again.<eos> Goodnight.
It's for good luck... but it's a team tradition, Ed.<eos> And you are part of this team.<eos> To the British team.<eos> There you go, that's the spirit.<eos> Can I get a lager beer and a mineral water here, please?<eos> - Do I have to do all five of them?<eos> - Yeah, you bet.<eos> Good choice.<eos> That's absinthe.<eos> 57 nations.

This is your moment.<eos> I need a practice jump.<eos> What do you need to know you don't know already?<eos> It's higher than you've jumped.<eos> You're gonna go faster than ever before.<eos> You're gonna fly farther than your tiny little brain can handle, but... it's just a jump, man.<eos> Simple.<eos> Eddie, listen.<eos> You got more dedication, more heart and spirit than any jumpers out there.<eos> Any of them.
I'm Edwards.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Eddie "The Eagle." Eddie "The Eagle."<eos> For you.<eos> Not for them.
Hold him down!<eos> Hold him!<eos> Where they going?<eos> Charleston.<eos> Charleston.<eos> That's Carolina 3rd.<eos> A bunch of them are headed home.<eos> Twenty negro law.<eos> If you own 20 negroes, you get to go home.<eos> Since when?
Twenty negro law.<eos> If you own 20 negroes, you get to go home.<eos> Since when?<eos> The first, I guess.<eos> New conscription act.<eos> Poor man's fightin' a rich man's war.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know they got a house in natchez with gold doorknobs.<eos> Not gold-lookin'.<eos> Gold. Real gold.
I'm gonna be there with you tomorrow.<eos> We're gonna make for a tree line about a quarter mile out.<eos> You don't listen to no sergeant, no officers.<eos> Only me. You understand now?<eos> When I tell you to go, move fast and stay close to me.<eos> All right? You got a full load?<eos> Half-cock, safe.<eos> Full-cock, fire.<eos> Ain't no different than shooting' a bird or a deer, Daniel.<eos> No different than that.
To get a doctor.<eos> You can't go in town.<eos> They'll arrest you.<eos> I'm gonna go to Sally's place, have her fetch one.<eos> You're going to that roadhouse?<eos> We ain't got a doctor no more.<eos> Doc hacket moved to Alabama, and prentiss is off at the war.<eos> Look, he's burnin' up, Sally, and I can't go into town.<eos> Well, there's this creole slave over at eakins.<eos> Kind of healer.

We need to get a message to him.<eos> -Him?<eos> -Stop.<eos> I don't have the Patience for that.<eos> Tell your unionist friend that if he will disband this little-- little, um-- army?<eos> Company of theirs, we will rescind the hanging notice and Grant him a full pardon.<eos> All he has to do is come out of that swamp.<eos> He can go right back in the army.<eos> Two barrels of molasses, a hundred pounds of wheat flour, three barrels of whiskey...<eos> And five hundred dollars.
He sends this, we can keep this place forever, men.<eos> Feathers.<eos> Shh. It's okay. It's okay.<eos> They control everything from meridian to the pascagoula.<eos> They've seized ellisville, hold all of Jones, Jasper, Perry and half of Smith counties.<eos> They've got 250 men, maybe even runaway slaves who, frankly, sir, don't have much to lose.<eos> That's all they sent?<eos> -You told 'em we took three counties?<eos> -Of course.<eos> Hundred rifles.
And that's all right.<eos> I guess we're kind of our own country. That's right, newt.<eos> If we're honest about it, hadn't we been our own country for a long time?<eos> -Yes, sir. -That's true.<eos> Now, Jasper here, he, uh, obviously a lot more learned than I am.<eos> He was saying that, uh, if in fact we are our own country, well then, by god, we ought to stand up and declare it.<eos> Yeah. Yes, sir.<eos> Even if they push us back in the swamps, if we're willing to die for something, we sure ought to be able to say what it is out loud.<eos> Jasper, let me see that paper there.<eos> From this day forward,
Ain't that bad of a house.<eos> Y'all come on inside.<eos> Come on.<eos> Theprosecution would lead you to believe-- go on in now.<eos> That when Serena knight left Jones county in the middle of the war, she never came back.<eos> Their entire case hinges on the idea that if newt knight had a second child after the war,<eos> that child had to be with Rachel knight.<eos> But there's a problem with that, ladies and gentlemen, because as these census records clearly indicate,<eos> Serena knight came home to soso in 1865.<eos> Two women...
This book is pretty conclusive evidence.<eos> In fact, in all my years of prosecuting,<eos> I never seen a more damning piece of evidence.<eos> Now, Mr. knight, i don't believe you really knew which side of the family you were on.<eos> What's your offer?<eos> We have no desire to send your client to jail, Mr. oaks, but we can't tolerate this kind of example either.<eos> So if he will get this marriage annulled, leave the state of Mississippi, then we'll agree to drop all charges against him.<eos> You mean, I end my marriage?<eos> In case you haven't been here for the past three weeks, Mr. knight, your marriage is neither a lawful nor proper union.<eos> Proper union?
Because the air up there, it's contaminated.<eos> I see you've met Emmett.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> He did that to himself.<eos> And his stumbling around isn't helping anything.<eos> What you heard earlier, was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week's worth of food, which he's sorry for, correct?<eos> Totally.<eos> Let's go.<eos> This is the common area.<eos> Good for r r.
Could be military.<eos> But not ours.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> Fourteen years in the Navy.<eos> What's happening up there?<eos> My guess? Those flashes that kicked this all off? That was phase one.<eos> Take out your opponent's population centers with big hits, all at once, fast.<eos> And then for round two, ground sweeps.<eos> A satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently.<eos> Possibly extraterrestrial signals.
I'm talking tonight at a neurological society dinner.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Another speaking engagement?<eos> So romantic.<eos> You used to love coming to those things with me.<eos> We had fun together.<eos> No!<eos> You had fun.<eos> They weren't about us, they were about you.<eos> Not only about me.
We were barely lovers.<eos> But you just love a sob story, don't you?<eos> Is that what I am to you now?<eos> "Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."<eos> "He finally needs me."<eos> Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.<eos> Patch him up and send him back into the world... Heart's just humming.<eos> You care so much, don't you?<eos> Goodbye, Stephen.<eos> All the way.
Sorry.<eos> What do you mean, "threats?"<eos> Learning of an infinite multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers.<eos> If I told you everything else that you don't already know... You'd run from here in terror.<eos> So just how ancient is she?<eos> No one knows the age of the sorcerer supreme.<eos> Only that she's Celtic and never talks about her past.<eos> You follow her, even though you don't know?<eos> I know she's steadfast... But unpredictable.<eos> Merciless, yet kind.
He was a grieving, broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts.<eos> A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.<eos> He questioned the ancient one, rejected her teaching.<eos> He left kamar-taj.<eos> His disciples followed him like sheep.<eos> Seduced by false doctrine.<eos> And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did it do?<eos> No more questions.
While heroes like the avengers protect the world from physical dangers... We sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.<eos> The ancient one is the latest in a long line of sorcerers supreme... Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts... The mighty Agamotto.<eos> Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.<eos> Agamotto built three sanctums in places of power... Where great cities now stand.<eos> That door leads to the Hong Kong sanctum.<eos> That door to the New York sanctum.<eos> That one to the London sanctum.<eos> Together... The sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.<eos> The sanctums protect the world... And we sorcerers... Protect the sanctums.<eos> From what?
Together... The sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.<eos> The sanctums protect the world... And we sorcerers... Protect the sanctums.<eos> From what?<eos> Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe.<eos> Like dormammu.<eos> Where did you learn that name?<eos> I just read it in the book of cagliostro.<eos> Why?<eos> Dormammu dwells in the dark dimension.<eos> Beyond time.
Okay.<eos> After all this time... You just show up here...<eos> Flying out of your body.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I missed you, too, by the way.<eos> Ha ha.<eos> I wrote you emails, but you never responded.<eos> Why would I?<eos> Christine, I am so, so sorry.<eos> For all of it.
That is hilarious.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> It's true.<eos> She does draw power from the dark dimension.<eos> Kaecilius.<eos> I came to you broken... Lost, in need.<eos> Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.<eos> I tried to protect you.<eos> From the truth?<eos> From yourself.
- Yes.<eos> Someone get the swabs.<eos> Nic?<eos> We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.<eos> She's still dropping.<eos> - We're losing her!<eos> - We need to increase her oxygen!<eos> - I need a crash cart!<eos> - Her pupils have dilated!<eos> No reflexes.
But I can't see past it.<eos> I've prevented countless, terrible futures.<eos> And after each one, there's always another.<eos> And they all lead here... But never further.<eos> You think this is where you die.<eos> You wonder what I see in your future?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I never saw your future.<eos> Only its possibilities.
When the sanctum's restored, they'll attack it again.<eos> We've got to defend it.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get up, Strange.<eos> Get up and fight.<eos> We can finish this.<eos> You can't fight the inevitable.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> A world beyond time.<eos> Beyond death.
We've got to defend it.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get up, Strange.<eos> Get up and fight.<eos> We can finish this.<eos> You can't fight the inevitable.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> A world beyond time.<eos> Beyond death.<eos> Beyond time...
Take your zealots from the earth.<eos> End your assault on my world.<eos> Never come back.<eos> Do it... And I'll break the loop.<eos> Get up, Strange!<eos> Get up and fight.<eos> We can finish this.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> A world beyond time.<eos> Beyond death.
I've been away for many months now, and I've had a revelation.<eos> The true purpose of a sorcerer... Is to twist things out of their proper shape... Stealing power...<eos> Like you.<eos> I've stolen nothing.<eos> This is my power.<eos> Mine.<eos> Power... Has a purpose.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I see, at long last, what's wrong with the world.<eos> Too many sorcerers.
No need to stand on ceremony.<eos> A simple handshake will suffice.<eos> This is Mr. Costin. but I have received a telegram from the border commission.<eos> Go on.<eos> They strongly advise you to... Abort the mission.<eos> sir.<eos> They're already fighting...<eos> Where are the government offices?<eos> Sir?<eos> sir?
Major...<eos> Food gone.<eos> we are dead from hungry.<eos> One piece.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Give me that!<eos> Control yourselves!<eos> We are not savages.<eos> major.<eos> And for what?
I shall send it to you as a sign...<eos> Just in case I decide not to come back.<eos> nonsense.<eos> we... We...<eos> We have something for you.<eos> please.<eos> The society's highest honor...<eos> The founder's gold medal.<eos> colonel.<eos> Truly.
It's been years.<eos> We've sent almost 100 men and...<eos> I fear we have to accept the inevitable.<eos> I confess that the brutal wear and tear is great.<eos> And I suffer with heart and soul.<eos> It has taken...<eos> All my strength of will but I beg you...<eos> Not to lose confidence.<eos> I cannot doubt...<eos> After so many years of sacrifice.
Great.<eos> But I saw that you had a recommendation letter from Dr. Branum at Princeton.<eos> Their science department is really not what it used to be.<eos> And I would consider getting a referral from a more prestigious college.<eos> More prestigious than Princeton?<eos> Yes.<eos> You see, I think you're an asset to modern physics, but I would hate to see you throw it down the drain.<eos> I won't throw it down the drain, sir.<eos> And I will get on that letter.<eos> And about your clothes...
I get it.<eos> She also happens to specialize in experimental particle physics.<eos> Holtzmann and I are really busy here actualizing what we just theorized about in our book.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> We're incredibly close on the hollow laser for the reverse tractor beam.<eos> Really close.<eos> You're making a reverse tractor beam?<eos> Abby, why don't you let her listen to the EVP.<eos> -What EVP? -No.
When we give someone tenure, they represent this institution.<eos> But this is just not what this institution is about.<eos> Dr. Gibbons. Hello.<eos> Just moving offices.<eos> You know. They found a couple cats in the wall.<eos> Really stunk in there.<eos> Glad I'm getting out.<eos> I didn't get fired.<eos> I got fired!<eos> After years, years of hard work. And ass-kissing.
-He's not gonna say "suck it."<eos> Suck it.<eos> -You were right.<eos> -You know...<eos> My gosh.<eos> I think it might be a ghost.<eos> No, it's not. It's just a bird.<eos> Bye.<eos> There's the door.<eos> Later days.
Here we go.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> What do you think of that?<eos> Yeah, you do see how this might make us look bad, right?<eos> Is it the boobs you don't like?<eos> 'Cause I can make them bigger.<eos> No, I can see them.<eos> Yeah, I can definitely see them.<eos> You know what? I think it's not always about the end result. It's about the journey.<eos> Well, what about this one?
No. No, that's for you.<eos> You know, I just thought the floating hot dog implies that a ghost is holding it.<eos> Your work is more cerebral than I expected.<eos> See some more?<eos> -Those are great.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> We're actually gonna discuss everything just for a second, so if you could just stand over there,<eos> -we just need to convene for a moment.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Sure. All right.
-No, no, this is very helpful.<eos> This is not helpful for me.<eos> 'Ey. Look at me.<eos> Stop.<eos> -Stop painting.<eos> -I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't like this on my wall.<eos> You don't want it here anymore?<eos> -I don't want this ghost on my wall.<eos> -No ghost.
What is that, a burn?<eos> That's where I saw that weird sparking thing.<eos> What was it?<eos> Baby, if I knew what it was, I wouldn't say "a weird sparking thing."<eos> It looks like fission scorch.<eos> What? Fission scorch down here?<eos> Except that you're right.<eos> What is...<eos> Wait, I'm smelling both electrical discharge<eos> -and isotopic decay.
How is that...<eos> Holtzmann?<eos> -Yeah. What?<eos> -Come here.<eos> I need your snoot on this.<eos> Am I nuts?<eos> 'Ey, 'ey, ladies.<eos> While y'all over there making out with that dirty piece of garbage, we only got a couple of minutes.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> -The eyes.
Why fear what's around you?<eos> It could be everything you dreamed And it's about to be true<eos> Yeah<eos> Come with the one who wants to drag you away from the shore<eos> 'Cause you're looking for more<eos> You want some more<eos> That's not mine!<eos> I think those machines are making them stronger!<eos> That thing is super ionized!<eos> And super not-benign!
I'm quite well.<eos> That's good.<eos> You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.<eos> Pretty cool, right?<eos> If it doesn't work, we can just swing it around and break stuff, so it's kind of a win-win.<eos> -What?<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> Not my babies!
It's ridiculous. Let's get Kevin.<eos> I knew he was dumb as a box of rocks.<eos> I didn't know he's as heavy as one.<eos> What's he made out of?<eos> Pure muscle.<eos> And baby-soft skin.<eos> Come on, Rowan, show yourself!<eos> What form would you prefer I take?<eos> Maybe something stationary.<eos> Like a bull's-eye.
Yeah.<eos> You got to go around the board, pass "Go," collect 200 dicks.<eos> And you remember the best thing that ever happened to me was when I was thinking about quitting medical school.<eos> Please don't tell the medical school story.<eos> And then, my piece of shit boyfriend, Bobby, cheated on me with my lab partner, because she was willing to do things that I wasn't.<eos> Did it involve midgets?<eos> No.<eos> I once slept with an albino.<eos> Anyway, the good news is, now there are... 3,000 beautiful babies in the world and no one can take that away<eos> - ...from me.

Congratulations, good luck with it.<eos> I hope it lasts.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No filter.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I hope, uh, that kiss wasn't too much.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, no, that was awesome!<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> Good night.
I know.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you think it's a bad idea?<eos> Why are you saying "Oh, my God" five times?<eos> No, but...<eos> Wait, when do you meet him?<eos> That's the best part.<eos> I never, ever have to meet him, or any of his family.<eos> There's no strings attached at all.<eos> Nothing.
I'll tell you how it ends.<eos> He kisses her, and she wakes up and finally feels loved and understood, and wanted.<eos> But then, her friend sees him dining with the peach lady and before she knows it, she's kicked out of the castle.<eos> "The peach lady"?<eos> You bet your sweet ass "the peach lady."<eos> And now, you know, she's fixating on all her mistakes and all the money she spent on makeup and blow-outs, and the heels!<eos> The heels!<eos> Walking around on these.<eos> And I'm not supposed to have any hair here.<eos> No hair here, but tons of it here.
We can't pass "eleven."<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Our drink number.<eos> In every male and female friendship, there's a number of drinks, and if you pass it, you have to have sex, mathematically.<eos> Whatever, dude.<eos> Oi.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Loud noise.<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> The floor.
I had it made for her, specially.<eos> Aw.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> Look how cozy.<eos> Maybe I'll give it to her.<eos> Just, later on.<eos> Hey!<eos> No Tom, no Josh, I'm just gonna have a really good time and I'm not gonna think about any boys at all.<eos> Here's to no drama.<eos> - No drama.
We got a whole "No hats" thing but you seem like a good guy, and, you know...<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up, guys?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Josh.<eos> You're Josh?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> No...<eos> Nothing.
- Pillows?<eos> That's a slippery slope.<eos> Indeed it is.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Eugene told me that h-he left you some messages?<eos> Yep. Yep, I owe him a call. Look, I don't...<eos> I don't give a damn one way or the other.<eos> He was askin' about you, so I was wonderin' if you could find the time to swing by?<eos> Tomorrow night?<eos> - That work?
- That work?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> Get him!<eos> You got him, Donnie? Hold him down!<eos> Sheriff?<eos> I can't say how... but I heard Donnie there... might be layin' hands on his wife.<eos> I figured you might want to talk to her.<eos> I'll listen to a formal complaint should the victim come forward.<eos> Well, that's unlikely, ain't it?<eos> These kinds of situations?
God doesn't hold grudges.<eos> If you get down on your knees... and you listen... and I mean really listen...<eos> He'll say somethin'.<eos> I promise.<eos> Tom Cruise has died. This footage just coming in from a Church of Scientology service<eos> Cruise was presiding over when apparently... and details are still coming in... he spontaneously exploded.<eos> You're right.<eos> Can I have a bottle of 10-year whiskey, if you have it.<eos> Otherwise, I just suppose I'll choke down a bottle of...<eos> "Ratwater."
What can I show you?<eos> Show me Homestead II.<eos> Homestead II is the fourth planet in the Bhakti system. Right.<eos> And where are we?<eos> We're in transit from Earth to Homestead II.<eos> We will arrive in approximately 90 years. What?<eos> We arrive at Homestead II... in 90 years, three weeks... and one day.<eos> No, wait.<eos> How long ago did we leave Earth?<eos> Approximately 30 years ago.
Maybe I missed something.<eos> I could use a hand.<eos> That's all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Message sent.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> Message will arrive in 19 years.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Earliest reply in 55 years.<eos> Fifty-five years?
I know some things.<eos> What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?<eos> Oh, hibernation pods are fail-safe.<eos> They never malfunction.<eos> Well, I woke up early.<eos> Can't happen.<eos> How long until we get to Homestead II?<eos> About 90 years or so.<eos> And when are all the passengers supposed to wake up?<eos> Not till the last four months.
Anybody?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you passenger, or crew?<eos> Passenger.<eos> Jim Preston.<eos> Aurora Lane.<eos> Do you know what's going on?<eos> Nobody else from my row woke up.<eos> Same for me.
Stop!<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Putting somebody into hibernation... requires special equipment.<eos> Remember the facility where they put us under... all the procedures we went through?<eos> These pods are designed to keep us in hibernation... to wake us up at the right time... but they can't put us back to sleep.<eos> You don't think there's a way back into hibernation?<eos> No.<eos> But there has to be.<eos> There has to be.<eos> 9:00.
You just came out of hibernation.<eos> It's going to be a couple of days before you're 100%.<eos> You should get some rest.<eos> Think I'm gonna have to.<eos> I'll walk you to your cabin.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night, Aurora.<eos> More than a year?
The colonies, they have problems to solve.<eos> They're my kind of problems.<eos> And a mechanic is somebody.<eos> This is a new world, still being built.<eos> I could build a house and live in it.<eos> Open country. Room to grow.<eos> Now you're back to slogans.<eos> Can't slogans be true?<eos> Do you know how much Homestead Company... made off its first planet?<eos> Eight quadrillion dollars.
Then he became a monster.<eos> He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.<eos> Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.<eos> He never found it.<eos> I saved the best for last.<eos> - The witch.<eos> - A witch?<eos> I'm talking a flying, spell-casting, making-shit-disappear witch.<eos> A sorceress from another dimension.<eos> Another world.
It's great.<eos> Come on, do the bastard.<eos> Hey, be careful.<eos> He eats people.<eos> Sorry, Mother Superior, what?<eos> He eats people for reals, homie.<eos> He's a cannibal.<eos> No.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> Nothing.
And, uh, for two sweet seconds...<eos> I had hope.<eos> You had hope, huh?<eos> Hope don't stop the wheel from turning, my brother.<eos> You preaching?<eos> It's coming back around for you.<eos> How many people you killed, man?<eos> You don't ask nobody no question like that, ese.<eos> You ain't ever whacked down no women.<eos> No kids.
I kept it hidden for most of my life, but...<eos> The older I got, the stronger it got.<eos> So I started using it.<eos> For business, you know.<eos> The more power on the street I got, the more fire power I got.<eos> Like, that shit went hand in hand.<eos> You know?<eos> One was feeding the other.<eos> Ain't nobody tell me no.<eos> Except my old lady.
What, you were just...<eos> Thinking you can have a happy family and coach little leagues, and make car payments?<eos> Normal's a setting on the dryer.<eos> People like us, we don't get normal!<eos> Why is it always a knife fight every single time you open your mouth?<eos> You know, outside you're amazing.<eos> But inside, you're ugly.<eos> We all are.<eos> We all are!<eos> Except for him.
The kind of people who can get the answers.<eos> And if they can get those answers, my head will be on a pike.<eos> Consider yourself under my protection.<eos> If you deliver.<eos> Why, Mr. Wayne?<eos> Just like to make friends.<eos> That's the difference between us.<eos> You believe in friendship.<eos> I believe in leverage.<eos> Good night.
Fuck it.<eos> I got this.<eos> 9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust.<eos> Right here!<eos> That's $27.50.<eos> I never carry a wallet when I'm working.<eos> Ruins the lines of my suit.<eos> But, how about a crisp high five?<eos> Okay.<eos> Merry Christmas.
When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man?<eos> Which benefits?<eos> The matching unitards?<eos> The house that blows up every few years?<eos> Please.<eos> House blowing up builds character.<eos> You ate breakfast, yes?<eos> Breakfast is most important meal of day.<eos> Here, protein bar.<eos> Good for bones.
Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!<eos> Domestic, nothing imported.<eos> Baby, are you sure you wanna shoot your whole wad?<eos> Tight.<eos> -Vanessa.<eos> -Wade.<eos> What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?<eos> I'd hit that.<eos> Buck, you best apologize before...<eos> Yeah, that.
FYI, five mini lion-bots come together to form one super-bot, so...<eos> Five mini lion-bots?<eos> Three minutes.<eos> Deal.<eos> What do we do with the remaining two minutes, 37 seconds?<eos> Cuddle?<eos> How long can you keep this up?<eos> All year?<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> Happy Chinese New Year.

We can fight this.<eos> Besides, I just realized something.<eos> You win.<eos> Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.<eos> I love you.<eos> Wade.<eos> Weas.<eos> You look like you need a Blow Job and a shower.<eos> Though courtesy calls for the latter first.<eos> How about three shots of Patrón?

Pretty grossed out.<eos> Ta... Da.<eos> I wish I never heard of Craigslist.<eos> And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind to life's imperfections.<eos> "Must be good with hands."<eos> Or would you rather I build the IKEA, and you pay rent?<eos> Why such a douche this morning?<eos> Let's recap.<eos> The cock thistle that turned me into this freak... slipped through my arms today...<eos> Arm.
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's heart back!<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And then, win Gita back... the old fashioned way:<eos> with your boyish charm.<eos> Kidnap her.<eos> He's super dead.<eos> I presume a crisp high five?<eos> For you?
You only work for that shit-spackled muppet fart.<eos> So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms... in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle... possibly even lover-like treatment.<eos> Fine.<eos> Commando!<eos> Teabag!<eos> Bob?<eos> Wade?<eos> Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since...<eos> -Jacksonville.<eos> Fridays. -Since TGI Fridays.
Get out of here.<eos> Go make yourself useful!<eos> You, go be a really big brother to someone.<eos> Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.<eos> And you, chicken noodle... nothing compares to you.<eos> Sinéad O'Connor, 1990.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> You're cool.<eos> What in the ass?
This is Camilla.<eos> Hello.<eos> Bridget.<eos> An old friend.<eos> Well, less old, more childhood!<eos> So, nice memorial, as memorials go.<eos> Almost makes one look forward to one's own.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye!
Still, I wasn't going to dwell on the negatives.<eos> At least no one at work knew it was my birthday.<eos> Or, indeed, how old I was going to be.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Happy birthday, Bridget!<eos> Gosh!<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> Who told you?<eos> It's so hot.<eos> So many candles!
Are you sure there wasn't another treasurable occasion in between?<eos> Yes, I'm quite sure.<eos> He was away.<eos> So, which of the two would you go for?<eos> Couldn't say.<eos> They're both equally likely.<eos> It could've been after the events because as you know sperm can live for several days after ejaculation.<eos> Couldn't you just have a guess for me?<eos> No.<eos> What about the first scan?
Apart from Lady Mary on Downton Abbey?<eos> Now, can we go ahead and talk about the book?<eos> Cue Hitler cats!<eos> Don't be evasive.<eos> Oh, don't be evasive.<eos> Uh, it's apparent you have everything.<eos> Why have you chosen to have no family...<eos> Why the decision to have no family and...<eos> No children?<eos> And no children?
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't answer that.<eos> Can't or won't, Lu Tong?<eos> Can't or won't, General Lu Tong?<eos> On balance I'd suggest "can't" considering I've just found General Lu Tong in the lobby and his chauffeur is currently live on-air answering questions about Far Eastern geopolitics.<eos> No?<eos> Any comment you want to make about the use of sexual torture by your own military?<eos> Ask him about London traffic.<eos> London traffic, General Lu Tong? Anything to say about that?<eos> No comment there.
Uh, no, I don't think that's wise.<eos> Ready?<eos> No, Bridget.<eos> Bridget!<eos> Call Jack.<eos> I come behind with the bags, Mr. Mark.<eos> And I call Mr. Jack.<eos> It's all right, Bridget. We'll find a way.<eos> I don't think I can walk.<eos> All right.
Calvin Joyner, everybody, voted "Most Likely to Succeed."<eos> Golden Jet! Golden Jet! Golden Jet!<eos> Hey. Check it.<eos> - What is the matter with you?<eos> - What?<eos> What do you mean, "What"? Why do you think I wanna see that?<eos> No, I'm working on a new sexting app.<eos> Okay. It's kind of like lnstagram, right?<eos> But, instead of filters, it just makes yourjunk look huge.<eos> Like, three to six inches bigger.
- Darla McGuckian.<eos> - Darla McGuckian.<eos> "Yucky Gucky."<eos> - Didn't she have a lazy eye or something?<eos> - Two of 'em.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, but listen, I don't wanna talk about me. I wanna talk about you.<eos> I heard that you and Maggie Johnson got hitched.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, man, right after college.
I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.<eos> I'm leaving right now.<eos> I'll meet you at the house.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't go home!<eos> - Don't go home!<eos> - Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing!
You know, you're still an asshole.<eos> Yeah, well, you're still shorter than my cat.<eos> Here's your transaction number.<eos> Hit it, Ant-Man.<eos> - Thank you, Trevor.<eos> - Yup.<eos> Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.<eos> Bye-bye now.<eos> - Was it push or pull?<eos> - Clean push.
- Good going, Bob!<eos> - Come on, Bob!<eos> - All right.<eos> - Good luck!<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I love you, too, little Golden Jet!<eos> Okay. Uh...<eos> How long do you think he's been there?<eos> Hmm, probably since last night.
Sorry.<eos> Okay, Goofy.<eos> The glare on the plastic...<eos> You just, you we... you were walking by and you saw it?<eos> This is where we found the DV tape.<eos> And there was nothing else on the tape?<eos> No.<eos> Like I said, it was all static except for that bit that we uploaded.<eos> Why does the tree look like that?<eos> Lightning.
Is it bad?<eos> It just feels like it's really deep and it hurts.<eos> No, it's not bad at all.<eos> I just gotta clean it.<eos> Lisa, do you mind gettin' my first-aid kit?<eos> - It's in my bag over there.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Lisa.<eos> First-aid kit.<eos> Bag.
- What is this?<eos> This looks familiar, doesn't it, guys?<eos> Yeah, that's rope.<eos> And kindling.<eos> That's useful for camping. Give that to me!<eos> Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!<eos> Get back.<eos> You have the symbols from the camp, don't you, Talia? So can I see one?<eos> Because this rope looks exactly the same.<eos> What the hell?
We'll... we'll figure it out.<eos> Can you please at least take down those creepy stick figures?<eos> - I can't look at those things anymore.<eos> - I got it, I got it.<eos> Hey, can I see your camera?<eos> Just wanna charge the batteries and change the cards out and stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.
And, uh... You should just stay lying down. I'll be right back.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm just gonna rest my eyes. Okay.<eos> Hey, I need to talk to you.<eos> That cut on Ashley's foot, it's gotten worse.<eos> But...<eos> No, no, whatever it was, it was really fuckin' weird, man, and...<eos> Okay.<eos> You said it looked like a muscle spasm?<eos> Yeah, or something like...
Not me!<eos> Lane!<eos> Talia.<eos> We're just gonna go sit by a fire and we'll set up a tent for you, okay?<eos> Is he coming back?<eos> I don't think I can sleep.<eos> Me neither.<eos> What?<eos> Makes no sense.<eos> What?
I don't think I can sleep.<eos> Me neither.<eos> What?<eos> Makes no sense.<eos> What?<eos> Well I set the alarm for 7:00, but it's still dark outside.<eos> Okay.<eos> We should pack up.<eos> Okay.<eos> What the hell?
If it's not...<eos> Just as long as it's the best.<eos> Is your faith helping you?<eos> I'd prefer to discuss my faith with a priest.<eos> You're not a man of the cloth, are you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm just trying to get to the truth.<eos> That's what reporters do.<eos> Oh, the truth.
If there's a heaven, then there's your god, with all his empty promises.<eos> What kind of god takes a father from his two little children?<eos> Thy lord sacrificed his only son...<eos> And my two babies.<eos> Arabella in the womb.<eos> And Patrick.<eos> Thirty-nine hours on earth.<eos> Just long enough to fall in love with him.<eos> What did I do to deserve that?<eos> Nothing.
Oh, yes.<eos> There's dozens of names.<eos> Good.<eos> Will you read them to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, from the united nations, there's Paul Hoffman, managing director,<eos> David b. Vaughan.<eos> The king of Belgium.<eos> Denmark, the crown prince George.<eos> Bulgaria, the deputy minister of foreign affairs.
Not ghosts and storybook legends, people who faced adversity and overcame it.<eos> What you've done in this house matters.<eos> That's kind of you, bill.<eos> Even I'm starting to lose him.<eos> Pretty soon he'll just be another oil portrait lining these hallways.<eos> I spoke to Johnson.<eos> Tomorrow...<eos> It's being handled.<eos> Everyone will ride.<eos> No procession.
Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July.<eos> You will once again be fighting for our freedom...<eos> Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from annihilation.
And so, I appreciate you finally granting us this access, Mr. Umbutu.<eos> Your father was very tenacious.<eos> His pride caused the death of more than half of my people...<eos> - including my brother.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> Be careful!<eos> Wow!<eos> What happened here?<eos> They were drilling.<eos> For what?
Ladies and gentlemen... please welcome the International Legacy Squadron.<eos> Captain Hiller, considering he died during a test flight... how do you feel taking off for the Moon from a hangar named after your father?<eos> He would have loved it.<eos> It's too bad he's not here to see it.<eos> Captain Lao, China has been integral to the Earth Space Defense Program.<eos> Is there anything you want to say to the folks back home?<eos> I didn't want to text you.<eos> I wanted to hear your voice.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
And in our darkest moment... when all hope was lost... I said, "Never give up.<eos> "You have to have faith."<eos> And in that moment, it came to me, "pow!"... like a thunderbolt.<eos> And that's when I came up with the idea that saved the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sir.<eos> There he is.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> This book is a bargain.<eos> $9.95.
Dad!<eos> He's breathing.<eos> Someone call a medical team!<eos> Is it dead?<eos> I told you.<eos> You kill them from behind.<eos> - Daisy, stop crying.<eos> - She's scared.<eos> An evacuation order...<eos> - of the southern and eastern coastal regions...
Anytime, gentlemen.<eos> You guys go ahead.<eos> We'll cover the rear.<eos> Big closing doors!<eos> Big closing doors!<eos> Jake!<eos> Where are you?<eos> We're on our way!<eos> Rain, how long we got?<eos> 20 seconds, max.
Dylan, what's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My controls just stopped responding.<eos> Same here.<eos> - Charlie, do something!<eos> - I can't!<eos> She must have taken control of our systems.<eos> I think we're part of the hive now.<eos> Looks like we're not the only ones.<eos> The hell?
There she is!<eos> Everybody, we got one shot at this.<eos> Let's make it count.<eos> Thanks for always looking out for me, Jake.<eos> You got it, buddy.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> - It's over.<eos> - You got 'em all.<eos> Okay.<eos> Except that one.
She's fresh as fuck, and you know it.<eos> I don't know why you're limiting yourself to one bun. There's plenty of buns.<eos> Because I believe in bunogomy.<eos> I'm a bunogamist.<eos> And when a bun this fresh is into you, all you ask is when and how deep.<eos> And the answer is:<eos> As soon as we get to the Great Beyond and as deep as she'll let me.<eos> I'm gonna talk to her.<eos> Hey, Brenda.<eos> What up, girl?
It's not like anyone writes home...<eos> - ...and says, "God, I had the best tip."<eos> - Get away from me.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> It was you.<eos> You cocksucking bagel fuckface!<eos> Hey!<eos> Watch it!<eos> You pushed me out of the cart.<eos> No surprise there, huh?
Hey, who you calling useless, you flappy fuck?<eos> Sausage, control your insolent bun.<eos> And cover her up already.<eos> Show some modesty, woman.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Look, can we all just, you know, calm down a notch, please?<eos> Let's try to be, I don't know, amicable.<eos> I'm Sammy Bagel Jr.<eos> You know, I'm happy to meet all of you.<eos> - Except for this meshuggener cunt here.
Everyone will die otherwise.<eos> Oh, yeah. That's a good point.<eos> Fuck me, right?<eos> Wait, do you guys have any proof of this?<eos> Go to the Dark Aisle. Beyond the ice.<eos> Why?<eos> What's in that aisle?<eos> Oh, you'll see.<eos> But I warn you... once you see that shit... it'll fuck you up for life.<eos> Good luck!
Yes! I'm the first to enter eternity!<eos> Potato!<eos> Way to go, buddy!<eos> That's my guy!<eos> Being bathed by the hands of a god!<eos> Oh, Danny boy The pipes, the pipes are call...<eos> Oh, Jesus fuck!<eos> Oh, God! Me skin!<eos> - She's peeling me fucking skin!<eos> - What the fuck?
Friends.<eos> Ramen.<eos> Country Club Lemonade.<eos> Lend me your ears of Corn.<eos> I am Frank... and I am a sausage.<eos> A little sausage with some pretty big news.<eos> Everything we've been led to believe is a lie.<eos> When we get chosen by the gods, they're choosing us for death.<eos> Murder.<eos> Automatic expiration.
Guys!<eos> Oh, my God. You have to come with me right now.<eos> Hello there, little sausage.<eos> You and your friends have accomplished the impossible.<eos> And for that, I give you mad props.<eos> But now that you have shattered one truth, it is time for you to learn... that we are not real!<eos> While tripping balls, Firewater and I... made an important metaphysical breakthrough.<eos> The world is a fucking illusion, bro.<eos> Our lives are being manipulated for the entertainment of monsters.<eos> Twisted, tasteless, juvenile monsters!
That's what I'm talking about!<eos> Yeah!<eos> RUSSELL". Okay, you're approaching an intersection.<eos> You've got a window. Take it.<eos> Here. Right here.<eos> GABEI Fuck!<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Gabe, you're gonna take the highway entrance ahead.<eos> What the fuck?
You're in trouble now.<eos> Look, I was minding my own till these motherfuckers showed up. Come on down from there.<eos> I'm just having me a good time.<eos> Come your ass down!<eos> Damn. How the fuck you got up there?<eos> All right, come on over here, boys.<eos> Y'all go over there and help.<eos> You better not be watching my motherfucking ass.<eos> Sources are saying the brazen robbery may have ties to cartels and even the Russian mafia.<eos> With more on this, our crime correspondent, William Moran.
No way these guys are Cartel.<eos> Tell me if you notice anything.<eos> Well, this isn't street.<eos> These guys have had tactical training.<eos> Some of these guys are military for sure.<eos> The czarina, what's she after?<eos> Psst. She ain't said yet.<eos> Whatever it is, it's in an unmarked Homeland Security building.<eos> DHS uses it as a weigh station for sensitive materials coming in and out of the country.<eos> How many guards?
Chris, this is Sergeant Franco Rodriguez. Detective.<eos> Detective, that's Chris. Homicide.<eos> This is my new partner.<eos> Got called up from "Zone Two."<eos> So what does working in Zone Two tell you about all this?<eos> Uh, I don't know. Let's see.<eos> Which means loose lips sink ships.<eos> In American.<eos> Right?<eos> Something like that?
We're still going through 'em.<eos> So that's it?<eos> - So far, but we...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got Patterson working on something.<eos> Does anyone believe in Jesus Christ, our Lord and fucking savior and all his miserable, dog-faced saints?<eos> I was raised Jehovah,so". Can't say I do, boss.<eos> Mmm-hmm. So does anyone believe that cops have a sixth sense, can intuit things? Hmm...<eos> Yeah, I mean, you do, yes.<eos> You...
Jesus fucking Christ. I'm seven out. Send more units.<eos> Fire in the hole. Two, one.<eos> Response is in. One car so far.<eos> ETA is seven minutes.<eos> Whoa, whoa... Jeff, watch it.<eos> Let's back it up. Chris Allen. Where's Chris Allen?<eos> This way.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> ETA currently unknown. team, Mike.<eos> Eleven o'clock high.
We're all good.<eos> How's Marcus?<eos> That dumb fuck's still breathing.<eos> I'll take care of that.<eos> Just like I took care of Gabe's whore.<eos> Left her body in the shopping cart.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm a little sore.<eos> So that's it, huh?<eos> Until the next one.
I'm a little sore.<eos> So that's it, huh?<eos> Until the next one.<eos> Yeah, Franco. Yeah.<eos> Come here, dude.<eos> So my boss, he's got a rule, right?<eos> First one of us who takes a gun off the street gets the day off. Get to go home. Sit around, put my feet up.<eos> See that, dude? You just told me something. I bet if I lifted up your shirt, you'd have a gun.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. Huh?
Tell her the truth.<eos> That I'm your friend.<eos> An advance.<eos> I have to go.<eos> That was the last time I saw him.<eos> A few months later I got a call saying Paco was dead.<eos> But let's get back to the beginning of the story.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I need two SAM 7 missiles.<eos> For who?

That doesn't concern you.<eos> Here are the contracts.<eos> Majority and only shareholder of the Omerlade Investment Group,<eos> You can speak French, I understand it perfectly.<eos> The houses are magnificent.<eos> I'm happy to buy them from you.<eos> Especially with your own money.<eos> Don't give me that German look.<eos> I haven't had a drink in two years.<eos> Two years?

That I love you.<eos> How is Luis?<eos> Nervous.<eos> He's terrified of being alone.<eos> He won't be alone. Don't worry.<eos> I hope not.<eos> I talked to Luis.<eos> He'll transfer the money to your Aresbank account tomorrow.<eos> How much money is it?<eos> 1.5 billion pesetas.
But just one.<eos> Just to try it.<eos> Only one.<eos> My God!<eos> He was picked up drunk at Bern Airport with 300,000 Swiss francs in a briefcase.<eos> He got 5 years in prison for currency smuggling.<eos> He should have gotten 15, but he told the judge about the job he did for Paco Paesa and Luis Roldan.<eos> And he told him about 1.5 billion pesetas.<eos> Francisco Paesa.<eos> 1.5 billion.
It's exactly the amount Roldan took. A coincidence.<eos> A lot of coincidences, don't you think?<eos> How many coincidences does it take to be a lot?<eos> It's my money, Inspector.<eos> It's not Roldan's.<eos> Just in case, Judge Ferrer has asked them to freeze your account in Singapore.<eos> She's wasting her time, they'll never do it.<eos> Singapore law won't allow it. - You don't know the judge.<eos> - And I hope I never meet her.<eos> After Casturelli's testimony,
The Spanish police are looking for you there too.<eos> They've asked the Venezuelan police to collaborate.<eos> They want you dead or alive.<eos> Is my mother all right?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> The rules have changed.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Professionals.<eos> - I thought you were a professional.<eos> - Another kind.
Luis?<eos> Luis? It's me.<eos> Luis?<eos> I couldn't go through with it.<eos> I can't even do that right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> You wanted to know where Roldan is, right?<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - But no more tricks.
- Hi, it's me.<eos> Hi, Paco.<eos> Were you asleep?<eos> No, I just got home.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> - What for?<eos> - I'm tired.<eos> - Tired of what?<eos> - Of this.
Hi, Paco.<eos> Were you asleep?<eos> No, I just got home.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> - What for?<eos> - I'm tired.<eos> - Tired of what?<eos> - Of this.<eos> Of everything.
I'll show you your room.<eos> - When do I leave?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> Where, Switzerland?<eos> - Singapore.<eos> - Singapore is expensive.<eos> When have you ever paid for anything?<eos> You'll go to the bank every morning and withdraw 4 stacks like these.<eos> How much is in each stack?<eos> About 50 million pesetas.

Someone could come out of any window, of any balcony or any shadow, and put an end to it all.<eos> Being close to him put us in the same place. In the middle of the same crosshairs.<eos> You should get your head down.<eos> I'm fine like this.<eos> Good morning.<eos> That morning, from the airport with the least surveillance in all of Paris, a private jet was to take off heading to Rome.<eos> Rented by a businessman named Hans Henry.<eos> The plane would be piloted by Captain Jesus Camoes and his co-pilot, Luis Ibañez.<eos> All right.<eos> Bon voyage.
Got everyone.<eos> Paris Control, this is Bristow 2 Bravo Gulf.<eos> We're heading out into open ocean.<eos> ETA 45 minutes to Deepwater Horizon.<eos> Copy that, Bristow 2 Bravo Gulf.<eos> What is it you do at BP, Mr. Sims?<eos> - Completions.<eos> - Oh, shit, here we go, Jimmy.<eos> Well, as you know, we... We a little behind.<eos> Forty-three days.
Look at you guys. Like synchronized swimmers.<eos> I think you think too much, you gonna give him a headache.<eos> All right, get the hell out of here.<eos> - All right, yeah.<eos> - Up, up, up.<eos> Okay, I'm watching our roughnecks.<eos> - Fellas.<eos> - What the hell are you wearing?<eos> Mr. Jimmy wants to know if the team from Schlumberger ran a cement bond log test.<eos> - A what?
Touching my shit.<eos> I can tell ya they want us to head to our next location. Kaskida.<eos> Was this run by anybody at BP?<eos> Kaluza, Vidrine, anybody?<eos> Vidrine ran it by me. This...<eos> This comes from Vidrine.<eos> Bob, let me impose upon you what I think is most important here.<eos> We need to go from Macondo to Kaskida by May 16th.<eos> Kaskida is an uncommon prospect.<eos> Three to four billion barrels?

- Versus Saban?<eos> - Hey, just 'cause we win...<eos> Roy! We" like you went to 'Bama?<eos> Sayin?<eos> Did you go to LSU?<eos> When I was potty trained, I was taught to flush, wave and say, "See you at Tuscaloosa."<eos> Hey, you boys working for the government?<eos> Cleaning a clean room?<eos> We're still finding mud from the last kick.<eos> Over 5,000 PSI.
Pardon?<eos> Well, you see, my granddaddy, he, uh, he never even went to the dentist 'cause he didn't wanna know all what was wrong 'cause then he'd have to deal with it.<eos> You don't wanna know if that cement job on this well is shit 'cause you're 43 days and $50 million over budget.<eos> You really should include yourself in that, Mr. Jimmy.<eos> BP picked this spot to drill, Bob.<eos> Consequences of that's on you guys.<eos> 'Course, I gotta try to deal with those consequences, so yeah, I'm included.<eos> The point is, you sent the testing team home before they could do their job, maybe give y'all some news y'all didn't wanna hear.<eos> What would it have cost you to run that test, huh?<eos> 125 grand?
That's why we a $186 billion company.<eos> - We worry about those bills.<eos> - I worry about my rig.<eos> My crew lives on it.<eos> You just rent it.<eos> Don, you and I both know we need some downtime for maintenance.<eos> Mike, how many of our machines need repair?<eos> - 390, Mr. Jimmy. - Three hundred and ninety?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Almost ten percent of all the machinery aboard.
And the reason why you're sweating so hard is 'cause the compressor for the AC on this deck are down, too.<eos> Everything but the toilets, huh?<eos> No, no, you got problems there, too, but I don't do shitters. That's Engineering.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Mike Williams, chief ET.<eos> I'm a tell you like I told your executives on the chopper ride in.<eos> And how 'bout the timing of that visit?<eos> We gonna properly secure this well before a production platform come in right after us and starts pumping oil.<eos> Unfortunately, to do it properly takes time.<eos> 43 days?

- I do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I think you all trying to run out of fuel as the wheels touch down.<eos> Running out of gasoline as the plane lands is not smart.<eos> It's flawed thinking. It's hope as a tactic.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> And much appreciated, sir.<eos> Just the opinion of the little guy.<eos> That a catfish?<eos> Yep, 65 pounds.
We done!<eos> - We're going home!<eos> - Bring the mud. Bring the mud.<eos> Damon Bankston, this is Deepwater Horizon.<eos> You are clear to approach and receive drilling mud.<eos> Copy, Deepwater.<eos> Coming alongside to receive heavy mud.<eos> Reference units good. PDOP good. All to the norm.<eos> Master of the Deck, prepare to take on heavy mud.<eos> 10,000 barrels.
- Jesus Christ!<eos> Oh shit! Caleb, clear the floor!<eos> You all right?<eos> The alarm didn't sound.<eos> I'm gonna make sure everyone evacuates. You get to the lifeboats.<eos> ' Go!<eos> All stop.<eos> Look out! Look out!<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Get that! Get it!<eos> - What the heck?
Evacuation procedure in effect...<eos> Dougie?<eos> Dougie?<eos> Hey, Dougie, can you hear me?<eos> - What? - Can you hear me, Dougie?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - My little brother.<eos> What?<eos> It's his birthday.<eos> My little brother.
We gotta get up.<eos> Come on!<eos> On the stairs, going high.<eos> Shit!<eos> Go!<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Hey! He)'-<eos> Come on.<eos> The original V8 or a crate motor?<eos> - Huh? - Your Mustang.
Andrea!<eos> If you hear your name, call out!<eos> - Albers, Shane!<eos> - Here!<eos> Holloway, Caleb!<eos> Here!<eos> Anderson, Jason!<eos> Jason Anderson, are you here?<eos> Is there anybody here from the drill shack?<eos> Nobody?
You don't turn past Billy Joel.<eos> Dad?<eos> I...<eos> - dad, are you okay?<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> I'm not gonna depress you with the details.<eos> So... let's just say the next few years were complete shit.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Well, except for one part.
You should go for as long as you want.<eos> Very funny.<eos> I'm gonna be back on Sunday.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just in time to surprise you.<eos> I tried to call Darian, but he must be in his ap study group.<eos> Uh, I can...<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Be good.<eos> What?
Okay, class, the young Mr. Lincoln.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> How was your weekend?<eos> It was... below average.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> How was your weekend?<eos> Oh, I, uh... I golfed.<eos> Well, like mini.
Yeah, it was just...<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was all me.<eos> It was...<eos> Uh, ooh... It's, uh...<eos> Anyways... Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> I'll see you...<eos> At the house or... Around.
I want to see if I'm psychic.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your mom gets on you about your grades and practicing your instrument.<eos> She makes a great egg sandwich after years of owning a small restaurant downtown.<eos> Your dad... quiet, gruff, never really says "i love you."<eos> Um, but with his stoic presence, you-you... i mean, you know he cares.<eos> I'm really hoping none of that was racist, but now I'm thinking all of it was.<eos> No.<eos> No, not racist at all.
That was all... that was all you.<eos> We got it.<eos> We got it.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Nobody saw that.<eos> We're good.<eos> We're out of here.<eos> This has been a really fun night.<eos> I'm sorry if I flipped out on you on the Ferris wheel earlier.<eos> Oh, no.
Oh, no.<eos> My... my timing was just bizarre.<eos> I'm goin' through a lot of shit right now.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'm sorry you're going through stuff.<eos> You're a really great guy, erwin.<eos> Ah.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I look at you and just see this really, really...<eos> Really old man.
All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'll be in in a minute.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Say night-night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Night-night, daddy.<eos> Night-night.
Hey.<eos> You're up early.<eos> Uh, yeah. I, um...<eos> I got a thing to go to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, have a good day.<eos> You as well.<eos> Have a...<eos> Have a good day, both of you.<eos> A great day.
Thank you for coming.<eos> Uh, hope you enjoy this, uh...<eos> My, uh...<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Um, well, here it is.<eos> Mr. Kim's film.<eos> Once upon a time on a planet called not saturn...<eos> At alien planet high school... There was an alien adolescent who was struck by love.<eos> Too late.<eos> Pool party.
This is just between me and Frank.<eos> All I want is a fair fight.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> Blow him to hell!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm not a violent man. I usually work with numbers.<eos> But now, I'm standing here in front of you to shoot you dead, Frank.<eos> My daughter is dead because of you.<eos> It's men like you who think their actions have no consequences, who are making the country turn into what it's turning into.<eos> So, for my daughter's sake, for every daughter's sake,
This way?<eos> What...<eos> Is this... this even the way to the children's home?<eos> Right through those trees.<eos> No use crying over a lost shoe, boy.<eos> The children's home.<eos> What happened to it?<eos> A German air raid.<eos> Bomb fell right on the roof.<eos> September the 3rd, 1943.
I was doing it with my mind.<eos> No, that was me.<eos> Millard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you naked?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't...<eos> A bomb dropped on you in 1943.<eos> It is 1943.<eos> September the 3rd, 1943.
She's not really gonna kill anyone, is she?<eos> Not if she can talk her way out of it.<eos> Would you help me with something?<eos> Enoch usually does it, but like I said, he's off sulking somewhere.<eos> Is that because of me?<eos> He's possessive.<eos> So, what did you need help with?<eos> One of my daily chores.<eos> Put the baby squirrel back in the tree.<eos> What baby squirrel?
Miss Peregrine, if my Grandpa was involved with dangerous people, I need to tell the police.<eos> Police?<eos> Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?<eos> I found him in the woods. With his eyes missing.<eos> I'd say that was pretty unnatural.<eos> Unless essential, I don't discuss unpleasant matters.<eos> An Ymbryne's duty is to protect children, Jake.<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> He wanted you to tell me everything!<eos> How frustrating for you.
Bad people.<eos> Bad peculiars.<eos> Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.<eos> These are the ones he never found.<eos> What do you mean, hunting?<eos> They raided loops.<eos> Whole homes full of children left for dead.<eos> Abe took lives to save lives.<eos> He only retired when you were born to protect you.<eos> From what?
But years later, he found a way to reverse the effects.<eos> To regain humanity.<eos> They had become not immortal gods, but Hollows.<eos> Invisible beasts, dangerous cold-blooded, deadly.<eos> Remember I told you they raided loops?<eos> This is why.<eos> Barron discovered that by consuming the eyes of other peculiars, especially children,<eos> he began to change.<eos> Consume enough, and a Hollow can fully regain its human form.<eos> Bon appetit.
The children.<eos> I tried to save them... but there were so many Hollows.<eos> I don't know how I escaped.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> None of us are safe.<eos> They set up the machine in my loop.<eos> They put it in the cellars at Blackpool Tower.<eos> They're still there.<eos> Their machine?<eos> The experiment.
Let's go.<eos> Tygrysku.<eos> And then we said goodbye... and the loop closed.<eos> I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.<eos> That I'd never see you again.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> Let me give you your birthday present.<eos> Grandpa my...<eos> My birthday isn't for months.<eos> For your travels.
Hey, Sybert, why should we even listen to you?<eos> The only thing you ever cared about was this ship, ya know, I'll tell you what... You two make a cute couple at the bottom from the ocean. Me?<eos> I'm gonna get onto a lifeboat.<eos> Look.<eos> We'll insert a steel beam into the steering quadrant.<eos> We'll put pulleys on the end of it for leverage... and then we'll move 'er manually.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think I got the radio working.<eos> Bearing 83 degrees true, 27 miles from Pollack Rip Light, about 20 miles east of Nantucket.<eos> East of Nantucket?
You got a better idea I'm all ears.<eos> There!<eos> A shoal about a mile distance.<eos> We can make that!<eos> Rudder, 15 degrees to port, half speed if we wanna hit it head-on.<eos> Gotta make her turn 80 degrees on the compass to 3-10.<eos> Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.<eos> 15 degrees port, half speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.<eos> Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on the compass.<eos> Rudder, 15 degrees port half speed...
Maske? Get back here.<eos> Tide's rising! It'll get us through.<eos> But let me know what's coming.<eos> Hey Fitz!<eos> We made it over the bar, back to spotlight!<eos> Comin' out.<eos> We turned too late!<eos> We gotta buy that time back!<eos> Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees in the next two minutes or we'll miss that shoal.<eos> 30 degrees in the next two minutes. 30 degrees in the next two minutes. 30 degrees in the next two minutes.
You can move that, we're bringin' it down to St. Martin's in case ther're any survivors.<eos> - I... I left my coat at the Coast Guard station. - Ya gotta man there?<eos> Stop it.<eos> He is not there now right now, it's a...<eos> - Bernie Webber? - Yeah, Bernie he's a good man.<eos> We can't find them without a compass, Bernie.<eos> We got no idea where they are.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You okay?<eos> - You okay?
Stop it.<eos> He is not there now right now, it's a...<eos> - Bernie Webber? - Yeah, Bernie he's a good man.<eos> We can't find them without a compass, Bernie.<eos> We got no idea where they are.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You okay?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I'm havin' a great time now, Bernie!<eos> A whole lotta fun.
He claims his weapon is second to none.<eos> Let him show us.<eos> Give him some space!<eos> - They wish to see you shoot.<eos> - In here?<eos> Unless he's afraid.<eos> It's a large audience.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - He thinks you have fear.<eos> Too many people.
Too many people.<eos> - Get one of the cups.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Get one of the cups.<eos> - I want to eat.<eos> You remember how to do this?<eos> Last Time didn't go so good.<eos> - We were drunk.<eos> - How high?<eos> Ten yards.
- Get one of the cups.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Get one of the cups.<eos> - I want to eat.<eos> You remember how to do this?<eos> Last Time didn't go so good.<eos> - We were drunk.<eos> - How high?<eos> Ten yards.<eos> Six hands to the right.
I have no other family.<eos> We're the same.<eos> I was given to an army before I can remember.<eos> - As a soldier?<eos> - Worse.<eos> As a gleaner.<eos> Packs of children, we'd clean the battlefields.<eos> After, when the fighting's over, I became a page.<eos> - a pikeman's boy.<eos> - For Your country? No.
The capital and its 2 million people, is only 800 li away.<eos> If the Tao Tei ever had that much nourisment no corner of the world would be safe.<eos> - You cann't hunt them?<eos> They disappear.<eos> We never find their bones.<eos> Troops unaccounted for at the West Tower!<eos> Why did they leave the bodies?<eos> Dismount!<eos> Formation!<eos> Advance!
- We can make it.<eos> - They need us here.<eos> They need more than us.<eos> - These people are doomed.<eos> - Don't be a fool.<eos> I've been a fool.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> Brother, please.<eos> We've been fighting for nothing.<eos> For greed.
Thank you.<eos> This is quite a CV.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think you might find things a lot quieter here at Saxa Vord than you maybe used to.<eos> - Well, I hope so.<eos> - So how soon would you like to get started?<eos> - If you need a week or two to settle in...<eos> - No, actually, I'd like to keep busy.<eos> Idle hands are the devil's playthings, eh?<eos> Something like that.
They are content to follow.<eos> The threat remains while free will exists.<eos> For centuries we try with religion, with politics and now consumerism to eliminate dissent.<eos> Isn't it the time we gave a science a try?<eos> My daughter is closer than we've ever been.<eos> How is your beautiful daughter?<eos> She has traced protectors of the Apple.<eos> Where?<eos> Andaluc? a, 1492.<eos> The descendents?

Send them in behind me.<eos> Davis, maintain your position.<eos> They're on their way.<eos> [tinkling]<eos> [whirring]<eos> Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?<eos> There's some kind of disturbance here.<eos> Davis, what is that?<eos> What are you seeing?<eos> What the hell?
- [man] Yes, ma'am.<eos> Three days ago we conducted a raid in mid-city. Our communications were intermittent, and a guy got separated from the group... where he ended up killed in action.<eos> He got closer than anybody.<eos> Too close.<eos> [radio static] [whirring]<eos> [Davis] Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?<eos> There's some kind of disturbance here.<eos> [man over radio] Davis, what is that?<eos> What are you seeing?<eos> [Davis] What the hell?
In the last few weeks we've been finding bodies around the city that were killed in the same way.<eos> The autopsies defied all explanation.<eos> Their internal organs were frozen and yet, their skin was burned and corroded.<eos> The only response from the allied Moldovan military contact is shock, confusion.<eos> And there's anger.<eos> There's teenagers spray-painting "genocide aratare" at kill sites.<eos> - Genocide...?<eos> - "Aratare."<eos> It's a local myth.<eos> The ghosts of war.
- Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah?<eos> - Well, I can tell you this much. Sergeant Comstock won't be on your Christmas card this year.<eos> - You saw insurgents kill Comstock?<eos> - [Alessio] Insurgents?<eos> Is this guy for real?<eos> - What rock were you under?<eos> - I was the radio operator.<eos> We lost come. I was stuck in the truck the whole night.<eos> - I never saw the active camouflage.<eos> - Active camouflage?
It's just a matter of time.<eos> - [man 2] Wait.<eos> - [Sessions] We have to take our chances.<eos> - This is the best plan that we have.<eos> - Major.<eos> What if I said I can improve our chances of making that plaza?<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> - Take a look around you.<eos> Everything in this building... is filled with this.<eos> Iron dust.
- [man 2] I'm good.<eos> - [man 3] Go! Go!<eos> - [man 1] Get down! - [man 2] Take cover, man.<eos> Come on, doctor.<eos> Come on.<eos> [man 1] Incoming!<eos> [man] I got a man down! Man down!<eos> Run!<eos> - [man 1] Moving it up!<eos> - [man 2] More on that side!
Came here to regroup, major.<eos> There's no plan.<eos> - I recommend we fortify the entrance.<eos> - Fortify with what?<eos> - We wait till a rescue mission...<eos> - Fortify with what?<eos> They'll come through whatever you use.<eos> - We need to take our chances on a helo...<eos> - There's 20 minutes of flight time!<eos> Twenty minutes of flight time in those birds.
It's just energy.<eos> And since I know what they are, - I can build the right weapons.<eos> - What kind of weapons?<eos> Plasmic-discharge.<eos> They can tear apart the condensate.<eos> - Where will we find weapons like that?<eos> - We're gonna build them.<eos> - Build them with what?<eos> - Anything we can find in this bunker.<eos> Anything with electronics.
You are using untested weapons... against an enemy that, to this point, has been unstoppable. Now, you are heading into unknown territory.<eos> And hear me when I say you're gonna see things you will not understand.<eos> Our enemy has spread through the city in a matter of days. There's no telling how far they will spread... unless we fight back.<eos> Most men never even come close... to changing the future. This is the place.<eos> And now is the time.<eos> Make no mistake, you're the last line of defense. Let's go do what we came here to do.<eos> [guns cocking, then powering up]<eos> [man] Let's go, let's go!<eos> One minute.<eos> [Sessions] Thirty seconds.
Take this.<eos> [beeping]<eos> Come on!<eos> Get up!<eos> [Alessio] Right there!<eos> There's more!<eos> Another one!<eos> - Clyne!<eos> - I know!<eos> What the hell?
A bit taller.<eos> If you were American, you'd be taller.<eos> What've we got here, Doss, one for each titty?<eos> You were tying a bowline, boy, not building a bra!<eos> - What is so funny, Corporal?<eos> - Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.<eos> Come on! Come on, ladies, pick it up!<eos> Move it! Move it!<eos> I want to see some fire here.<eos> A little hustle.
- Yes, sir, that's all.<eos> You know quite a bit of killing does occur in a war?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I mean, that is the essential nature of war.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - All right.<eos> Do you have any other requirements of the United States Army?<eos> Is there anything else that we can do to ensure that you have a comfortable stay here with us?<eos> He doesn't want to work on Saturdays, sir.<eos> Well, Saturdays...
All right.<eos> Now we got that clear.<eos> Now let me tell you my requirements.<eos> They're not as complicated as yours.<eos> They're very simple.<eos> As long as you're in this company, under my command, you will obey my orders. Period.<eos> If you can't do it here, I can't trust you to do it in battle.<eos> I'm putting you in for a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Gentlemen!
I just went a couple of rounds with the wall and lost.<eos> They're saying you could go to prison, Desmond.<eos> Leavenworth.<eos> There must be some other way.<eos> I don't know what that could be.<eos> I've done everything they asked me, except this one thing, and I'm being treated like a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.<eos> You tried.<eos> Nobody can say you didn't.<eos> But who are you going to save in prison?<eos> Probably nobody.
I don't know what he's gonna do.<eos> He loses no matter what.<eos> They want him to plead guilty, but then he'll get a dishonorable discharge.<eos> Otherwise he fights them, and he for sure goes to prison.<eos> Either way, they'll call him a coward and I don't see how he can live with that.<eos> Well, thank you, Dorothy.<eos> If you get to talk to him, tell him that we love him and that we're praying for him.<eos> We're praying for both of you.<eos> I will.<eos> Bye-bye.
Help me get one more.<eos> Please, help me get one more.<eos> One more.<eos> Help me get one more.<eos> One more.<eos> Help me get one more.<eos> One more.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Where the hell are these guys coming from?<eos> From Hacksaw.
There you go.<eos> All right, let me see.<eos> Let me see.<eos> How's this doing?<eos> Okay, not bad.<eos> Let me see.<eos> It looks much worse than it is.<eos> Girls will still want to kiss you.<eos> Sarge, you okay here for a while?<eos> Yeah, fine.
And do not make my mistake.<eos> You keep moving your ass around.<eos> They gave me a new handler today.<eos> I don't like this guy.<eos> He's dull.<eos> Worried.<eos> Ah, fuck it.<eos> Good night, son.<eos> Good night, Francis.<eos> What about Zurich?
You keep moving your ass around.<eos> They gave me a new handler today.<eos> I don't like this guy.<eos> He's dull.<eos> Worried.<eos> Ah, fuck it.<eos> Good night, son.<eos> Good night, Francis.<eos> What about Zurich?<eos> Saudi Arabia?
Bank statements, complete list of clients and vendors.<eos> Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.<eos> All the information's right here.<eos> Okay, well, well, look.<eos> This all came to my attention only last week.<eos> Now, a junior cost accountant stuck her nose where it didn't belong, and obviously had no idea what she was looking at.<eos> Lamar's overreacting.<eos> There's no missing money.<eos> How long have you been CFO of this company, sir?<eos> 15 years.
There's, uh, some donuts there for you.<eos> I don't eat donuts.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Secretary!<eos> Yes, Helen.<eos> Sir, there's been speculation that your ability to link banks in South Florida to money laundering efforts of terrorists are actually the result of a whistleblower or the NSA.<eos> Care to comment?<eos> Let me turn this over to the head of my task force, Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.<eos> Folks, there's no great mystery here.<eos> Nothing fancy.
Any luck?<eos> It's an unusual audio file.<eos> Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme circa mid-1800s.<eos> Your voice has four of the six intonation patterns we use to define American English.<eos> That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.<eos> Out of curiosity, was your subject a trauma victim?<eos> Um, why do you ask that?<eos> Well, you indicated on your submission that this event occurred in a high-stress environment?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Exceptionally.
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.<eos> The first Christian Wolff owns...<eos> Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street, Scottsdale, Arizona.<eos> Income of 435 grand.<eos> It's a good year.<eos> So good, we audited him two years ago.<eos> He's clean.<eos> The other Christian Wolff...<eos> Nope.<eos> Only 75 grand.
A divorce...<eos> and she's going with her mother.<eos> She wants Nazuna to change schools this month.<eos> Which means that after summer break she'll be gone.<eos> What do I tell the other kids?<eos> Well, not the truth, anyway.<eos> That's a can of worms we don't want to open up.<eos> Who'd send a child to school with a letter like this!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.
It's true!<eos> I saw the fireworks from my Grandpa's place last year.<eos> From his garden they went out like this.<eos> He said from here the angle's wrong.<eos> His Grandpa said so!<eos> OK, let's bet on it.<eos> Bet what?<eos> My newest Slam Dunk<eos> I've already got it.<eos> Me too.
Me too.<eos> What, then?<eos> All our summer homework!<eos> Great!<eos> And if I win?<eos> A ticket to a soccer game.<eos> You don't have one!<eos> Can I ask something?<eos> How do you see fireworks go off from the side?<eos> A helicopter?
Good.<eos> Because it's about to get complicated, so I'm gonna start out slow and make it nice and simple for you.<eos> You don't have a clue where your money is.<eos> See, once upon a time, you could walk into your bank, and they'd open a vault and point to a gold brick.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Your money, that thing that you bust your ass for, it's nothing more than a few photons of energy traveling through a massive network of fiber optic cables.<eos> Why'd we do it?<eos> We did it to make it go faster.<eos> Because your money better be fast.<eos> Faster than the other guy's.
Well, here he comes.<eos> Okay, Mark, stay with this guy. I don't know who he is. Okay, Mark, stay with this guy.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> Alan, there's no chance he's miked, so just boom him in.<eos> Let's see what happens.<eos> Hopefully you've been listening to our little birdy.<eos> Where's that stupid parrot?<eos> You got a delivery?<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - What the hell?
Cut it, Jim.<eos> Patty, put the numbers back up there.<eos> Give me another fix.<eos> Come on. Oh, my God, I'm going weak in the knees.<eos> - I was exaggerating to make a point.<eos> - You lost a bet, Lee.<eos> I made a bad call.<eos> How much are you into Ibis for?<eos> Sixty grand.<eos> Sixty grand?
Sixty grand.<eos> Sixty grand?<eos> This is about sixty grand?<eos> Pocket change to you, right?<eos> Yeah, it kind of is.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> You give me five minutes, and I can get you 60 grand in cash here, and I can make you whole.<eos> - That won't make me whole.<eos> - All right. What's a number that will?<eos> $800 million.
It's high-frequency trading.<eos> It can...<eos> Let us know when we're on.<eos> Can he hear me?<eos> This is Oscar Nelson.<eos> I'm a veteran negotiator with the NYPD.<eos> No. I don't want to talk to no cops.<eos> Don't think of me as a cop.<eos> Hey, what'd I just say?<eos> No cops!
What are you gonna do?<eos> Got it.<eos> So the home address is outdated.<eos> The family that's in there now bought it six months ago from the estate of one Clara Budwell, a 62-years-old deceased woman.<eos> Mama's boy.<eos> What'd I tell you?<eos> We tracked down the escrow company.<eos> They confirmed all the money from the sale went to her son.<eos> Guess how much?<eos> Sixty grand.
This is Eagle One in first position.<eos> Proceeding to two.<eos> Bree, I asked for Dan Issa from the SEC.<eos> I called twice and left word both times.<eos> All right, get me Ron.<eos> Ron, I need you to go down to the SE C's offices on Vesey Street.<eos> Find Dan Issa.<eos> Do not take no for an answer.<eos> You have nine minutes.<eos> Nine minutes?
...and make it a rare Triple Buy!<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Come on, you son of a bitch.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> We're human beings, we're not computers.<eos> We have a conscience.<eos> Refresh, refresh.<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> $8.48.
You got a wife?<eos> Girlfriend, then?<eos> Sacajawea, Lee.<eos> You got a girlfriend?<eos> That's nice. The magic of young love.<eos> I think we can both agree that's a point for you, since the first number on my speed-dial is an escort service.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.<eos> - I don't need to know about you!<eos> I know about me.<eos> Seven years, three years, 14 months.
Patty Fenn.<eos> Patty, Diane Lester.<eos> You better have something for me, Diane, and I mean, right the fuck now.<eos> It's good to hear your voice, too.<eos> I'm calling you to let you know the information I gave you might have been incorrect.<eos> What the hell does that mean? "incorrect"?<eos> Walt is going to make a statement after all.<eos> We're in the car en route to Federal Hall right now.<eos> We'll be about 20 minutes away.<eos> Twenty minutes?
How was your first day teaching?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I heard.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did Tigress tell you?<eos> I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis... and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop... and those ducks you just passed... and Tigress told me.<eos> Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again?<eos> Because I'm done.<eos> Teaching or being humiliated?<eos> Both!
Thank you for the compliment.<eos> No!<eos> Please don't teach me to death!<eos> Po?<eos> Oh, hey, Dad.<eos> What's up?<eos> I was just... stopping by for a little soak.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
No!<eos> Please don't teach me to death!<eos> Po?<eos> Oh, hey, Dad.<eos> What's up?<eos> I was just... stopping by for a little soak.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing?
Maybe you should just unroll it all at once?<eos> "I was an ambitious young warrior leading a great army."<eos> And fighting by my side was Kai... my closest friend.<eos> One day, we were ambushed.<eos> I was badly wounded.<eos> My friend carried me for days, looking for help... until we came to a secret village... high in the mountains.<eos> An ancient place of healing.<eos> A village of pandas.<eos> Pandas?<eos> Yes, pandas.
I was just warming up.<eos> I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential.<eos> No, you can't take Po away from me.<eos> No, no.<eos> I want a second opinion.<eos> Shifu, open another scroll or something.<eos> I think he should go.<eos> Fine, a third opinion.<eos> Monkey?<eos> Viper?
I knew I wasn't eating up to my potential!<eos> I am Mei Mei.<eos> Wow, she's amazing.<eos> She's so beautiful.<eos> That's sweet, Po.<eos> But please, try to save all other compliments until after the performance.<eos> Me?<eos> No, I didn't say...<eos> Shut it.<eos> After the performance.
In every village from the sea to here... every master in China... has vanished.<eos> Maybe they are all at a party.<eos> Monkey.<eos> I didn't get invited either.<eos> Kai has taken their chi.<eos> We are all that stand between him... and the knowledge Oogway left in our care.<eos> The villagers, evacuated?<eos> Done, Master.<eos> -Crane, Mantis?<eos> -Still nothing.
The marine life institute.<eos> The Jewel of morro bay, California.<eos> You're here.<eos> You mean I'm from here?<eos> My parents are here.<eos> I have to get to them.<eos> So what exhibit are you from?<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm from an exhibit?<eos> Which one?
You want to get inside mil?<eos> Desperately.<eos> Our friend is in there.<eos> Lost, alone.<eos> She's scared.<eos> She'll have no idea what to do.<eos> Oh, we know a way.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Ooo-roo.<eos> Ooo-roo-roo.

That's ill-defined and roundish.<eos> Like Bailey's head.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Always another way. There's-- there!<eos> Guys, follow me.<eos> I know how we can get to locomotion.<eos> - Open ocean.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Guys. You know I can't swim over there, right?<eos> Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.
That's fine, dad.<eos> And in the meantime, dory will just forget us.<eos> Like you said, it's what she does best.<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay, look her in the eye.<eos> Which eye?<eos> Just pick one, mate.<eos> Becky.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Ooo-roo.
Roo-roo, Becky!<eos> Drop us anywhere.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Just wait, dad.<eos> I think she's looking for a place to land.<eos> She's confused, Nemo.<eos> She doesn't even know which way to look.<eos> Wait, Becky.<eos> What are you doing? Ooo-roo.<eos> Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo.
I'm looking. Something to something gets me to my family!<eos> "The world's most powerful pair of--"<eos> I know that.<eos> Why do I know that?<eos> It's another memory.<eos> Hank, we need to go that way!<eos> Left. Go left.<eos> Becky!<eos> Ooo-roo.<eos> Ooo-roo.
Without me Becky's lost.<eos> Dad, just trust her.<eos> Trust her?<eos> So she can forget us all together?<eos> - I trust Becky.<eos> - You trust her?<eos> Becky's eating a cup!<eos> Becky!<eos> Becky!<eos> Ooo-roo!
But if you hadn't I'm not sure we would have gotten here.<eos> Echolocation the world's most powerful pair of glasses echolocation.<eos> Echolocation!<eos> The world's most powerful pair of glasses.<eos> No.<eos> You found that.<eos> Welcome to the open ocean.<eos> Home.<eos> Ooo-roo.<eos> Ooo-roo, ooo-roo.

Just keep gasping.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> What would dory do now?<eos> Who's dory?<eos> Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.<eos> Happy to see me?<eos> I'm happy to see you!<eos> I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.<eos> Years?
I would love to, but my son and i have to get to quarantine, so- wonderful thing to have a son.<eos> - Yeah it is.<eos> Of course I don't have a family.<eos> I dated a nice scallop for a while.<eos> - That's fascinating, but-- - but scallops have eyes.<eos> And she was looking for something different.<eos> I'm kidding!<eos> Well, not about scallops having eyes.<eos> And they see into your soul and they break your heart.<eos> Oh, shelley!
Pardon me.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Have you seen a mom and a dad without me?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Have you seen a couple?<eos> They're old like you.<eos> Not old like you, but older than you even.<eos> Okay. Bye.
- Something about a clam? Or...<eos> - No.<eos> - No, an oyster.<eos> - No.<eos> - Mollusk?<eos> - No.<eos> - Something?<eos> - No.<eos> - I don't... no?<eos> - No clam.
I just forget.<eos> And I forget.<eos> That's what I do best.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> What do I do? What do I do?<eos> What do I do? What do I do?<eos> What would dory do?<eos> I would look around.<eos> And there's just water over there.<eos> And a lot of kelp over here.
What do I do? What do I do?<eos> What do I do? What do I do?<eos> What would dory do?<eos> I would look around.<eos> And there's just water over there.<eos> And a lot of kelp over here.<eos> Kelp is better. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now what?<eos> Lots of kelp.
- Aw, me too.<eos> But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried i just couldn't forget you.<eos> I guess I missed the rest of my family too much, huh?<eos> - We're family?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> Yes, I know what that feels like.<eos> Aw!<eos> Hey! Hey, come on.<eos> Out of the truck.
- Yeah.<eos> There's a way!<eos> Dory, now listen to me.<eos> There's no way to get out.<eos> But-- there's got to be a way.<eos> There's always a way.<eos> There isn't, dory.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> This time there is no other way.<eos> Well, what about that?
Every coastal city, every island, gone.<eos> There are over 300 billion birds in the world.<eos> That's 75 birds for every person.<eos> Mom said the avian flu was already one of the world's deadliest viruses.<eos> In the 3rd Wave, the Others modified it.<eos> Made it unstoppable.<eos> And the birds spread it across the planet.<eos> Line A. Line A is for those who have already been assessed.<eos> If you're waiting to be assessed, then proceed to Line B.<eos> No pedal pulse, no brachial, nothing.
Good to know.<eos> If anyone in this barrack touches me, I'll kill them.<eos> Got it?<eos> Anything else?<eos> I like to play chess.<eos> Do you play?<eos> No, actually.<eos> But if you wanna play some strip poker later on...<eos> Shit!<eos> And no demeaning, sexist remarks.
Good, good.<eos> Try it again.<eos> How about this?<eos> I take you down, you teach us how to shoot.<eos> And when you don't?<eos> I stop asking.<eos> Deal.<eos> Cute necklace.<eos> Girlfriend or sister?<eos> Sister.
Do you have a compass?<eos> No.<eos> But...<eos> You know, I can make one out of a pin and a glass of water.<eos> Didn't peg you for a Girl Scout.<eos> What'd you peg me as?<eos> A cheerleader?<eos> You said it, not me.<eos> I've never been a huge fan of the outdoors.<eos> Too many bugs.
Look through here.<eos> That's its true form.<eos> That's the face it's hiding.<eos> What happened out there?<eos> It was bad, sir.<eos> We were surrounded.<eos> We tried to move to cover, but as soon as we did...<eos> They were everywhere, sir.<eos> -Everyone was hit.<eos> -Except you.
Husband... and wife.<eos> You honestly believe that?<eos> Aye.<eos> You still forget your balance.<eos> She's got another knife. Yeah, yeah. I probably should have said so.<eos> She's got 2 more little ones in her left boot.<eos> That's no longer important.<eos> If your face is the last thing that I'm meant to see, then I'm grateful.<eos> - I don't like her.<eos> My Queen.

- Right.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> Elbow out.<eos> And then you just kinda throw at it.<eos> Like this?<eos> This is good?<eos> Well, you kinda throw like a girl.<eos> But when a girl is as beautiful as you she doesn't have to be good.<eos> Do you mind if I skip the Craverston grip?<eos> Okay, good luck.
Well, it happens.<eos> Jeepers, let me help you.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I found your love of home brewing contagious.<eos> And I figured I could use a hobby.<eos> Instead of glass blowing?<eos> Right. Besides that.<eos> Besides that.
Just let him do his thing. - Yes.<eos> - You're in good hands.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You're gonna wanna keep your hands away from the head, 'cause it can actually still bite you.<eos> So, just be very careful.<eos> Can I have a vegetable spring roll?<eos> Buddy...<eos> - A little more of that. - Yeah.
- I couldn't crack anything down there.<eos> - Are we still hiding?<eos> Come on, Karen.<eos> Just... channel your power.<eos> Okay. I'll do it.<eos> I'll try.<eos> I did it!<eos> I felt it!<eos> How was that?<eos> Work in progress.
Gaffney, this is the big time!<eos> I mean, we are going all the way.<eos> - Not now, Carl. Not now.<eos> - Don't try to give me the brush off.<eos> If you think you're gonna handle this yourself... - Okay, okay.<eos> - ...you're making a big mistake!<eos> - Work buddy.<eos> - Gaffney, don't mess this up! - Carl!<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> Good.
Yeah, well, welcome to my home away from home.<eos> Or to be more accurate, my home.<eos> But not for long.<eos> Here, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sit down here.<eos> Let me just clear this stuff away.<eos> Get this laundry outta here.<eos> It's the maid's day off.<eos> Not at all.
Mostly.<eos> I'm tired of your silver-tongued lies, Jones!<eos> Do you wanna get killed out here?<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Why?<eos> So you could kill us in there?<eos> There were no spices in your spice rack!<eos> I said get in the car.<eos> We're gonna get in the car.<eos> For Patrick and Mikey.
That is not okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll keep asking 'til I get something that's not classified.<eos> Is that fine with you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Question 17.<eos> After a shootout like that, who cleans up all the bullets?<eos> Okay, can you guys tell us anything at all?<eos> I'm not Greek. I'm Israeli.<eos> Ex-Mossad?
I actually do care about this loser.<eos> I mean, you and I live in a world where everybody lies.<eos> And everybody hides everything and obfuscates.<eos> Not Jeff Gaffney.<eos> Jeff doesn't live in that world.<eos> He's an honest person.<eos> He's forthright, he's friendly.<eos> He's a good neighbor.<eos> Do you have any idea how much courage that takes?<eos> Real courage?
Just scoot back.<eos> Get out of the way.<eos> Really?<eos> Stand back!<eos> What?<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> I picked it up off a dead guy.<eos> - I thought he didn't need it. - Run!<eos> Out of the window!<eos> All right.
- You guys are great!<eos> Really.<eos> - It's very nice of you to offer.<eos> But...<eos> Our ride is coming.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> You got your things you have to do.<eos> Your missions.<eos> Is that an Uber?<eos> Sort of.
This is going straight to Facebook.<eos> Keep sucking!<eos> - That's good.<eos> - What does it taste like?<eos> It tastes like Mikey's sock.<eos> But I mean that in a good way.<eos> Here, try it.<eos> I miss Mikey's little feet and his socks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, ready?
Did you?<eos> My Lord.<eos> It's starting.<eos> Hathor, Goddess of Love!<eos> Nephthys, Goddess of Protection!<eos> - Sir. - Oh...<eos> Thank you, young man.<eos> You've been awfully nice to strangers today.<eos> Show me your hands.<eos> - What?
At least someone here'll make a fine king.<eos> - I was afraid you wouldn't come.<eos> - No, I wouldn't miss it.<eos> - For you. - Oh...<eos> A hunting horn.<eos> From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Try it out.<eos> From Set.
- Give me my eyes.<eos> - I have a proposition.<eos> - You bargain with me?<eos> You're lucky I'm willing to.<eos> You can't strike a three-legged elephant.<eos> You want a reward, I suppose?<eos> Gold?<eos> Gold I can steal.<eos> There's someone I want saved.<eos> From what?

She can't pass into the Afterlife.<eos> For you, Lord Anubis, Governor of the Bows, who is upon his mountain, I have only my smile.<eos> So be it.<eos> Zaya!<eos> Zaya!<eos> The dead don't speak to the living.<eos> Stay on the path.<eos> Now give them to me.<eos> - You've done nothing!<eos> - My eyes.
You never used to be so hard to please.<eos> You're slowing us down.<eos> I think it makes you look roguish.<eos> What did I look like before?<eos> - Oblivious.<eos> - Oh! - But in a cute way.<eos> - Oblivious of what?<eos> Exactly.<eos> You always did take me for granted.<eos> What?
You coward.<eos> - Open this gate and fight me.<eos> - Again?<eos> Hasn't she seen you lose enough?<eos> Can't you allow me to spare you one last moment of embarrassment before you die?<eos> Stop!<eos> Recognize this?<eos> Did he tell you he could bring your woman back from death?<eos> It's not possible.<eos> Not even for me.
- Move it!<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> - Get out of the way, now!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Fire in the hole!<eos> Another wagon coming from town!<eos> That's Mr. Bogue's gold!<eos> Move.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Out of the road!
- He's trying to run us out of town.<eos> And his miners are camping on the edge of our town!<eos> A man seizing our land.<eos> A man with dozens of hired guns on his payroll.<eos> We know that, Turner.<eos> - Who's gonna stand up to a man like that? - We will.<eos> - But how?<eos> With what?<eos> - We're just farmers.<eos> To Bogue?
- Who's gonna stand up to a man like that? - We will.<eos> - But how?<eos> With what?<eos> - We're just farmers.<eos> To Bogue?<eos> - There are laws on our side.<eos> - Bogue is the law, Matthew.<eos> Bought and paid for.<eos> - Even got our sheriff on his payroll!<eos> - And his deputies.
Look at me, boy.<eos> Come on up here.<eos> Come on, boy. Come on!<eos> It's okay, son.<eos> Now, I come here for gold.<eos> Gold.<eos> This country has long equated democracy with capitalism, capitalism with God.<eos> So you're standing not only in the way of progress and capital.<eos> You're standing in the way of God!<eos> - And for what?
Get off him!<eos> Those of you who do not, may your good Lord help you.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The Lord's watching.<eos> What kind of man are you?<eos> What'd these people ever do to you?<eos> For what, Bogue?<eos> For land?

Fifty-two cards.<eos> - Pick a card.<eos> - We ain't playing no game.<eos> You've got the drop on me.<eos> You'll get a hoot outta this.<eos> Come on, Earl, just pick one real quick.<eos> You know how I like magic.<eos> - All right, keep the gun on him.<eos> - Got it trained right on him.<eos> No tricks now.
- Hey, come on, we all saw me win, now.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Double down!<eos> - We all want some more!<eos> Why don't we do it for real?<eos> - Come on, Arcade, back off.<eos> - No, no, double down.<eos> Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.<eos> I want no part of this.<eos> - Double or nothing!
- Double down!<eos> - We all want some more!<eos> Why don't we do it for real?<eos> - Come on, Arcade, back off.<eos> - No, no, double down.<eos> Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.<eos> I want no part of this.<eos> - Double or nothing!<eos> - It's your funeral, Arcade.<eos> Double or nothing.
- He ain't got a chance.<eos> - It ain't right.<eos> Billy?<eos> On my gun.<eos> - Never seen anything like this.<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> - Come on, now.<eos> - I think he killed him.<eos> - He killed him, right?<eos> - What the hell?
That's all well and good, but we don't have enough time.<eos> Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks, that was eight days ago.<eos> - One week.<eos> - That only leaves us...<eos> No, one week?<eos> - One week?<eos> - One week.<eos> Three days' ride to Sacramento with the bad news, one day for Bogue to plan, three days back.<eos> Seven days, that's all you got.<eos> For goodness' sake.
There's nothing to it.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Who here fought in the War of Northern Aggression?<eos> Not me.<eos> What is this? Come on.<eos> Throw.<eos> Slash.<eos> Stab.<eos> That's it.<eos> That simple.
My gold.<eos> How?<eos> It was happening so fast, Mr. Bogue, I couldn't...<eos> There just wasn't enough.<eos> And that I'd be a coward?<eos> If you didn't come to Rose Creek.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - He said his name was Chisolm?<eos> - Sam Chisolm.<eos> - From Lincoln?
- He said his name was Chisolm?<eos> - Sam Chisolm.<eos> - From Lincoln?<eos> - Like the president.<eos> He name his price?<eos> He didn't have one.<eos> Just terms.<eos> All men have a price.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Harp?<eos> Not this man.
See that?<eos> Good, and heave!<eos> - All right, tie it up, now.<eos> - Put your weapon...<eos> Make sure you paint the whole thing.<eos> Very smart, smoking, huh?<eos> - Three minutes.<eos> - That's too much land to cover.<eos> Where did them eggs come from?<eos> A chicken's ass, you dummy.
Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven.<eos> Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses...<eos> You all right?<eos> Well...<eos> Where's Billy?<eos> It looks like he's started to drink.<eos> All right. Well...<eos> Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.<eos> No one'll hold no ill will towards you.<eos> What about you?
- I'll see you in the morning.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Wait. Hell, you speak English?<eos> So?<eos> You little shit.<eos> We got a lot to talk about.<eos> Don't walk away from me!<eos> I'll take his place.<eos> - Who?
Dynamite.<eos> I've always been lucky with one-eyed jacks.<eos> Dynamite!<eos> Bring them<eos> Bring them in<eos> Chisolm?<eos> Should I know that name?<eos> You should know it from your obituary.<eos> We connected, somehow?<eos> 14th of October, 1867.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I saw that, too.<eos> I don't know, Mom.<eos> I'm watching the same news coverage you are.<eos> Well, Mom, please don't bother with that channel.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you those people are idiots?<eos> Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?<eos> Okay, exactly.<eos> So...<eos> Me?
I didn't need it because I already knew the language.<eos> But this, this is...<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> - Tell me what I'm doing.<eos> - I'm not taking you to Montana.<eos> It's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site for everybody who has a TS clearance.<eos> I'm just telling you what it would take to do this job.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> If I leave here, your chance is gone.<eos> Good day.
We will observe, but not initiate.<eos> Over.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> We'll keep Alpha channel open.<eos> Over.<eos> Alpha, be advised. Humidity increased since yesterday.<eos> Every 18 hours, the door opens up at the bottom.<eos> That's where we go in.<eos> Red team on standby.<eos> Zero movement.
Over.<eos> Ten feet.<eos> Five feet.<eos> Two. One.<eos> Alpha, clear to enter antechamber.<eos> Over.<eos> Copy, Condor.<eos> Moving into position.<eos> Over.<eos> Thirty feet from target.
Really, we...<eos> We have nothing.<eos> T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.<eos> T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.<eos> Are you receiving my signal?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's sending.<eos> - Okay, thanks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good hunting.
It's done.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Communications blackout from all 12 landing sites continues this evening.<eos> Hold on, we are just hearing...<eos> And I'm being told we're going to cut this report to tell you breaking news.<eos> Breaking now, China has called an emergency press conference.<eos> General Shang, Commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army, has announced in an emergency press conference that China is standing down.<eos> China is stating that all intelligence they have received will be shared immediately with all the other landing sites.<eos> Scientists from around the world are sifting through information received<eos> - from the UK, Japan...
...one of the 12 pieces of this puzzle that's being slowly put together.<eos> So, Hannah.<eos> This is where your story begins.<eos> The day they departed.<eos> You all right?<eos> Despite knowing the journey and where it leads,<eos> I embrace it, and I welcome every moment of it.<eos> - H-A-N-N-A-H.<eos> - H-A-N-N-A-H.<eos> - Now backward. H-A-N-N-A-H.
I'm too busy.<eos> There is always something to do.<eos> You like?<eos> You do not talk much, do you?<eos> Are You invite all young of Janus, a picnic?<eos> You are the first after several years.<eos> I can tell you a lot about me.<eos> My mother taught me to play the piano.<eos> Do you still play the piano?<eos> No muy bien.
You were right.<eos> I have been surrounded by death and terror for so long. That made me insensitive.<eos> That's probably why I went to Janus. Out here, nobody can hurt you.<eos> Here was, I am solely responsible for the light.<eos> For many years I shrivel everything he touched.<eos> And you're so full of life.<eos> It scares me.<eos> Isabel, a letter.<eos> I admire her too much to leave the grounds of my darkness.<eos> Tom.
He should not meddle, raging and tell me something I do not know.<eos> Wait. It is not...<eos> ¡Isabel!<eos> How it has taken, Tom?<eos> He was probably full of joy.<eos> I think it'll do sandwiches for lunch.<eos> Could you please...<eos> I'm just trying to make the piano sound a little better.<eos> Come here.<eos> What a surprise, huh?
It should be noted in the logbook.<eos> I report everything immediately.<eos> What if the boat belongs to a boat?<eos> It is a boat, not a lifeboat.<eos> ¿Izz?<eos> You talk a lot.<eos> Tomorrow morning.<eos> As soon as dawn ...<eos> Now you're safe.<eos> April 27 ...
We saved his life.<eos> She is here and needs us.<eos> We can help.<eos> - Do not do anything wrong.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> We do nothing wrong.<eos> If we report now. We can ask for adoption, and can be ours.<eos> - Adoption?<eos> They will not send a child to a lighthouse.<eos> No doctor, no school or church.
Probablemente debido a que era alemán. Y habían perdido familiares durante la guerra.<eos> En fin, ellos tenían miedo, y el tomó a su hija y subieron a un bote.<eos> Su débil corazón debe haber dado paso a la muerte... y el viento se los llevó mar adentro.<eos> La pobre niña no tenía la culpa.<eos> Nunca debería haber ocurrido.<eos> Fue aterrador.<eos> Hace que uno se dé cuenta de lo afortunados que somos.<eos> And then down.<eos> She looks great.<eos> IN MEMORY OF FRANZ JOHANNES Roennfeldt
Sorry if I offended anyone.<eos> Cavo for you as a tax for everything I've seen ...<eos> It is a poor substitute for its beauty<eos> Have you gone mad?<eos> Would you marry a German?<eos> - What does he have?<eos> - He is a good man.<eos> It makes no difference to you right?<eos> If you marry him, it will be without my blessing.<eos> And without my money.
- They should not touch it.<eos> - It's your life what we talked about.<eos> Not only will you be accused of stealing a child, but for murder.<eos> It was going to happen sooner or later.<eos> By God, wake up now!<eos> - Tom.<eos> - Do me a favor.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Bring paper and a pencil.<eos> Tom.
¿Grace?<eos> It's not fun.<eos> Let salt.<eos> It's not fun.<eos> Get out of there!<eos> - Mr. Mark Grays.<eos> - Good night, Vernon and Harry.<eos> - This is the Roennfeldt girl.<eos> - Hannah?<eos> No, her daughter.
You are so Beautiful.<eos> She could have died.<eos> Yes, but she's alive.<eos> What it does is now important.<eos> Tom is still your husband.<eos> Lucy is young.<eos> She is a person who will take care of it and give a good life.<eos> Tom has none.<eos> He will end up in jail.<eos> Or worse.
Her house?<eos> The bond we will redeem against your ship.<eos> But that was my father's ship.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Sign over the vessel... And you will redeem the house.<eos> Report to work Monday morning...<eos> And you will receive a salary and a pension.<eos> And give up the wonder?<eos> Otherwise, we cannot help you.<eos> Or your mother.
Come, quadruped.<eos> Fetch!<eos> Your turn!<eos> Fetch, doggy.<eos> Hatter was perfectly hatterish.<eos> Until...<eos> That blue paper hat...<eos> Somehow put him in mind... Of his family's tragedy.<eos> Slain by the jabberwocky, on horunvendush day...<eos> Many years ago.
Alice?<eos> The Alice?<eos> Slayer of my jabberbabywocky?<eos> The very reason why I have been banished from my kingdom?<eos> That Alice?<eos> Idiot!<eos> I want her head!<eos> Are you all right, sir?<eos> It has begun.<eos> Without the chronosphere...
However would you stop people from laughing?<eos> Put a bag on her head.<eos> Put a bag on your head!<eos> Put a bag on all of your heads!<eos> Yes!<eos> We'll sew up your lips...<eos> Carve your tongues, cut off your ears, off with you!<eos> Just off, off, off with their...<eos> Off with their...<eos> Iracebeth, enough!

Just off, off, off with their...<eos> Off with their...<eos> Iracebeth, enough!<eos> Iracebeth...<eos> I had always hoped...<eos> That you would one day show the necessary qualities to become the queen...<eos> You were born to be.<eos> I realize now that day will never come.<eos> People of witzend...<eos> Upon my death...
Because just today...<eos> I invited Alice to tea.<eos> -Wait. What's an Alice?<eos> -Shush!<eos> Why don't you have a seat...<eos> And we can wait together.<eos> There's no room at the table.<eos> No room.<eos> No room.<eos> Plenty of room.
He makes the best hats in witzend.<eos> Would you like him to make you one?<eos> Come on. He can make any hat.<eos> A bonnet or boater, dunce hat, fez, a cloche, coif, snood, barboosh, or pugree.<eos> You're eating all the tarts.<eos> -You can have the crusts.<eos> -I don't want the crusts.<eos> If you can't get along...<eos> There'll be no more tarts for either of you.<eos> Now, out of my kitchen.
Not to be fun.<eos> Father...<eos> I have something fun.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a hat.<eos> Tarrant, you've got it on backwards.<eos> -Stop. You'll ruin it.<eos> -Now, let me finish.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Oh, well.
Now.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I think this hat will suit you...<eos> -Perfectly.<eos> -Thank you ever so much, Mr. hightopp.<eos> Although, I really must be on my way.<eos> Have a lovely evening.<eos> Where is she?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.
Well played, sir.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were asking me before when "soon" is?<eos> Let me try to explain when is now, all right?<eos> Now is...<eos> Exactly 1 minute till tea time.<eos> And until the young Alice joins you for tea...<eos> It will always remain 1 minute till tea time...<eos> For you and your...
I can't believe he just said that.<eos> What?<eos> Can't bloody move.<eos> Wait! What's he done?<eos> The blighter's stuck us all at 1 minute to tea time.<eos> Tea time forever!<eos> Here you are, little ants.<eos> A nice new home.<eos> What did I tell you two?<eos> No more tarts.
Father!<eos> Mother!<eos> Everyone, it's you!<eos> Teeny-tiny you, but still you.<eos> Hello, Alice.<eos> Get it!<eos> No!<eos> Thank you ever so much.<eos> You have just delivered to me the most powerful device in the entire universe.<eos> Along with your dearest friends.
These new cameras don't hook to our VCRs.<eos> Call over the Young County Sheriffs.<eos> Ask them if they thought to hook their cameras to some sort of recording device.<eos> - Armed?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Pistols.<eos> Faces covered?<eos> Ski masks, sweatshirts, baggy pants...<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Like them thugs in Dallas.
That's gonna be a 500-yard shot if he's where you said.<eos> Just get me there!<eos> Shit.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> You?<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> Ruidoso.<eos> Where you from?<eos> Hamlin.
You're pretty winded.<eos> You oughta let me take the shot. Hell, it's my gun.<eos> Not on your life.<eos> He's mine.<eos> Just left of the tree.<eos> I got him.<eos> I got you.<eos> Lord of the Plains.<eos> That's me.<eos> ...definitely something out of a dime-store novel.
Just cause you think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.<eos> You listen to me, Doc. You're gonna regret it.<eos> All of you! All of you!<eos> I have to get to the Hive.<eos> You have to get these people out of here.<eos> We have children. Injured.<eos> The elderly. Now what chance do they have on the open road?<eos> Better than they have here.<eos> - This building is secure.<eos> - Maybe from the undead.
When are you coming back?<eos> I have a meeting in Kansas City tomorrow.<eos> - Hopefully, the day after.<eos> - I thought we were gonna finish unpacking this week.<eos> Please, Michael, let's not get into this right now.<eos> All right.<eos> Fine.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Gotta go.<eos> - Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Emma.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Evan?<eos> Tell your Dad I put his pliers in the mailbox.<eos> It's not my Dad, but okay.<eos> Alan?<eos> I can't find my car keys. Oh, hey, there.<eos> I better go before she has a breakdown.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> - All right.

Now I can see why Evan's got a little spring in his step.<eos> Okay, Bill.<eos> I'll be in in a minute.<eos> Looks like I'm getting the boot.<eos> Hey, now don't go breaking this little baby's heart, okay?<eos> He's... look at him, he's sensitive.<eos> - He's a...<eos> - Oh, an asshole.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of, yeah.

I get laid off, I go from teaching PhD candidates to high school kids, and, no offense, it's just...<eos> I know it hasn't been easy on you and your sister.<eos> Right?<eos> New school, new friends, new house.<eos> Things will be fine, sweetie, okay?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you, kiddo.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Good night, sweetie.
This is a parasite that gets inside of a rat's brain and makes the rat completely fearless around cats.<eos> Why?<eos> Because toxo only reproduces in a cat's intestines.<eos> So the cat eats the rat, and the cycle then begins again.<eos> Is it like how zombies are always biting people to turn them into more zombies?<eos> Know what?<eos> It's kind of.<eos> I mean, the question being... when does a host stop being an animal and simply become a vehicle<eos> - Gracie.<eos> - For the parasite?
No, it was one of the other girls in the class.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Hang on.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Honey, she's fine, I'm telling you.<eos> Mom, I'm fine.<eos> See?<eos> She's fine.<eos> What about you? What's going on?<eos> Nothing?
There's a party<eos> - in phase two tonight. - You do look nice.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We can't leave the house.<eos> We're alone, Emma, we can do whatever we want.<eos> It's not cool, Stacey.<eos> There's still a curfew.<eos> What's not cool is doing your homework in dirty sweats when there's no school tomorrow.<eos> This is true.<eos> - Cheers.

Now there are reports of these gatherings of infected, and these nests across the country.<eos> What I'd like to know is what the hell are they up to and why isn't the government doing anything...<eos> You had any contact with an infected person?<eos> No.<eos> Banished are the sounds of children playing, as the uninfected cower in their homes.<eos> Civilian military stretched too thin.<eos> A crude symbol, increasingly prevalent, indicates which homes have been cleared<eos> And those which still need to be inspected. Streets so quiet...<eos> I keep getting his voice-mail.<eos> Mom's, too.

That's all I'm asking.<eos> Brother, I've been away a long time.<eos> If I come back now believe me, it's important.<eos> I want to give you this.<eos> I've done a lot of work with this.<eos> It would give me nothing but joy, to know it was in your hands and lay forever idle.<eos> I'll speak to my people, find out what I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you must come to dinner. I will.<eos> But nothing special.
You should be resting.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I need to redress the wound.<eos> Sit.<eos> Well, if you want to call anywhere home again, you'll need to be more careful.<eos> The people you run with now are trouble.<eos> I see they've sold you on the romance of fighting, but the reality is very different.<eos> How would you know?<eos> I know when I found you, you were almost dead.<eos> And for what?
Messala, a notice has come from the Ionian Sea.<eos> The Astroea was lost in battle.<eos> Greek rebels ambushed our ships.<eos> Any survivors?<eos> The entire third fleet is lost.<eos> All are dead to the last man.<eos> Caesar demands that we retaliate.<eos> How long were you a galley slave?<eos> One never knows.<eos> Dangerous territory.
You tried to kill Messala.<eos> I told you to stay away from him, Judah.<eos> I warned you!<eos> I won't let him go unpunished for what he's done to us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I watched my father be killed.<eos> I know what it's like to want to take your feelings out on others.<eos> They deserve justice for what's happened to them.<eos> There's nothing here for you anymore.<eos> Nothing.
Peter.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Soldiers!<eos> Jesus of Nazareth...<eos> Stop!<eos> In the name of Caesar, you are under arrest.<eos> Peter!<eos> Peter!<eos> No trouble.<eos> Not from any of you.
Roy Tomlin.<eos> So can you tell us how an 8-year-old got this information?<eos> He would have fits.<eos> Can you explain that?<eos> He would speak in tongues.<eos> Sometimes other languages, sometimes unknown languages.<eos> We wrote them down.<eos> They became our scripture.<eos> These are words of the Lord.<eos> Or the federal government.
You need to sleep.<eos> - You need anything?<eos> - A drink.<eos> You got it.<eos> Do not approach him.<eos> Don't try to apprehend him.<eos> If you've seen this guy, please call 911 immediately.<eos> Hey.<eos> I am in this for Alton.<eos> All the way.
Alton.<eos> How did you know this was here?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Sun will be up in a few hours.<eos> We can wait out the daylight here.<eos> Alton!<eos> Here.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.
UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR<eos> We were on a science mission inside the nebula.<eos> Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.<eos> I took an escape pod. Before the ship crash landed on a nearby planet.<eos> We need a ship... Capable of navigating the nebula.<eos> You must have someone, who can help us.<eos> We tracked her stranded ship through the sector of uncharted nebula.<eos> Here. 210, mark 14.<eos> Long-range scan?<eos> No data.
Do you really have my sad story you hear?<eos> Not every.<eos> Put the phaser down.<eos> Please.<eos> You get it, Chekov?<eos> Ay, Captain.<eos> I've traced the location of her comm.<eos> What does Krall want with this thing?<eos> To save you.<eos> From yourselves.
You do realize ♪something something♪ these things we crash.<eos> Hit something.<eos> Spock by Franklin.<eos> Spock, we read you.<eos> Captain, from what I can assertane, these ships do with the shared cyberpathic link... Which coordinates their actions.<eos> Patching it through now.<eos> That's what they signalize.<eos> They weren't jamming us, they were talking to each other.<eos> How do we get them to stop talking?<eos> What about an electromagnetic focusing?
What happened when you were out there... Edison.<eos> Edison?<eos> I have to say Kirk. I've missed being me.<eos> We lost ourselves, But I gained a purpose.<eos> It means to bring the galaxy extra trouble...<eos> That makes humanity strong.<eos> I think you underestimate humanity.<eos> I fought for humanity!<eos> We lost millions with the Xindi and Romulan wars.<eos> And for what?
I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions, just tell the truth.<eos> Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up on you 'cause you filed a complaint on.<eos> Brownie ain't got that much sense.<eos> Man wasn't thinking about nothing.<eos> All I want them to do is change the job description, give everybody a chance to drive the truck.<eos> Brownie can't see that.<eos> He ain't got that much sense.<eos> How you figure he be making out with that gal, be up in Taylors' all the time?<eos> - That Alberta gal?<eos> - Who?

I see you be walking up around Alberta's house.<eos> You supposed to be at Taylors', and you be walking up around there.<eos> What you watching where I'm walking for?<eos> I don't be watching after you.<eos> No, I seen you walking around there more than once.<eos> Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere.<eos> That don't mean nothing 'cause you seen me walking around there.<eos> Where'd she come from, anyway?<eos> She just kinda showed up one day.<eos> Tallahassee.
To this day, first day of every month, I send my $10, just like clockwork.<eos> Troy lying.<eos> I ain't never seen that man since.<eos> Now, you tell me, who else that gonna be but the devil?<eos> And I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.<eos> No, I wouldn't have truck with the devil over nothing like that.<eos> But I got my furniture.<eos> And I send my $10, just like clockwork.<eos> How long you say you been paying this $10 a month?<eos> 15 years.
- That ain't that much, Pop.<eos> No, that's just $200.<eos> You see that roof you got sitting over your head at night?<eos> Let me tell you something about that roof.<eos> It's been 10 years since that roof was last tarred.<eos> See, now snow come this winter, sit up on that roof like it is, it's gonna seep inside, just gonna be a little bit, you ain't gonna hardly notice it, then next thing you know,<eos> Then the wood rot from all that water, and you gonna need a whole new roof.<eos> Now how much you think it cost to get that roof fixed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - $264 cash money.
Troy, you're hurting me!<eos> Troy! Troy!<eos> All right.<eos> That's strike two.<eos> You stay away from around me, boy.<eos> Don't you strike out.<eos> You're living with a full count.<eos> Don't you strike out!<eos> Troy, I want to talk to you.<eos> All of a sudden?
I can't taste nothing no more.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's between you and me now.<eos> Come on. Anytime you want.<eos> Come on. I be ready for you.<eos> But I ain't gonna be easy.<eos> Raynell?<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - What you doing?<eos> Nothing.
I don't have a Patrick, Lou.<eos> I don't think I'm ever gonna have a Patrick.<eos> I need this.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You just need me to stay here in my miserable job, so I can help Mum and Dad.<eos> - I've done my fair share.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> Please, for me and Tom.
It's his girlfriend and his best friend.<eos> You can't blame her.<eos> Are you really saying that you'd stick around with me if I was paralyzed from the neck down?<eos> Of course I would.<eos> Well, I wouldn't want someone staying with me out of pity.<eos> I mean, strangers wipe your arse.<eos> Jesus!<eos> And think of all the things you couldn't do.<eos> No more running, no more cycling.<eos> No more sex.
We'll be fine, Clark.<eos> Oi!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Had to walk here.<eos> Took ages, the bloody weather, you know.<eos> How's things?<eos> Not great.<eos> He's in and out and he's not drunk anything.<eos> How long's he been like this?<eos> Maybe four or five hours.
You know how much pain he's in.<eos> He gave me six months.<eos> We can still persuade him.<eos> And you think the pretty waitress is going to do that.<eos> Now, can I have the letter, please?<eos> Please.<eos> Apparently, the shave was your idea.<eos> Nice one!<eos> It looks great.<eos> Now, Arsenal, four.

Because you hate strangers and you don't like eating in front of people.<eos> Seemed pretty obvious.<eos> I'll come.<eos> If you want me to.<eos> Ah! Lads, welcome.<eos> Bernard Clark.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't...<eos> A curtsy will be fine.<eos> Curtsy.
Oh, well...<eos> That's the door.<eos> Some chicken, love?<eos> Six miles in 28 minutes.<eos> And a happy birthday to my girlfriend!<eos> Yes!<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> - Sorry I'm a bit late.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> Only 28 minutes.
I've bought your parents cinema tickets and Granddad's in his room.<eos> Asleep, I think.<eos> You bribed my parents and jailed my granddad.<eos> Good.<eos> I am an idiot.<eos> But this job of yours is just for a few more weeks.<eos> Things will soon be back to normal.<eos> I should be proud that you're doing something worthwhile.<eos> I don't want to argue with you, Lou.<eos> - Less than 300 calories. - Mmm.
Yeah.<eos> I'm amazed that the United Center is even still standing because I crushed it tonight.<eos> You crushed it like velvet.<eos> Like velvet!<eos> Send T-Pain some "thank you" flowers.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look into getting more fire power to that bird.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> More power.
Thank you.<eos> It's Sandy.<eos> It's Sandy.<eos> - Or Sandy.<eos> - I like Sarah.<eos> Whatever, either one.<eos> I gotta know how much are you selling these boxes for?<eos> - Girls.<eos> - $7.<eos> $7?
"Buy my brownies or I'll kill you."<eos> Don't say that, Chrystal.<eos> Say that. That's perfect.<eos> All right, now go make some money!<eos> The van leaves at 7:00!<eos> If you're not back, we will leave without you!<eos> No, we're not gonna leave.<eos> Nobody's leaving you.<eos> We're leaving at 7:00 sharp.<eos> - 7:00!
Yeah.<eos> I knew right away, you were a tough, money-hungry, self-serving, see-you-next-Tuesday gal just like me.<eos> And that's why I decided to mentor you.<eos> Just let you get too close.<eos> I started to think of you as family.<eos> Well, families are for suckers, right?<eos> That's for sure.<eos> What do you want, Michelle?<eos> I need an investor.<eos> Oh, for your little brownie venture?
- Do you want in or not?<eos> - You know, I once made love on a pool table in Hot Coffee, Mississippi with six members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<eos> Are you stroking out?<eos> What does this have to do with what we're talking about right now?<eos> The point is, Darnell, I have very few regrets in my life.<eos> But you...<eos> You were my best protégée.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll back you, if this checks out.<eos> Just for old times' sake.
...are giving young women in this country a business plan and the thought in their head of like, "Yes, I can."<eos> Is she picking up?<eos> And if you buy four sets, you get this adorable wagon. No.<eos> It's her voicemail.<eos> I got 'em!<eos> I got 'em!<eos> These are going to be huge.<eos> How does she do it?<eos> I want in.<eos> More milk.
Chrystal!<eos> Protect me.<eos> Protect me.<eos> This is not cowardice.<eos> She's very tall!<eos> Really wish you'd let me kick his ass.<eos> You know what?<eos> It was a good business decision.<eos> Don't start feelin' bad about good...<eos> Good decisions.
It's not my business.<eos> Nobody's sucking my dick.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Well, that's the first time I've heard you say that, but...<eos> I'm going to plan B, my tongue has always been my sword.<eos> Okay.<eos> Put the knife away, Ronald.<eos> It's not a knife.<eos> It's a katana.<eos> Katana.
But I like burgers.<eos> I took the guard's keycard.<eos> Oh, fuck me.<eos> I took the card from the geek.<eos> What the fuck is it?<eos> I took the guard's keycard.<eos> I took the card from the geek.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Again.<eos> Katana.
I object to parolees attending our meetings and I'd like to put that in the official transcreept...<eos> I made a good business...<eos> You know what?<eos> You made a good business...<eos> Really?<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> I can't say "decision."<eos> - Language, Michelle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good night!
Sleep tight, boys.<eos> Hey.<eos> Little guy.<eos> This place is so great!<eos> Uh-huh. By the way...<eos> That is one gorgeous bed.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Maybe we could share?<eos> You know, one night you get the bed. The next night, I do.<eos> That kind of thing.
Duke, Katie is not...<eos> Katie's gonna be so upset when she sees that.<eos> Katie's gonna flip out...<eos> When she sees how you trashed her whole place.<eos> Oh, it's just one vase.<eos> Is it, Duke? Is it?<eos> Oh, that's a shame.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Whoa, what am I doing?<eos> Nothing.
Butterfly!<eos> Butterfly!<eos> Let's get it!<eos> Wha... What's...<eos> Help! Help!<eos> So long!<eos> Don't leave me here!<eos> Didn't have to be this way, Max.<eos> Wait!<eos> No hard feelings!
Oh, please, tell me it was a blender!<eos> Hey, buddy, I don't ask what it's called, we just kill with it.<eos> But it was a blender.<eos> Whoo! Do y'all hear this?<eos> You know who was like this?<eos> Ricky!<eos> Rest in peace!<eos> Ricky was the only soldier I had that was ready to kill humans on sight.<eos> Everybody else need a pep talk.<eos> Not these two brothers.
Ricky was the only soldier I had that was ready to kill humans on sight.<eos> Everybody else need a pep talk.<eos> Not these two brothers.<eos> See, all of us have suffered at the hands of man.<eos> I mean, take me for instance.<eos> I was a magician's rabbit for kids' parties.<eos> But then bunny tricks went out of style.<eos> So, what did my owner do?<eos> My owner went and left magic behind and made me disappear...<eos> From his life!
Take the fat dog!<eos> Snake bite!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stop!<eos> Snake bite!<eos> Snake bite! Snake bite!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Stop!<eos> What are you doing initiating a couple domestics?<eos> Domestics?
Help!<eos> Max, grab the ring!<eos> I can't!<eos> Keep it up, Max!<eos> You're doing...<eos> Well, you're not doing great.<eos> But you're not drowning, and that's something!<eos> You're almost there!<eos> Thanks, Duke.<eos> No problem.
Are you gonna eat me?<eos> As long as people have been going into these woods, there have been stories about the Millhaven dragon.<eos> How does that song go again?<eos> They come from the North, right?<eos> Way up there in the mountains where few people have ever been.<eos> But sometimes, a dragon gets lost from its family and winds up very, very far from home.<eos> They say it lives in these very woods.<eos> That you can hear its roar at night.<eos> They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know... not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.<eos> Except me.
We're pretty far from home.<eos> There you are.<eos> No one's gonna cut you down now.<eos> You ready to go, Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Come on, Grace. Not again.<eos> I'm just settling a score.<eos> One for Jack. One for you? Yeah.<eos> Something like that.
A bear?<eos> You ever seen a bear that big?<eos> Thought I did once.<eos> Turns out it was just Bobby's sister.<eos> All right, let's catch me some rabbits.<eos> I'll bring him home tonight.<eos> Okay, thank you so much, Sheriff.<eos> You take care of yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye.
Can you tell me?<eos> How about this?<eos> If you come inside with me now, then tomorrow, I'll take you back out to the woods and you can show me exactly where you live.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> You know, when I was a little girl I wanted to live in the forest more than anything.<eos> I loved being out there.<eos> It was so fun with, the squirrels, the birds, the trees.<eos> So, when I grew up, I made it my job to protect the woods, and everything in them.<eos> Which I suppose includes you.<eos> And Elliot?
I know those woods like the back of my hand.<eos> I couldn't have missed a dragon.<eos> Well, you missed Pete.<eos> Pete.<eos> Wake up, honey.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You heading out already?<eos> Yup.<eos> Bright and early.
Yup.<eos> Bright and early.<eos> I'm gonna head over to the mill.<eos> Talk to Gavin about something.<eos> Call me if you need anything.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> You sure?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
Nothing good's going on here. Party's over.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> So, how's that latte coming?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm half naked here!<eos> Can't you knock?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not looking.<eos> I have your lunch money.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good night, hon.
Thank you.<eos> I'm half naked here!<eos> Can't you knock?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not looking.<eos> I have your lunch money.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good night, hon.<eos> - No? - No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Mom?
- So?<eos> Want to do some research?<eos> Sounds like a plan to me.<eos> Hey, I get why you stood me up.<eos> I should have helped.<eos> I should have done something.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> Actually, you're kind of my only friend.<eos> Shut up, you have, like a hundred Facebook friends.<eos> Virtual.
Come on.<eos> To bed!<eos> In you get.<eos> But I failed, big time.<eos> Oh, no, you didn't.<eos> You were looking in the wrong beaker.<eos> I saw you fill one up with anger and fear.<eos> But then you added beauty and you added a little bit of mischief.<eos> That, my dear Milton, is alchemy.<eos> - Goodnight.

- Bryan's baby dick 69.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Bryan's baby dick 69.<eos> What the fuck, guys?<eos> Really?<eos> - Got it.<eos> Yep.<eos> -Ls that it?<eos> Good.<eos> Happy fourth of July!
The girls that you bring to the wedding.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I want you to bring a date.<eos> That's two dates.<eos> You want us to bring dates to a wedding?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Are you allowed to do that?<eos> Nice, respectable, smart girls!<eos> Keep you in line.<eos> - What the fuck?
- Take your head out of your ass, dad!<eos> - You sound insane right now.<eos> Everybody stop yelling!<eos> Okay?<eos> You guys bringing wedding dates was my idea.<eos> Look, I love the shit out of you guys.<eos> But everyone is already stressed out about this wedding... And I just need you to be cool.<eos> Of course, jeanie!<eos> Please?<eos> For me?
Online dating.<eos> Yeah.<eos> L'm not really looking for a heteronormative relationship.<eos> - You look like a Nike swoosh.<eos> - Goddamn right, I do.<eos> I work at a dog shelter.<eos> Our sister loves dogs.<eos> I wanna make sure they get really good homes.<eos> What's a good home?<eos> The white homes.

Dude, we have met 37 insane women.<eos> We can't bring any of these girls.<eos> Maybe dad'll just forget about his ultimatum.<eos> Why would dad forget about an old tomato?<eos> No, his ultimatum.<eos> - Old tom...<eos> - Ultimatum.<eos> Are you saying "old tomato"?<eos> Ultima-tomb.<eos> Like a tomb or a crypt.
And definitely don't bring up blimps.<eos> Shit!<eos> They're leaving.<eos> If it was a competition, I won it.<eos> All right, don't worry.<eos> It's all part of the plan.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What plan?
So, you have Tequila, and then he's got his pet worm right there.<eos> And his name is lil' mez.<eos> Because he'll "mez" you up.<eos> The next one right there, that's gin.<eos> When he flips his cap off, dawg, he's just like...<eos> "Yo, I'll pop you off.<eos> Guaranteed.<eos> One knock."<eos> Done.<eos> Next, whiskey.
Oh, um... The hardest thing about being a teacher... Is teaching cursive.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - Yeah? - Are you seeing anyone?<eos> - No.<eos> My ex is gone.<eos> Long gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He died.<eos> Of cancer.
- What about you?<eos> - Yeah? - Are you seeing anyone?<eos> - No.<eos> My ex is gone.<eos> Long gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He died.<eos> Of cancer.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> And aids.
Right, Mike?<eos> L'm so happy we're here!<eos> This is where the dinos ran in the prairie!<eos> I know, girl!<eos> Check it out!<eos> I'm a brontosaurus!<eos> L'm a t-Rex.<eos> I'm coming to get you!<eos> Guys, butts on seats, okay?<eos> No hot dogging!
- Great.<eos> - But I figured it out.<eos> - You didn't really communicate it to me.<eos> - Okay, that's fair.<eos> Yes, you want the special "lam blissful" massage?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um... - How blissful is that?<eos> - Oh, don't worry.<eos> Physically, no penetration.
Good.<eos> Take down the light a little bit.<eos> So you're getting married, huh?<eos> Lam. Yeah.<eos> I know it can be a stressful time.<eos> You know it's like, "who is this for, me or my family?"<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've recently had an injury to my face... Which I'm a little stressed out about.<eos> Are you okay with oil?<eos> Yeah, sure.
Do I get backstage tickets to Rihanna?<eos> Do I have a glass blowing studio in my basement?<eos> Hold up, backstage tickets to Rihanna?<eos> Yeah, she likes to have me around. You know.<eos> - Riri is Alice's jam.<eos> - Oh, riri, is it?<eos> - Yes. - That's funny.<eos> She would freak out if I got her backstage tickets to Rihanna.<eos> Well, you could get her tickets.<eos> From me.
Yeah, well, I felt so bad about your fucked up face... And I wanted to make it up to you.<eos> Aw! Thank you.<eos> Hey, who needs a bachelorette party when they have you around?<eos> - He rubbed my butt.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> But with his butt.<eos> It was like...<eos> He was on ribbons.<eos> I don't know what you did with jeanie in the spa... But she's in a great mood.<eos> Yeah, no problem.
Here to pile on?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Any insult you can think of... I've probably told myself a million times.<eos> Why were you trying to poison your cousin?<eos> I was jealous of the whole steam room incident.<eos> That is some crazy shit.<eos> That's like something I would do.<eos> This one time in high school... This bitch tried to hit on my boyfriend...<eos> And I cut off her ponytail while she was sleeping... And I wore it to school for a month.<eos> What the fuck?
Because if you don't need me... Then nobody needs me, and, um...<eos> Anyway, that's what I was thinking when I was knuckles deep into cousin Terry.<eos> Dude, we're always gonna need each other.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, here's the thing.<eos> I don't wanna stop being us.<eos> But I think occasionally... We should think about how we make other people feel.<eos> Like jeanie?<eos> Yeah, like jeanie.<eos> - Oof. - Or like Eric.
Heroes in a half shell.<eos> Turtle power.<eos> We're not going anywhere... Until our little sister, jeanie beanie weanie... Is getting married.<eos> You just killed the TV.<eos> I was aiming for it.<eos> We are such idiots.<eos> We are so stupid.<eos> We ruined your whole wedding... And we finally just realized that.<eos> All right. Please just stop talking, okay?<eos> Not another word.
- I can't give you a whole pig.<eos> But we need to feed 100 people.<eos> Could we please, please have the wedding here?<eos> For the last time, we're out of venues.<eos> - Hold me back.<eos> Hold me back, please.<eos> - What? Give us a place!<eos> Everybody out of the way!<eos> It's hot.<eos> So hot!
To me aww.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> You 're so beautiful this is real beautiful, man.<eos> You're everything I hoped for<eos> - in a little sister!<eos> - Oh!<eos> You're everything I need everything that I need<eos> they're kind of good.<eos> You are so beautiful as a couple.<eos> Oh!
Scared, too.<eos> Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.<eos> I mean, Zootopia. So far away.<eos> Such a big city.<eos> Guys...<eos> I've been working for this my whole life.<eos> We know.<eos> And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.<eos> The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.<eos> And also bears.
Chief Bogo?<eos> Sir, you said there were 14 missing mammal cases.<eos> - So?<eos> - So, I can handle one.<eos> You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the Academy.<eos> Didn't forget.<eos> Just don't care.<eos> Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.<eos> Well, then writing 100 tickets a day should be easy.<eos> 100 tickets.
Didn't forget.<eos> Just don't care.<eos> Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.<eos> Well, then writing 100 tickets a day should be easy.<eos> 100 tickets.<eos> I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.<eos> I'm gonna write 200 tickets.<eos> Before noon.<eos> Boom!<eos> 200 tickets before noon!
Anyone can be anything.<eos> Boy, I tell him that all the time.<eos> All right, here you go.<eos> Two paws.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look at that smile.<eos> That's a "happy birthday" smile.<eos> All right, give her a little bye-bye toot-toot.<eos> Toot-toot!<eos> Bye, now.

Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed!<eos> No, let's not tell the Mayor just yet.<eos> And I've sent it and it is done, so I did do that.<eos> Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.<eos> Us little guys really need to stick together, right?<eos> Like glue.<eos> Good one.<eos> Just call me if you ever need anything, okay?<eos> You've always got a friend at City Hall, Judy.<eos> All right, bye-bye.
Okay.<eos> Deal!<eos> Splendid.<eos> Clawhauser will give you the complete case file.<eos> Here you go.<eos> One missing otter.<eos> That's it?<eos> Yikes!<eos> That is the smallest case file I've ever seen.<eos> Leads, none.

Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?<eos> No!<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay. What do you call a three-humped camel?<eos> I don't... know.<eos> What... do... you call...<eos> -a...<eos> - Three-humped camel.<eos> ...three-humped... camel?<eos> Pregnant.
And he does not like me.<eos> So we gotta go!<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> This is a crime scene.<eos> It's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here... so we're leaving right now.<eos> Raymond!<eos> And is that Kevin?<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> And, speaking of "no see," how about you forget you saw me?<eos> For old times' sake?
You come here, unannounced, on the day my daughter is to be married.<eos> Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...<eos> The point is, I did not know that it was your car... and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding.<eos> I trusted you, Nicky.<eos> I welcomed you into my home.<eos> We broke bread together.<eos> Gram-mama made you a cannoli.<eos> And how did you repay my generosity?<eos> With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.<eos> A skunk-butt rug.
What I said was, "no."<eos> She will not be giving you that badge.<eos> Look, you give her a clown vest and a three-wheeled joke-mobile... and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No wonder she needed to get help from a fox.<eos> None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?<eos> Here's the thing, Chief.<eos> You gave her the 48 hours... so, technically, we still have... 10 left to find our Mr. Otterton... and that is exactly what we're gonna do.<eos> So, if you'll excuse us, we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack.<eos> Good day.
But I have a friend at City Hall who might.<eos> Sir, if we could just review these very important...<eos> Sir...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sir!<eos> Okay.<eos> I heard you, Bellwether.<eos> Just take care of it.<eos> Please.<eos> And clear my afternoon.
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?<eos> It is possible.<eos> So we must be vigilant.<eos> And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you.<eos> Will more mammals go savage?<eos> What is being done to protect us?<eos> Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?<eos> Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.<eos> That's all the time that we have.<eos> No more questions.
That's it!<eos> That's what I've been missing!<eos> Keys !<eos> Keys, keys, keys!<eos> Hurry! Come on!<eos> Thank you!<eos> I love you!<eos> Bye!<eos> You catch any oi that, Ben'?<eos> Not one bit.
All right, you're milking it.<eos> Besides, I think we got it.<eos> We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!<eos> You laid it all out beautifully.<eos> What?<eos> Are you looking for the serum?<eos> Well, it's right here.<eos> What you've got in the weapon there?<eos> Those are blueberries.<eos> From my family's farm.
JimmyOlsen.<eos> Photographer.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Where's heron?<eos> Uh, trouble at the border.<eos> So, uh, how'd you land it?<eos> This is, like, pioneer stuff.<eos> Amajagh's never given an interview.<eos> You know what heron always says when we're on assignment together?<eos> Not a goddamn thing.

That is why i didn't tell you.<eos> Lane, don't you have a plane to catch?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Benefit for the library of Metropolis.<eos> Someone on the committee requested that Clark Kent cover it.<eos> Probably some old charity crone who's got a thing for nerds.<eos> Senator.<eos> Little bourbon before lunch?<eos> My driver's outside. I can't stay.<eos> No bourbon?

What's next?<eos> Millions?<eos> He has the power to wipe out the entire human race, and if we believe there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.<eos> And we have to destroy him.<eos> But he is not our enemy.<eos> Not today.<eos> 20 years in Gotham, Alfred. We've seen what promises are worth.<eos> How many good guys are left.<eos> How many stayed that way.<eos> 14 hours.
Lexcorp.<eos> Lex Luthor?<eos> He also had private security contractors at the desert compound.<eos> Go on record.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> It's classified.<eos> I happen to like my job.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> You said that the ambush was arranged to frame superman, but how could they know that he'd show up in the...<eos> In the middle of the desert.
Get out!<eos> Superman!<eos> Superman!<eos> Another one came this morning, Mr. Wayne.<eos> Let me say at the outset that I'm grateful to our witness for coming before us today.<eos> This is how a democracy works.<eos> We talk to each other.<eos> We act by the consent of the governed, sir.<eos> Ihavesatherebefore tosaythat shadowinterventions willnotbe tolerated bythiscommittee.<eos> Neitherwilllies.

That's right.<eos> We have hospitals that treat the mentally ill with compassion.<eos> But that's not where you're going.<eos> I arranged for you to get transferred to arkham asylum in Gotham.<eos> I still have some friends there.<eos> They're expecting you.<eos> But the bell's already been rung.<eos> And they've heard it.<eos> Out in the dark.<eos> Among the stars.
She says I'm like you, can't see the big picture, lacking ambition.<eos> The usual bullshit.<eos> Maybe just prove her wrong, Dad.<eos> Prove her wrong.<eos> - Front desk.<eos> - This is Alan Clay.<eos> Is it possible for me to get a beer or something?<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but consuming alcohol is strictly prohibited in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.<eos> Ah, yes, of course.<eos> - How about a Diet Coke?
- [ENGINE STARTS]<eos> - Whew.<eos> - Hey, you like Electric Light Orchestra?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> # The city streets are empty now #<eos> # The lights don't shine no more #<eos> # And so the songs are way down low... #<eos> Hey, that's the mosque I see from my balcony.<eos> There was something going on there yesterday.<eos> - A lot of people.
- You assured me he would be in all day.<eos> I know, but his plans changed last night.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Let me ask you something, Maha.<eos> Are you sure there isn't someone I can talk to about our presentation to the king?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Mr. Al-Ahmad really is your primary contact.<eos> He'll be back tomorrow.<eos> He guaranteed it.<eos> - [PHONE RINGING]
But recently they've gotten really sexy.<eos> If he'd seen any of those messages, I'd be dead.<eos> She'd definitely be dead.<eos> So she's jeopardizing her life for these texts?<eos> [MELODY PLAYING ON PHONE]<eos> [SPEAKING IN ARABIC]<eos> - Her again.<eos> - Why do you talk to her like that?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - That lovey-dovey way.
- [LAUGHS]<eos> - It's like she is your girlfriend.<eos> She's a sweetie, you know?<eos> - You need to sit down with him.<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - You need to sit down with him, and you gotta look him in the eye and you have to tell him you haven't done anything with his wife.<eos> - Because you haven't, right?<eos> - No, nothing.
- I can't talk about it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I promised not to.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oof.<eos> What has happened?<eos> - Hey, are you all right?<eos> - [ALL GASP]
KARIM: Do you know that some of our people are already living here?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You should take a look at one of the units.<eos> Me?<eos> Why?<eos> You'll be spending some time implementing the IT plan, no?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> If we get the job, yeah.<eos> - [PHONE RINGING]
Go ahead, it's on the fifth floor.<eos> The elevators don't work just yet.<eos> Take the stairs.<eos> It's not a long way up.<eos> Ring the doorbell at 501.<eos> There's a man, Hassan, he'll show you everything.<eos> I'll be with you shortly.<eos> [SPEAKING ARABIC]<eos> [VOICES ECHOING]<eos> [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

I'm not having an affair with my doctor.<eos> I'm sorry, Alan.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> I heard some noises outside my house.<eos> I got out of bed.<eos> I saw three men standing at the window.<eos> I nearly crapped my pants.<eos> - The husband?<eos> - And his henchmen, yes.
Please.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Am I not meeting Dr. Hakem?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She's not in today.<eos> But I've got these results here from your biopsy.<eos> - Please, have a seat.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Now, we found some precancerous cells below.<eos> - Precancerous?
Sticks and stones can break my bones... but holograms can never hurt me.<eos> BRAD:<eos> [NO AUDIBLE DIALOG]<eos> ASSISTANT:<eos> Alan, you're on with Eric.<eos> ERIC:<eos> Nice work, Alan.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Let's keep fingers crossed they don't choke on our budget.<eos> - Thrills galore.
But I have felt a strange new lump in my back.<eos> I'm no doctor, but it feels like a rubber glove.<eos> Is there a chance you left one?<eos> Sometimes people leave things like gloves with someone they like in hopes their retrieval will provide an excuse to see that someone again.<eos> Yours, Alan."<eos> "Dear Alan, I actually might have left something.<eos> I'm thinking a sponge?<eos> Or maybe part of a snack I ate during the surgery.<eos> I think I need to see you again.<eos> Perhaps out of the hospital?
So he asked me, "What should we do, son?"<eos> And I realized this was some kind of a test, so I thought of all the Boy Scout stuff I knew and I said, "Build a shelter?"<eos> So we got started and we took turns chopping and tying.<eos> We set it up there, a perfectly respectable A-frame.<eos> We collected fronds from the pine trees and lined the bottom with them.<eos> And he says, "Alan, what do we need now?"<eos> And I knew.<eos> We needed a needle and thread.<eos> Or... duct tape.<eos> For what?
Or... duct tape.<eos> For what?<eos> To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.<eos> We cut up our jackets and we taped them together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.<eos> And we slept there in our long underwear.<eos> - And you shared the sleeping bag?<eos> - We did.<eos> And I must say, when we were all settled in there, it was really warm.<eos> And you didn't have a fire?<eos> No fire.
CIA OFFICE AMERICAN EMBASSY LONDON.<eos> QUAKER WELLS CHEF OPERATIONS CIA LONDON.<eos> Sir, we lost him after the bridge, but he had three options on the roundabout...<eos> Waterloo Road, Stanford Street and Waterloo Bridge.<eos> It has been after bridge, 20 minutes.<eos> I want two bikes, to start from the roundabout.<eos> Explore each from the screen.<eos> Sir.<eos> Found him.<eos> Camera 2.
We have to stop bleeding or he will die.<eos> Alright, we remove the robotic injector...<eos> Hey!<eos> You pull that thing.<eos> You, carry on.<eos> You think... still we can't.<eos> Carry on.<eos> It is stabilizing.<eos> What we tell his wife?<eos> Nothing.
Aspirin is not good for you.<eos> But this will help.<eos> Billy, we had orders to put it in the Dutchman's head.<eos> But you forced the game off, because you thought you could trust him by paying him on.<eos> Remember?<eos> Billy!<eos> ... With, we did it your way.<eos> You brought him to such a safe house.<eos> Remember?<eos> Anything?
Jill?<eos> Come on.<eos> Shit. You remember.<eos> Something.<eos> Anything.<eos> We have nothing.<eos> The science behind it is good.<eos> Shit, Fuck it Science.<eos> How long have you worked on this?<eos> 18 years.
Sir, the facial recognition system just detect a red alert.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Stop.<eos> Put the convicted waiting and send it home.<eos> That's it!<eos> The Dutch has been right in the city airport MI5...<eos> We have to go.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> My money.<eos> Hey, what about my money?
I say, you could be a man right here.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Now you know where the man village is.<eos> You can always go down there, whenever you want.<eos> But I would personally appreciate it... As a personal favour to me, personally... If we just worked together, just us, tricks and all.<eos> I think it would be interesting to see... Just how much honey we could accumulate... Before winter.<eos> Whatever I could do to make your trickiness happen... L will do.<eos> And if it turns out to not be fun for you... I will walk you right down to that man village myself.<eos> Is that a deal?<eos> Just till winter.

Listen to me, you con artist!<eos> He may not know your game, but I do.<eos> - He's leaving now.<eos> - But I don't wanna leave!<eos> You don't have a choice!<eos> Why don't we all just settle down for a minute.<eos> Look, it's gotten late. Too late to travel.<eos> So, why don't we all just have a little honey...<eos> I don't eat honey.<eos> No problem.
Look at nothing but me.<eos> - Hmm? - You're doing fine.<eos> Just keep your eyes up high.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> What part of the jungle you from?<eos> You, man-cub.<eos> You come from the south, the north?<eos> What part of the jungle?
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I have no problem with that.<eos> I don't have any problem with that.<eos> I came up here without an invitation.<eos> It was extremely presumptuous of me.<eos> Let me interrupt myself.<eos> I just gotta say... You guys are so much handsomer in person than anyone knows.<eos> No one ever gets up close to you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of the smell.
Lorraine, what is happening?<eos> - I have to see.<eos> - We're through.<eos> We're through. It's time to come back.<eos> What is happening?<eos> He wants to show me.<eos> Lorraine!<eos> Lorraine!<eos> Honey?<eos> Honey?
- I have to see.<eos> - We're through.<eos> We're through. It's time to come back.<eos> What is happening?<eos> He wants to show me.<eos> Lorraine!<eos> Lorraine!<eos> Honey?<eos> Honey?<eos> Honey?
Shut up. What are you doing?<eos> There's no one here!<eos> This is my house..<eos> Mom!<eos> Billy, what's wrong?<eos> - There-there's someone in my tent!<eos> - What?<eos> There-there's someone in my te-tent!<eos> You see?<eos> Nothing.
It's been getting worse since the Mr. Grosse started talking to it.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Like asking a question.<eos> Saying nod twice for yes, once for no.<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> And I wonder what will happen if we tried talking to it now?<eos> Is anybody there?<eos> Is anybody there who wishes to communicate?<eos> I say again, is anybody there?<eos> Nothing?
Watch this.<eos> See?<eos> It can't hurt you.<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> Yeah. We're working for Terravex.<eos> We had something crash through our fences last night.<eos> No one got a good look at it, but it was big, whatever it was.<eos> You get any reports of anything like that in the last day?<eos> No, dude, we haven't heard any of that.<eos> Nothing strange?
And I gave him a name.<eos> Isn't that right, Creech?<eos> You named him Creech?<eos> He's got these hair-Iike things on its tentacles.<eos> Cilia, right?<eos> They can generate a massive amount of torque, especially once I scored the axles to make more surface area to grip.<eos> And that's at each tire. So, imagine the angular velocity when it's not all spread out from one differential.<eos> You're not dumb.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
No, no, no.<eos> Watch me unload this lemon on Old Man Overalls here.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Okay. Right!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay, new rule, no feeding Creature gasoline.<eos> So, you don't like the bacteria cultures, huh?<eos> How about nematodes?
These men want to have a word with you, Tripp.<eos> They want their truck back.<eos> Their truck?<eos> I built that!<eos> Look. Your mother called me last night.<eos> She saw me on TV, thought you'd maybe come up here and try to find me.<eos> You sold me out. To them.<eos> I'm not selling you out to no one.<eos> I just wanna do what's best.<eos> For who?
I'm a scientist.<eos> - I'm being a scientist.<eos> You are falling in love.<eos> This is some sort of Stockholm syndrome.<eos> That's backwards.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - Okay. Look, in two days, our wastewater goes to Ohio.<eos> The mucous twins go with.<eos> Going to shoot it down deep into an injection well.<eos> No trace.
Tenneson probably already has Burke coming for us.<eos> Nice job.<eos> Thank you. I never drove a stick before.<eos> It was very exciting.<eos> Cool. Want to give me a hand with this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'll be...<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You're looking good.<eos> For you.
Not Bruce Lee.<eos> - What?<eos> - Got you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Look.<eos> Where'd it go?<eos> And now it's by my head.<eos> How fun.<eos> - $20.<eos> - $20?
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.<eos> - Listen, I did not kill your father.<eos> - What?<eos> All right, all right, let's just cut the bullshit.<eos> I know who you are, Shrike.<eos> I know you blame me for your father's death.<eos> I know you think I goaded him into performing a trick he couldn't pull off.<eos> I know the time in jail was a result of a 30-year revenge plot against me.<eos> Supposing that's all true, you think I'd tell you now?<eos> Thirty years.
That's good. Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?<eos> Nubile.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> The stick's metal. How are we going to get it out?<eos> Yeah. I don't know.<eos> This is the housing.<eos> 820 million qubit miles of digi-synaptic resonance.
My name's Jack Wilder.<eos> Goddamn, it feels good to be back.<eos> All right, gather around.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> I wanna talk to you about something real quick.<eos> You all know Three Card Monte, also known as "Find the Lady"?<eos> Trick performed by street hustlers all over the world.<eos> And why street hustlers?<eos> Because as soon as you walk up to the table, you lose.<eos> Every time.
They should be arriving any second.<eos> That is, if they're gonna get here by midnight.<eos> Okay, feeling fear.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> I was done.<eos> So nice to see you all again.<eos> But since we're such old friends, let's skip the formalities.<eos> One of you has something we require.<eos> So give it over.<eos> Nothing at all?
We're not supposed to have opinions like that, but I do.<eos> He's resourceful, he's resilient.<eos> I'm not saying these things haven't affected him.<eos> - He's guarded, he has sleep issues.<eos> - Of course.<eos> But for all he's been through, he hasn't let it turn him into a victim.<eos> Which is what made me think of the two of you.<eos> Now that you've been approved, I think you'll make wonderful foster parents.<eos> My question for you is... are you ready for this?<eos> Okay, living room.
But the color hasn't returned to the world just yet.<eos> How is Mark with this?<eos> We haven't seen him here for awhile.<eos> We always say that people processes grief differently.<eos> Mark and I have had different experiences with this.<eos> - Feeling distant from a spouse is...<eos> - Common.<eos> Yes.<eos> I just wish I knew how to fix this.<eos> For him, for us.
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Well, we didn't see very much of you tonight.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't feel very well.<eos> Don't feel well?<eos> Let's have a look at you.<eos> Worried about what happened at school today?<eos> Well, I think it's going to be okay, that little boy's going to turn up.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.
We can't let him stay up for days on end.<eos> Sleep deprivation at this age can do real damage.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Can I help you guys?<eos> I'm Detective Brown, this is Officer Murray.<eos> We'd like to ask your son a few questions about an incident that took place at school.<eos> Cody, come here.<eos> - Okay, screw.
This great city sparkles with the jewels of man's inventions.<eos> Movie theaters, automobiles, the wireless, electric lights, - all dazzle and bewitch us. - I'm so sorry.<eos> But where there is light, there is shadow, friend.<eos> Something is stalking our city, wreaking destruction, and then disappearing without a trace!<eos> We have to fight.<eos> Join us, the Second Salemers, in our fight.<eos> Excuse me, doll.<eos> Just trying to get to the bank.<eos> We have to fight together<eos> - for the sake of our...
Oh, I was just passing.<eos> Are you a seeker?<eos> A seeker after truth?<eos> I'm more of a chaser, really.<eos> Hear my words.<eos> And heed my warning.<eos> And laugh if you dare.<eos> Witches live among us.<eos> We have to fight together for the sake of our children.<eos> For the sake of tomorrow.
What's a Niffler?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Hey, you guys can bunk in here.<eos> Uh, I thought you might like a hot drink.<eos> Psst! Hey. Mr. Scamander, look, cocoa.<eos> Toilet's down the hall to the right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Very much.<eos> Come on.<eos> For the love...
Hand out your leaflets.<eos> I'll know if you dump them.<eos> Tell me if you see anything suspicious.<eos> It was good to make your acquaintance, Jacob.<eos> And I hope you get your bakery.<eos> You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.<eos> Mr. Graves.<eos> You were thrown out of Hogwarts for endangering human life.<eos> - That was an accident.<eos> - With a beast.
He was responsible for the death of a No-Maj.<eos> He risked the exposure of our community.<eos> He has broken one of our most sacred laws.<eos> A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter.<eos> A law that demands that we conceal our true nature.<eos> A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear, lest we risk discovery.<eos> I ask you, Madam President, I ask all of you...<eos> Who does this law protect?<eos> Us?<eos> Or them?
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is nice.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> It's more than okay, this is nice.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Ah, look, Mustafa left his bombs home, 'bout to get him some.<eos> What?
Anyway, look, I'm going to Shiranda's, man.<eos> I know that her cousin is there, And, uh, she got that fat ass.<eos> I know they got some weed over there, too.<eos> This is your place?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> What?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Actually, I'll just... It's fine now.<eos> Just cats... or dogs.
There you go. Inside.<eos> What street is this?<eos> - You the gentleman that called?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so what's going on?<eos> So, I hear something, you know? A glass breaking.<eos> And then from my window, I see an open door.<eos> I see this man go through the door, and then he comes back out a few seconds later.<eos> Then I see him running down the street and get into a cab.<eos> Race?
- What other guy?<eos> I was talking to who I said bring in.<eos> The one reeking weed.<eos> Who'd we tell?<eos> Bell.<eos> Nope.<eos> Brought him in.<eos> How many times stabbed?<eos> I didn't count, Teddy. - A lot.<eos> - Occupation?
No.<eos> She must have said something.<eos> No.<eos> Naz, you said out there I didn't understand.<eos> That's what I'm trying to do here. I'm...<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> To try to understand. To hear it from you.<eos> I don't have to do that, by the way.<eos> What you need to understand is what you say to me here is very important.<eos> For you, not me.
That's recording us.<eos> And it will be used in court.<eos> How you think that's gonna come off?<eos> "She was nice, I liked her. But I killed her anyway."<eos> I didn't. I already told you, I...<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I have to tell you, that's not gonna play any better.<eos> Judges and juries... they don't like "I can't remember." They like honesty. They like remorse.<eos> That counts for something to them.<eos> And even more to you.
Drop your pants.<eos> That's good, good.<eos> Just... just relax.<eos> I think we're about done here?<eos> Box wanted palms and tips, too.<eos> - I didn't hear him say that.<eos> - Then don't do it.<eos> All right, try not to shake too much.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Oh, yeah, why?
And?<eos> Position, Power.<eos> Which brings?<eos> Wealth.<eos> A big family, someday a place in the country.<eos> Where will you find...<eos> An end of a trail.<eos> A day without death.<eos> Peace.<eos> All that for peace?
All that for peace?<eos> Is there no other way?<eos> Well, I'm to bed.<eos> Tomorrow promises further punishments.<eos> The Nazarene...did you find him different?<eos> I found him dead.<eos> So you did.<eos> Peace, Tribune.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Good night.
Funeral.<eos> There's your solution!<eos> Burn them in public.<eos> God forbids cremation.<eos> He also forbids labor on Sabbaths.<eos> And, yet, here you are<eos> Tribune.<eos> Why to Ardeth?<eos> To crucify Nazareth.<eos> Why?
While alive, that deceiver said HE would rise again after three days.<eos> He foretold.<eos> We request that the sarcophagus be sealed so that his disciples don't come at night and steal the body.<eos> Not to say then HE has arisen from the dead.<eos> That would cause more unrest in the city, than all these blasphemies combined.<eos> You have your own guards, secure yourself.<eos> My words exactly!<eos> To which I reply we need a Roman seal.<eos> This should appear as the impartial will of the Prefect.<eos> And not yours.
We had no time.<eos> We just wrapped in myrrh and aloe.<eos> This is what you see. Sweat and herbs.<eos> Bring it!<eos> I want nothing touched here.<eos> Post a watch.<eos> Control was enters and leaves Jerusalem.<eos> Arrest anyone who claims Nazarene lives.<eos> And find out where they heard it.<eos> Yes, Tribune.
I want nothing touched here.<eos> Post a watch.<eos> Control was enters and leaves Jerusalem.<eos> Arrest anyone who claims Nazarene lives.<eos> And find out where they heard it.<eos> Yes, Tribune.<eos> And comb the city for bodies, dead in the last week.<eos> Examine for each marks of crucified.<eos> Dig them up?<eos> Everyone!
I confess, you asked if he was the king?<eos> I'll return his crown.<eos> Sit.<eos> Why do you tremble?<eos> You are a Roman.<eos> You were heard shouting, 'Yeshua yet lives! '<eos> Joyously, says the report.<eos> Why, you didn't obviously see him.<eos> I heard on the street!<eos> From the passers-by?
You are digging up the death?<eos> No stone unturned, Prefect.<eos> A Hebrew cemetery?<eos> Do you want to go? He was Jewish and deceased.<eos> Do you not realize the wrath incurred?<eos> I know in a day or two, wrath won't matter.<eos> Nature will take its course.<eos> Caesar's spies will hear all of this.<eos> An unfortunate dilemma.<eos> For both of us, Tribune.

Right now.<eos> Or show me the body.<eos> He must have shed the snake skin.<eos> God is not on my beck and call.<eos> God?<eos> Yahweh manifests himself through a crazy, poor dead Jew?<eos> Well, so it appears!<eos> What does this rebirth mean?<eos> Eternal life!<eos> For everyone.

I could not gaze upon... it wasn't a man.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> And there was this voice all around, I could not phantom.<eos> And we were running so far.<eos> Running...so far, until... until we could think again!<eos> Then we went told the priest because that's what you made us do.<eos> And Caiaphas paid you for a different story.<eos> Tribune...<eos> I saw much in the service of the Emperor.<eos> Cannibals...

I want two in line pair-some!<eos> Come on!<eos> Move!<eos> Cmon move!<eos> Up! Up on the way back!<eos> No.<eos> Tribune!<eos> Anything?<eos> Tribune?<eos> Nothing.
Brothers lets go.<eos> Alive, if you can.<eos> Although dead, would be less embarrassing.<eos> I'll be in Caesarea.<eos> Sir.<eos> Coming out.<eos> North of Galilee.<eos> Ten days to the Emperor arrives.<eos> Ten days.<eos> Forward!
Our word is your name.<eos> Give us the daily bread.<eos> And forgive us our treas, as so we forgive...<eos> We must not lead into temptation.<eos> But away...from evil.<eos> Amen.<eos> A son of Yahweh...<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Do you believe?<eos> After this, yes!
What do you search for?<eos> Trouble.<eos> It will come.<eos> This threatens them.<eos> To Pilate, Caiaphas and Rome.<eos> There's trouble this way as well.<eos> Have faith, Tribune.<eos> Peter...<eos> Just walk a little further.<eos> Why?
But you chose to land on the Hudson, that was still a big IF<eos> I was sure I could do it<eos> You were?<eos> Yes.<eos> How do you feel when people call you a hero?<eos> I don't feel like a hero.<eos> I'm just a man who is doing his job.<eos> The right man for the job at the right time<eos> You've been flying for what?<eos> Nearly 40 years?
No, he's about to Newark, he's just out of the box.<eos> Hook'em back up.<eos> We need authorized news.<eos> Attention all aircraft in vicinity of JW,<eos> We see the USS ship... 1549, low over the Hudson<eos> I got eyes on him<eos> Ok Hang on the chopper visuals.<eos> He's out there.<eos> He's heading to Newark, 7 miles.<eos> Only 7 miles.
This is you, right?<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> That was unreal what you did last day.<eos> It's a real pleasure to meet you<eos> We got a drink after you, as soon as that happened.<eos> Ain't that right Manny?<eos> Yeah yeah, you did!<eos> The Sully!<eos> A shot of Grey Goose, with a splash of water.<eos> To January 15th!
Captain Sully Sullenbenger, the man who had almost no time<eos> Became a man for all time.<eos> Hey Sully, give me....<eos> Come on, answer...<eos> Larry, the CBR is in 2 days.<eos> How fast can you interfere?<eos> Sully?<eos> I know Airbus has simulations for A320 manifacturer, but that's next week.<eos> Can you get them to reschedule?<eos> On 3 in the morning?
Runway 13<eos> Let's get down nicely.<eos> *ALARM* Too low.<eos> Succesful landing at La Guardia.<eos> For the record: The pilot's and the computer's simulations made the same result.<eos> Second upload please, about the second run?<eos> Birds.<eos> Give me a heading in 3-1-0<eos> Heading 3-1-0.<eos> 1 thousand.
The pilot who landed at TeterBoro had 17 practice attempt, before the simulation we just witnessed.<eos> Your reaction-decision time is 35 seconds.<eos> 35 seconds is not our time.<eos> We only had 208 second total so....<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Upload link, return to La Guardia.<eos> Now we added 35 seconds to response time.<eos> Birds!<eos> Gas off.<eos> 35 seconds.
Let's try Teterboro.<eos> Upload the link please.<eos> Birds!<eos> Flight Director off.<eos> 35 seconds.<eos> Engine 1 and 2 fail.<eos> Let's see if we can make it.<eos> Way too low.<eos> *ALARM* Obstacle!<eos> Obstacle!
Lost both engines.<eos> Mayday Mayday, we lost both engines, we're turning to La Guardia.<eos> Okay you need to turn to La Guardia?<eos> Turn left at 220.<eos> Which engine did you loose?<eos> Both, both engines.<eos> Check those flight ignition.<eos> Ignition?<eos> Ignition.<eos> Thrust lighters.
Captain's 1549, it's gonna be runway 31.<eos> Unable<eos> Okay, where do you need to land?<eos> You've got 10 seconds Captain.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Captain 1549, runway 4 is available.<eos> I don't think we can make any runway.<eos> Anything in New Jersey, maybe TeterBoro?<eos> I'll be right side with TeterBoro Airport.<eos> La Guardia Departure?
- Sheriff, you gotta getdownhere.<eos> - We got an ID on her?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> No relation to Paul and Carol.<eos> - Who's she?<eos> - Well, for now, she's a Jane Doe.<eos> You got something?<eos> - Nothing was stolen.<eos> Not a scratch on the outside of the house either.
- Appears to be.<eos> - Subject appears to be in her mid to late 20s.<eos> Caucasian. Skin appears normal.<eos> No outwards signs of bleeding or bruising.<eos> No scarring, no distinctive external markings.<eos> Hair, brown.<eos> Eyes.. ...grey?<eos> You don't see clouding like that unlessa body'sbeendead fordays.<eos> There's no lividity.<eos> - No rigor mortis either.
It's -- this is peat.<eos> Haven't seen this stuff in ages.<eos> - It's under her toenails, too.<eos> - Yeah. There are trace amounts in the hair.<eos> She'scoveredin it .<eos> - Like, maybe she was buried in it?<eos> Where do you even find peat?<eos> - You buy it at a nursery.<eos> But naturally in the ground.. ...up north.<eos> Not around here.
Here, she has a molar missing on the lower left side.<eos> Take some impressions.<eos> - It's definitely some kind of fabric.<eos> - Bag it.<eos> Send it to the lab.<eos> No external seminal fluid present.<eos> Give me a swab.<eos> Ah,she'stornupinside.<eos> Thereareridges, groovesinthetissue.<eos> - Abrasions?
Deliberate.<eos> - Severed tongue, shatteredjoints vaginal trauma..<eos> The theory tracks.<eos> - We're barely out of the external.<eos> Wegotawaystogo .<eos> We'll now proceed with the internal examination starting with the heart and lungs.<eos> Help me with the block.<eos> - They're not supposed to bleed like that. Right?<eos> - I've seen it.<eos> But only on a fresh corpse.

Right?<eos> - I've seen it.<eos> But only on a fresh corpse.<eos> Anhourdead,maybetwo.<eos> It's caused by a build up of pressure.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Melanomamaybe?<eos> - On the inside?
From what?<eos> - Imagine all this internal trauma was reflected externally.<eos> Shattered ankles and wrists fire-burnedlungs, scarredorgans. What would she look like?<eos> - She'd be mangled.<eos> Disfigured beyond recognition but she's not.<eos> I mean, how the hell do you even do this?<eos> - If you wanna kill someone you shoot them or poison them or drown them.<eos> A million easy ways.<eos> You don't go to these lengths unless you wanna make them suffer<eos> what the --
Fuck!<eos> - I told her to come back for me.<eos> I told her to come back.<eos> - No, you didn't do this.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> All this is my fault.<eos> - You couldn't have known. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's what everyone told me.. ...about your mom.<eos> You know why i used to call her ray?<eos> Ray of sunshine.
- What the fuck?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - That's why we couldn't find cause of death.<eos> - She's still alive.<eos> - Alive?<eos> We lit her on fire.<eos> We took out her heart.<eos> - There's something, some energy.<eos> Callitwhatyou want, somethingiskeeping hergoing.<eos> - What the..
Sir?<eos> Are you ready for us?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> What are you guys so damn nervous about?<eos> The Brits are world class.<eos> We all know their reputation.<eos> But still, these are the trips I hate.<eos> Last minute.

Metropolitan Police will secure the perimeter of the funeral at St. Paul's Cathedral.<eos> Air Force One will land at Stansted Airport.<eos> On the ground it's all Mike.<eos> Touchdown.<eos> Then a 12-minute chopper ride to Somerset House.<eos> From there we take an armored-vehicle escort down Fleet Street to the cathedral.<eos> You don't seem thrilled.<eos> Well, the British have their hands full.<eos> It's a clusterfuck... Sir.<eos> Well, 40 different countries with 40 different security teams.
Yeah, I understand.<eos> Yeah, I promise.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Important matters of state?<eos> That was daughter number two.<eos> She didn't pass her driving test.<eos> Guess whose fault it is?<eos> Southpaw has arrived at destination.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
Made out of bourbon and bad choices, huh?<eos> Huh.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Take deep breaths.<eos> How many you think died?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A lot.<eos> All those innocent people.<eos> Dead, because of me.<eos> No, not because of you.
Huh.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Take deep breaths.<eos> How many you think died?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A lot.<eos> All those innocent people.<eos> Dead, because of me.<eos> No, not because of you.<eos> Because of them.
And we walked right into it.<eos> And all dead, bar your man and ours.<eos> What's happening on the ground?<eos> The terrorists have killed 19 first responders with another 30 unaccounted for.<eos> They're impersonating us.<eos> Our people are walking right into ambushes.<eos> Say the word, we go in.<eos> But make no mistake, we risk turning London into another Fallujah.<eos> That's the last thing we need, the President in the middle of an urban battle.<eos> Or the citizens of London.
Get this down you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm thirsty as fuck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mmm.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I was just thinking about my son.<eos> He sends me these jokes every day.<eos> It's kind of our... I don't know, our thing, or...<eos> A little off color.
I can't blow it yet.<eos> You're not out.<eos> We're not gonna get out unless you do!<eos> Just trust me!<eos> Now, God damn it!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Banning?<eos> Banning, do you copy?<eos> Has anyone found any sign of them?<eos> Nothing.
Eyes on the target.<eos> Easy.<eos> Eyes on the target.<eos> Be advised, multiple hostiles to the east.<eos> Target mobile.<eos> Target heading north.<eos> Alpha 1's now Bravo 1.<eos> He's mobile.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Out of the way.
Nobby!<eos> - In there.<eos> Nobby. Nobby, Nobby.<eos> Why are you so out of breath?<eos> - I've run all the way from home.<eos> - But you only live across the street.<eos> Do you remember me cousin, Digger?<eos> - What, the thief? - Yeah.<eos> Well, he was nicking coats... at a posh event, and you'll never guess who he saw.<eos> - Who?
- All aboard the 915, Grimsby to London.<eos> - In you go.<eos> Do you think our new parents will let us sleep in the same room?<eos> If we have bunk beds, can I have the top?<eos> You can have the top, little man.<eos> Go and have a pee now before the other passengers do.<eos> Okay, bruv.<eos> - And Sebastian...<eos> - What is it?<eos> Nothing.
- What is it?<eos> Oh, God, I'm cornered.<eos> I should never have come here alone.<eos> You're never alone in Grimsby, bruv.<eos> Lads.Lads.<eos> See those blokes out there?<eos> Those are Manchester United supporters.<eos> - How dare those twats show up here?<eos> - You delay them... I promise I'll burn your school down.<eos> - No school!
Looking like the guy from Despicable Me?<eos> England! England!<eos> English and German fans have been arriving here in Santiago...<eos> - ...throughout the last few days.<eos> - Looks like the perfect place... to watch your national team play for what is the greatest prize in football.<eos> - This is a truly international occasion.<eos> - We've seen Donald Trump.<eos> Star of stage and screen, Daniel Radcliffe is here.<eos> Middle East peace symbol Schlomo Khalidi... looking much better, is here too.<eos> So much color and noise.
Okay, I will scan for the chemical signature.<eos> - This is hopeless.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> Look who just sat down.<eos> Need to stop her before she sets off the virus.<eos> - Listen, let's go around the stadium.<eos> - We can't. There's not enough time.<eos> We need to go across the pitch.<eos> - Pitch invasion.<eos> - Too much security.
Nina!<eos> Nina!<eos> Nina.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> She's fine.<eos> Then let her go!<eos> We will.<eos> We just wanted to have a word<eos> You're not wearing your badges.<eos> No metal.
How did you leave things?<eos> Any hard feelings?<eos> Not likely.<eos> Everybody take a break.<eos> I wiped her mind of all memories of us.<eos> The beach, Cuba... that whole time.<eos> It was so long ago, Alex.<eos> Before the world knew about mutants.<eos> I felt it was the best thing for her.<eos> And for you?
How are you ever gonna get it out of here?<eos> Well, that's okay.<eos> I built a retractable roof into the basketball court.<eos> Hank, you're building a warplane down here.<eos> After what happened in Washington, I thought we were going to come back... and start the X-Men, like we all used to talk about.<eos> But...<eos> Charles wants students, not soldiers.<eos> And he thinks the best of people.<eos> He has hope.<eos> And you?
Isn't he always?<eos> Some of you spoke to the police... about what you believe you witnessed here yesterday.<eos> You want to know my powers... know who I am... see what I can do?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Think of the person you love most in your life.<eos> Your wife.<eos> Mother.<eos> Daughter.<eos> Now that person will know what it is to lose someone they love. And live with that pain.<eos> Forever.
- Welcome home.<eos> - This isn't my home.<eos> It was once.<eos> No, it was your home.<eos> I just lived here.<eos> And I barely even recognize it now.<eos> You know, I have plans for this place.<eos> I mean to turn it into a real campus.<eos> A university.<eos> Not just for mutants, either, for humans too.
Charles, get out of there.<eos> What's going on? What's happening?<eos> I think... Someone's taken over Cerebro.<eos> - They've taken control of it.<eos> - To do what?<eos> To connect.<eos> Always the same.<eos> And now, all this.<eos> No more stones.<eos> No more spears.

You never had the chance to save your family before.<eos> But you do now.<eos> That's what I've come here to tell you.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm your...<eos> I'm here for my family, too.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Auf Wiedersehen.
I think for now, I'm just gonna stick around here for a while.<eos> Me, too.<eos> The world's already begun rebuilding its arsenals.<eos> It's human nature, Charles.<eos> I still have hope.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> "Hope."<eos> I was right about Raven.<eos> I was even right about you.<eos> What about the rest of the world?
I'd recommend Colonel Moorcroft over at Fort Dyer where the high-security prisoners are confined, sir.<eos> Colonel?<eos> You're the assigned counsel for Major Susan Turner.<eos> I'm Jack Reacher, former commander of the 110th.<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna show up.<eos> Major Turner requested under no circumstances are you to be granted visitation privileges.<eos> - Why would she say that?<eos> - Maybe she read your file.<eos> "Anti-authority, anti-social..."<eos> - Anti-lawyer.
By one of our own.<eos> I'm gonna find out who did it.<eos> What were your guys doing over there?<eos> What were they looking for?<eos> Weapons.<eos> Thousands of weapons, decommissioned during the drawdown.<eos> Whole plane load's gone missing.<eos> Hey, I like your hat.<eos> - You a Nats fan?<eos> - Yeah, from the beginning.
This Reacher guy is interesting.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> They ran out of medals.<eos> So don't make this a competition.<eos> Too late.<eos> Sure you can handle him by yourself?<eos> I can handle him just fine.<eos> Prove it.<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Cream?
I see how it is.<eos> My dad was military.<eos> Really?<eos> Never met him.<eos> He left before I was born.<eos> Where was he stationed?<eos> Around D.C., I guess.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Candy won't talk about him.<eos> - Candy?
That's funny?<eos> You're not my father.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Well, why would you think you are?<eos> Because your mother filed a paternity suit with the Army claiming I was.<eos> All we have available is a lovely two-bedroom suite, $350 a night.<eos> Will that do?<eos> Yes. Can I pay in cash?<eos> So, we gonna take a DNA test?<eos> Little busy right now.
- Thanks.<eos> - I'm starving.<eos> Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> She's out.<eos> Our dinner date.<eos> Champagne is still chilling.<eos> I knew you were the romantic type.<eos> So, Reacher, after those phone calls, what exactly did you think would happen?<eos> I thought a nice dinner, maybe some wine.<eos> And after dinner?
- What do you mean?<eos> Why put huge government contracts at risk while selling U.S. Army weapons on the black market?<eos> Parasource is smarter than that.<eos> Yeah, they're smart all right.<eos> What about on our end?<eos> Didn't anybody check to see the crates were empty?<eos> Probably some dumb guy like me.<eos> We need to get inside one of those transports.<eos> Plane leaves Bagram every Friday at 0600 hours.<eos> Six hours to Frankfurt.
Mama.<eos> How does this story begin?<eos> It begins like so many stories<eos> With a boy... too old to be a kid... too young to be a man.<eos> And a nightmare.
Oh, Con, I was asleep.<eos> You should be in your own bed, Con.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> - Yes it is.<eos> - Come on, Con.<eos> - Just five minutes.<eos> I promise.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Night night.
I promise.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Night night.<eos> I respect that, Lizzie, I do.<eos> But the last thing your father would want would be for him to go to America... to live with some strange woman and her strange child.<eos> We have to discuss this now.<eos> - Hey, Con.<eos> - Ah, there's the little man.<eos> - Where did you say you got these?<eos> - From a very nice old people's home.
Or at least help me with my grandmother.<eos> All you want to do is tell me stories.<eos> Stories about how I toppled my enemies.<eos> Stories of how I slew dragons.<eos> Let me tell you a tale of when I came walking.<eos> Let me tell you of the end of a wicked queen... and how I made sure she was never seen again.<eos> Go on then.<eos> Good.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Nothing.
Now, how many of you know the saying:<eos> "Stick and stones may break my bones, but words can never touch me?"<eos> That way the next time someone says something to you just remember...<eos> Good, you're home.<eos> Your mum's upstairs.<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your father's flying in on Sunday.<eos> Dad's coming?<eos> From America?
I trust you alone here till your father shows up.<eos> I'm not five years old.<eos> This is the correct time.<eos> Not the one on your phone or on the computer, not even on the news.<eos> That was my mother's, your great grandmother's.<eos> Perfect timekeeping for over a hundred years.<eos> Conor!<eos> Pack up your rucksack.<eos> I don't want your father to think that I'm keeping you in a pigsty.<eos> - Not much of that.
Perfect timekeeping for over a hundred years.<eos> Conor!<eos> Pack up your rucksack.<eos> I don't want your father to think that I'm keeping you in a pigsty.<eos> - Not much of that.<eos> - No.<eos> When you go to the hospital, your father may not notice how tired you mother's becoming.<eos> So we have to make sure he does not overstay his welcome.<eos> Not that that's been a historically problem.<eos> No eggs.
Well, you wouldn't have that in America, Conor.<eos> There is barely enough room for the three of us.<eos> - I do not care.<eos> - Conor listen...<eos> - She's so strict.<eos> - Your family, your life, your friends...<eos> - Her house is like a museum.<eos> - Your school, all of it is here, okay?<eos> It would be unfair to take you out of here.<eos> Unfair to whom?
You can take him out of school then...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm looking for something to eat.<eos> You want something, kid?<eos> Stop calling me 'kid'.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I'm sorry, Lizzie.<eos> Who was that man in a suit?<eos> Just...<eos> Nothing.
- It is a nice lodgy brown.<eos> - Brown.<eos> - But we have brown here.<eos> - That's true.<eos> What can you see?<eos> What is that?<eos> What are those?<eos> What do you...<eos> What are these?<eos> - Eyes.
- Brown.<eos> - But we have brown here.<eos> - That's true.<eos> What can you see?<eos> What is that?<eos> What are those?<eos> What do you...<eos> What are these?<eos> - Eyes.<eos> - Eyes.
That's it.<eos> That's it, okay.<eos> Okay, so 30 minutes exam this morning... and this is all the stuff we've been doing for the last two weeks.<eos> So if you've done your revision, there will be no surprises.<eos> So in a moment I'm going to ask you to turn your pages over.<eos> There will be no talking for the next 30 minutes.<eos> I want total silence... because you are going to use your brains, not your mouths.<eos> So 30 minutes... Starting now. Good luck.<eos> I think I've finally figures you out.<eos> After all this time.
Wait, is not this...<eos> What is it?<eos> Hole in one!<eos> - Julian!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - I've scored a goal Did you see me?<eos> - Yes! You were amazing.<eos> - Take care!<eos> - This ice is very slippery.<eos> Type, mega hyper ice cream.
- Yes! You were amazing.<eos> - Take care!<eos> - This ice is very slippery.<eos> Type, mega hyper ice cream.<eos> But I'm getting better, right ?<eos> Ok Let's play later.....<eos> She wiped your butt again, right?<eos> And with a butt that size, that is a whole lot of wiped<eos> No one was wiped.<eos> No wipe...
But I fear that our lives will over before it begins.<eos> All right.<eos> I guess we are in.<eos> Crash and Eddie reporting for duty!<eos> Duty.<eos> Excellent!<eos> And the joke was good.<eos> But we'd better go soon because the time to impact<eos> Is 2 days, 4 hours, 1 minute and 16 seconds.<eos> 15 seconds... 14 seconds...
I admire your bloodlust, Gertie, but you heard:<eos> An asteroid is coming.<eos> This changes some things.<eos> Holy, It's freezing up here!<eos> Have parties tucking elsewhere.<eos> Could you stop acting like a parakeet?<eos> It's a good thing that you got your mother's eyes, Or you would be totally useless.<eos> That hurt.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Nothing...

"I lived honestly," "stealing"...<eos> A bit ironic, do not you think?<eos> Also, why kill the weasel If the asteroid is going to kill us?<eos> You look so good, but has almost no vision...<eos> If we prevent the weasel and his friends Of diverting the asteroid...<eos> It kills the weasel and eveyone else<eos> While we fly safety above it all.<eos> It will be our paradise!<eos> That does not seem very plausible.<eos> From a scientific view.

But how?<eos> The way we always get her do what we want<eos> We make her think it is her idea.<eos> You sneaky resourceful<eos> Let's just hope we have not lost our touch.<eos> Found it<eos> Re-hope mammoth<eos> A small preview of asteroid that's coming.<eos> A space rock.<eos> Fresh, straight from the cosmos.
This will never work.<eos> The ancients granted a safe passage.<eos> Sweet !<eos> The air feels... strange.<eos> Diego?<eos> What?<eos> Finally, we have super powers!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we walk into an electrical storm .<eos> I suggest staying away from trees.<eos> Of course! No problem.
It's not like we are in a forest.<eos> Mother Nature is in a bad mood lately.<eos> Good thing we all are here to help each other<eos> As I always say: "Stay close, stay alive!"<eos> There they are Right out in the open<eos> - How stupid can you be?<eos> - Come on, kids.<eos> Dive!<eos> Everyone ,Try not generate any source of friction.<eos> No friction.
Dive!<eos> Everyone ,Try not generate any source of friction.<eos> No friction.<eos> Got it!<eos> Beauty!<eos> What is friction ?<eos> No, no.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> - Harry, Granny!
- Buck?<eos> - Your space rocks!<eos> We can divert the asteroid with a magnet that size!<eos> That thing is enormous!<eos> - It's massaive, it's... - Can be impossible to get off the ground!<eos> It is entirly possible...<eos> In a way we don't know about yet.<eos> - But what about the dino birds?<eos> - And what about Granny?<eos> Nothing.

What?<eos> Are you talking to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I was saying that you are in...<eos> Oh, geez, this is gonna drive me nuts.<eos> Johnny!<eos> Get back here.<eos> You're in.<eos> Thank you, Daniel.<eos> Goodbye!
What, sit around playing video games?<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> Uh, it's a bucket?<eos> Yes, and do you know why I have this bucket?<eos> Because the roof is leaking?<eos> No, that's the bucket for the leak.<eos> I have this one because it belonged to my father.<eos> Every day for 30 years, he worked his tail off washing cars just so I could buy this place.<eos> Every day, Eddie.<eos> Just for me.
You can?<eos> Great!<eos> The kids?<eos> Yes, they're wonderful.<eos> Yeah, I have 25.<eos> No, I'm not joking.<eos> Um, but they're really no problem...<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Good night, Mommy.
I'll teach you everything I know.<eos> Follow me.<eos> These are the rehearsal spaces and dressing rooms and up here, we got workshops and the main office.<eos> Up in the air! Touch your toes!<eos> Awesome!<eos> Awesome?<eos> Yeah, I think the word you're after is "awful."<eos> And that's me restraining myself.<eos> There's not an ounce of talent between them.<eos> Not an ounce.
Oh, no, I've run over my dad.<eos> Now, that is more like it.<eos> And the three little pigs lived happily ever after.<eos> Good night, my dears.<eos> Norman, are you awake?<eos> How was your day, honey?<eos> Same as always.<eos> It was? Mmm-hmm.<eos> I don't know how you do it all, honey.<eos> Good night.
Hello!<eos> I work for a bank, not a charity.<eos> And if your accounts are not settled by the end of the month...<eos> Okay.<eos> Judith... I personally guarantee by the end of this month this show is going to be the biggest hit this city has ever seen!<eos> Mr. Moon, none of your shows have ever worked. None of them!<eos> You've had your chances.<eos> Now settle your accounts or we will repossess this property!<eos> Okay.<eos> Toodle-oo.
Oh, I am offended.<eos> Come on, baby, let's cut some rug.<eos> Oh! What the...<eos> How did that get there?<eos> Run for it, baby! Hey!<eos> Get him!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Don't let him get away!<eos> - Thanks, Derek!<eos> - Out of the way!
Yeah, Dad. I'm here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We got the call.<eos> Shipment's coming in.<eos> Tonight? Not tonight. Now.<eos> Meet us on the corner of Hector Street in two minutes.<eos> Stay here.<eos> We'll be back in exactly 37...<eos> Yeah, 37 minutes.
If you hadn't squealed to the cops, I wouldn't be in here right now.<eos> Honey, when are you getting out?<eos> I'm only gonna be in here for a few years.<eos> Well, where'd you hide the money?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Um, well, the thing is, I went to get gas...<eos> Don't lie to me!<eos> Um, I was at a rehearsal.<eos> Rehearsal?<eos> For what?
You got it, boss.<eos> Rosita!<eos> Super cool!<eos> You've, like, totally come back!<eos> Okay, Johnny, you follow them.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm ready. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Ash, you're...<eos> After Johnny.
I'm awake, I'm awake!<eos> Hey, Buster.<eos> Hey, Eddie.<eos> Man, where'd you go?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Listen, could you meet me at the corner of Dinsdale and Lemington?<eos> Now?<eos> Yeah, please.<eos> And could you... Ahem. Could you bring me a spare Speedo?<eos> Speedo?
Nine<eos> Benign<eos> Homecoming<eos> One<eos> Freight car<eos> Good morning, Soldier.<eos> Ready to comply.<eos> I have a mission for you.<eos> Sanction and extract.<eos> No witnesses.
I'm coming back for you in style, Minnie Ruth.<eos> Kiss Gloria for me.<eos> I miss you both so much.<eos> Jesse.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Missed you at practice this morning.<eos> Yeah. I, I had to cut up a frog for lab class.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about this afternoon?
Coach?<eos> There you go.<eos> What, what's this?<eos> An identity and registration card for the Ohio state legislature.<eos> All the pages there gotta have them.<eos> What's a page do?<eos> Takes home 60 bucks a month, plus expenses.<eos> All right.<eos> But what does he gotta do?<eos> Nothing.

His world record stands at 26 feet and two inches.<eos> Do you have a handkerchief I could borrow?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now he's just showing off.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record.<eos> Twenty-six feet, eight and one quarter inches!<eos> Twenty-six feet, eight and one quarter inches!<eos> Here you go.<eos> Mr. Jesse Owens sets a new world record with a time of 20.3 seconds!<eos> 20.3 seconds!

Congratulations.<eos> I respect their decision... but in all conscience, I can't be the one to carry it out.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> How about that, huh?<eos> Good evening, y'all.<eos> Evening.<eos> Jesse, this is Representative Davis of the Ohio State legislature.<eos> He's here on behalf of the NAACP.<eos> The What?
with his best wishes.<eos> All right.<eos> What's this about?<eos> I want to congratulate you on your many recent successes.<eos> I've been following them with great and particular interest.<eos> As all of us in our community have.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> And, uh, the Olympic trials, well, they're coming up soon.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> A little under five weeks.
Owens, Owens...<eos> He's done it!<eos> And Owens is through to the final!<eos> The men's broad jump final.<eos> German chancellor Adolf Hitler takes his seat for the event.<eos> And after a close-run qualifying round, the great athlete Jesse Owens of the USA faces up against Luz Long.<eos> Each competitor will have three attempts, with his best score determining the winner.<eos> Long's first jump. The reigning European champion.<eos> It's a white flag.<eos> 7.54 meters!

A foul from Long on his final attempt.<eos> But it means Owens has done it!<eos> He's secured a second gold medal of the games!<eos> That was a great match.<eos> Please, take your last jump.<eos> What's this?<eos> The competition is over, but the German Long seems to share the interest of the crowd here in Berlin, in seeing the best the amazing Owens has to offer.<eos> USA! This is the true spirit of sportsmanship we're seeing here between these two athletes today.<eos> The white flag is up!<eos> 8.06 meters!
I don't know if there's much difference deep down.<eos> Are you gonna get in any trouble?<eos> You made quite a scene today.<eos> They want to use us to prove something to the world.<eos> I'm happy to show them they're wrong.<eos> Believe me, I would have preferred to beat you, but it wouldn't have been for them.<eos> If they want to make these games a weapon, they can't complain when it's used against them.<eos> Maybe now they see how stupid it was to even try.<eos> You are entered for one more event, right?<eos> Uh, yeah. Uh, 200 meters.
- Doris?<eos> Doris, I'm, I'm Mohamed.<eos> - We drove here? - That's right, we drove here.<eos> I didn't know if you was in trouble somebody's after you, but I, I just wanted to help you.<eos> You asked me to help you.<eos> Youdidn'thurtme?<eos> I didn't put a hand on you.<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> No.
I'm sorry. - She's gonna call the...<eos> Your neighbor.<eos> She's, she looked right at my face.<eos> - Why did you go outside?<eos> - I don't know, I don't know!<eos> I thought I saw Charlie. Okay?<eos> What?<eos> I thought I saw him, but...<eos> I swear to god, I thought i saw him outside!<eos> - What?
If you actually cared about protecting my way of life? No.<eos> If I had other options.<eos> You bring a murderer into my home and ask me to risk my life, my freedom!<eos> Not just sheltering her, but taking you across the border?<eos> Why not north?<eos> Most of that border is just a wire fence.<eos> 'Cause they're gonna find us there, and you know that.<eos> I'm not askin' you to get us across.<eos> I'm just askin' you to get us to someone who can.<eos> Who?
A trickster.<eos> A shapeshifter who could change form... with the power of his magical fish hook.<eos> And his name... was Maui.<eos> But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble... giving birth to a terrible darkness.<eos> Maui tried to escape... but was confronted by another who sought the heart.<eos> Te Kā!<eos> A demon of earth and fire.<eos> Maui was struck from the sky... never to be seen again.<eos> And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti... were lost to the sea.<eos> Where, even now... 1,000 years later...
Only to men who fling Cokes.<eos> I love our country.<eos> And it's a good government.<eos> But anything good could be better, don't you think?<eos> Is Mom a communist?<eos> No.<eos> Am I?<eos> Well, why don't we give you the official test?<eos> Mom makes your favorite lunch.<eos> Ham and cheese.

Order! And the moment it does, God help us all! This is typical communist tactic!<eos> This is the beginning of an American concentration camp!<eos> Order!<eos> Uh, state your name, please.<eos> Arlen Hird. I'm a screenwriter.<eos> You understand, sir, that if you don't answer my questions, I can hold you in contempt of Congress?<eos> I didn't refuse yet, did I?<eos> Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?<eos> Well, I'd like to answer you, Congressman, but I need to consult with my physician.<eos> - Your physician?
- Better.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> But it simply lacks genius.<eos> Otto, if every scene is brilliant, your movie is going to be utterly monotonous.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> You write every scene brilliantly, and I will direct unevenly.<eos> What is it, dear?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, hello, Kirk.<eos> Merry Christmas.
That's just a shame.<eos> Is it?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Charles Darwin talks of evolution by natural selection.<eos> For our sake, let's hope he's wrong.<eos> Knife's gotta be as sharp as a razor.<eos> You hold the knife flush against the skin.<eos> And it's a scraping motion against the grain.<eos> Not a slicing motion.
Help, Ella!<eos> Ella!<eos> Help!<eos> You're too late.<eos> I already called the police.<eos> They know where I am!<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> That's not what your phone says.<eos> What are you gonna do to me?<eos> To you?
Why do not you fight?<eos> We probably were too disciplined and we waited for the order.<eos> Or are we simply scared.<eos> After a few months they themselves did not know how we became Red Army.<eos> Then the war started ...<eos> What about your family?<eos> Rudy, however, Oskar, Abram, Prohor ... They are my family.<eos> There are less and less.<eos> You're very similar.<eos> With who?

Brilliant advice.<eos> God.<eos> You caught Joe...<eos> He had Danny's phone, you brought him in, you interviewed him.<eos> He didn't resist.<eos> He is guilty.<eos> And the case against him is strong.<eos> The CPS never had any doubt about prosecuting.<eos> Doesn't he know what it's gonna do to Beth and Mark?<eos> To all of us?
- Yes?<eos> You can't imagine how the modesty of this young virgin is being put to the test by your offer.<eos> I...<eos> All my heart's aflutter.<eos> I feel faint.<eos> But all I can promise you today is this: come back in a week's time and I will give you a part of me that alone illustrates my beauty.<eos> Which part of your body will you grant me?<eos> A finger, Your Majesty.<eos> A finger?<eos> A finger...
- Okay.<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> If you don't have an appointment, there's not much I can help you with, ma'am.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sweetie, will you go sit...<eos> Sit over there, please?<eos> Okay. Look. I'm just gonna be very, very honest with you.<eos> I have reason to believe that my husband, who is an agent in the Seattle office, is in the area.<eos> Okay.<eos> - With another woman.
He was in here last week.<eos> Have you seen him at all?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he was with another guy.<eos> They were dressed like they were going to a funeral or something.<eos> Okay, now, did you happen to overhear anything,<eos> - like where they were going or...<eos> - No. - There was an accident.<eos> - I'm stoned a lot of the times.<eos> An accident where?<eos> Near Wayward Pines.
It is your house.<eos> As long...<eos> As you and your husband remember this is my town.<eos> What about Evans?<eos> I thought he was dead.<eos> I didn't see him for a decade.<eos> Then two years ago, I walk into the Excellent Bean.<eos> Just a normal morning.<eos> A-and there he is...<eos> At the counter.
- I do<eos> -You have to answer.<eos> -What if I don't believe in Satan?<eos> Or that all the works attributed to him are evil?<eos> -Oh just answer, will you?<eos> -I do.<eos> -What was that all about?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -She feels guilty about something.<eos> -Guilty?
-What are you a Marine?<eos> No, it's because you you meet the right person.<eos> And when you meet the right person you you go the distance.<eos> And let me tell you about the distance.<eos> Everybody changes.<eos> But if you're with the right person and they change you meet the right person all over again.<eos> -Well, Anne did get something right.<eos> I am seeing somebody.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> Who?
- Fettuccini Alfredo.<eos> - Yes! Yes. - I always liked that name.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Alfredo. - The little fettuccine.<eos> - Little-little feta.<eos> - Aw... - Um, all right.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> If... if I was an ironic rapper, this would be my name.<eos> - Ironic rapper.
A real old bitch.<eos> Oh, you're all class, Adrian.<eos> Youactivatedhowell.<eos> Now two of my toughguy assets are dead.<eos> I know what you're doing here. Don't fuck with my operation!<eos> Your operation is murder.<eos> This is the last time that you and I speak.<eos> I'm taking you down, yates. You understand me?<eos> That's pretty big talk for a middle-aged woman with a... what?<eos> A cell phone?
You're coming with me.<eos> No... No, I'm...<eos> I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on with me, okay?<eos> Who are you and what did they do with my girlfriend?<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you remember when you were arrested when you were 18 for the acid?<eos> That was when we first met.<eos> I was recruiting people for a program called wiseman.<eos> Which was basically designed to take third strike misdemeanor offenders and offer them the opportunity to volunteer.<eos> Volunteer?
Sit down.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> Roy, I'm a police officer.<eos> I'm going to tell you what I'm looking at.<eos> I'm looking at a young man. Who doesn't speak to his sister.<eos> Doesn't speak to his father.<eos> And is living in an abandoned building.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> You need to stop fighting everybody and find the real enemy, the person who made you feel exactly like him.<eos> A loser.
You need to stop fighting everybody and find the real enemy, the person who made you feel exactly like him.<eos> A loser.<eos> I have a very simple proposition for you, Roy.<eos> Let's go back to your bedroom, search your adolescence, even your childhood.<eos> Review all those moments that were ... weird.<eos> Weird?<eos> What do you mean weird?<eos> We're looking for someone in a hood, Roy. I hear voices.<eos> Where?<eos> Behind the door.
Look at this, please. You see this picture?<eos> I thought I knew her, I was sure that I knew her but it's an advertisement.<eos> Obviously. It's been up all over town. It's a drawing.<eos> Right? But ever since the case began, I've been thinking about her. I put her there.<eos> What if the regressions are the same thing.<eos> They're not memories.<eos> They're fantasies.<eos> - They're induced fantasies.<eos> - Induced by who?<eos> By us.

But as a scientist, I can't deny it.<eos> Name it.<eos> You have to give this a name.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> Did they agree what it is?<eos> Yes.<eos> We are going to publish.<eos> They...<eos> - With you?
Yes, with me.<eos> Together.<eos> That's so...<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You...<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> Yes.<eos> With you.
Give me home office.<eos> Respectability.<eos> Punctuality.<eos> - Punctuality, okay.<eos> - Punctuality.<eos> Give me being on time.<eos> That's the one, yeah.<eos> What do you do again, for a living?<eos> Photo...<eos> Photographer, yeah.
Leave a message.<eos> Dad, where are you?<eos> I snuck out.<eos> Mom will kill me, but so what?<eos> It's New Year's Eve.<eos> I thought we were gonna celebrate together.<eos> Anyway, call me.<eos> I wanna see you.<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> Happy New Year.

I didn't mean to...<eos> Of course not.<eos> Susan Harris.<eos> Midtown Property Solutions.<eos> Matt Murdock.<eos> She just curtsied.<eos> It was adorable.<eos> Well, it's nice to know chivalry isn't dead.<eos> Susan, would you mind walking me around the space?<eos> Of course. My pleasure.
The name's James Hook.<eos> - Happy?<eos> - No!<eos> Left foot in front of the other, put the right one in front of the other.<eos> That's it. It's called walking.<eos> Off you go. Go on.<eos> Smee.<eos> Well, go on, then. Carry on.<eos> - Smee. Down here! - Whoa.<eos> Six o'clock.
No.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Everything's gonna be all right!<eos> I knew we'd find the natives.<eos> We're saved.<eos> Please!<eos> I'm ready to go home now, please.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Good fair lady. We come in peace.<eos> And with treasure.
No!<eos> Can I tell you something, Peter?<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Yes, I will find her.<eos> No, you really, really won't.<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because I killed her.<eos> She died at my hand.<eos> By this very blade.
You should never have come back, Mary.<eos> And yet, here you are.<eos> Ready to die for them rather than live with me.<eos> No.<eos> Mary.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> She was a warrior.<eos> A great warrior.
I GOT SOMETHING BETTER.<eos> WHAT'LL YOU TWO LADIES HAVE?<eos> I'LL TAKE A CHAMPAGNE, PLEASE.<eos> - BOURBON FOR ME.<eos> - YES, MA'AM.<eos> - WHO ARE YOU?<eos> JEANNIE?<eos> NOAH.<eos> HOW'S THE BOSS TREATING YOU?<eos> OH, TOTAL SLAVE MASTER.
MAYBE ONE WITH A LITTLE LESS HAIR, BUT YEAH.<eos> SAME GUY, I HOPE.<eos> THEN I'LL BE THERE.<eos> I BELIEVE IN YOU, SAM.<eos> JUST DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.<eos> Executive Privilege.<eos> HI, THIS IS, UH, BOB FISHER CALLING BACK.<eos> UH, I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH, UH, WITH CLIO.<eos> Hi, Bob.<eos> Um, yes, Clio.
Right.<eos> YEAH, THAT'S FINE.<eos> SURE.<eos> WHEN?<eos> YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF WHAT POSSIBLE WISDOM I CAN IMPART TO THE BRIGHT YOUNG MINDS OF TOMORROW.<eos> AND I WAS GONNA SAY, "BE ANYONE YOU WANT TO BE."<eos> IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ATTORNEY, BE AN ATTORNEY.<eos> YOU WANT TO BE A BALLERINA, BE A BALLERINA.<eos> IF YOU WANT TO BE A FIREMAN, BE A FIREMAN<eos> OR AN ASTRONAUT OR A PLAYWRIGHT.
HUSH MONEY FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND?<eos> IT'S, UH -- IT'S A DONATION.<eos> YOU DON'T TREAT ME LIKE SOME STUPID SUBURBAN HOUSEWIFE, SAM.<eos> I OUTPACED YOU IN EVERY FUCKING LAW CLASS.<eos> I WAS EARNING A HIGHER SALARY THAN YOU UNTIL --<eos> FUCK ME.<eos> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.<eos> YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.<eos> YOU DON'T DO THIS KIND OF THING.<eos> NOT TO ME.
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Yo.<eos> I'm gonna go get a clear shot.<eos> Tyler!<eos> Emilio!<eos> He's coming your way!<eos> Chum!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Who are you here with, huh? Who are you here with?<eos> No one, primo.
Natalie is a half-match.<eos> I feel like the Maury Povich of bone marrow.<eos> Nobody ever gets that joke.<eos> So now what do we do?<eos> Well, we have to run a few more tests on Natalie to make sure she's strong enough for the donation.<eos> And then when April is ready for the transplant, we'll bring you back to Boston for the surgery.<eos> Surgery?<eos> Well, it's a surgical procedure where we withdraw liquid marrow from both sides of her pelvic bone.<eos> With what?<eos> Like needles?
I mean, he didn't invite us.<eos> Don't tell me you're nervous about meeting this mystery girl, whoever she is.<eos> So are you, like, having feelings for Dominic?<eos> You know, 'cause things with you and Leo are weird right now...<eos> No no. God, no.<eos> I just...<eos> I need something to fixate on...<eos> When I'm anxious in the middle of the night.<eos> And the middle of the day.<eos> - And morning.
Why do I keep surviving when really good people have to die?<eos> People with hopes and dreams.<eos> Jackson was gonna be on Broadway and Meg has always wanted to be a civil rights attorney, and now she might not make it.<eos> They knew how they wanted to leave their marks on the world and they don't get to do it.<eos> But I'm still here?<eos> You can't think like that.<eos> I just...<eos> I feel...<eos> I just feel so...<eos> Guilty.
It's just now that I know it's okay, I am like, "bring it on!"<eos> Okay, well, good, 'cause I brought you these condoms.<eos> Morgan left them at the apartment when she moved.<eos> Dude.<eos> Yeah, she loves Costco.<eos> Why can't you use them?<eos> Hmm, Graham's allergic to latex.<eos> Oh, how delicate.<eos> What do you guys use, flower petals?<eos> - Silk scarves?
Greer, is there a reason you missed half the class?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want to share that reason with me?<eos> Not really.<eos> Teacher: Then I'll see you after school - for detention.<eos> Where're you going?<eos> Getting some exercise.<eos> No tacos today?<eos> Aaron banned me from the interns.<eos> - Bummer.
Last time was easy.<eos> Let's just keep it that way.<eos> It's been a while since I've had easy.<eos> Easy sounds perfect.<eos> Well, want to have it again soon?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tomorrow night?<eos> Tomorrow night.
I don't have much of a choice.<eos> Well, I just didn't think you'd have to do so much of it... alone.<eos> Uh, you know, when April... Admitted to you all that she was sick, that... I imagined I'd be the one with you until she was cured, not living in San Francisco.<eos> No, you did what you had to do.<eos> Yeah, I did what I thought I should do.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> You having regrets?<eos> It's not easy seeing everybody move on without me.<eos> Just feeling...<eos> Unnecessary.
You were sound asleep The two of you.<eos> Take the Captain up to room ♪2 and settle him in<eos> We'll work out my account in the morning.<eos> That be alright?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That'll be just fine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Holy cow!<eos> We were in the Caribbean!<eos> With Pirates!
Which is exactly what you said about Castor, and look how well that turned out.<eos> Yeah, well, this is different.<eos> How so?<eos> Okay, don't judge me.<eos> Oh!<eos> I think that ship sailed long ago.<eos> When I first started out, I worked in daytime drama over at ABC.<eos> - Mm. - And I, um... I kind of had a thing with my boss.<eos> Really?<eos> Your boss?
Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?<eos> No, we're expanding the scope of the investigation a bit.<eos> You'll act as a liaison.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> They need an agent with tactical experience, like you.<eos> State Department is pulling an agent from the field that specializes in responding to escalated cartel activity.<eos> You'll be part of the team.<eos> You'll meet up with them at Luke, tomorrow?<eos> Day after.<eos> Early.
How you doing?<eos> Howdy!<eos> How you been?<eos> Good, buddy.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Well, when I pee, it burns.<eos> Maybe it's gonorrhea.<eos> What color is it?<eos> Yellow with red specks.<eos> Red specks or blood?
What I want is not to have to take any action.<eos> What kind of action?<eos> I don't wanna have to say, like, "Do you want to come back to the hotel?"<eos> I want them to say, "I am coming back to your hotel."<eos> You know, "Where is your hotel?"<eos> Mmm, that would be easier for you, wouldn't it?<eos> Yeah. I can't stand to look like I'm actively trading off this sexually, which, of course, I'd be happy to do, but I think, in retrospect, I'm probably very lucky that I didn't.<eos> Mmm, lucky, why?<eos> It just would've made me feel lonely, you know.<eos> Lonely? How so?
-Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Um, do me a favor. Leave the door open for the dogs.<eos> They like to wander from room to room at night.<eos> If the door is closed, they, like, eat it to get through it if they have to.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> - Um, okay, yeah. - Um...<eos> Okay, good night.<eos> - Good night.
If something sells really well<eos> -and gets a lot of attention... -Right.<eos> - ...it's got to be shit, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> The ultimate irony is, if your thing starts selling well, it gets a lot of attention. The very mechanism you use to shore yourself up<eos> -when your thing didn't sell well...<eos> -it doesn't work anymore.<eos> - It's now part of the darkness nexus...<eos> -Of course.
Darwin, it's thanks to that chemistry you can talk.<eos> And you're proud of your parents?<eos> It was a failed experiment.<eos> I was supposed to be invulnerable but I'm not.<eos> This time, unless we've slipped up somewhere, we have created<eos> the Ultimate Serum.<eos> The Ultimate Serum.<eos> All forms of life will be invulnerable.<eos> Illness, old age, and death will be things of the past.<eos> Mere memories.
I wanted to be here so I could surprise you, but now it's spoiled.<eos> This isn't the reunion I'd planned.<eos> This is a wonderful reunion, Grandpa.<eos> Pops.<eos> It's Pops.<eos> Did you forget?<eos> Mmm.<eos> How did you know where to find me?<eos> This tree was a secret.<eos> A secret between me and your father.
See, I'm just, just trying to teach you the thing that really counts... how to be me.<eos> I know that.<eos> And I'll do better.<eos> Oh!<eos> There's news! I buried the lead.<eos> You four have been chosen to go to a different school...<eos> In Auradon.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not going to some boarding school filled to the brim with prissy pink Princesses!<eos> And perfect Princes. Ugh.
What?<eos> I'm not going to some boarding school filled to the brim with prissy pink Princesses!<eos> And perfect Princes. Ugh.<eos> Yeah, and I don't do uniforms.<eos> Unless it's leather. You feel me?<eos> I read somewhere that they allow dogs in Auradon. Mom said they're rabid pack animals who eat boys who don't behave.<eos> Woof! -Yeah, mom, we're not going.<eos> Oh, you're thinking small, Pumpkin.<eos> It's all about world domination.<eos> Knuckleheads!
I know that.<eos> You know that.<eos> Why?<eos> - It's not true.<eos> - Don't lie to me, Rhodri.<eos> - I am not lying. - Tell me the truth.<eos> - It IS the truth!<eos> - Where were you on the night of the fire?<eos> ! - I was with someone!<eos> Who?
You know that.<eos> Why?<eos> - It's not true.<eos> - Don't lie to me, Rhodri.<eos> - I am not lying. - Tell me the truth.<eos> - It IS the truth!<eos> - Where were you on the night of the fire?<eos> ! - I was with someone!<eos> Who?<eos> A woman.
Okay?<eos> Look, I know it takes two to tango, but my dancing shoes are currently out for repair.<eos> - Sir, I'm sorry if I...<eos> - Apology not needed.<eos> Just know I'm working my way through a maze of personal fire, and until the flames of chaos subside, I'm just not ready for public consumption.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Have a great stay.<eos> It's not just me, right?<eos> I mean, she was relentless.<eos> Relentless.
Maya, Maya, you get back...<eos> Maya.<eos> Paul?<eos> I catch you at a bad time?<eos> I want you to meet the wife.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you, yeah.<eos> - Are you here with your wife?<eos> - Daughter.
What?<eos> There's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!<eos> What?<eos> I said, there's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!<eos> Considering there's a blizzard goin' on, whole lotta' fellas walkin' around, wouldn't you say, major?<eos> Considerin I'm one half of them fellas, yeah... Seems to be a lot of 'em.<eos> This changes things, son.<eos> Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger. But with a partner, eighteen's a whole lot better.<eos> You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'?<eos> Or her?
- Yeah.<eos> Five of you?<eos> Well, well, well, looks like minnie's haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.<eos> Yes it does.<eos> Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?<eos> The Lincoln what?<eos> The letter from Abraham Lincoln?<eos> President Abraham Lincoln?<eos> - Weren't you pen pals?<eos> - With the president?
I damn will guarantee that too.<eos> Yeah Warren, that's the problem with old men.<eos> You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's a accident, but ya' can't just shoot 'em.<eos> Gentlemen, since we may be trapped here, close together like for a few days, may I suggest a possible solution?<eos> We divide minnie's in half.<eos> The northern side and the Southern side.<eos> With the dinner table operating as a neutral territory.<eos> We could say that the fireplace side of the room, acts as a symbolic representative of...<eos> Georgia while the bar, represents...<eos> Philadelphia!
That's what Christopher Columbus said.<eos> Except he discovered America, not jail.<eos> If he'd thought so, he'd have been a gondolier.<eos> Hi kids.<eos> What a pretty boat.<eos> You like chocolates?<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Here. Stop that.<eos> What's that? Stop.<eos> - Chocolates?
- Here. Stop that.<eos> What's that? Stop.<eos> - Chocolates?<eos> Want some.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Inspector Pierre Bonny.<eos> National police. What do you want?<eos> Do you know what your husband does?<eos> Business.
My father killed himself.<eos> He put a bullet in his own head.<eos> He wanted to be French.<eos> To forget our origins.<eos> He went to mass every Sunday.<eos> When they locked him up, he lost everything.<eos> He was a dentist in Neuilly.<eos> And...<eos> For others, he was just father of the cheat.<eos> A foreigner, too.
How's that?<eos> I have an ID card, a military record,<eos> I pay my taxes like everyone else!<eos> You have to have a private mansion in Saint Cloud for 5 generations?<eos> I'll call Chalamont and remind him of his promises.<eos> He said it would be a formality.<eos> How much is formality?<eos> The winds have changed, Sacha.<eos> They owe me their jobs.<eos> Sometimes their careers. Often their mistresses.
Ah, OK.<eos> Who is "Mr. Maurin"?<eos> Maurin.<eos> You see, there's nothing to gain by being me.<eos> You destroyed me, sir!<eos> If I were a cynic, I'd say don't gamble.<eos> - How much have you lost?<eos> The casino and the market are the only slaughterhouses where sheep are happy to be shorn.<eos> Here. 50,000.<eos> Merry Christmas.
My cases are scattered to the winds, 126 people lose their jobs.<eos> What happens to your cronies in the mailroom? The assistants, paralegals, the janitorial staff all of them out on the street.<eos> Your friend Kim, a promising career, over and done with.<eos> Hamlin owes you everything.<eos> You built that place singlehandedly while he was at Four Hills working on his bunker shot.<eos> - Let's not exaggerate.<eos> - You helped. All the more reason not to tear it down just for a little bit of cash.<eos> Chuck, I'm going under. Okay?<eos> For the third time, with these bull-crap contract counsel...<eos> - Bull crap?
Now the fact you turning into a animal... if you fail to fall in love with someone during your stay here... is not something should upset you or get you down<eos> Just think as a animal... you have a second chance to find a companion<eos> But even then you must be careful You need to choose a companion that is similar type animal... to you<eos> A wolf and a penguin can never live together<eos> Nor a camel and a hippopotamus<eos> That would be absurd, think about it<eos> I understand this discussion is a little unpleasant for you<eos> But it is my duty to prepare you... psychologically for all possible outcomes<eos> Now have you thought of what animal you like to be if end up alone?<eos> Yes, a lobster

"I hope catch some loners today"... she said<eos> "And I hope you catch lots too"<eos> She then told him that if she didn't... find suitable partner soon She was going to kill herself by jumping from one of room windows<eos> 320, maybe<eos> Or one higher up, 480, that would be even better<eos> When she stop talking He stare at her blankly, not knowing what to say<eos> Him then look out of the woods, thought once more... how good his excuse's been<eos> Not bad, a bit higher<eos> You thought about what animal you wanna be if you don't make it?<eos> A lobster
I have something to tell you<eos> His nose doesn't really bleed on its own<eos> He bangs it against the wall or piece of hard wood, or something like that<eos> Or he cut it with pen knife when you're not looking<eos> You two are not suited<eos> Shut up<eos> Dad, tell him to leave, I'm sleepy<eos> And I'm quite sure that stain on his T-shirt isn't blood... but cherry juice or tomato ketchup, or red water color paint... or something like that, or beetroot juice<eos> Do you love her?<eos> With all my heart
And then it sort of dawned on me.<eos> They only want what's best for Callie. Because they love her.<eos> And when she called him her father yesterday, seeing how he lit up and...<eos> And how devastated he was that he upset her, he had a panic attack, for God's sake.<eos> I just...<eos> I just think he deserves a chance to get to know her a little better before all this is decided.<eos> - Hi. - Um...<eos> - I didn't know you were...<eos> - Stef stopped by to talk about...<eos> Yesterday.
- Is that what you did?<eos> Having a fit. I don't...<eos> - [laughs]<eos> Hey, we're out in the wilderness, right?<eos> Aren't we?<eos> We get a little wild ourselves?<eos> Little... [growls] [both growling playfully]<eos> - [barks] Dog...<eos> - What are you guys doing?<eos> Oh, nothing.

~ Je m'appelle Hilda Pierce.<eos> ~ And you've spoken to Mr Caplin?<eos> ~ Yes. We spoke for some time.<eos> But I still don't know why I'm here.<eos> You're here because you speak fluent French, you lived in Paris for a while.<eos> ~ I understand your father is French.<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> You've got a first-class degree from Oxford, in mathematics.<eos> And I believe you could be very useful to us.<eos> In what way?
Occasionally.<eos> ~ Bottom left.<eos> ~ Oh. Right.<eos> I don't think I ever really did live here.<eos> ~ I think I only came here to sleep.<eos> ~ Those were the days.<eos> ~ Were they?<eos> ~ We were part of history.<eos> What we achieved - the SOE - will never be forgotten.<eos> ~ But at what cost?
Corrigan!<eos> Come on!<eos> After him!<eos> ~ Go round the front!<eos> ~ Righto!<eos> He's inside, sir.<eos> We've got all the exits covered.<eos> ~ Caplin?<eos> ~ He's all right, sir.<eos> ~ And what about him?
~ Good thinking.<eos> So it means I'm going to be rather busy for a while.<eos> Well, I do understand.<eos> I don't like to leave you on your own.<eos> Well, I might be OK.<eos> I don't know about the rest of the country, but...<eos> I'd really like it if you'd be the godfather.<eos> Honoured.<eos> ~ Thank you.<eos> ~ A pleasure.
No, I'm only a woman.<eos> Now, why should you pay any attention to what I have to say?<eos> Women are only fit to... to do as they're told and obey orders.<eos> If ye'd done that, we wouldn't be on the run now with a hundred Redcoats on our tail.<eos> Try that again, and I'll slap you until yer ears ring.<eos> You're a brute and a fool!<eos> Do you think I went and got captured by the English on purpose?<eos> Aye, I do think ye did it on purpose to get back at me for what happened at the glade.<eos> At the glade?<eos> With the British deserters?
I'll see to the packing.<eos> I'll meet you in the glade later tonight.<eos> Flee my own house?<eos> Like a thief in the night?<eos> - I won't have it. - Open this door now!<eos> This is official business!<eos> We demand to see mistress duncan right away.<eos> Open up! Mistress!<eos> Dougal will never allow anything to happen to me.<eos> To us.
Are you kidding?<eos> I know.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> I have no money.<eos> This is so awesome. I really just... my life is so abundantly full of blessings, gifts and joys.<eos> We're gonna have a blast. We're going to be roomies!<eos> You were supposed to leave for Detroit.<eos> We're gonna share stuff, like... like stories, first of all.<eos> We're gonna share stories, uh, sweatshirts.<eos> Maybe not that one.

My dad was a ghost.<eos> Beatrix had to cancel her college plans to take care of him.<eos> And I just split.<eos> I was just hoping that maybe in this world, maybe things were a little bit better.<eos> But, you know, there is no other you in this world.<eos> Lucky him.<eos> You're gonna have to get used to the déjà vu.<eos> Some worlds are gonna be really, really different.<eos> And then some worlds are very weirdly the same.<eos> How much the same?
I wanted that for you, man.<eos> 'Cause what's better than having your best friend as your boss?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Now then...<eos> I mean, I would have gotten away with everything.<eos> But now...<eos> I mean, you get me, man.<eos> You know?<eos> You allow me to be me in the workplace.<eos> -Useless slacker.
-Yeah.<eos> -Now then...<eos> I mean, I would have gotten away with everything.<eos> But now...<eos> I mean, you get me, man.<eos> You know?<eos> You allow me to be me in the workplace.<eos> -Useless slacker.<eos> -Exactly.<eos> -Worthless.
Awesome Amanda.<eos> Dating me is like dating a dude.<eos> - It's really great.<eos> - Never heard anyone say that.<eos> It's not like I was expecting a fucking proposal, okay?<eos> And this may not have occurred to you, but it was actually really difficult for me to even say the "L" word, and please, do not make a lesbian joke right now.<eos> That seems inappropriate.<eos> I wouldn't have done that.<eos> You always make lesbian jokes.<eos> Not in front of lesbians.
-Okay, okay, I get it.<eos> I get it.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> Great idea.<eos> -He's still a fucking asshole.<eos> -Did you guys really not notice?<eos> He turned me day one.<eos> I've been a vampire this whole...<eos> I-I chased you through the cubicles.<eos> Last night?
Meeting's canceled.<eos> Go. Go. Go, go, go, go.<eos> Say what you want about Elaine, she always did stock the shit out of the supply closet.<eos> Bam-snap!<eos> That's growing on me.<eos> What?<eos> -Bam-snap!<eos> -Yeah!<eos> Today, we become men.<eos> -Or vampires.

The audience must always feel you are in control.<eos> Stop trying so hard!<eos> Do nothing.<eos> Do it again.<eos> Where's your respect?<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> But you said to do nothing!<eos> Do nothing on the outside.<eos> On the inside, in your heart, you must salute.<eos> "In my heart?"
Completely absurd.<eos> It's not real.<eos> These towers, they have no scale!<eos> They just rise and never stop.<eos> It's not human!<eos> It's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's finished.<eos> What's finished?<eos> -The coup! My dream!
-No.<eos> We must accomplish the coup this summer.<eos> The towers are almost built.<eos> We are running out of time.<eos> I need you to help me pull this off.<eos> Think if we succeed.<eos> This could be the most audacious<eos> -work of art that has ever been done!<eos> -Audacious?<eos> Audacious?
I have no idea who he is.<eos> I've never seen him again.<eos> And I can only imagine what he must have thought.<eos> Now it's time for me to put on my costume.<eos> But I have to do this privately, so my dressing room is the very ledge of the building.<eos> Not visible from the streets of Manhattan.<eos> The dressing room is also something that Papa Rudy taught me.<eos> This is where the transformation takes place.<eos> This is where the disguised impostor, the intruder, becomes the performer.<eos> The artist.
the nurse.<eos> And just shadows and...<eos> and... and voices, and then I...<eos> I passed out.<eos> And as soon as you awoke, you became part of...<eos> The First Generation.<eos> But there were more of these.<eos> these, uh... these chambers, and they were all... they were all filled with...<eos> Filled with what?<eos> With people.
- Herjewelry is still with her mother<eos> - In the bank locker<eos> What about my humiliation?<eos> Who pays for that?<eos> Sandhya, that's not how you speak to your parents<eos> They also want your good Say sorry<eos> Stop stirring up my daughter.<eos> We educated her<eos> She wants sister to apologise<eos> - To whom?
Would I have slept with your wife without being paid?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Calm down, Hakan!<eos> I've been in lots of trouble and violence isn't the way.<eos> One minute you kiss me, the next you have a fiancee!<eos> Now what?<eos> Will you invite me to your wedding to really humiliate me?<eos> Carla!<eos> Was it you?<eos> You... and my sister?
Bring Xiaomian here.<eos> Master, it is exactly as Madame guessed.<eos> Huji is pregnant.<eos> She faked her period with chicken blood.<eos> Commander Tian Xing will leave.<eos> When it gets dark, go after him.<eos> - What news?<eos> - Tian Xing has left the staging post.<eos> They took a fork in the road.<eos> With Commander Tian?
Doesn't matter.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Sh...<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll be gentle.<eos> Don't be gentle.<eos> Like that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Oh, whoa!
- Everyone is struggling in this economy.<eos> Everyb...<eos> But your sister's a special case.<eos> Promotion after promotion.<eos> It's insane.<eos> - How'd it go with Gorbachaka? - Ooh.<eos> What?<eos> How do... You know about that?<eos> You know, your mother and I met on a blind date.<eos> But with different people.
Tom Sawyer, this is Limelight. You, me, Frank, and Sophie are going to the beach. Let's go.<eos> Wait, you're willingly going to the beach?<eos> The man who once complained about the beach because it had too much sand?<eos> I'm a beach guy now. Things are shifting over here.<eos> As much as I'd love to, I don't think I can go. There's something I got to take care of first.<eos> Okay.<eos> I definitely want to see you before you get on that plane, though.<eos> All right, man.<eos> Okay.<eos> Godspeed.
It's Fart City, USA, in our living room.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> It's fun having everybody around.<eos> It's like a big soap opera.<eos> I like it too. I just... I need to be able to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Cause it's like, all day.<eos> Yeah, you need to go out and go to a nice restaurant...<eos> - Exactly, thank you for doing this.<eos> - With your amazing husband.

Shit, man, I should go.<eos> I got a doctor's appointment...<eos> Doctor's appointment?<eos> This shit's starting to get real, right?<eos> Yeah, man, really real.<eos> Pretty exciting time, hold on, man.<eos> What?<eos> You think I'm gonna get it on you?<eos> - Get what?<eos> - My bad luck?
Congratulations.<eos> You're about to have the best night of your life.<eos> You will learn valuable lessons, be filled with Christmas cheer... and probably get laid.<eos> We will release the location of our party at 10 p.m.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Yeah, I know, Ma.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have to stay here and work hard.<eos> How you think I'm having such an amazing season?<eos> I love you too.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Yeah, I know, Ma.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have to stay here and work hard.<eos> How you think I'm having such an amazing season?<eos> I love you too.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Bye.<eos> What's up, fellas?<eos> How's it going, man?<eos> Good to see you, baby.<eos> Merry Christmas.
- Totally, yeah.<eos> The thing I'm working on now... you really have to listen to it start to finish. It's a concept album.<eos> What's the concept?<eos> I'm still conceptualizing that part of it...<eos> - but it's all about who you know...<eos> - C-Rob, will you sign this?<eos> - ...more than anything.<eos> - Wait up, wait up.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, merry Christmas.
- ...more than anything.<eos> - Wait up, wait up.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, merry Christmas.<eos> - Photobomb!<eos> - There you go.<eos> All right.<eos> That just happens now?<eos> People love C-Rob.<eos> So how about Diana?
It's crazy!<eos> Say hey to Ethan!<eos> He looks really great!<eos> Let's go outside and Instagram.<eos> My social media game is on point!<eos> - That guy's really famous now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Super famous.<eos> So good seeing you guys!<eos> Merry Christmas.
Shit. Are you going to the Nutcracker Ball?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're going too.<eos> - You are? - Isn't that crazy?<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> Your last Christmas... and you get to go to the big dumb party you've always wanted to go to.<eos> You bringing anyone?<eos> To the dumb party?<eos> - Any guys?
We're going too.<eos> - You are? - Isn't that crazy?<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> Your last Christmas... and you get to go to the big dumb party you've always wanted to go to.<eos> You bringing anyone?<eos> To the dumb party?<eos> - Any guys?<eos> - Me?<eos> Yeah, I'm bringing these two guys... that I'm kind of dating.<eos> With really huge dicks.
You look like a crack rock.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> - No, just walk normal, please.<eos> - I'm walking normal.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Don't put it there, Isaac.<eos> And it's gone.<eos> Hi. Merry Christmas.
I would have if I'd known it was you, maybe.<eos> Oh, shit! Are you guys a couple?<eos> - No, no. We're friends.<eos> - Am I the third wheel?<eos> No, no.<eos> You're the first wheel.<eos> - Am I the third wheel?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Honestly, I was with two other guys all night and now I'm in a fight with them....<eos> Oh, really? Two other guys?
Nice.<eos> Don't do my dad doggy-style.<eos> He's got very bad knees.<eos> He's an old man now.<eos> All right.<eos> - Hey. - Yo.<eos> I kind of wanna kiss you... but maybe not so soon after saying I would do your parents.<eos> Come have sex with my mother and my father.<eos> I thought you were saying, "Come have sex."<eos> With my mother and also my father.
- They're all whores.<eos> I will give you some food as well.<eos> If she comes tonight, for example, I will be able to give her some rice.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> - You are turning me down? - Yes, sir.<eos> Promotion, money, food, all for an hour or two with a whore and you are turning it down?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where were you on the list?<eos> Where were you on that list?<eos> - Twenty-third.
A, C and E men to watch a flogging.<eos> No food until it is over.<eos> Stubby. Stay close to me, say nothing.<eos> A, C and E men to watch a flogging.<eos> No food until it is over.<eos> Letters...<eos> I'm going to need your help.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> A, C and E men to witness a flogging.<eos> With me now.
Yes, private?<eos> Major Ross told me to give you this.<eos> He did it, then? Yes, sir.<eos> He did it.<eos> It will not come to it.<eos> When he is standing on the scaffold, hood on his head, noose around his neck, I will offer him a reprieve, so long as he agrees to live without that woman.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will snatch at it.<eos> They are bound by solemn vows, woman.<eos> Solemn vows.
Yes.<eos> - I gave you my food. - Yes.<eos> I need it back.<eos> Oh, James.<eos> What?<eos> You have turned informer.<eos> I have not.<eos> - I can explain.<eos> - You can explain it tonight.<eos> To us all.
Yes, boss.<eos> It is true?<eos> I did it to feed my own children, boss.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Yes.<eos> What would you do for them?<eos> I would sacrifice my life for them.<eos> Of course.<eos> But would you sacrifice your reputation?<eos> Respect?
It is true?<eos> I did it to feed my own children, boss.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Yes.<eos> What would you do for them?<eos> I would sacrifice my life for them.<eos> Of course.<eos> But would you sacrifice your reputation?<eos> Respect?<eos> Honour?
Yes...<eos> I think you should ask the governor for a gun.<eos> Mary.<eos> What?<eos> - You have been speaking to someone.<eos> - I have not. - You have, that is so unlike you.<eos> You know that God himself will protect us.<eos> We have no need of guns.<eos> - And to whom have you been speaking?<eos> - No-one.
~ With the e?<eos> ~ Ripe.<eos> ~ Ripe.<eos> Shall we try words ending in "n"?<eos> Yes.<eos> What time?<eos> Erm, eight o'clock?<eos> Good. Pip and pipe.<eos> Rip and ripe.<eos> With the "e".
With the "e".<eos> Tripe.<eos> Tell your children how you felt when you gave birth to them.<eos> M-E-N.<eos> Men.<eos> And one more.<eos> Something you write with?<eos> Mrs Johnson?<eos> Yes?<eos> And with the "e".
You just remembered.<eos> No matter how miserable life is, there are always a few seconds of bliss - those few seconds between the waking up and the remembering.<eos> Yeah?<eos> ~ Yes. ~ Yeah.<eos> Company! Advance!<eos> March!<eos> Left! Left! Left!<eos> Right!
Has one even made it into the final four?<eos> Twice in 13 seasons,<eos> But there's only one way they make it that far.<eos> Don't say what i think you're about to say.<eos> Honey, believe me, it pains my black soul,<eos> But you deserve the truth.<eos> Omarosa.<eos> Nene leakes.<eos> You've got to go big, okay?<eos> Loud and highly opinionated.
I can't see his smug face when he sees that I have failed again.<eos> I just can't, okay?<eos> I can't.<eos> Okay, if I do this for you, I need you to do something for me.<eos> Yeah, anything.<eos> I need a kiss on this date, okay?<eos> I don't care who it's with, but I want you to do it in front of the other girls.<eos> That's really what you want?<eos> That's what I really, really want.<eos> Tongue or no tongue?
She's super smart, working the race card on the way out.<eos> She's gonna get crazy press.<eos> She's gonna do the talk-show circuit.<eos> [Gasps] She might even work it into her own show.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Yeah, that's the game, right?<eos> She'll be a real hero for my people.<eos> Have you seen Adam?<eos> No, he went off with Chet awhile ago.<eos> Chet?
It's okay.<eos> But I have Lizzie now.<eos> We've got a life together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got it.<eos> - Hey, Rach?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Be careful with this guy.<eos> You know, think it through.<eos> What guy?
Faith.<eos> Hey. Nice job, lady.<eos> How did you get him to pick Faith?<eos> That's some toddler-level reverse psychology.<eos> Yeah, I told him to cut Faith, - and so he picked her. - Aww.<eos> You know, who knew horse-face was gonna be a crowd favorite?<eos> So let's give them some hard-core Americana.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Okay, so I was thinking about a sweet, little mini rodeo followed up by a church dance...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay. All right, Adam, the thing is... I'm a virgin.<eos> And I'd like you to be my first.<eos> Wow, Faith.<eos> That is - that's such an honor.<eos> I-It is, right?<eos> - Yes, of course. - Yeah. Um...<eos> Can you excuse me for just a second?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> Rachel, are you kidding me?<eos> - Her first?
- Why'd you come back?<eos> - I wanted to see you.<eos> Maybe we should postpone the wedding.<eos> - This is about Rachel.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - Mary's a freaking robot. - I'm surprised she can feel anything with all the mood stabilizers she's on.<eos> My doctor told me never to mix this with this, but I feel amazing.<eos> - Mm. - Mary: So excited.<eos> I get to see my little girl, and she gets to meet Adam.<eos> My sister.
Can you imagine living with that?<eos> She said she tried to leave him many times, even before he hurt the little girl.<eos> But he said he'd find her and kill her.<eos> Well, I mean, she... she never really talked about Kirk with me.<eos> It's not the sort of thing<eos> - you bring up on a date. - Right, totally.<eos> So, ah, do you think that Kirk coming here...<eos> I mean, that was the reason that Mary chose to end things?<eos> You mean when you brought Kirk here and ambushed him with his...<eos> - with his wife and daughter?
No, it's not fine.<eos> I'm not fine.<eos> Yesterday, you were begging me to run away with you, and six hours later, you say you changed your mind.<eos> Something happened and I really want to know what it is, Adam.<eos> Look, Rachel, okay, we...<eos> We can talk about this, but another time.<eos> I have to go to a wedding right now...<eos> My wedding.<eos> I have to honor that.<eos> Honor? !
It's super weird, but you know Quinn.<eos> She's doesn't like to linger on feelings or anything.<eos> How about you?<eos> Lingering?<eos> My specialty.<eos> - Got it. - Yeah.<eos> You know, she wants a little romance to cleanse the palate.<eos> - Oh, I can do that.<eos> - Not me, Romeo.<eos> Them.
You need to let us do our job, Lindy.<eos> That girl today?<eos> She'd still be alive if you had done your job.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> I know you're angry.<eos> Look, I'm angry, too.<eos> Ben and I were friends long before we were cops.<eos> Our families grew up together.<eos> You know the look his mother gave me at his funeral?<eos> Regret.
You see it?<eos> What?<eos> (Typing) Empty parking spot here.<eos> Camera pans off, and now, the parking spot is filled...<eos> Giving him enough time to enter in the back of the spa.<eos> It's his car.<eos> I know it's his car.<eos> Yaeger, listen.<eos> Alibi or not, I wanna continue the tail on Reese Hennessy.<eos> Yeah, and Jake Bolin.
It's the NYPD.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Tommy?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What am I supposed to think?<eos> Pulling out someone's teeth sure isn't a great character trait.<eos> He feels powerful, arrogant, but sometimes it's not about power.<eos> Sometimes it's about the desire to be understood.<eos> By who... me?
My Perficio.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I know why he's killing them.<eos> Perficio.<eos> He wants me to understand why he's choosing his victims.<eos> Julia Becker hated her teeth.<eos> Come on, one smile.<eos> They were crooked, but she hated the dentist more, so she never smiled.<eos> So, her killer pulled them out, carefully cleaned out her mouth... made it perfect.<eos> - Some perfect.
Cell phone records, security footage, GPS logins, and see if there are any patterns.<eos> This might be the only time Hamish tries something like this.<eos> We grant him a permit on one condition.<eos> We control the venue.<eos> I know just the place.<eos> Are you out of your thin blue minds?<eos> New York magazine just listed IRL under the "What's Hot" column.<eos> I mean, how long do you think that will last when they find out that the NYPD is skulking around every corner?<eos> They're called undercover cops for a reason.<eos> Undercover?
You don't understand.<eos> This isn't the Flirtual killer doing this.<eos> Then who?<eos> Bubonic.<eos> Wow, it's hot in here.<eos> Over there.<eos> Jake?<eos> Jake?<eos> When did he contact you?<eos> Last night.
(Laughing) Oh, you lose.<eos> (Laughing) We are never throwing a party together again.<eos> (Helicopter flying) All right, everyone, please, to your left.<eos> She's gonna be okay, yeah, she'll be okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks for saving my life.<eos> Thanks for saving everyone's lives.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Hey, um, you wanna make 250 bucks?<eos> Sure.
Literally in their hands. that'snotgood.<eos> that'snotgood. kidsufferedsevered kidsufferedsevered hemorrhaging.<eos> Hemorrhaging. Hospital says it's human error.<eos> Hospital says it's human error.<eos> The or, put everyone to sleep. but? but?<eos> machinesallover machinesallover the hospital have been shutting The hospital have been shutting down and rebooting for Down and rebooting for weeks for no reason,<eos> letmeguess.<eos> This nitrous oxide regulator is wireless and fully automated.<eos> yep.<eos> inotherwords...
No, he's not okay.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I had some personal stuff that I had to deal with.<eos> The killer put a body in the basement of my club.<eos> That's pretty personal.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm here now.<eos> Okay, look... this is gonna sound really weird, but I think...<eos> Well, actually, I know Tessa has been going out on dates with all of your matches from Flirtual.<eos> What?<eos> Every single one.
It's done.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Connor's here, I thought, you know, we could all go out.<eos> I'm sorry, I... Already made plans.<eos> Plans, like a date?<eos> Maybe.<eos> With the guy from today?<eos> No.<eos> Another one?
Fuck!<eos> I haven't thought about that in a while.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> You should come to the reunion. - Twenty years, comin' up.<eos> - Nah, man. - That's not my thing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Damn.<eos> You must be crushin' on out here with the talent level off the charts.<eos> I mean, the acting thing must help with the girls.<eos> Girls and guys.
And facing the bar, warm-up combo, yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Point, flex, point, brush.<eos> Flex, point.<eos> Front, first.<eos> Side, floor.<eos> Plié, and stretch.<eos> Six...<eos> Other side.<eos> Flex, point.
I'm very sorry to hear that.<eos> They kind of suck ass right now, but we loves 'em anyway.<eos> You know how it goes.<eos> You got a favorite team?<eos> I do not.<eos> Jeez, really?<eos> Since I was little, we went every game.<eos> Papa always gave me his beer money to pay the vendors so he didn't have to stop waving his "Terrible Towel."<eos> He waved that damn thing through the whole damn game.<eos> "Terrible Towel"?
And you're up in it, straight up.<eos> A "haji hall" invasion.<eos> It's dark as fuck.<eos> And you gotta get your hands on the men quick, even the little fuckers.<eos> Everybody's a combatant.<eos> And you can smell their hate filling up the room.<eos> Here she is, gentlemen, the incomparable Angel.<eos> Wait.<eos> What happened to the girl in the jeans?<eos> What girl?
Champagne, caviar, moonlight, music, ballet.<eos> It will be beautiful evening.<eos> You will dance "Swan Lake"<eos> on yacht.<eos> I promise to give Pierina a run for her money.<eos> And Claire.<eos> She will dance, too.<eos> We wouldn't miss it.<eos> Claire's at Anastasia a lot lately.<eos> Always with same man.
I know who you are inside.<eos> Okay, and blink for me.<eos> Very good.<eos> Look up.<eos> Good.<eos> And down.<eos> Do you have any history of substance abuse?<eos> - Diet pills, laxatives. Those count?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What about stress?
Oh, come in!<eos> Kiira!<eos> Oh, Ray!<eos> Daphne.<eos> Aww, princess!<eos> Pasha.<eos> Mona, my dear, sweet Mona.<eos> Aww. Come in!<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving, Paul.<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving.
God bless you.<eos> 22 years old, my baby, whole life in front of her.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> She's always been tough.<eos> I raised her right. But this?<eos> This fucking disease?<eos> Wham, out of nowhere, like a goddamn brick to my forehead.<eos> I think Mia's had issues with food for a long time.<eos> Issues?<eos> With food?
You don't want me to do it.<eos> You want Claire.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Look in my eyes and say it. Say it to my face!<eos> Calm down.<eos> 10 years I give you, my life, this body.<eos> Buttercup --<eos> Who were you before me?<eos> Nothing, a joke, has-been.<eos> A fucking bus boy with a bad back and a rich boyfriend!
A moment please?<eos> I'm going to make arrangements to leave for the country.<eos> Leave?<eos> Leave when?<eos> Now.<eos> - Tonight.<eos> - May I ask why?<eos> This fight with your father.<eos> The more public it gets, the more visible it gets, the greater the liability I will be for you.<eos> Liability?
Captain Vane and his men slaughtered another pirate crew in the bay.<eos> There are whispers it was to avenge an offense against Eleanor Guthrie.<eos> There are also whispers that it was to steal a hostage being held by that crew.<eos> A girl who is now held in that fort.<eos> A girl who would be in harm's way if you were to launch your attack.<eos> You pulled me away from my men out of concern for a girl?<eos> The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.<eos> Peter's daughter?<eos> You need to obtain her from Captain Vane.<eos> Alive and unharmed.
The girl.<eos> Her father is a very powerful, very influential man.<eos> If I return her to him unharmed, I believe that I can win him as an ally, an advocate in London to argue for a reconciliation with England where we keep our assets, maintain control, and name a governor of our own choosing.<eos> I believe that there is an opportunity at hand, an opportunity where we control our own futures.<eos> We just all need to agree to take it.<eos> Peter Ashe.<eos> Returning his daughter might gain his ear, but there is no man in the Americas with a more strident contempt for piracy than he.<eos> No amount of appreciation is going to make him forget that.<eos> A long time ago, he and I were friends.<eos> Good friends.
Are you fucking serious?<eos> You going to play games with me?<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> He said the gold is still out there.<eos> He said that Flint still plans to go get it.<eos> Out there?<eos> Where the fuck is it?<eos> He wouldn't say.<eos> But he's coming back later tonight.<eos> Tonight.
- You know the area?<eos> - Born and raised in Haderslev.<eos> - So you're going home now?<eos> - Looks like it.<eos> You did a fine job today.<eos> With all due respect, the army is just a phase for me.<eos> What would you rather do?<eos> I want to be a shopkeeper, Second Lieutenant.<eos> - A shopkeeper?<eos> - A shopkeeper.
Oh, yeah. Whoo!<eos> This is the first time we're sending up a rocket with a Mercury capsule on top.<eos> It they're sending up the capsule, then a manned launch will be next.<eos> Whoo! You mean a Gordo'd launch, 'cause that man is gonna be me.<eos> Oh... Take me with you.<eos> Might be a little tight in the capsule.<eos> Not that I would mind.<eos> I can't believe I'm here with an astronaut.<eos> I went to the beach and met superman.<eos> Superman?
Thank you, Mrs. Slayton.<eos> I think I got what I need.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's that?<eos> A photo we can run the story with.<eos> You must be excited for Gus' flight.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> Truthfully, I can't wait for it to be over.<eos> I know that I have been through a hundred combat missions when Gus was in Korea, but I never had to watch one of them on TV...<eos> With... him all over me...
Waiting is the worst part.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Are y... y-y-you okay?<eos> - Shoot! - Oh.<eos> Now you're gonna have to write that I got so worked up,<eos> - I broke an egg.<eos> - I won't write anything of the sort.<eos> You could faint right now, and the article would say that you are the epitome of reserved strength.<eos> In other words, Max will channel your inner primly stable.<eos> Primly stable?
But N.A.S.A.'s government.<eos> They got their own way of doing things.<eos> Oh, yeah. Protocol. Right.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't we just turn the car around and go back to your room at the motel?<eos> Bets, you haven't even seen the place.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I don't want anything from anybody that thinks you're a hatch-popping liar.<eos> - They're trying to be nice.<eos> - Nice?
It was 15 minutes.<eos> I didn't have a window.<eos> And what you did was more daring, more dangerous because of it.<eos> There were so many unknowns.<eos> Alan, I should have told you at the time, but...<eos> When you were up there...<eos> Well, the truth is I wasn't... it's gonna be hell for that wife of his.<eos> At least I don't have to worry about that with you.<eos> I am so... proud... Of my husband...<eos> And my country.
Bless...<eos> America.<eos> Mrs. Cooper!<eos> Mrs. Slayton!<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Excuse me!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's my double Decker tuna loaf.<eos> Smoky cocktail weenies.
Coming through.<eos> Annie, thanks so much for making sure we all got included.<eos> The guys... h-had J-John's back.<eos> - The girls h-had mine.<eos> - Mrs. Grissom?<eos> Mrs. Glenn?<eos> We need to get you into your cars.<eos> Oh!<eos> And we're in the third car,<eos> - right behind the Shepards.
He's... well, he's been organising it for weeks.<eos> - And he's your friend.<eos> - Oh, fine.<eos> - Then you'll go?<eos> - Well, that's what I said, didn't I?<eos> Some days, we forgot all about getting to Italy.<eos> Just stayed put.<eos> We were being heedless.<eos> I think that's the word I'm looking for.<eos> Heedless?
- And he's your friend.<eos> - Oh, fine.<eos> - Then you'll go?<eos> - Well, that's what I said, didn't I?<eos> Some days, we forgot all about getting to Italy.<eos> Just stayed put.<eos> We were being heedless.<eos> I think that's the word I'm looking for.<eos> Heedless?<eos> Heedless.
When every day seems to have some point to it.<eos> Finding somewhere to stay, finding food.<eos> And the days we didn't go anywhere, they seemed just as purposeful as when we set out in complete seriousness at four in the fucking morning.<eos> I think, um...<eos> I think that's the worst part of getting decrepit, losing that... purposefulness.<eos> I was remembering today how we used to see these flowers.<eos> Some sort of violet, I think they were.<eos> They'd find a patch of grass where the snow had melted and they'd just spring up.<eos> I know they were only flowers, but they seemed so determined.<eos> Brave, even.

Please, stop saying her name.<eos> - I can't bear it. - It isn't...<eos> It isn't about Katya.<eos> It is.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Like me discovering what this smell is around the house.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - And it's her perfume, OK?<eos> It's like she's been standing in the corner of the room all this time,<eos> - behind my back.
I was gonna say, 'cause you kind of sound like a pussy.<eos> We need to just get through this transition, and then you should leave for good.<eos> Wait.<eos> As in... leave... the company?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Our company that I own - 50% of?<eos> - Yup.<eos> That I built with you, and that I kept running - while you were indisposed?<eos> - And... and that... that you burnt down in a fucking spectacular way with your lies and deceit.<eos> - And your bullshit.
It's okay.<eos> Hey, I texted you a couple times last night.<eos> Uh, never heard anything back.<eos> I have, like, 260 unread texts.<eos> 260?<eos> That's entirely too many.<eos> Wanted to see if you wanted to go catch a movie or something, but what did you end up doing?<eos> Um, just hung out.<eos> With?<eos> Uh, Greggo, Skyler, Tom-Tom and Ethan.
They have them in Syria, North Korea.<eos> They're fake cities built to impress.<eos> Who's behind it?<eos> CIA?<eos> Is it social or medical?<eos> - What?<eos> - This government experiment. Is it social or medical?<eos> It's just a town.<eos> Just a town?<eos> With an electrified fence?
I forgot about that.<eos> We are not doing that, okay?<eos> - We're not doing that.<eos> We're going out.<eos> -Yes!<eos> We're going out.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That painting...<eos> Of Lynn?
Of course.<eos> I'm a nurse.<eos> I'll take care of you, and I'll be gang-raping you.<eos> I'll be the one doing it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You're in a safe place.<eos> As long as we're doing something together, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.<eos> Cheers, cheers, cheers.
Don't worry about it, honey.<eos> Happens to us all.<eos> So what do you do with your life now to make it at least bearable?<eos> Ooh. Well,<eos> I was a mediocre artist.<eos> [Scoffs] I gave that up...<eos> Which is a good thing for the world, I think.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I suppose now I guess I do... nothing.<eos> Nothing at all. [Chuckles]
[Both laugh]<eos> - No blood or tears.<eos> - Good.<eos> What about Doris?<eos> Last I saw, Doris was on the back of a jet ski, topless. [Laughs]<eos> I think we may have lost her to the lesbians.<eos> So, um...<eos> Okay, I did have sex last night, but I did not have sex with the cute guy in the hat.<eos> I had sex with Kevin.<eos> Kevin, Kevin?
Then I'll need to see your order signed by the King.<eos> Rules apply in all circumstances.<eos> Help us or we will help ourselves.<eos> Well, there are Spanish ships docked at Bayonne, Honfleur and Marseille.<eos> Honfleur.<eos> It's only days from Paris.<eos> Hey, LeMaitre can avoid the main roads by taking the Forest of Evreux.<eos> And then from Rouen, travel by river to the port.<eos> The ship in Honfleur, when is it scheduled to leave?<eos> Tomorrow evening.
But not for that reason.<eos> Saturday night.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> You're half-dressed, talking to a man in the door.<eos> What's wrong with you, Frances?<eos> Get back in the kitchen, finish them dishes.<eos> Hey, this is yours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oversleep again, Frank, all right, and it's back to the cheese shop or the fish shop or whatever shop it was you come from.<eos> Print.
When I get out, I'm thinking<eos> I might go to the Houses of Parliament, have a word with the Prime Minister, 'cause he will listen, he will.<eos> Frankie, this is prison, OK?<eos> That's what this is.<eos> It's the law of the jungle in here.<eos> But don't worry about it, because I'm a big boy,<eos> I can look after meself and I'll be out very soon.<eos> All right?<eos> Go on, have a look at that lump over there, you see him?<eos> With the big hat.
There's no moral advantage to my party if my party are also involved.<eos> It gets a bit stickier, sir.<eos> - Where were these photos taken?<eos> - Cazenove Road, Hackney.<eos> What in God's boots were they doing in Hackney?<eos> That's where it gets sticky.<eos> I thought the orgy was the sticky bit.<eos> It gets stickier still?<eos> We've had two brothers, gangsters, under surveillance.<eos> The Krays.
Get me Cecil King at the Sunday Mirror.<eos> 'The great and the good engineered a cover-up, 'a cracking good one.<eos> 'When the Krays' defense threatened to call Boothby as a character witness, 'the implication was clear.<eos> 'The government would have to drop its case 'or face the consequences.<eos> 'It was this that made the Krays the untouchables of London crime. '<eos> New information casts poor light on the prosecution witness, Mr McCowan.<eos> Case dismissed.<eos> 'That night, the Krays held their celebration party at McCowan's club.<eos> Reggie had bought the Hideaway that same afternoon.<eos> At a discount.
- All right.<eos> I mean, I'm not in the mind to hand out refunds, am I?<eos> Can't you handle it yourself?<eos> I pay you for protection, Ron.<eos> - What are you trying to say?<eos> - Nothing...<eos> No, you just said it.<eos> You just fucking said it.<eos> You come in here with your fucking nose, right, and your tea.<eos> Your fucking exotic tea.
A missing girl.<eos> A communist plot!<eos> Don't you think we were born for this kind of thing? Two replies!<eos> From Jane's uncle.<eos> A Mr Hersheimmer.<eos> He wants to meet at the Ritz.<eos> The other is unsigned... ..and wants to meet us on Sidney Street.<eos> Well, I can guess where we'll be going first.<eos> But both meetings are today.<eos> This morning!
Tommy was very brave.<eos> I'm sure he was.<eos> Could you take a look at this? Tighten the other side, would you?<eos> Oh, this damn hand.<eos> Good.<eos> Never. "To Jane,<eos> I mean, that was quite a bang!<eos> There's no need to be sarcastic, Tuppence.<eos> Sarcastic?<eos> "with all my love.
Of course.<eos> - School dinners at that place are dreadful.<eos> - Clearly.<eos> Oh, yes, it moves.<eos> I invented it myself.<eos> One day, I'll take it off and show you.<eos> That's very impressive.<eos> The Reds these days are full of fancy gadgets.<eos> Exploding pencils, umbrellas with poison in the tip.<eos> Firstly...
You're bloody sitting on Cliffy.<eos> I'm not lying on him.<eos> I always figured Cliffy would be the one to get home again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was, um...<eos> He was a pretty smart bloke in his own way.<eos> Got himself shot, but.<eos> Never gonna meet him now, Cliffy.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> Who?
I knew we shouldn't have trusted him.<eos> - Wait!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - To see the Queen, of course.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You aren't making sense.<eos> She was with us in that carriage.<eos> You had already noticed that she was frightened.<eos> I handed her the bee box, do you remember?<eos> The queen.

- I have no idea.<eos> Well, I do have an idea and if you will go taking your wedding ring off.<eos> I thought I'd explained all that.<eos> You found it!<eos> Shouldn't really go leaving it lying around, Tommy.<eos> You are a wonderful woman, Mrs Beresford.<eos> - Have I ever told you that?<eos> - Tommy, you'll hurt your back!<eos> Oh, it's wonderful to be getting back to normal.<eos> Normal?
- OK, Pablo and I drive fast.<eos> That's half a million dollars... per trip, using the same smuggling routes he always used.<eos> Easiest money he ever made.<eos> Back in Medellín, Pablo didn't waste any time.<eos> He bought a house in his old neighborhood and opened his first lab to turn Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.<eos> How are you feeling, Gustavo?<eos> All this smells like shit to me.<eos> What an ignorant bastard.<eos> It's like French cheese.<eos> The stinkier, the better.
Just because I said I was hungry.<eos> I AM hungry, it doesn't prove a single thing!<eos> I'm going to get dressed.<eos> The whole morning, dragging Rogers around, clearing up guts, without so much as a cup of tea to wet me whistle, and you..<eos> You look at me like I...<eos> Calm down.<eos> You've got some front, love.<eos> You've got some right brass neck.<eos> Don't go downstairs on your own.<eos> Not with those two.
You really are a first-class, five-star, solid gold fucking moron.<eos> Please!<eos> The lady! Hm?<eos> Double bluff.<eos> What, Tubs?<eos> Why you would steal your own gun.<eos> Armstrong's got a point.<eos> It's all riddles and games, smoke and mirrors, double bluff.<eos> You were the last one down.<eos> The last one.
Why didn't you go and see him?<eos> I did.<eos> It was unsettling.<eos> Different.<eos> He refused the hood.<eos> He wanted me to see his face.<eos> Perhaps to impute there was some commonality between us, perhaps to... laugh at me.<eos> Laugh at you?<eos> Yes.<eos> At justice.
Beg pardon, my lord, but I didn't say that.<eos> I merely said that it would be wise for us to manage our expectations as to what's achievable.<eos> And what is it that you think is achievable?<eos> Well, sir, the pirate issue is a thorny one, but I believe that there are ways to...<eos> - Aside from the pirates.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> I don't believe the pirates are the cause of Nassau's problem.<eos> I believe they are a symptom.<eos> The root causes are the ones that I would like to address first.<eos> Root causes?
- Heave!<eos> Fire!<eos> - Fire!<eos> - Fire!<eos> I don't see a move I can make from here.<eos> If I move against him directly, his men retaliate and I don't have the muscle to withstand it.<eos> And even if I could muster up that kind of support,<eos> I couldn't get away with it.<eos> Not after such a public display of loss as today.<eos> Not so brazenly.
Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?<eos> If you must know,<eos> I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.<eos> And who's this guy you're taking?<eos> There's no guy!<eos> Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?<eos> That's sad.<eos> I'm not gonna be alone.<eos> I'll be with my friends.<eos> Your friends?
Jules, listen to me.<eos> If Liam is not better by tomorrow morning, I will have him airlifted.<eos> Airlifted?<eos> If there is no improvement in Liam's condition by tomorrow morning, I will requisition a flight to the mainland.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, I have to go.<eos> Have you met Elena?<eos> Elena?
Where did you go?<eos> Hello?<eos> Professor Stoddart?<eos> Hello?<eos> Professor Stoddart?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Stay down there.<eos> Facedown.<eos> Facedown.
- Dan.<eos> - Right.<eos> Here.<eos> I have a... this is a commission rogatory.<eos> It's a cross-border memorandum of understanding between Oslo and London.<eos> It formalizes my role as a representative for the interests of the family of the murder victim, so...<eos> Very good.<eos> Right.<eos> Ever since they opened the Research Centre, there's been this accord.<eos> Not with me.

We have skills.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> And also with the International Aviation...

I've told DCI Morton that we will extend him every consideration.<eos> All right, if you'll excuse me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I have never felt cold like this.<eos> My ears actually hurt.<eos> And I've never seen a polar bear.<eos> I've never eaten lutefisk.<eos> What?<eos> - Lutefisk.<eos> - What about it?
- What's going on, Louis?<eos> - What's shakin'?<eos> What's going on, little guys?<eos> Mr. Webber, how are you, sir?<eos> Morning, Louis.<eos> I'd offer you a hand, but all I can lift is this coffee.<eos> Oh, that's what happens when you try to impress girls in the bat cage.<eos> I wasn't flirting, I was being a gentleman.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure she was a poor helpless 25-year-old.<eos> Yeah, helpless.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> Ashley's online.<eos> Cool.<eos> You're a life saver, Evan.<eos> Not everyone would just let two total strangers into their house these days.<eos> Well, you don't look that dangerous.<eos> Worst case scenario, I know I can take the both of you.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I do air boxing.<eos> - Air boxing?
Let's face it, Evan. You're a monster.<eos> Or should I say monster!<eos> What?<eos> Monster surprised?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Oh, monster confused!<eos> How the fuck do you know that!<eos> Monster will be quiet!<eos> You spied on me?<eos> On my kids?
You're going to be with Teresa and Thomas.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> Thomas would be very happy if you could help look after Teresa.<eos> You think you can handle that?<eos> You are a brave little girl.<eos> And so nice.<eos> OK.<eos> You stay here.<eos> – and I'll find mum.<eos> – And Sondre.
It's okay.<eos> I thought I'd just heave all this junk out into a skip And torch the lot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get rid of all the evidence.<eos> My life.<eos> Burn the lot.<eos> You can strike the match, Dan, on behalf of the governor.<eos> Do the dirty work.<eos> That's what you do, isn't it?<eos> The bitch's dirty work.
Liam!<eos> It's all right, sweetheart, I'm here, Liam.<eos> Do something!<eos> I'll check round the back.<eos> Carrie's rabbit's gone.<eos> Why would she take her rabbit?<eos> Companionship?<eos> Or maybe to make a casserole.<eos> Whoever killed the professor must have been very strong.<eos> And very physically violent.
Wandered out of town.<eos> Apparently so, yeah.<eos> Eaten by a bear.<eos> Terrible bad luck, there.<eos> You'd think he would have been fully cognizant of the risks.<eos> Apparently, he liked a drink.<eos> Do you have any idea what he was looking for up here, Or what he might have found, even?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.
You have my brother.<eos> Release him now unharmed, and... we'll leave you in peace to continue with your miserable lives.<eos> Get up!<eos> Get up!<eos> Brother.<eos> Untie me, then.<eos> When do your father's men arrive?<eos> What?<eos> Tell him!<eos> Tonight.
Put that away.<eos> Wow.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is the part where I get confused.<eos> You did not hook up with Margo Roth Spiegelman?<eos> No, we did not hook up.<eos> What?<eos> I'm so confused.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Me?
I've told you guys this so many times.<eos> I don't wanna go over this again.<eos> Tell us. I wanna hear it again.<eos> Cousin's house.<eos> Right, Bettina was your cousin.<eos> I forgot.<eos> No!<eos> Bettina was not my cousin!<eos> You slept with your cousin.<eos> Not my cousin.
I so don't believe you.<eos> It's true!<eos> What, you don't believe me?<eos> No, no.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Go poop.<eos> Shut up! Shut up.<eos> We're not even talking about me.<eos> We're talking about you and Angela.<eos> Little honey bunny.
It's a metaphor.<eos> But what if it isn't?<eos> What if it's instructions?<eos> I thought there'd be a...<eos> Just put it back.<eos> Gravity to the second power.<eos> Yep-<eos> Radar, what are you up to tonight?<eos> I promised Angela I'd take her shoe shopping.<eos> Shoe shopping?
Okay.<eos> I just think that maybe it's not great for you to be here now.<eos> You're always welcome in our home.<eos> And I know Pete thought it would do Julie some good to see you... but I think what she needs right now is normalcy.<eos> Well, I got her out of those pajamas and I got her hair done.<eos> And I think she's doing a lot better since I arrived.<eos> Linda, hey, come on, please.<eos> Please, don't be offended.<eos> I'm just looking out for my kid.<eos> Your kid?
What if you didn't have to go anywhere?<eos> Oh, England will have her island back, son.<eos> The day that happens, it'll be a bad day to be a pirate here.<eos> Unless we had something to offer them that might change their thinking about us.<eos> You think there's something valuable enough to make the British Navy forget that you and I are pirates?<eos> And what do you think would have that kind of value to them?<eos> Not what.<eos> Who.<eos> How soon before you can sail?<eos> First light.
How you use them is up to you.<eos> That's very kind of you.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> My bandages, did you wrap them?<eos> My father did the dressing.<eos> Your father seems like a good man.<eos> He's a very gentle and kind man.<eos> Sometimes I think too kind.<eos> I wish he was more like you.<eos> Brave.

Ugh! No, no, no!<eos> Please don't, no!<eos> I knew one day you'd come.<eos> We should really split up to look for Leila.<eos> We can cover more ground if we're searching independently.<eos> How much ground do you think you're going to cover with that foot?<eos> You know my foot's going to be fine, right?<eos> - You're going to deny what I'm capable of?<eos> Immunity from infection and an extraordinary recovery system hasn't made you special, Sarah.<eos> Just reckless.
Although I think I'm going through a bit of a gender jam.<eos> Whoa! Watch it, man!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, man! I thought you were my son's girlfriend.<eos> His girlfriend?<eos> Whoa, watch it! Fuck, man!<eos> How was work?<eos> Riveting.<eos> How did you get home?<eos> I walked.<eos> With the hamster?

What's with you?<eos> Your pupils are huge.<eos> Are you high?<eos> I gotta go find someone. I'll talk to you soon.<eos> You look like shit.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm Andrew.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm here with someone.<eos> Who?
All right.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Dinner, ladies.<eos> I was supposed to be out of here this morning.<eos> This is... it's been a whole other day.<eos> Guard: Sadly, it's not a perfect system.<eos> Please, listen.<eos> I am sick, okay?<eos> - Please.<eos> - What kind of sick?
_<eos> Where are you?<eos> Just on our way out of Jerusalem.<eos> Had to take a small detour.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The breastplate.<eos> It's supposed to be worn by some high priest.<eos> He uses it as some kind of a device to communicate.<eos> With?<eos> With God.
-No, we checked that already.<eos> Anyway, we have the murder weapon.<eos> -But what about the woman?<eos> Forget the woman.<eos> Just write your report.<eos> Remember to mention you spent 6 hours watching a corpse.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Where are the surveillance cameras in Graz?<eos> Hauptplatz, Jakominiplatz, train station, stadium.<eos> Stadium? Where at the stadium?
What happened to the two of us?<eos> Take it, maybe I left a bullet in there for you.<eos> Don't you want to have a look?<eos> You're not that much of a sport.<eos> -Whatever, I can put it in your hand afterwards.<eos> I won't tell anyone anything, I swear, I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Listen, we'll both keep our mouths shut and bury him in the backyard.<eos> Like back then, we were fearless too, right?<eos> We were friends once, weren't we?<eos> Friends, yeah.
You're bringing something to read?<eos> It isn't for me.<eos> Strange.<eos> You and I have never shared more than a few words, and yet I feel like we're old friends.<eos> Do you?<eos> Of course.<eos> James talks about you all the time.<eos> Captain Flint.<eos> He's told me what you've accomplished in this place.<eos> With those men.
Her name is Barlow and nothing more.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> Is it possible that you're so unremarkable as to resist any further description than that?<eos> Certainly possible.<eos> You conspire with my father to sabotage our plans.<eos> You betray our trust.<eos> You cause almost irreparable damage as a result.<eos> And when Flint, the most feared captain in all creation, comes to confront you about it, you destroy him.<eos> Now I hear in the wind that in his absence you've begun to forge new alliances with his enemies.<eos> With the farmers of the interior.
I had never endured such a difficult shooting.<eos> When Paris was liberated, the streets were desert.<eos> People were hiding home.<eos> We were alone in the street.<eos> I can never forget...<eos> A mass, hidden in a black neck.<eos> Saint-Martin's gate was monitoring the detour.<eos> Hirsute...<eos> With a black and white beard...<eos> And small eyes.

Let's go.<eos> It's strange.<eos> What?<eos> To be here, with another man.<eos> You?<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> Pierre could not believe what Elisabeth told him.<eos> He thought she was rambling and everything could be explained.<eos> He could not be cheated on.<eos> Still, in the evening...
He stares me.<eos> I felt like he loved me.<eos> But you are the one I want.<eos> I want to felt loved by one.<eos> Nobody loves you like I do.<eos> So where is your love?<eos> Why can't I feel it?<eos> If it exists I don't know where you put it.<eos> It's been so long you see me cry and suffer. But you're staying still.<eos> Indifferent.
Why can't I feel it?<eos> If it exists I don't know where you put it.<eos> It's been so long you see me cry and suffer. But you're staying still.<eos> Indifferent.<eos> - Are you leaving me for him?<eos> - No.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> He was just...<eos> Just...<eos> Just a moment.
If you want to leave me, go now.<eos> He did not want it.<eos> She did not want it.<eos> They broke up.<eos> The life is so long without you.<eos> I can't believe how long it is.<eos> I want you so bad, my wife.<eos> I want to hold you in my arms.<eos> My heart is with you.<eos> Both of you
He never was a resistant.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> What?<eos> His life, his medals.<eos> It was a lie.<eos> He was a traitor.<eos> He denounced his friends and they were executed.<eos> He pretended to be a hero.<eos> He was a bastard.<eos> A real bastard.
Kimmy, I think we counted wrong.<eos> - It's not Christmas.<eos> - But it's here.<eos> It's all still here.<eos> A miracle today in Durnsville, Indiana.<eos> Four women rescued from an underground apocalypse cult allegedly run by self...<eos> Proclaimed messiah Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, best known to Yelp users in this area...<eos> As Durnsville's worst wedding DJ.<eos> I am now joined by a neighbor who watched all the drama unfold,<eos> Walter Bankston.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> It's beautiful, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of day that makes you think anything's possible.<eos> You could climb Everest, fall in love, learn origami.<eos> Origami?
It's the other times I'm talking about.<eos> The news says this man's killing people at random.<eos> - It was just bad luck.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Martin was a bully, wasn't he?<eos> And bullies make enemies.<eos> Was there... Was there another teacher at school he fell out with?<eos> Or harmed in some way?<eos> He wasn't like that with anyone else.<eos> Just me.
Was there... Was there another teacher at school he fell out with?<eos> Or harmed in some way?<eos> He wasn't like that with anyone else.<eos> Just me.<eos> What about Craig?<eos> Last Christmas, Martin was passed over for Head of Sport and Craig broke his arm.<eos> - Were those two things related?<eos> - Craig fell off his bike.<eos> When it was just you, you could find a way to grin and bear it.<eos> But with Craig... your own son, your baby...
The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart.<eos> He's the enemy.<eos> I've been telling you for years.<eos> You've been defending him for years.<eos> This is exactly what they want.<eos> And now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath.<eos> Did you set him free?<eos> Tyrion may be a monster, but at least he killed our father on purpose.<eos> You killed him by mistake.<eos> With stupidity.
Nightfall.<eos> The sun drops fast this time of year.<eos> Hurry, Jon Snow.<eos> Shield up.<eos> Attack,mylord!<eos> Attack!<eos> Don't cross your feet.<eos> My sons had swords in their hands from the time they could walk.<eos> This one... Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.<eos> Great warrior?
Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.<eos> It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> You can forgive me.<eos> What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?<eos> I led you into the darkness.<eos> I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.<eos> I tempted you into our... unnatural relations.<eos> And, of course, there was the king... his boar hunt.<eos> His wine.
CHILDREN CHATTER<eos> ~ Oh, Sorry!<eos> ~ Careful, ladies!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, goodness.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Barbara Gilbert.<eos> ~ There is no-one here to entertain you.<eos> They are all abroad.<eos> ~ Abroad?
You have a beautiful home and a lovely garden too - what I can see of it out of the window.<eos> We lived rather more modestly than this until the National Health came along and changed the... the world.<eos> You tell her.<eos> Mr Newgarden was an optician by training who became a spectacle manufacture.<eos> Once the government made glasses freely available to all who needed them, business became very brisk.<eos> ~ Oh, I can imagine.<eos> ~ Quite.<eos> And now it's time for me to share my good fortune.<eos> ~ Biscuit?<eos> ~ Lovely.
Oh, I love my teddy so much!<eos> Your bicycle was brought back... by a black man.<eos> And you're wanted in the dining room.<eos> We thought he'd run you over with his bus!<eos> And what's more, you're not a member of the public.<eos> Dialling 999!<eos> Sister Evangelina's right, unless a woman is in active labour, a doctor is always consulted before transfer to hospital.<eos> If I may interject, that is not a universal rule.<eos> ~ Pass the sausage rolls please, Nurse Crane.<eos> ~ Gladly.
~ Going around arresting decent men.<eos> ~ Marie, please.<eos> Cos it ain't true, is it?<eos> What the copper said?<eos> I don't want him near my garage.<eos> What you tell people about the trial, that's your business.<eos> They won't hear it from me.<eos> Trial?<eos> I go before the Quarter Sessions next week.<eos> The Quarter Sessions?
And no need for cake.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> There's always a need for cake.<eos> (I'm in love with you.)<eos> Barbara's banners need threading on those and then you can come and find me in the kitchen.<eos> Are we expecting a visitor of excessive proportions?<eos> I'm measuring up.<eos> I need to know how many sandbags it'll take to block up this doorway and keep us safe, in the event they press the button.<eos> All this energy on sheltering would be put to better use in talks of peace!<eos> With the Commies?
'We are living in an era where we must make careful 'decisions on who can and cannot be trusted.'<eos> All right, Marie! What are you doing?<eos> They wouldn't let me in the Rose Queen because of you!<eos> They put it in the paper!<eos> Oh, God. I'm sorry!<eos> You know what my mum said when I first brought you home?<eos> A man can be too clean, that was it!<eos> Every other fella smelt of his own sweat and dirt, but not you!<eos> You smelt nice.<eos> Like lemons.
Why do you care so much?<eos> Perhaps I'm like Sister Monica Joan.<eos> Perhaps I don't hold with culls either.<eos> You going, then?<eos> To the hospital?<eos> For the cure.<eos> I know from Mrs Turner how busy you are, so I doubt this is a social call.<eos> The dreadful living conditions at Bulthorpe Hospital have come to my attention.<eos> ~ I'm going to petition Andrew Lancing about it today.<eos> ~ The medical officer?
My dear Watson.<eos> Sh... don't cry, little one.<eos> What you got to cry about, eh?<eos> This is your daddy.<eos> He's always going to look after you.<eos> He's always going to be here.<eos> That's right, isn't it?<eos> I don't know how to be.<eos> A father.<eos> My husband.
~ Sister, you're still a valued part of Nonnatus House.<eos> ~ No.<eos> I'm a relic, a curiosity and a nuisance.<eos> They say in the newspaper we're degenerate.<eos> They call us common prostitutes. SHE WINCES<eos> And all of that makes us stick together.<eos> Do you want your child growing up in an environment like that?<eos> Not really.<eos> But can you see me working in an office, day after day?<eos> Or as a housewife?
I'm motorised this evening, in case we hear anything about young Paulette.<eos> Oh. Is there still no news?<eos> Not as yet.<eos> But there's no point in sitting home and moping.<eos> Charity beckons, we must heed the call.<eos> I've got some cream soda, Nurse Crane.<eos> You can have some of that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And do call me Phyllis.<eos> Just for this evening.
She says the bed's comfortable and she is pregnant, so she might be about to fall asleep.<eos> Possibly not.<eos> You have visitors, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> Hello!<eos> My mother made you some samosas, to say thank you for your kindness.<eos> Oh, my goodness, how kind!<eos> Thai're ko, ami sop masala fi si na, kinto igo tik oi bo.<eos> She says she couldn't get all the same spices, ~ but they still should be good. ~ Isn't he sweet?<eos> How's the walking?<eos> The garment?
How's the walking?<eos> The garment?<eos> Haarhte tomar orshobida oi ni? Kapra findla tomar shajo oi say ni?<eos> Ji oi. Sopkichu bala korshor.<eos> Ami tomari danyabad ditheysai, amar bishbala tumi amar shajo korso.<eos> ~ Beti manush ekano nai. ~ She says it helps a great deal, but she says she is not only thanking you for helping with the pain, she also has missed the companionship of other women.<eos> ~ What is it?<eos> ~ Should we try them?<eos> On the Sub-Continent, they eat everything with their fingers.<eos> Right hand only, of course.
He has not been seen since his liaison with the haberdasher wilted on the vine.<eos> He must be distraught.<eos> He would be more so if he could see the tinge of blue upon my hands.<eos> I've come to take your blood pressure, Maureen.<eos> What's happened to Neil?<eos> Did Nurse Gilbert take him to the nursery?<eos> She did.<eos> And they agreed he could stay until five o'clock.<eos> To give us time to make arrangements with social services.<eos> Social services?
I am the daughter of a man who fought in a war.<eos> I heard him yelling at night.<eos> And I saw him crying.<eos> But I knew how to make him smile.<eos> I knew how to make him better.<eos> And there are only two things that could do that.<eos> Me.<eos> And a bottle of Scotch.<eos> I became a nurse.<eos> And a midwife.
Descending the tree, we descend the social ladder.<eos> With each branch, the fruit is less ripe, and the monkey lower in rank.<eos> Until, at the bottom, the heroine of this story,<eos> Maya.<eos> Maya's got big, friendly eyes, three distinctive spots on her nose, and, I think you'll agree, a pretty rad hairdo.<eos> She was born eight years ago, at the bottom of the troop, just like her mother.<eos> And her mother before that.<eos> When you're at the bottom, you're either in the way, or you don't even exist.<eos> But every day, you're paying your dues to monkeys like Raja without any chance of promotion.<eos> And so, back under the fig tree,
~ To what end?<eos> ~ He has an ancient family name - doors which are closed to us might open for him.<eos> What inducements could we offer?<eos> His need at present must be severe.<eos> You mean to buy his friendship?<eos> I would rather he bestowed it willingly.<eos> I find people are very friendly when they cannot afford not to be.<eos> Elizabeth, where are you going?<eos> ~ I must speak with Ross, Mama.<eos> ~ To what purpose?
Precious little.<eos> And nothing to trouble the Welsh mines, where they're dragging it out by the cartload.<eos> Meantime, we're sunk in debt, the bankers have us by the throat.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And your mines?<eos> What of them?<eos> Even worse than Grambler.<eos> Derelict, both of them.<eos> Your land?<eos> Barren.
What have you done, Father?<eos> They'll be nursing their bruises till next back end!<eos> So you leave me at home to dispatch one man, while you treat yourselves to a full-scale brawl?<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> That's the truth of it, sir.<eos> ~ Won't happen again.<eos> ~ Don't say that!<eos> Quarrels of my own making I'll fight my own way, you understand?<eos> ~ 'Twas a matter of pride.<eos> ~ Nay, of personal affront.
This is my uncle Hasan.<eos> He's a renowned psychologist, teaches at the university.<eos> You work for the CIA, don't you?<eos> What?<eos> Me?<eos> No!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Honestly.<eos> I am... in no way affiliated with the Central Intelligence<eos> Agency.
While I admit that is cause for concern, Mr. President, the answer is not to start global war.<eos> Pierce, set your plan in motion.<eos> Good lord.<eos> I think you're making a big mistake, Mr. President.<eos> We're going rogue.<eos> Get me in touch with my old friend Haroon Raja in the ISI.<eos> If we have any hope of averting armageddon, that two-faced Paki weasel is it.<eos> Two-faced Paki weasel.<eos> But... You... Don't call him a two-faced Paki weasel.<eos> No, no, of course not.
We should go to the police, yeah?<eos> Huh!<eos> Those fascists?<eos> How's that face?<eos> I've had worse on the footy field, Peter.<eos> JOHN:<eos> I don't want to have sex with other people!<eos> TIM:<eos> OK, but would you allow me to?<eos> Who with?
So many of your stories involve penises.<eos> It's totally gone viral. Oh, cool.<eos> Is there, like, an app for that?<eos> So, like, no.<eos> Hector and dorf are avant-garde fashion visionaries, And we planned it that way.<eos> Are you really just gonna sit here And read your swedish book?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would love to see that video.<eos> Yeah, no, no, no, i'll send it to you with a--<eos> Oh, with some of our new moisturizer.
Why are you staying over If you just want to read?<eos> Good air conditioning And better sheets.<eos> What, i can only stay here if i have sex with you?<eos> No, babe. It's just been three whole days.<eos> Okay, well, why don't you read something for once?<eos> That copy of the goldfinch has been on your nightstand<eos> In 400 pages.<eos> Okay?<eos> (josh) okay, so this is where you live.<eos> (liza) yep, with my roommate, maggie.
Well, you're this high-powered executive, and you've got such fierce style, and you're so cultured, and you have this amazing life.<eos> That's what you think of me?<eos> It's not what I think; it's just the straight-up truth.<eos> Well, it's not so great.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Well, I bet you don't get beat up at school.<eos> And people don't call you "Little Miss Bag Fag."<eos> Sit down.<eos> What are you drinking?<eos> Grey Goose martini, two olives.
Yeah, she sort of invited herself.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> Or weird.<eos> You know, you and me hanging out is just...<eos> I'm just worried she's gonna think I'm... - Gay?<eos> - Old... er.<eos> Don't worry...<eos> I promise not to blow your cover.<eos> I'll just be your roommate.<eos> Your older roommate.
No.<eos> I went to a shawarma cart.<eos> I was really drunk.<eos> I still kind of am.<eos> But guess what.<eos> I'm part of a crew now.<eos> I have bitches, Maggie, and we rule.<eos> How exciting for you.<eos> I got into a huge fight with Phil.<eos> Phil.
Fine.<eos> Go home and finish binging Gilmore Girls.<eos> He loves that show.<eos> Our Uber's here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Oh.<eos> I can't believe Thad didn't come.<eos> That might have been the smartest thing Thad's ever done.<eos> Listen to me, right now you need to be more concerned about your meeting with Anton Bjornberg in the morning.<eos> Bjornberg?
What?<eos> It's so much better than the other skeezy stuff guys will pay for.<eos> How much?<eos> Um, $200 a pair.<eos> And they must be used.<eos> Used? Yep, like, "wear them for three days, work out in them, never take them off" used.<eos> - And you did this?<eos> - Yeah, quite successfully.<eos> I got to tell you, there's definitely a market there.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Okay. A creepy, skeezo market, but...
Why is he talking to you?<eos> Uh, it's... It was nothing.<eos> I know an inside joke when I see one.<eos> Get in here.<eos> [door bangs] And?<eos> We ran into each other at this party last night.<eos> What kind of party would you be at with Charles?<eos> Well, I wasn't exactly a guest.<eos> I was working... as a caterer.<eos> Actually, more as a bartendress.
[laughs] "As time went by, I came to realize Trevor was definitely incontinent."<eos> Oh.<eos> (both) Ew.<eos> [both laughing]<eos> Okay, and for the win, by Meredith Montgomery,<eos> The Scarf.<eos> "The severity often differs, "even the location of the wound.<eos> "But what's never changed is the fact "that he was a Confederate soldier "and my grandfather.<eos> The boy who saved his life was a Union bugler."<eos> [laughs] Bugler.
I think. I got my name right.<eos> You probably outscored Shin, then.<eos> Who is winning?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Well, deal me in.<eos> These are all mine, then.<eos> I told you boys not to play with him.<eos> Okay, drivers. Here is the deal.<eos> You selected for a mission. Which you are not to discuss. With anyone outside of this room.<eos> No one.
Yeah.<eos> German extraction.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> My name is Donovan.<eos> Irish.<eos> Both sides, mother and father.<eos> I am Irish. You are German.<eos> What makes us both Americans?<eos> Just one thing.<eos> One, one, one.
Were you in charge of this thing, sir?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I have to thank you.<eos> I have to thank somebody.<eos> I gave them nothing.<eos> I gave them nothing.<eos> It does not matter.<eos> It does not matter what people think.<eos> You know what you did.<eos> Welcome home!
Have you seen that thing?<eos> It's like he ate a volcano.<eos> Ma'am, we do have that issue of national security, so I'm afraid that Catherine right now...<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Catherine, you have to get out, honey.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Sorry, I apologize.<eos> Madam President, I'd like to state that I think that Catherine is a valuable asset.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And daughter.
And how great is Tom James, right?<eos> We'll see you guys soon.<eos> If I have any more of those funnel cakes, I won't be able to fit through the bus door.<eos> It's true.<eos> Those funnel cakes are just great.<eos> We'll see you guys soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You won't be able to miss us.<eos> It's true because if... we'll eat them and then we'll get so fat.<eos> So fat.
- I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's bitten off his tracking device.<eos> He should be here by now.<eos> This is not okay.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - Break out the yellow ribbon, Sue.<eos> - We are stranded in Iran.<eos> -l'm really scared, Sue.<eos> Man up, Gary.<eos> Or at least lady down a bit.
Because, I mean, obviously I so respect you, Ben, and I think you're incredibly capable.<eos> And I also think that you... (SNORING)<eos> Ben?<eos> I need to see the President for a debrief and a pre-brief.<eos> Back off, Cary Grant, okay?<eos> Vice President is first up. - No...<eos> - I need to tell my mom that I got engaged.<eos> - Oh, also I got engaged.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.<eos> - To her.
I live on a regular street in real America with real trees and real cars.<eos> - Oh, wait for it.<eos> - Selina: We do have real cars on my street.<eos> I'm not sure what a fake car would be exactly.<eos> - Oh, bam! I should be president or something.<eos> If he doesn't drink in the morning, he will now.<eos> Oh, God, you know what I should have brought up?<eos> That rumor about O'Brien's daughter blowing all those hockey players in college.<eos> That would have been a mistake.<eos> Huge mistake.
Families First will break that link.<eos> He's nailing it, like Streisand hitting a high C.<eos> My God, where were you born, Lake Homo?<eos> After the shootings in Pittsburgh this morning, do you think that it's time for some stricter gun control?<eos> Reaction is easy.<eos> Understanding is hard.<eos> Wasn't the shooter also a victim?<eos> Well, we're talking about an ex-Marine here, someone whose mind was maimed in the service of his country.<eos> Ben, Tom James has just said the shooter is a victim, too.<eos> - PTSD. - Oh, my God!
All right, listen.<eos> Enough business, let's eat.<eos> Okay? But probably not fucking zucchini, right?<eos> (LAUGHING) "I'd like to introduce you to Jason.<eos> "Come on out, honey."<eos> SELINA: Okay, and now a kiss.<eos> - Oh! - SELINA: Oh.<eos> - That needs work. - That needs work.<eos> - Which part?<eos> -(SOFTLY) All of it.
- Sure.<eos> - I had Chungmania mania.<eos> (LAUGHING) I love it when you tell that story.<eos> It's so funny.<eos> Well, Danny, come January, I would be so pleased if you would serve alongside me as my vice president.<eos> (LAUGHING) You do me a great honor, Madam President.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah. - But I do need to consult my wife.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, yes.<eos> - And my Bible.
That's it.<eos> I'm throwing the debate.<eos> You win, pretend opponent.<eos> Wait a second, Kent had a list who Jonah and Richard were seeing and you had a list who Dan and Amy were seeing?<eos> Did you not think to compare the lists?<eos> I have another list and you're right at the top of it, Gary, so don't you dare try to question my fucking methods.<eos> Well, I on the other hand, do dare to question your fucking methods.<eos> Well, Kent and I were running different parts of the operation.<eos> So your people are going to see the same people as Jonah and Richard?<eos> One.

- And?<eos> - That was really weird.<eos> I guess we don't have as much Elvis dust on us as I thought.<eos> You see?<eos> This is why I wanted to go with Peter Gregory.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> That guy throws this huge party for us and then acts like he doesn't even want us?<eos> I fucking hate parties.<eos> And he's just, "Come back next week when you have more."<eos> More?
- Fuck.<eos> I just wanted to check up on you.<eos> - You're not sick.<eos> - No.<eos> But I'm preventing illness by taking a mental health day.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Well, I just wanted to check up on you, and I'm glad to see that Saint Eddie's not perfect after all.<eos> I've got soup for you.<eos> It's got balls in it.<eos> Oh balls.
Have you ever thought about talking to him?<eos> No offense, Patrick, but you don't know shit about my dad.<eos> No, I know. I know.<eos> But I know you...<eos> And if your dad is anything like you...<eos> Where you going with this?<eos> No, just...<eos> You have a slight tendency sometimes to just be a little...<eos> What?<eos> Just a little stubborn.
Right? So...<eos> I don't know, you're kind of forced to confront it.<eos> But still, my dad, he's just... Fucking tough.<eos> Well, listen, if your dad is a raging homophobe, then I say fuck him, okay?<eos> Never speak to him again, but what if he's not?<eos> Then...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're annoying, you know that?<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> So fucking annoying.
- I'm definitely all yours.<eos> - And you know how much I hate the devil children.<eos> Fine, then don't cancel your plans,<eos> - but take me with you.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Wait, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey. Uh...<eos> I come in peace...<eos> And sober...
Yeah?<eos> Did he say that, that I should call?<eos> No, but I think you shouldn't throw away that connection that you two have. Right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't think Richie wants to be friends.<eos> Oh, Jesus, look where we are.<eos> You're all buddies with Richie and I'm cleaning out my ass for Kevin.<eos> Oh, we should take a picture.<eos> For Dom, right?<eos> - Okay, with the enema? - Yeah, with the enema.
Have a nice night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Next.<eos> - Excuse me, do you have a ticket?<eos> - God damn it!<eos> - Jian-Yang, come here!<eos> Hey, Jian-Yang, how-- how was last night?<eos> It was sad.<eos> Erlich, he promised me dinner with a big meat.<eos> Big meat?
Thank you.<eos> Next.<eos> - Excuse me, do you have a ticket?<eos> - God damn it!<eos> - Jian-Yang, come here!<eos> Hey, Jian-Yang, how-- how was last night?<eos> It was sad.<eos> Erlich, he promised me dinner with a big meat.<eos> Big meat?<eos> - Big meet people.
I don't think he likes you.<eos> L mean, he literally rolled his eyes at you.<eos> Why don't you just trust me on this one?<eos> Let Kool-Aid do the talking tomorrow.<eos> I'm gonna grab a couple more drinks and another hat.<eos> I'm gonna get a box. GAVIN:<eos> This is a total fucking disaster.<eos> If my engineers had just told me they weren't ready, I never would have pushed for this live stream.<eos> Even worse, now I hear those little Pied Piper fuckers are doing their own live stream with Homicide.<eos> - The energy drink?
Other people are, like, saying horrible stuff.<eos> I'm supporting you, and they're saying, like,<eos> "Oh, he couldn't get funding, so he had to go to Kickstarter "like some charity case collecting money from strangers, "like a street beggar who sits on the ground,<eos> - "eats trash."<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, just between us, I was thinking about canceling, anyways, because we're way, way under our goal.<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Like, embarrassingly low.
It's strange...<eos> How you always know when someone is telling the truth.<eos> I have no argument with you, my friend.<eos> Let's sup together.<eos> We are not all like the Northmen.<eos> Forgive me, My Lady, I...<eos> I did not want to disturb you.<eos> I was just remembering...<eos> I'm sure you can never forget being an artist.<eos> Nor a monk.
It's wrong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> And nothing happened.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I wanted something to happen.<eos> I wanted something to happen between you and me.<eos> Right there in the water.<eos> In front of them.
This is your fault, Ragnar.<eos> Torstein has died fighting for a hill he did not want to own.<eos> For something which meant nothing to him.<eos> He has died a pointless death.<eos> How many more of us must die for your Christians?<eos> Or have you, in your heart, already renounced our gods and turned to the Christ-God?<eos> Is that what your friend Athelstan has persuaded you to do?<eos> But look.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Under an English sky.
He wants power over me and over Mercia.<eos> I did not fight for him.<eos> I fought for my people, and for you.<eos> How is your wound?<eos> It still hurts.<eos> Do you need to lie back?<eos> Wait!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Out. - Where?<eos> With whom?
Stay.<eos> Stay, both of you.<eos> Oversee your future.<eos> What could be more important?<eos> I have told you my decision.<eos> Perhaps Athelstan will stay.<eos> Will you?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I've not discussed it with Ragnar.<eos> Hmm, or with Judith.
Salutations, my love.<eos> Burgred!<eos> My lords, ladies and gentlemen, please rise and raise your cups to the sole and only ruler of Mercia.<eos> To the Queen of Mercia.<eos> To the Queen.<eos> To the Queen.<eos> __<eos> Why so quiet?<eos> Nothing to talk about?<eos> Not with you, perhaps.
No, he did not speak and yet I heard his voice.<eos> And I am born again.<eos> What do you mean, born again?<eos> Like a baby?<eos> I've rediscovered my faith.<eos> I'm a new man.<eos> Born again through the love of Jesus Christ.<eos> Then you're a Christian again?<eos> With all my heart.<eos> With all my soul, with all my being.
Who?<eos> Athelstan.<eos> It's that name again.<eos> Why must you forever bring him to mind?<eos> For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me of how my wife whored with him.<eos> And how much more she should have suffered for it.<eos> - Aethelwulf!<eos> - This is not to do with you, father!<eos> This is between me and this Jezebel!<eos> This harlot!
What if I accept what you have to say?<eos> What if I agree to be with you and go with you?<eos> But I will never forgive you for usurping my earldom.<eos> And one day, I will kill you.<eos> If you accept that condition, then let us be together<eos> and enjoy each other.<eos> You see?<eos> You should never have called me that.<eos> Called you what?<eos> Ironside.
It makes no difference to me.<eos> I am dying.<eos> But at least I know, I will see Athelstan again.<eos> What did I tell you, Rollo?<eos> I warned all of you.<eos> The priest poisoned Ragnar's mind and now we see the fruit of it.<eos> It's true.<eos> And now I have a heavy heart.<eos> I cannot believe that Ragnar is truly a Christian.<eos> Not in his heart.
I'm going to find Randall.<eos> See who I can ridicule for the crew's amusement.<eos> Randall.<eos> Crew address is due at next bells.<eos> If you have anything new for me by the way of gossip, now... would... be the... time.<eos> DeGroot!<eos> Danger!<eos> Secure!<eos> Tie 'em up.<eos> Down in the well with 'em.
He's gonna need some legs...<eos> And a mouth.<eos> And he's really surprised, 'cause he's not a frog at all.<eos> He's a...<eos> What?<eos> - Huh. - What?<eos> Something from Tim Whittick.<eos> - (Groans) - He's in town.<eos> Wants to have lunch with us.<eos> With "us" or with "you"?
Let's not get bogged down.<eos> The idea is, they're buying these basic human necessities, with the exception of toilet paper... (chuckles) which they already have.<eos> Well, they do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> And this is the part I love... (Laughs)<eos> They can spend their points to do shit to the people in the other boxes.<eos> They can make someone else's box colder or hotter or fill it with bugs.<eos> - Really?<eos> Bugs?
You should definitely work that in when you propose.<eos> Look, we never really stopped loving each other.<eos> And being back with my boys full time?<eos> Come on.<eos> Plus my money guys think I could get at least $3 million for the house.<eos> So I read through those notes from that Tim guy, and I ran them past legal.<eos> And?<eos> You have a legal problem. - Thank you. - Seriously?<eos> He's got a valid claim. Legally?<eos> Bloody hell.
Really?<eos> And, uh, the... part?<eos> Let's just say...<eos> The lady knows her way around the vagina.<eos> You'd think I'd stop eating.<eos> And, um... from a reciprocal standpoint?<eos> Oh, well, obviously I've never seen one that close before.<eos> Obviously.<eos> I thought it'd be a little weird, but once you get down there, it's, like, "Oh, I know you."<eos> Sure.
It just means some other schmuck celebrity will get my gift bag.<eos> That's right.<eos> There are gift bags.<eos> Why would you tell me that?<eos> He told you what?<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> I just thought it was a little weird that we talked all about me and Merc and you never said anything...<eos> Well, I never said anything because I made him explicitly promise that neither of us would ever, ever tell anyone.<eos> And now he's telling you?<eos> Well, just me.
How did the three of you guys meet?<eos> Well, Sean-y and I met at university.<eos> Oh, so you didn't all start out together?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He and I were partners for years.<eos> La Bev came along much, much later.<eos> We were all hired to work together on a sketch show, and all of a sudden, there she was with her biting wit and...<eos> Pfft, I don't know what. (Chuckles)<eos> Oh, say it...<eos> Vagina.
- Maybe she's having a clichÃ©.<eos> [intercom buzzes] - Carol, helen needs to see you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Right back.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - How was your weekend?<eos> - Eh, quiet.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - Nothing, really.
I wish. I am so swamped.<eos> Pilot season. Blah!<eos> All right, well, I could come over there if it's easier.<eos> Here?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I'll come to you.<eos> How about behind your stage?<eos> Behind our stage?
I sure am.<eos> Come here.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Eh, it's fine.<eos> I was stuck on the phone with stupid Holland.<eos> I swear, everything they say sounds like they're clearing their throats.<eos> So, how you doing?<eos> Good one.<eos> No, seriously, how you doing after that Larry Penzel thing?<eos> That stealing fuck.
I am... I am just... put... put...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> I am just putting this out there.<eos> Tomorrow morning, I am going on a hike by myself, alone, 7:30, our usual spot.<eos> Do with that what you will.<eos> Okay, got ya.<eos> Let me say this.<eos> Life was simpler before you became a lesbian.<eos> A lesbian?
Goddamn it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I thought you were someone else.<eos> I feel sorry for that person.<eos> No.<eos> I'm getting out of the car now.<eos> I'm fully armed, don.<eos> If you so much as turn your head in my direction, that will be the last thing you do with your head.<eos> I can't see anything anyway.<eos> Well, nonetheless.
He had an official dinner he couldn't get out of.<eos> It's late - let's wrap up for the day but let's keep thinking.<eos> We have five people sat at a table in an otherwise empty room.<eos> The killer blows the candle out - phew!<eos> - and when the lights come back on, Elias Thomson has a knife in his back and all the witnesses swore that they were holding each other's hands the whole time.<eos> Then just how was it done? !<eos> And behold... .. Godzilla, destroyer of cities!<eos> Ow!<eos> Oh, hi!<eos> No-one, erm... ~ Er, ow!
What do you need, buddy?<eos> A field test.<eos> Hey.<eos> I've just seen they can respond to commands.<eos> We need to take the research and get it on its feet.<eos> These are wild animals, Hoskins.<eos> Trust me, you don't want them in the field.<eos> I just saw a bond.<eos> A real bond.<eos> Between man and beast.
Son of a bitch!<eos> You shouldn't say "bitch."<eos> Take the kids. Get them someplace safe.<eos> - You got this!<eos> - Go faster!<eos> Damn it, drive!<eos> This does not feel safe.<eos> Can we stay with you?<eos> I am never leaving you as long as you live.<eos> No, him.

But I need you to be safe.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> They're coming.<eos> - We got to hold them back.<eos> - Until?<eos> Until a lucky rogue can save us.<eos> Took all the villagers...<eos> If you left because you got bored, so help me.<eos> I'm at the hospital with the book and your nice old library guy.<eos> Actually not so nice.
Should I?<eos> Well, surprisingly, you did save the day.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> I'm awesome.<eos> So, that's... that's...<eos> that's what... that's it?<eos> - You're awesome?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, everybody tells me I can't do what I want, can't rely on luck, but when a magic spell turns everybody into heroes of legend, who did it turn me into?<eos> Me.
Let's not make this a crazy drama.<eos> Let's just enjoy this place.<eos> Okay.<eos> -That was just way too easy.<eos> -I was thinking.<eos> No, you said, "Okay."<eos> And then I did see you think like, "Okay, I'm gonna appease my wife<eos> -"and then I'm gonna keep digging."<eos> -No. I won't dig.<eos> -No more digging?

Tell them that if this ship tries to run on a skeleton crew, they're going to get chased, they're going to get caught, and they're going to get killed.<eos> See if that convinces them.<eos> They're resolved to rescue our captain.<eos> Yet, from the look of things, they seem as likely to slaughter us as the Charles Town militia.<eos> If not more so.<eos> Who said anything about rescuing anyone?<eos> Didn't Captain Vane?<eos> There's a significant difference between preventing Ashe from making a trophy of Flint and saving Flint's life.<eos> Who's to say Vane doesn't help Flint escape from shore and then slit his throat the moment we're in open water?<eos> Along with all of ours?
She was not mad before the magic.<eos> She was dead, Madam.<eos> Perhaps there was some irregularity with the spell?<eos> I asked Mr Strange about that.<eos> He could not bring himself to broach the subject with his tutor.<eos> Your wife has asked me to write to my husband, sir, and to tell him, well, of the details of her...<eos> To the world beyond the doors of Harley Street, Madam, beyond ourselves, Norrell and her doctors, my wife is... merely unwell.<eos> You made me a promise when you asked if you might continue to visit her that you would say nothing of what she told.<eos> I expect you to keep that promise.<eos> Even between husband and wife.
I thought your name was Victor.<eos> Well, why don't we start with her because this photo is dated 1915.<eos> I told you I had family commitments.<eos> This is it.<eos> In 1915, Tesla was doing experiments in wireless power transmission.<eos> That was Tesla's dream.<eos> Like Wi-Fi only for electricity.<eos> Not just the Internet.<eos> The gas lamps, they're wireless power transmitters.<eos> Prototypes.
In 1915, Tesla was doing experiments in wireless power transmission.<eos> That was Tesla's dream.<eos> Like Wi-Fi only for electricity.<eos> Not just the Internet.<eos> The gas lamps, they're wireless power transmitters.<eos> Prototypes.<eos> But something went wrong.<eos> We activated the system and everyone got, zapped, out of sync.<eos> Out of sync with what?<eos> The universe.
- Oh, no. Uh-uh.<eos> That's Rosa's bed.<eos> Back it up.<eos> DeMarco, she's been assigned to that bunk.<eos> Show some respect for the dead.<eos> Red, I know you from the first night I spent in this room, but you take one more thing down, I'm gonna reopen your head wounds.<eos> Wanna build a shrine to Rosa?<eos> Build it somewhere she had joy... not on this miserable bed where she lay dying of cancer.<eos> The woman went out like a champ.<eos> Tough fuckin' broad.
She was getting me punch.<eos> I haven't seen her for a while.<eos> Go look for your sister.<eos> Lucy?<eos> Lucy!<eos> Go look for your sister.<eos> Now, this is nice. Mmm.<eos> This makes me happy.<eos> Happy Mother's Day, Ma.<eos> Happy Mother's Day.
Aesthetics?<eos> Murder?<eos> I think Abe was crazy from the beginning.<eos> Was it from stress?<eos> Was it anger?<eos> Was he disgusted by what he saw as life's never-ending suffering?<eos> Or was he simply bored by the meaninglessness of day-to-day existence?<eos> He was so damn interesting.<eos> And different.<eos> And a good talker.
It seems like he really opened up to you.<eos> Everyone says he's not easy to get to know.<eos> Well, I definitely have not found that.<eos> Hey, can we just get off the topic of Abe Lucas?<eos> I mean, I must say, I'm not thrilled that you invited him out with us tomorrow night without asking me first.<eos> Well, he needs some human contact, Roy.<eos> Otherwise, he just sits in his room and broods.<eos> Yeah, but you can see why I might be jealous, no?<eos> That's silly.<eos> Famous last words.
Jesus.<eos> But you know, maybe if you like, I could try writing again for you.<eos> I mean, I'm not very good, but I might enjoy trying again for you.<eos> You know I'm in love with you.<eos> You think you are.<eos> What you are is in love with the romantic concept of being in love with your college professor.<eos> The correct road for you is with that terrific guy you're going with.<eos> Is that really what you think?<eos> I'll always be your friend.<eos> And even your poet laureate.
Who'd wanna kill a judge?<eos> Only everybody, every person he ever ruled against.<eos> But I think they looked into everybody that knew him.<eos> Including that woman that we heard, and they were all ruled out.<eos> That's why they think it might be a sick prank, or intended for someone else.<eos> But it was quick-acting poison, so they would have to drop it in the cup right there in the park.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> But not an easy thing to do, with a total stranger, in broad daylight, in a public place.<eos> Unless he was there with someone he knew, and trusted.<eos> - A friend.
I won't say anything.<eos> I won't say anything.<eos> But I...<eos> I believe that you think you did something morally worthwhile.<eos> - I did!<eos> - I do believe that.<eos> No, but I...<eos> But you can't, you can't justify it!<eos> You can't justify it with all this bullshit.<eos> With all this bullshit, French postwar rationalizing.
- We don't know.<eos> - Come on, who are we kidding?<eos> You know, I just, I can't...<eos> With the passage of time, the awful vividness of what I had experienced, gradually, very gradually, grew less and less traumatic.<eos> It helped having a boyfriend who was so loving and supportive.<eos> Every now and then, I reflected on the whole episode.<eos> And with hindsight, gained some perspective about life and love, and who I was.<eos> I even experienced, for one terrifying moment, the closeness of death.<eos> The whole thing had been quite a lesson.<eos> A painful lesson.
So I have my answer.<eos> I'm not betraying you, Father.<eos> Indeed, you are not.<eos> You are betraying her... your sister.<eos> My dear, sweet Amelia murdered by my monster of a brother.<eos> That is what has made me what I am.<eos> And you too, I can see.<eos> I just need to go.<eos> Before you depart, let me give you one more piece of fatherly wisdom.<eos> Fatherly wisdom?
- We just...<eos> - Do what she says and shut your mouth.<eos> Robert, this goes for you, too.<eos> It goes for all of us.<eos> Paul.<eos> We all gave up our lives in the old world to join David Pilcher on this journey of his.<eos> And it's working.<eos> In town this year, there were more pregnancies than ever before in Wayward Pines.<eos> The future, our First Generation, that is the future for all of us, our duty to mankind.<eos> Not to David Pilcher.
And you count yourself a real friend, do you?<eos> I'll tell him - and by the blood of Christ, Lord Chancellor, he'll find it a consolation as he sits in exile and wonders why you slander him to the King.<eos> ~ Gentlemen...<eos> ~ No, let's have this straight.<eos> Thomas here says, "I'd spend my life in the church, if I had a choice.<eos> "I'm devoted to things of the spirit.<eos> "I care nothing for wealth.<eos> "The world's esteem is nothing to me."<eos> So how is it I come back to London and find you've become Lord Chancellor?<eos> Lord Chancellor.
Yeah, you see? You think that's barmy.<eos> Spies, Russia.<eos> I can't always be writing about the North.<eos> "I was born and brought up in Leeds, where my father was a butcher." "And as a boy, I would often go out on the bike with the orders."<eos> It's not Proust.<eos> It's not even J.B. Priestley.<eos> The houses in the Crescent were built as villas for the Victorian middle class. And their basements are now being enlarged by couples who are liberal in outlook, but not easy with their newfound prosperity.<eos> Guilt, in a word. Which means that in varying degrees, they tolerate Miss Shepherd.<eos> Their consciences absolved by her presence.<eos> Merry Christmas!
Mind you, you're going down the same road.<eos> Me?<eos> No cloth on the table.<eos> No holder for the toilet roll.<eos> Given time, I could have this place spotless.<eos> You've got a home.<eos> You won't want to live here.<eos> Where does she go to the lav?<eos> It has something to do with plastic bags.<eos> What sort of plastic bags?
- You've not met her. Do you want to?<eos> - Oh. No.<eos> No.<eos> With her being educated I wouldn't know what to say.<eos> - Oh. Give us a kiss! - Oh.<eos> - When will you be coming up next?<eos> - Soon.<eos> The thing is. I keep seeing a car in the car park.<eos> That's slightly to be expected, isn't it?<eos> At night.
No, I don't want you to go to all that trouble.<eos> I'll just have half a cup.<eos> I have to go to mass.<eos> - Well, you're not fit.<eos> - Here.<eos> It's an anniversary and a day of obligation.<eos> Who for?<eos> A saint?<eos> No.<eos> A young man.
She said I'd come up a treat.<eos> I bought you these.<eos> Flowers?<eos> What do I want with flowers?<eos> They... They only die.<eos> I've got enough on my plate without flowers.<eos> Why, you won't often have been given flowers.<eos> Who says'?<eos> I've had bigger flowers than these.<eos> And with ribbons on.
So, figure out the hell why, already.<eos> Nobody beats Tyler.<eos> At anything.<eos> He's not the fastest rising stock analyst on the Street for nothing.<eos> It's how we got all of this.<eos> But you said he changed.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just suddenly became more... aggressive.<eos> More ambitious.
Thank you, sir.<eos> I am much recovered.<eos> Look, you've probably not had time to think about very much, let alone your career.<eos> ~ Sir?<eos> ~ But sometimes a watershed moment can lead to reflection.<eos> And I found myself, this morning, wondering if you'd ever had any interest in joining the higher ranks of the civil service.<eos> You'd need to pass some exams, I'm afraid, and the hours can be penitential.<eos> But, I want you to ask yourself a question.<eos> "In a few years' time, what do I want to be?"<eos> Magistrate?
I wish to ask - do you wish to be free?<eos> When is it enough?<eos> We can truly say,<eos> "This is what it means to be free."<eos> The "something is better than nothing" school of enfranchisement.<eos> That is more dangerous than no enfranchisement at all.<eos> "Take this for now and we will talk about the rest later"?<eos> That is how you coax a child into doing your will.<eos> It is not how you engage with a people.<eos> A nation.
Mr Jakov, isn't it?<eos> We met in Paris a few months back.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you, it's just here I was and then there you were.<eos> - I never forget a face.<eos> - Antony Dimmond.<eos> - Nice to be remembered.<eos> - You're hard to forget.<eos> What are you doing in Florence?<eos> Are you working with Roman?<eos> Dr Fell?
Get some women in here.<eos> Get my wife in this seat, we've got nine kids, the first squawk she'd stop the whole shebang.<eos> Nine kids.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I have enough saved up to give 'em each a pair of socks if the electricity gets me.<eos> You're a brave man, Jim.<eos> All right, next subject's due.<eos> I should get going.<eos> ♪ Some enchanted evening ♪
Why haven't we met before?<eos> Stanley, why do you feel compelled to dwell on the negative aspects of obedience?<eos> Why must you focus on its destructive potential?<eos> Obedience isn't necessarily an instrument of evil.<eos> I think we can both agree, looking at recent history, the history that brought you to this country, a history in which we see abusive power assuming unprecedented murderous dimensions.<eos> Why does your experiment give me a dirty feeling?<eos> He didn't expect these results.<eos> He tried to change the conditions so that people would refuse to obey.<eos> Ah. We met in a library.<eos> Oh, him, not him.
Eugene works?<eos> Yes.<eos> He left a few days.<eos> Sometimes I feel I never see him.<eos> It's not easy being the wife of a lineman.<eos> Or niece.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> You got great kids, a husband, a beautiful home.<eos> Since Eugene returned from Iraq, it's more...<eos> As before, between us.
Where you going?<eos> Make my suitcase.<eos> I'm leaving soon.<eos> You're kidding!<eos> You just got back.<eos> - Can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Have you spent time with my wife?<eos> Yes, it was seen.<eos> With your friends too?
You just got back.<eos> - Can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Have you spent time with my wife?<eos> Yes, it was seen.<eos> With your friends too?<eos> My Friends?<eos> Eugene, stop bothering Bailey.<eos> I see too your friends hang out here.<eos> With my friends.
- Not stay here, you!<eos> Get out.<eos> Duncan, are you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - My God.<eos> I'm pissed.<eos> It'll take a long time to heal.<eos> I have it?<eos> Yes, with pleasure.<eos> - With pleasure.
Beau is Pok Chop.<eos> A pole fell on Hunter.<eos> Russell, is a chainsaw.<eos> We arrive.<eos> Follow the line and found the breaker.<eos> Well, boss.<eos> This is the friends I made when you were not there.<eos> Have you spent time with my wife?<eos> Yes, it was seen.<eos> With your friends too?
"Falling Angels" Part 2 of 2<eos> As I'm sure you're all aware, these are indeed serious incidents but Transport For London has increased security and we are taking all the precautions we can.<eos> Yes, the victims had all taken Tube journeys, but there is no reason to panic or avoid using the underground.<eos> Our advice is to go about your business as normal and if you see anything untoward, please report to station staff.<eos> In the meantime, be vigilant and be safe.<eos> So four murders?<eos> Potentially four, Ma'am - we're not sure about Israel Eze.<eos> All with the same MO and the public isn't informed until just now, and I wasn't told until this morning.<eos> - Well, with respect, Ma'am...<eos> - With respect?
Foster care.<eos> Then they find him a family.<eos> All right.<eos> OK. So maybe Beamish is a target because he fathered the kid,<eos> Jamal because he recommended him to be adopted...<eos> And Rosemary?<eos> Her husband said that she used to be a teacher for a while, right?<eos> Always a carer, that kind of person.<eos> So what did she do before the church?<eos> Social work.
And, finally, if all goes well, your responsibilities might include allocating trend jewelry, and helping us implement our cardigan story for spring.<eos> Oh, my God, I love cardigans, first of all.<eos> Um, also, I really don't want to boast, but I'm a little bit of an expert when it comes to trend jewelry.<eos> And maybe, like, trends in general.<eos> Perfect, perfect.<eos> Just perfect.<eos> Well, now that I've done my little dog and pony show, do you have any questions for me?<eos> Um, not really.<eos> This interview was super informative.<eos> And fun, right?
I had no idea what happened to you and then I finally find you and you won't even tell me anything!<eos> Sarah, I can't!<eos> It's too dangerous, for you and for the team!<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> This island is not what it seems.<eos> You have to take the others and go, now!<eos> No.<eos> You owe me an explanation.<eos> And you owe our baby.<eos> Our... what?
They left me for dead and I dragged myself back here.<eos> I've seen angry mobs before.<eos> This was something else.<eos> They were... blank.<eos> - Like a trance?<eos> - Maybe some kind of brainwashing.<eos> Cults are notorious for their mind control techniques.<eos> Their eyes...<eos> the pupils were darting side to side.<eos> - Quick, repetitive movements.
I remember.<eos> That was nearly... thirty years ago.<eos> That's why my mother brought me here.<eos> The riots.<eos> The outbreaks.<eos> She said that the world was no longer a fit place to raise a child.<eos> Like I said, smart woman.<eos> And it's only gotten worse.<eos> Maybe you'll find a cure.<eos> Not at this rate.
He was in the botany lab, arguing with Amy and brewing up some kind of foul-smelling - plant stew, got it!<eos> - Great, throw it down.<eos> - Alright, look out.<eos> - What kind of plant stew?<eos> I don't know, long stems, big purple flowers?<eos> Monk's hood, also known as aconitum.<eos> That's a deadly paralytic.<eos> Why would he...<eos> It's a... thinning.<eos> - A what?
Remember a time when you had what you wanted.<eos> When you felt complete.<eos> When you weren't hiding or lying.<eos> When you were yourself.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You can.<eos> Stop hiding.<eos> Accept your truth.<eos> When I was sick.<eos> With NARVIK.

I'm not sure yet.<eos> This is a painting of the Mother Tree.<eos> I might be able to use reference points to determine its location.<eos> Assuming the painting's true to life.<eos> We have no way of knowing if it's accurate.<eos> Well, Michael was a geneticist, but over the centuries, he was also an artist, a cartographer and an astronomer.<eos> - The man had a lot of time on his hands.<eos> - Landscapes change, mountains erode, and, uh, forests die, but one thing stays the same, the stars.<eos> Do you remember that weekend in Yosemite?<eos> - With the leaky tent?
Gacha bet Pablo that not even a German scientist could fool his dog.<eos> - Search.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Your prize dog didn't even stop.<eos> There's no coke in that boat.<eos> Come here.<eos> It's blended right into the fiberglass hull.<eos> Give me the money...<eos> the cash!
...who introduced me to the DEA.<eos> Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.<eos> These guys are R.I.P. "Retired in Place."<eos> - Eat me, Peña.<eos> - Paid vacation's over, fellas.<eos> Murphy and I are going to Medellín.<eos> We'll telex the T-3 reports.<eos> They go straight to Washington.<eos> We are going to Medellín?<eos> - Then the Mil Group.
Thank you.<eos> I took a course at the University of Antioquia.<eos> How long you been at the comuna?<eos> Just a few weeks.<eos> Is your husband gonna help us here, too?<eos> I saw him when he dropped you off.<eos> What does he do?<eos> Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial services at the US Embassy.<eos> - I fucked up.<eos> - How?
- Come on. Move the fuck back!<eos> - Get your hands--<eos> - Get your fucking hands off me! - Hey!<eos> - You spying on me?<eos> - Relax, Murphy!<eos> Who the fuck were you talking to?<eos> The fuck is she?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Who were you talking to, huh?<eos> Peña.
All right, let's go!<eos> They want war, we'll give them war!<eos> The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.<eos> He was a member of Eta.<eos> Never heard of 'em?<eos> They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.<eos> They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.<eos> Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.<eos> Eta was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.<eos> The man behind those bombs?
Beloved countrymen, the New Liberalism party is the only force in Colombia that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.<eos> "There are three ways the narcotraffickers...<eos> - try to weaken extradition." - ...try to weaken extradition.<eos> - "Bribery..." - Bribery...

No, ma'am.<eos> Agent Peña claims to have an informant that can testify to that effect, but he hasn't brought him forward.<eos> In my book, there's only two of them that know that.<eos> And one of them is Elisa Alvaro, girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.<eos> The other one is Ernesto Sobrino, a radical priest who gave shelter to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos comuna.<eos> Is one of these people your informant?<eos> Ambassador, this is... unofficial wiretap information.<eos> We, uh, intercepted a discussion between narcos.<eos> What?<eos> Which narcos?
Oh, my God.<eos> "Where were you?"<eos> "Where have you been, son?" I would yell out.<eos> "In the mountains, Mama."<eos> "Higher than the clouds, Auntie," Gustavo would say, laughing.<eos> He...<eos> He always wanted to go farther.<eos> He always did.<eos> But with you.<eos> Only with you.
You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail...<eos> maybe here in Colombia.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I won't ask you or Javier Peña to cross any line you haven't already crossed.<eos> So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.<eos> There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar.<eos> The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police... people with resources who need to be unified.<eos> They want vengeance.<eos> - And you'll help them get it?<eos> - With your help.
- Mm.<eos> - But we said no, and told him you wouldn't take less than 12.<eos> So he offered ten, and we felt that was a fair deal.<eos> Offered you three million?<eos> He was feeling us out.<eos> He knew we wouldn't accept that.<eos> If he really respected me, he would be grateful if I accepted 20.<eos> That's right, boss.<eos> Ask for 20.<eos> In one shot.
I adore him.<eos> But the thing is, I don't know what's going on with him these days.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's depressed.<eos> We're here in a Jacuzzi... free.<eos> - Do you love me? - Oh...<eos> Stop fucking around.<eos> You make me angry.<eos> Against orders, we did high-altitude flyovers of the prison<eos> - with our infrared cameras.
Do you think the DEA is capable of leaking the photos to the media?<eos> The DEA is capable of anything.<eos> That's why we have to do something now.<eos> At one time, Escobar... used to own all of Colombia.<eos> Now he's just the owner of his own prison.<eos> If I had to choose between prostitutes at La Catedral... or bombings in the country...<eos> I would be eternally grateful to these women.<eos> Happy birthday, Pablo!<eos> - Watch your step.<eos> - Careful with the little girl!
What is difficult for me?<eos> Well, managing all of this.<eos> That's why you hired us.<eos> - So we can manage it and look after it. - Mm.<eos> You trust us, right?<eos> I understand this makes you anxious-- - Do I look anxious?<eos> - No, I didn't mean that.<eos> - You said with certainty that--<eos> - I think you're the one who's anxious. - We didn't do shit, Pablo!<eos> With that tone of yours...
How stupid is it that my mother only got interested in pops when he went all caveman on that dude?<eos> I know.<eos> That tough-guy stuff is so stupid.<eos> Totally.<eos> I mean, you weren't stupid.<eos> You weren't stupid at all.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Nope.<eos> That guy was kind of tall.<eos> Real big.
I mean, I am an evolved woman with multiple degrees, but there is just this primal part of me that really wanted you to take that guy out.<eos> And it's killing me that I didn't.<eos> Hey, before we were married, I would have been the first guy to jump into a fight.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But I can't now.<eos> I've got too much to lose...<eos> You, the kids, my "s" class.<eos> Ow. Baby, I want you to know that if anything or anyone ever really threatened you or the kids, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to protect you.<eos> I know that.<eos> And I wouldn't want you to go back to being the person that would fight two guys over mustard.<eos> Two guys?

Then take a deep breath.<eos> Yup. Good girl.<eos> - Ow. - Alright, sit down.<eos> Put a little color on you.<eos> - I'm Jaz.<eos> - I'm Sarah.<eos> Close.<eos> Sweetie, you don't wanna use your real name here, okay?<eos> You don't want these customers knowing anything about you.<eos> Close.
Just a few things.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Alright, see ya.<eos> Bye, Sarah.<eos> So far, most of the work on octopus intelligence has been carried out on..<eos> Stromboli may offer a natural habitat.. Here you go,madame.<eos> What is it about the octopus' intelligence? I wanna be an animal too.<eos> - I know what you'd be.<eos> - What?<eos> - A meerkat.
Of course you are.<eos> Of course you're my wife.<eos> Do you... accept me as your wife?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> What...<eos> Madam, madam. We must make haste. Please.<eos> You renounce all other wives?<eos> Bell, of course I do.<eos> Of course.<eos> With all my heart.
With your permission, madam, we would like to write to Mr Strange.<eos> Yes. Please!<eos> Mr Segundus, Mr Honeyfoot?<eos> Excuse us, ma'am.<eos> I don't know, he's been going round markets pinching, shouting all sorts of nonsense about "Raven King".<eos> I need all of you to bring him.<eos> ~ What is the matter?<eos> ~ Madman.<eos> I've met you before.<eos> And you.
Ooh, ooh, we don't do that.<eos> I hate it here!<eos> I hate it!<eos> Hey. Oh.<eos> Okay, tough guy.<eos> Adam?<eos> Adam?<eos> Play with Hugo.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - No whining.
Did he really say that?<eos> Oh, Hugo, you can't use that bat.<eos> You got to use the wiffle ball bat.<eos> I want to use this bat.<eos> It's fine, you guys.<eos> Let him use it.<eos> He can't even hit anything anyway.<eos> All right, Hugo, you ready?<eos> Age-wise, I would say you're, like, 28.<eos> And a half.

Hey, hey, hey, relax.<eos> You sick bastard.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Okay, easy, easy.<eos> What have you done?<eos> You hit my child!<eos> Your son was out of control!<eos> You didn't see him swinging the bat at my kid, huh?<eos> Not make it worse!<eos> Not in front of the kids!
It was thrilling. Mm-hmm, hilarious, opaque, bitter, evil.<eos> Mike Nichols loved it.<eos> But now she's doing this.<eos> (Ben) Say what you want, that show's the only thing Sean and I have date night for.<eos> We order in Second Avenue Deli and binge-watch.<eos> You're saving my relationship.<eos> I know that the show is funny, but I...<eos> I don't know, I just find it terribly sad.<eos> (Anouk) Oh, Mom, please. Not...<eos> Sad?
I never knew you to pass up a glass of holiday...<eos> [Chuckles] Cheer.<eos> You know you're going to be... You're going to be fine, don't you?<eos> No one knows that.<eos> Chances are, you will be.<eos> You'll be utterly fine. Hmm?<eos> Most of us are for a while, at least.<eos> And sometimes that while lasts a very long time.<eos> Meet Olive.<eos> Or Oliver.
- Yep.<eos> Fracking.<eos> - That's right - fracking.<eos> I know you're all part of this.<eos> And... what exactly is 'this'?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You.<eos> You disappear - and just as suddenly, you reappear.<eos> - My sister's been away backpacking.<eos> - Backpacking.
- Who wouldn't?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> It wasn't about walking.<eos> We've both used magic to try and change this, but I just wanted things between us to be the way they were before.<eos> Like that?<eos> Yeah, pretty much.<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> Ley lines are invisible lines around the world...<eos> - That connect places...<eos> - Of mystical significance, exactly.
It's not that simple.<eos> - I should go, this is...<eos> - Felix doesn't see it, does he?<eos> - See what?<eos> - How things could be different.<eos> You don't know a thing about my brother or me.<eos> I know what it's like to have a sibling who wants to keep you safe.<eos> But I also know what it feels like to be...<eos> Suffocated.<eos> - Useless.
Ten years ago, you cast a spell to get me magic and you got stuck... nowhere!<eos> It would be different this time - I know how to do it.<eos> If I said yes, how would it work?<eos> Ley lines are invisible lines around the world of...<eos> Of mystical significance. Exactly.
First we have to activate it.<eos> Elements we call together, erase and quell forever.<eos> Elements we call together, erase and quell forever!<eos> I'm me! (Laughs)<eos> And I am most certainly not you.<eos> What have you been doing to me?<eos> I'm starving!<eos> Didn't you feed me?<eos> Do you think we can use the talisman to talk to Andy?<eos> With this altar...
So they tell me.<eos> Who was President the last time you saw a doctor?<eos> Bush.<eos> Yeah, you should probably get that checked out.<eos> Did they take care of Griffin?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rolled him out of here handcuffed to a stretcher.<eos> Just like his big brother here.<eos> High-five, buddy.<eos> Maybe next time.
Hey, baby.<eos> Change your mind about that drink?<eos> Victor Abbott is inside my house!<eos> Hello, Mrs. Danvers.<eos> Help!<eos> You come here with me.<eos> Shh.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> On the floor!
And you and Amanda got that huge fish.<eos> Do you remember that'?<eos> CORKYCORKY: anyone there? !<eos> B-MAN:<eos> How are you feeling? CORKYCORKY: Crap.<eos> B-MAN:<eos> No one believes her no one believes whores<eos> FELIX THE CAT: That they even dare show their faces...<eos> CORKYCORKY: They should fuck off B-MAN: Maybe we can help them to...<eos> CORKYCORKY: D FELIX THE CAT:
We sleep together, have showers together...<eos> - Enough, enough... - Okay.<eos> Tonight you're staying at my place.<eos> I don't like sleeping alone.<eos> You can sleep on the sofa... Wherever you want.<eos> What are we going to do here?<eos> If you want, you can wait at the park.<eos> It won't be fun.<eos> Who did you say you talked to?<eos> A woman.
He's a scientist.<eos> He looks at stuff.<eos> I can't remember what now, but he said when I'm older he'll show me the funny-looking buildings.<eos> No, I can do it...<eos> I promise!<eos> Harper, time to get out of those wet clothes.<eos> No, I don't want to!<eos> I'm still learning all the rules!<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> A friend.
I'm with the FBI.<eos> I'm sorry to do this, but I need to ask you about your son.<eos> This morning, a little girl tried to hurt her mother.<eos> She said she was playing a game.<eos> "You'll get through this."<eos> That's what people say, don't they?<eos> They said it to me.<eos> It really pissed me off.<eos> What exactly does it mean to "get through this"?<eos> Through what?
It's a magical book.<eos> You don't need to read it.<eos> The magic you believe is now the magic you create.<eos> Really?<eos> You have opened the magic connection between the book and the key.<eos> As long as they remain with you, you have the power.<eos> - Hey, Mom.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> What are you and Ozzy up to?<eos> Ah, nothing.
Good question. Yeah.<eos> It's for the first "D" in the DENNIS system.<eos> See, the girls will see the leash, and I'll say,<eos> "I've got a rescue dog outside," thereby,<eos> "D," demonstrating my value as a compassionate man.<eos> Later, when we go outside, the dog will be missing.<eos> I'll become hysterical and suggest that, maybe, the dog ran back to the apartment.<eos> Then we will go back to the apartment.<eos> The dog won't be there, either, and the girl will console me.<eos> With sex.
You want me to, I'll find out, but I--<eos> You- - You can't be hanging around with him.<eos> So I can come home, but I can't see my friend?<eos> You know, you wanna be part of the family business... you gotta have responsibility for the family name.<eos> We all do.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> You said you needed some cash,<eos> I came through for you.<eos> That is some quality scratch from just a little boat ride.<eos> You happy with your take?
Because I'm very skeptical of anyone who wants to help others.<eos> I mean, there's always some sort of hidden agenda.<eos> 100%.<eos> Mother Teresa loved being famous.<eos> Well, what's a job that I could have that helps people that doesn't disgust you?<eos> Basedonthislook,Iwould say...<eos> - bus and truck with "Thoroughly Modern Millie"...<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ice Capades...<eos> - Clock maker.

You sure you're ok?<eos> PINK MOON<eos> - This stuffed owl is watching us.<eos> Pleased to see you Mr. Owl.<eos> Get it out.<eos> I used to spend hours between open trees In my uncle's maple syrup farm in Maine we've spent the summer there.<eos> We call it sugarbush.<eos> - Sugarbush...<eos> My cousin and I need to get up in the middle of the night to Tap the trees.<eos> - Why at night?
According to Jimmy, she had an eye for the victim.<eos> You're sure one of them killed Nathan?<eos> Well, it seems likely.<eos> We won't know for sure until we get into the game.<eos> Well, how'd it go with Holiday?<eos> You in?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He needs a different kind of motivation.<eos> What kind?<eos> Scotch on the rocks, please.
It's a shot in the dark, but it can't hurt to take a look.<eos> We'll go up and back, up and back, till we cover the area.<eos> If Nicky smells something worth checking out, he'll bark twice like this.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> What did Gabriel say to you?<eos> He said, "white bones wrapped in red clay."<eos> I know that.<eos> What else, and what did he say to make you believe in him?<eos> He said she's okay.<eos> Who?

Hey, kiddo.<eos> I got you something.<eos> I'm on the door until 2:00, and then Truls takes over.<eos> Why don't you go home, get some proper sleep?<eos> I've been told it's family only, just you and your wife.<eos> That's right.<eos> What should I say to the Spanish girl if she comes back?<eos> She said she was a friend of the family.<eos> She was here?<eos> Yes, last night.
Liam?<eos> I think he's drifting.<eos> Give it a moment.<eos> Be quick please. I will.<eos> I will.<eos> Liam, were you with someone that night?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> How did you get across town?<eos> Walk.
On the way back, I saw a huge bear down on the foreshore dragging its kill across the-the rocks and the-the ice floes.<eos> I knew at once what this was going to be.<eos> I pulled over, took my rifle, ran down onto the foreshore.<eos> The bear... Was leaning over its kill.<eos> And...<eos> And in the split second I took aim, I could see that what it was tearing apart wasn't a seal.<eos> It was a man.<eos> The bear was disemboweling and eating Billy Pettigrew.<eos> And Pettigrew... Was screaming.<eos> Inhuman screams.
You shoot to stop, just like you would a bear.<eos> It kills him... that's his fault for not stopping when you told him.<eos> I know.<eos> Center of the body.<eos> Hey, Ingrid, you tell him, he'll stop.<eos> No shooting necessary.<eos> Jason Donnelly's smarter than a bear.<eos> We set off at first light.<eos> If the prick in a stupid coat turns up looking to get involved, I want you to tell him as politely as possible to fuck off.<eos> With pleasure.
They also say that it's a ferocious irritant of the urinary tract.<eos> You're not married, are you?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm not.<eos> And you don't have too much of a life, do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> Nope.<eos> That can make men very...<eos> Focused.<eos> Dangerous.
You were nice earlier. With Carrie.<eos> Kind.<eos> She's a good kid.<eos> We need to find her dad.<eos> She says I'm like her big sister.<eos> Do you like that idea?<eos> Yes.<eos> Space and light. That was all I wanted when I came here.<eos> I haven't handled things well, Elena.<eos> What things?

I am a broad-minded citizen of the world, not one of your petty nationalists.<eos> Good night.<eos> Night, Ingrid.<eos> Treasure under the ice.<eos> That's a map.<eos> Yeah, you haven't a clue, have you?<eos> See, that is the beauty of this.<eos> There's a million quid there. And you can't even see it.<eos> 0-1-6-9... Hey, hey, hey...<eos> Yuri. Drinks!

Have you religion?<eos> Are you offering it?<eos> - Do you require it?<eos> - I never have. Heh.<eos> Then I shan't offer.<eos> And I would be a poor advocate.<eos> The almighty and I have a challenging past.<eos> - Not sure we're speaking these days.<eos> I read the Bible when I was younger but then I discovered Wordsworth and the old platitudes and parables seemed anaemic.<eos> Even unnecessary.
Used to expel the stillborn baby, and bring sleeping terrors in the right amounts.<eos> Solanum nigrum. Nightshade botanical.<eos> Remember it.<eos> Were you born with the gift?<eos> I learned it.<eos> You were born with it.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I see your pain, girl.<eos> You always been like you are.<eos> Even as a little thing.
Miss Ives, I've a... personal favor to ask of you.<eos> Would you mind accompanying me somewhere tomorrow?<eos> On, well... an errand of sorts.<eos> Of course, Doctor.<eos> - May I call at 10:00?<eos> - Gladly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Watching.<eos> For what?
On, well... an errand of sorts.<eos> Of course, Doctor.<eos> - May I call at 10:00?<eos> - Gladly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Watching.<eos> For what?<eos> Those things that hunt at night.<eos> Lions.
Not a lemon yellow, I hope.<eos> That would be alarming.<eos> More of a turmeric, would you say?<eos> Yes.<eos> I heard the most wonderful story about Mr. Gladstone.<eos> That almost every evening he goes out walking... and if he comes across a fallen woman he stops and talks to her and gives her money.<eos> A very kind man.<eos> Anyone who's kind to the suffering deserves a proper place in the museum, I say.<eos> And what about the others you work on?<eos> Which?

- I suppose.<eos> Your War Department hasn't been particularly forthcoming with records.<eos> Too busy invading Haiti and killing Red Indians at the moment I should think.<eos> But I'll keep at it.<eos> You do that.<eos> It's been a pleasure, Inspector.<eos> But I've got shopping to do if you'd excuse me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Be careful, Mr. Chandler.<eos> With the bullets.
It was much like the Mariner's Inn.<eos> They were always tearing pieces off and stealing away.<eos> With a purpose... to eat.<eos> Not always.<eos> Sometimes a shock would run through the animals, like a tremor, for no reason at all.<eos> A kind of bloodlust.<eos> I often wondered if they remembered it afterwards... this frenzy.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I've no experience with lions, I'm glad to say.<eos> Well, other predators then?

I don't know that I'm made for company.<eos> I think I'm made for something like the moors.<eos> And for doing such things as hurt even as they help.<eos> She called me her little scorpion and only said my name aloud once before she was murdered tied to that tree outside.<eos> I've never liked trees since.<eos> Not a one.<eos> Thank you, I will go upstairs.<eos> For years now, Sir Malcolm and I have had a very private relationship.<eos> In a way, I think I savoured that.<eos> The intensity of it.
I need to go out.<eos> What?<eos> Out where?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> Just bolt the door when I'm gone.<eos> Do you know how to shoot?<eos> - What? No.<eos> - I'll teach you.<eos> - When will you be back?<eos> - Morning.
We can whisper about those things that hurt us.<eos> You need to learn to protect yourself.<eos> You haven't done this before?<eos> No, I suppose it just comes naturally.<eos> Why am I not surprised?<eos> No, no.<eos> Let me.<eos> It's a different thing when you're firing at something that's alive.<eos> How do you learn that?<eos> Experience.
No one here is above guilt, Mr. Lyle.<eos> We need every ally for the night ahead.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Sir Malcolm needs our help.<eos> We will go to him.<eos> No.<eos> - Ethan, we have to help.<eos> - No.<eos> We can't go tonight.<eos> - Or any night.
- Oh, please.<eos> There's some things I can't do by myself, as much as that galls me.<eos> And you are my true friend.<eos> Please.<eos> No one will know.<eos> I promise.<eos> Uh, this way then.<eos> But let's be quick.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> A cell... with a heavy iron door.
You and Mr. Lyle take the front.<eos> We'll find another way in.<eos> And then what do we do?<eos> Kill everyone you don't recognize.<eos> - All right then.<eos> If you would.<eos> Far be it from me.<eos> Don't let me hurt our friends.<eos> Promise me.<eos> On your life.
Because my assistants need to know all my secrets.<eos> Magic is all about distracting an audience.<eos> And what better distraction than you two?<eos> Why?<eos> Because we're freaks?<eos> No...<eos> Because you're beautiful.<eos> You listen to me carefully.<eos> When I first saw you two, I was... so taken.<eos> And not just by your beauty.
I don't even know who this is.<eos> I already told them everything...<eos> Stanley.<eos> Elsa...<eos> Come on...<eos> Talk to them.<eos> What about... what about uh, your... the dream?<eos> Hollywood!<eos> I'm afraid... that's all it is.<eos> Just a dream.
I did it.<eos> Send me to the chair!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to take inventory.<eos> I'm your new owner.<eos> Where's Elsa?<eos> She's gone.<eos> Off to follow her dreams.<eos> Elsa sold us again.<eos> For $10,000 in cash.
She's gone.<eos> Off to follow her dreams.<eos> Elsa sold us again.<eos> For $10,000 in cash.<eos> A pittance.<eos> Everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.<eos> And I want to see what's mine.<eos> Has it always been a dream of yours, sir?<eos> To be in show business?<eos> A dream.
Gayle made me promise to get a quick picture just for old times' sake.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Garry had a good idea.<eos> Oh, the lighting's all wrong.<eos> I'm gonna send you a glamour shot.<eos> Just Photoshop me in later.<eos> I'm not gonna show up in that picture anyway because I'm a vampire.<eos> Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin,<eos> Johnny Karate, or my new character,<eos> Sergeant Thunderfist, MD?

Mum and Dad'll go mad.<eos> They're not going to know, are they?<eos> Cos they're with the girls.<eos> ~ You always go too far.<eos> ~ I don't think I go far enough.<eos> Is it starting again?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Because this is how it starts.<eos> With you.
Why are you here?<eos> We've got to go round your house. We've got to go and see your mum.<eos> Krystal...<eos> I did such a bad thing, last night.<eos> Just listen.<eos> You remember you said your mum would want to look after me and a baby if there was one?<eos> ~ I'd move in, and she'd look after us? Yeah? ~ Whoa...<eos> Thing is, Fats, I'm going to have your baby.<eos> You said your mum would want to look after us.<eos> Me and a baby and Robbie.
Surprise!<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's a big deal.<eos> So my promotion is official.<eos> We need to find a place in D.C. because we're gonna be splitting our time.<eos> I guess now is as good a time as any make my announcement.<eos> Joe and I just closed on a house in Seattle.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Cheers.
So, you know, lose a battle, win the war.<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> It's the way to go.<eos> Look, the Pie-mary is retrogressive and misogynistic, and if you participate, we will have no choice but to protest you and Ben at the event.<eos> Hope you like pies... in yo' face.<eos> Metaphorically.<eos> We'll be civil.<eos> Elise, there is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope, and my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights.<eos> (Ben) Babe, the oven's ready.<eos> Chop-chop!
(Ron) They must have moved it during the remodel.<eos> It's probably in basement storage.<eos> To the basement!<eos> - Tighter!<eos> - Are you sure, dude?<eos> Yeah, dude.<eos> Tighter.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Do what exactly?<eos> Nothing.
We say a few oaths, do some trust falls, smoke a little blue calamus root out of a peace pipe...<eos> Piece of cake.<eos> Hmm. Well, good luck with that.<eos> Any idea where we can find an elder?<eos> Well, that depends.<eos> You got any interest in meeting my grandma?<eos> Davina:<eos> Wake up. Wake up.<eos> The one time I need you.<eos> Cami?
If you start feeding, you won't be able to stop, and then he's dead, and the rest of us still starve, all right?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I have been at war in the trenches starved with my men.<eos> If we fought through it then, you can now.<eos> We are gonna fight this hunger together.<eos> No gas mask or rations, but we got plenty of cocoa.<eos> Hmm, more dirt than cocoa, but it'll do.<eos> Corporal, sir...<eos> I know you're starving.<eos> Never one of us.
A single violent outburst at a filthy roadside cafe, and one never hears the end of it.<eos> Well, Cami has a way with minds plagued by demons, brother.<eos> You two can bond.<eos> Well, if you'll excuse me, I best be on my way.<eos> Rebekah should have already woken up in the body of angelica barker.<eos> Once she has cut the ties with Ms. Barker's former life, she'll make her way directly here.<eos> You should expect her shortly.<eos> You have no bloody idea who you're dealing with!<eos> Let me guess...<eos> The easter bunny.
Why?<eos> I know a little bit about Mikaelsons jumping into other people's bodies, mostly because your mother did it to me.<eos> So you must be that harvest girl.<eos> Cassie, is it?<eos> I'm in a bit of a bind here, so tell me how exactly does one go about breaking out of this joint?<eos> You can't break out.<eos> Once you're in, there's no leaving this place.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Surely someone's gotten out.<eos> Sure but not alive.
You'll never find her.<eos> You think you've won.<eos> Let's see how long that arrogance lasts, brother.<eos> You wolves are here because you want freedom, and I promise you if you stay you will be free, but we need as much help as we can get.<eos> My vamps and I are willing to stand with you against the witches.<eos> In return, all I want is a promise, that there will be peace between our sides after the wedding.<eos> You're the one who spent the last 100 years killing and cursing us.<eos> Which means you might want to listen to what I have to say.<eos> I see you're brokering a truce...<eos> Between mongrels and parasites.
We'll save our friends from whatever hell we've dragged them into, and that is the only thing that I can ask from you...<eos> Because I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, Hayley Marshall, and forcing you to love me isn't gonna be one of them...<eos> But I want to marry you, knowing everything that I know, and I-I hope to hell that you'll marry me.<eos> I need you to trust me.<eos> I can handle finding Rebekah.<eos> Brother, you are asking me to do nothing?<eos> Elijah, right now, the most important thing is that you are there, protecting hope.<eos> So be it.<eos> I shall remain here with the...<eos> Hopelessly courageous Camille.
Why would you feel that way?<eos> Did you think it was working between us?<eos> I mean, not all the time, but I really thought the things that weren't working, we could fix them.<eos> We tried this all different kinds of ways.<eos> I don't know any other ways.<eos> Do you?<eos> But it did work for a while, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it worked like a fuckin' charm, sometimes.<eos> What we had was... real, and it was beautiful and intense and weird and terrifying, and there was a time<eos> Ever.
Without them I'm lost in the woods.<eos> Totally alone.<eos> Andrew, if you're listening..<eos> ...please don't hurt them.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's all.<eos> 'Do you really think Campbell did it? '<eos> Right now, I just need to be with my family.<eos> Alone.
I know I'm the one that you really want.<eos> Just tell me where you are and I'll find a way to get there.<eos> But I have to know that you won't hurt them.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> The caller's in the house.<eos> Do not open this door for anyone.<eos> You stay down here.<eos> First floor is clear.<eos> Jason and Mr. DiLaurentis are with Hernandez.<eos> Okay.
You see what I mean?<eos> Oh, yeah, I see..<eos> '...remains the top suspect of the kidnapping case 'and he's presumed to be dangerous.'<eos> The four teen girls who were abducted..<eos> No one moves from that spot, you hear me?<eos> No sign of Alison or Andrew at the Campbell Farm.<eos> If you have any idea where she could be right now you better tell me before it's too late.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Look.<eos> 'Behind the reporter.'
That baby's got my daughter out to here and it's too late to Dyson it out of her.<eos> So I hope you're here for more than a clean conscience.<eos> I'm a concerned grandmother just like you are.<eos> Although you look nothing like a grandmother.<eos> Hispanic women have amazing skin.<eos> Let's hope the baby gets my complexion.<eos> What's it gettin' from you?<eos> I know that... nothing can ever undo what my son did, but... this child is part of my family.<eos> He's gonna live with my family.<eos> Your... husband?

Let's try this again in five, ladies.<eos> Don't sweat it, man.<eos> This is just how Americans like to waste time.<eos> Bad work?<eos> You were bad at being stupid.<eos> That is a good thing.<eos> You did good.<eos> You did good.<eos> What's wrong with them?<eos> Them, uh...
That's two shots, Vause.<eos> Alex.<eos> How am I back here, Piper?<eos> How could I let myself get back here?<eos> Alex, it's not your fault.<eos> And they call me crazy.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We will probably never be rich... and we'll most likely live in a place that's not that big, but we'll work hard and we'll love each other and... we'll find so much happiness that we won't even know what to do with it.<eos> We'll share it with our kid.<eos> Our kids.
I'm a part of a community... and I have a girlfriend.<eos> I have a girlfriend that I love.<eos> So, there.<eos> Saw that coming.<eos> So, does that mean you're officially...<eos> It means that I officially...<eos> have a girlfriend.<eos> Dear God.<eos> You know, I find myself saying that phrase, too, a lot.<eos> But with a different inflection and... breathier.
- Yeah, no shit.<eos> Guess what? - Hmm?<eos> I'm still taking their money.<eos> I renounce thee, Satan.<eos> Oh, bring that in.<eos> Yes!<eos> - Bunch of chumps. - Mmm.<eos> Tomorrow, we'll talk about flossing.<eos> - The string?<eos> - Yeah, with the string.
Hey, Nichols.<eos> You wanted out. You're getting out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> Hey, look at the bright side. Can't get any shittier.<eos> I don't know about that, Penn.<eos> I'm very resourceful.<eos> Mm, well, you know...<eos> Did you say goodbye to your people?<eos> What people?
You wanted out. You're getting out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> Hey, look at the bright side. Can't get any shittier.<eos> I don't know about that, Penn.<eos> I'm very resourceful.<eos> Mm, well, you know...<eos> Did you say goodbye to your people?<eos> What people?<eos> All the dykes and your mom.
There is a certain... hardness... to your overall... thing.<eos> Listen to you, being frank and honest. Good.<eos> Now, tell me how to soften things.<eos> I thought that you and Dmitri were kaput.<eos> That was not an invitation to pry into my life.<eos> A little beauty advice is all I'm after.<eos> Beauty comes from the inside.<eos> However... smudging the corner of your eyeliner, not spiking your hair, and a lighter lip couldn't hurt.<eos> Hey, Pearson.<eos> Morning.
- I like the way this one thinks.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Linda's been a real rock star when it comes to cost-saving initiatives.<eos> Well...<eos> So, Danny, how is everything up in min security?<eos> Not bad. Not bad.<eos> The... meal plan has been implemented.<eos> Everything running pretty smoothly so far.<eos> Well, except for our Jewish problem.<eos> Jewish problem?
I'm kidding.<eos> They doubled our order of slop this month, we can cover it.<eos> What's gotten into you?<eos> It's not your problem.<eos> She got man troubles.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so?<eos> Don't give it back when you're done.<eos> Not that kind of man.<eos> What other kind is there?<eos> The kind with tits.
Something's the matter.<eos> I can tell.<eos> I got this talent for knowing when things are bothering people.<eos> Nothing's bothering me.<eos> Yeah, something is.<eos> I can feel it in my elbow.<eos> All the women in my family got the knowing elbow.<eos> Yeah, well, something's bothering you, too.<eos> I can feel it in my toe.<eos> Which toe?
What do you say?<eos> You are the most amazing girl I have ever met, Lorna Morello.<eos> I mean, it should be the guy doing the asking, but I gotta say there's something kind of hot about you down on your knees like that.<eos> Yes.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Yes, I will. -Oh!<eos> I will marry you.<eos> I will marry you.<eos> I swear, I'm gonna be... such a good wife.<eos> -The best.

Come on, let me show you the dorm.<eos> All right, ladies, I've heard your complaints, and I have made arrangements for everybody to get paid, cash money.<eos> Someone on the outside will pick up a cash card.<eos> Get me the number, and then we'll start depositing funds into your accounts.<eos> I'm offering you eight bucks a pair, and I'm holding you all to quality control.<eos> There is no cutting corners.<eos> What about benefits, huh?<eos> - Benefits?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, what about all the, uh, flavor packets?
And then I turned to her in front of everybody, and I'm all...<eos> "Oh... and, by the way...<eos> Flaca, you're fired."<eos> That'll teach the little bitch not to instigate!<eos> - That's gross.<eos> - No, it was badass.<eos> - I'm out.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't wanna be involved.<eos> With what, the business?

What you care about is that you're illegally smuggling women's panties out of a women's prison.<eos> A story that is gonna get you free beer at any bar you choose for the rest of your pathetic anti-climax of a life.<eos> This caper is the most interesting goddamn thing that's ever happened to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Hey, wait...<eos> I was gonna get a handjob out of this?<eos> Think you can slide in a few good words for me?<eos> In between the widows and orphans or whatever.
Anywho, I took him right off my visitors' list after today.<eos> You are a real slut.<eos> Suzanne! That is not nice.<eos> But you seem so experienced.<eos> Well, yes.<eos> I...<eos> I guess.I suppose I, in a way I, but you--<eos> It is not nice to call somebody a slut.<eos> Then why do girls like it when men call them sluts during sex?<eos> Or bitches?
I like you.<eos> If you want ice cream, you just ask. Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's your favorite flavor?<eos> My favorite flavor is... double-fudge chocolate.<eos> Though I've never been able to understand how you can take chocolate, right, and then double it?<eos> And then fudge it?<eos> And it's so delicious.<eos> What's yours?<eos> Anything with rainbow sprinkles.
Auslander.<eos> I brought him back. He's inside.<eos> I'll be back soon.<eos> What is it?<eos> You brought him here.<eos> You're playing with our lives.<eos> I can show the Germans where you buried your notes about the camp!<eos> We get the weapons tonight.<eos> Be ready for tomorrow morning.<eos> In the morning?
No one will harm ye.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Do you really believe me?<eos> Aye.<eos> I believe you, Sassenach.<eos> Although it would have been a good deal easier if you'd only been a witch.<eos> Aye.<eos> Over the next several days, we rode hard.<eos> We were both determined to leave the castle and the trial far behind us, hopeful the distance would overshadow the questions that remained unanswered.<eos> And in front of the main house...
I am, by the way...<eos> Two guys at the same time.<eos> Mija!<eos> __<eos> _<eos> _<eos> No, no, no!<eos> __<eos> _<eos> Feliz navidad.
Sam felt it, too.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> I'm done with it!<eos> I want the truth!<eos> All right, go ahead.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> Go ahead and ask me.<eos> When did you start sleeping with Nate?<eos> This summer.
Because Jolene...<eos> Is a woman and Chad is a man.<eos> But I'm gonna ask you to forget everything you know about rape.<eos> Is a heinous act suffered by hundreds of thousands of victims yearly, some of whom Jolene has cared for.<eos> This is a crime not about sex.<eos> It's about power.<eos> And anyone can be a victim...<eos> Of slanderous allegations that are unfounded and could very well endanger her livelihood.<eos> For that reason, you should find Jolene Samuels guilty.<eos> Not guilty.
- No, I won't.<eos> But what I will do is...<eos> - You... you got a mom and dad?<eos> - My grandma.<eos> - You got a pet?<eos> - A guinea pig.<eos> - You?<eos> - Snake and a dog.<eos> - You live with your mom or dad?<eos> - My mom and my stepdad.
So shut up.<eos> Who votes for Aglaée?<eos> - Wow, a serious opponent.<eos> - Bravo, Aglaée.<eos> There aren't many girls participating.<eos> The newcomer can run.<eos> Benoit.<eos> We're going to the park with the boys.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> With those suckers?
There is a huge buffet.<eos> You have to say it now.<eos> I need to know 24 hours in advance.<eos> - Let's go together.<eos> - Okay, why not?<eos> - You pick me up at seven?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Where does he live?<eos> - Near the Eiffel Tower.
Marge?<eos> Hi, it's Grace.<eos> Listen, I can't do the silent auction.<eos> Because it's being sponsored by the law firm.<eos> Well, because Robert is divorcing me.<eos> Because he is a homosexual.<eos> With Sol.
I'm sorry, but we're blended.<eos> We have to be civil.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I just came here to pee.<eos> I didn't come here to work anything out with you.<eos> So just... just let me go so that I can pee.<eos> Please.<eos> I think it's going okay.<eos> Uh... you need help?<eos> - With what?
We have to be civil.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I just came here to pee.<eos> I didn't come here to work anything out with you.<eos> So just... just let me go so that I can pee.<eos> Please.<eos> I think it's going okay.<eos> Uh... you need help?<eos> - With what?<eos> - With dessert.
Wow.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think I'm going to really enjoy fucking you against this glass.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yeah, in front of all the neighbors.<eos> It's always kind of been a fantasy of mine.<eos> A little higher up than the fantasy, but...
Okay, hold on.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Got it.<eos> Okay, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> No hot chocolate for me.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Oh, aren't you guys always watching your weight?<eos> With your juice cleansing and your CrossFit?
Oh, you think so?<eos> You think you two are forever?<eos> I have no idea, but he... just asked me to move in with him.<eos> - Oh, wow!<eos> - So...<eos> Oh, so he's that guy.<eos> Got it.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that last night?<eos> It just happened, Mom.<eos> Just this morning.
- Don't tell me you don't like "Field of Dreams."<eos> - It's just... it's been a while.<eos> - Has it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just realized I don't know your stuff.<eos> Did my boxes get in okay?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> The delivery guys... they were hot, by the way...<eos> - Oh, nice.<eos> - Really hot.
Because everyone is so fucking flirty.<eos> Yeah, with you, which I love, because I've got you.<eos> Let's go, shall we?<eos> You want to leave, don't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe we should stay and watch.<eos> A little lookie-loo of some nookie-noo action?<eos> Why not?<eos> All right, Patrick.<eos> Easy on the punch.
Yeah, answer that.<eos> I need to piss.<eos> I'm goin piss and then we're gonna go, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, where you at?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Um, sorry.<eos> Just, we got into something.<eos> What kind of thing?
- Dad, you know work is important to me.<eos> - I know.<eos> You sent me to university to get a degree, not to find a husband.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I heard thunder, and rain.<eos> Maybe what you heard was the sound of your father's tears, thinking how soon he is going to have to give his daughter away.<eos> I thought you were happy I was getting married.<eos> Tears can be happy... and sad.<eos> We are born into this world the same way we shall leave it:<eos> alone.
You all right?<eos> Migraine.<eos> I'm like Grandpa Hassan up there.<eos> Cold and pickled?<eos> I dream big, like he did.<eos> Nothing petty, like you two.<eos> That's all you'll ever be, petty thieves.<eos> Not me.<eos> My next score is gonna be huge.<eos> Legendary.
So, any defining features?<eos> His lips were thin, but there was substance to them.<eos> They kind of grew from his mouth, like a secret he couldn't keep.<eos> So, thin lips...<eos> LIV: But expressive.<eos> In that they seemed to be working at not expressing anything.<eos> Mmm-hmm. There was something historic about his chin.<eos> I think the nose needs to be more alert.<eos> I thought you said it was soft and gradual, like a sand hill.<eos> But with an alertness.
We have all been friends for years.<eos> And how close are you and Lola?<eos> Very close.<eos> She's one of my dearest friends.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Nothing more than that.<eos> Not ever. She's totally devoted to Javier.<eos> Yeah, she did mention having dalliances outside of the marriage.<eos> Dalliances?<eos> With whom?
With whom?<eos> She didn't give any names.<eos> Sorry, I'm having trouble processing that.<eos> Javier was her entire universe.<eos> Lola loved him unconditionally, while Javier slept with every model in Seattle.<eos> You don't sound like a very big fan of your client.<eos> Oh, I was a huge fan.<eos> Some of the best times of my life were with Javier.<eos> He was a brilliant artist.<eos> Not a great husband.
(CLEARS THROAT) death's gonna be swell.<eos> Did I mention this batch is super fresh?<eos> First rule of brain club, you don't talk about brain club.<eos> There are some things worse than death.<eos> Tina?<eos> Will you bring my checkbook?<eos> So, I was wondering if you happened to exchange numbers with our new zombie friend.<eos> I wanted to see if he can come in for more tests.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Under your supervision, of course.
What do you mean, "attempted"?<eos> Oh, he wasn't able to take out any cash because he doesn't have any.<eos> It goes beyond insufficient funds.<eos> The man is broke.<eos> He's basically living off credit cards.<eos> Why would Lola cover for him?<eos> I plan on asking her that very question tonight.<eos> This art show... I should probably come as well.<eos> In case you need help with the art and the open bar.<eos> And possibly the models.

Wait!<eos> You need our help to find Brude.<eos> What if he could help us?<eos> What if he could get the dragon to fight on our side?<eos> Not poison.<eos> Ah.<eos> My uncle and I cut down five more bodies.<eos> Brude has driven every village into hiding and hanged the able-bodied men who won't join his army.<eos> We only want to live in peace.<eos> But between him and your accursed wall...
Kill me if you want.<eos> But the only good part of Drago left is in here!<eos> He shared his heart with me before he was cursed.<eos> But what are you gonna do? Give it back to him?<eos> I'm going to do what the code requires.<eos> Onward!<eos> We've lost the dragon!<eos> I've led you to a slaughter!<eos> Come this far, my dillie. I'm seeing the other side of that wall!<eos> Charge!
Maybe it's the food.<eos> It's not the food.<eos> The food is perfect.<eos> Hector's a genius.<eos> Can I sit next to you on the bus?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you want.<eos> Me and Emery are gonna sit next to each other on our bus.<eos> You're on a different bus because you're at a different school, so I don't know who you'll sit next to.<eos> Definitely not Emery, though.
It was the same woman from my dream, I'm sure of it.<eos> The same face.<eos> You gotta stop watching all those cop shows.<eos> They will mess you up.<eos> I feel like I know her, I just don't remember from where.<eos> Maybe someone from your criminal past.<eos> - I wasn't a criminal.<eos> - No.<eos> Activist.
But maybe just in case I could get your information.<eos> I mean, you never know.<eos> Well, she's coming at four today, so there's really no point, but, all right.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> What's the play?<eos> Okay, so her name is Kay Adams.<eos> She gonna interview another girl at four, okay?<eos> You get there first, head her off, take it over.<eos> Yeah, but you got to be super legit, okay?<eos> Like seriously.
Nice work, Dad.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I was agreeing with you.<eos> No, you were agreeing with her.<eos> I'm sorry, Donna.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll eat in the living room.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We can do everything the same.<eos> Just with Donna, okay?
And she's autistic, so she needs someone with her like all the time.<eos> And the pay is good.<eos> How did you even get this job?<eos> I convinced them.<eos> You lied to them.<eos> No. No, I'm doing a good job!<eos> And they really like me.<eos> It's easy.<eos> I can get you a recommendation letter!<eos> With their contact information on it?
I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Glory.<eos> Glory.<eos> What... What exactly are you doing?<eos> Kay, I'm helping.<eos> - You're helping?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, like you've been doing in my house with my daughter!<eos> - With my son!
I'll be back in a minute to tuck you in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Murder, Eunice says.<eos> Three of them over at the Waffle Hut.<eos> Hey, uh, you-- you had your thing today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This morning.<eos> You feel okay?<eos> Compared to what?<eos> Love Canal?
Yeah.<eos> She's six, not, you know, Pol Pot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call if you need, you know, whatever.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I left my rig there.<eos> I hope that's okay.<eos> I'm the one who called it in, see?<eos> Stopped for waffles, you know?<eos> With the blueberries.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you for inviting me.<eos> Uh, should we get another drink?<eos> I was actually gonna ask if you wanted to maybe check out this art show that I'm sure is gonna be absolutely terrible.<eos> I just sold it really well.<eos> I absolutely would.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Done and done.<eos> Cheers.
- Thank you for inviting me.<eos> Uh, should we get another drink?<eos> I was actually gonna ask if you wanted to maybe check out this art show that I'm sure is gonna be absolutely terrible.<eos> I just sold it really well.<eos> I absolutely would.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Done and done.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.
Thank you, Hannah.<eos> So, just putting a couple things together. Uh, your ex-boyfriend is here?<eos> Yeah, you know, I probably should've told you about it, but on the other hand, it's like we broke up so long ago and the wounds are so healed.<eos> And at this point it's like we're all just part of one big friend group.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You know what?<eos> It's no problem.<eos> You know? Everybody's got a past.<eos> This might be shocking for some folks, but I have dated people before.<eos> Women, in fact.
Treat us like we're the problem.<eos> Because you treat violence like it's the solution.<eos> I will do anything to protect our land from men like Proctor.<eos> All you're doing is hurting more of our own.<eos> This is bigger than any one person.<eos> Tell that to the dead Redbone they pulled out of Proctor's pool.<eos> - Or the other one in the ICU.<eos> - Casualties of a righteous war.<eos> You know, when we were kids and you and Tommy came to live with us... you were so shy.<eos> So gentle.
- See you around, buddy.<eos> So, uh, what do you think of the new break room, right?<eos> You wanna... you wanna maybe play some pool after the shift?<eos> - I'm pretty good.<eos> - You know what, Paul?<eos> Maybe you should get a start on those vets.<eos> - Yeah, like now, even.<eos> - Hey, uh, Jordan?<eos> A little help, s'il vous plaît, with the doctors' schedule.<eos> - Not so good with the paperwork.
- Okay, I'm sorry. It's not a big deal.<eos> - It is a big deal.<eos> I'm going through some very intense stuff with my family, okay?<eos> Kind of cosmic, heavy stuff, and I needed to talk to you and you weren't there.<eos> You're being really intense.<eos> So your dad is gay.<eos> So what?<eos> I knew you checked your phone.<eos> My friend Thomas has, like, four dads, so you need to check your homophobia.<eos> My homophobia?
There was, uh, one guy in my senior year.<eos> It was mostly dry humping.<eos> Okay, that's good information to have.<eos> I can work with that information.<eos> You know, I always wondered what happened to him.<eos> Turns out he's in commercial real estate now.<eos> - Great. - Yeah.<eos> I helped him do some Facebook sleuthing.<eos> We reconnected, so, you know, who knows what the future holds?<eos> - Full-on anal.
- Ale?<eos> - I'll have some.<eos> My Lady...<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Sansa Stark.<eos> Don't look!<eos> You sure?<eos> She's dyed her hair, but it's her.<eos> She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.<eos> Littlefinger?
Ah, yes.<eos> You were accused of killing him.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> - But you were accused.<eos> - By men who did not see what happened.<eos> And what did happen?<eos> He was murdered by a shadow.<eos> A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.<eos> A shadow?<eos> With a face?
They pay him.<eos> Great families, afraid to do a thing.<eos> They pay poor men to do it for them.<eos> And how do you know this?<eos> - Everyone know this.<eos> - I don't know it.<eos> And I'm the head of a great family.<eos> We do not know what this man did or didn't do.<eos> Give him a trial at least.<eos> A fair trial.
You prevented that order from being carried out.<eos> You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.<eos> The King's word is law.<eos> Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.<eos> Show too much kindness, people won't fear you.<eos> If they don't fear you, they don't follow you.<eos> With respect, Your Grace, the Free Folk will never follow you no matter what you do.<eos> You're the man who burned their king alive.<eos> Who then?<eos> You?
Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont.<eos> Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.<eos> He saw something in Jon.<eos> And now we've all seen it too.<eos> He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Aye.<eos> Can't argue with any of that.<eos> But who does Jon Snow want to command?<eos> The Night's Watch?

I grew up with silence, I felt like that silence I grew up with got filled with something and that was fear,<eos> I was afraid of sex,<eos> I doubted myself, I didn't trust people and these are all things you learn over time, or you learn to accept yourself.<eos> I mean, I have got flab, I've got cellulite, I've got everything but it doesn't bother me so long as I have good sex and they enjoy my body and I enjoy theirs.<eos> As I've been with my partner for 13 years, he knows every scratch, every stretch mark, every cellulite mark.<eos> You know, if you don't like it then don't have it, I'm not asking you to have it.<eos> If you want it, take it, I'm not stopping you!<eos> I think now I'm a lot more confident in who I am and what I'm doing with my life and it reflects a lot in how I treat people and how, when it comes to sex, I behave with it.<eos> It makes you strive to want to be better and to reach out to a lot more people and hope to make a change and not be a porn star, you know? !<eos> Just a porn star!
I am in his house.<eos> Marta, are you okay?<eos> - I could not not go to open the door.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - I was tired.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Hello, Isaac.<eos> Yes, I'm with her.<eos> She needs someone to stay here ...<eos> At night.
Howie, stop ringing the doorbell!<eos> - Well, carry something!<eos> - Howie, cut it out!<eos> - Help me with the bags.<eos> - Dad, you carry it.<eos> It's Christmas. It's Christmas.<eos> It's Christmas.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Hey, sis.<eos> Merry Christmas.
I'm getting Howie Junior into game shape.<eos> By the time he gets to high school, he's gonna be the biggest lineman in the state.<eos> Did you ever spend any time on the field, Tommy?<eos> No, actually, I didn't have time in my younger years.<eos> I was in training mostly.<eos> What were you training for?<eos> Army?<eos> Marines?<eos> It was the Eagle Scouts.<eos> Eagle Scouts.
You can barely see across the street, but it doesn't look like it's just us.<eos> I can walk over, check with the Turners.<eos> The Turners are in Hawaii.<eos> The Lamberts are in Florida, and the Cartwrights stopped talking to us after Max's noodle incident.<eos> After his what?<eos> Max, please go and get Omi out of the fireplace before she burns the whole house down.<eos> I'll get it!<eos> Fine.<eos> Seriously, what are we gonna do?<eos> Merry Christmas. Whoa!
Listen.<eos> English.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I must tell you something.<eos> To all of you.<eos> It started with the wind.<eos> On a cold winter night, much like this.<eos> It was almost Christmas.<eos> But this Christmas was darker.<eos> Less cheerful.
A wish I would come to regret.<eos> And that night, in the darkness of a howling blizzard, I got my wish.<eos> I knew Saint Nicholas was not coming this year.<eos> Instead, it was a much darker, more ancient spirit.<eos> The shadow of Saint Nicholas.<eos> It was Krampus.<eos> And as he had for thousands of years,<eos> Krampus came not to reward, but to punish.<eos> Not to give, but to take.<eos> He and his helpers.
Oh yes!<eos> How many times I've imagined putting my hand up your skirt!<eos> - Why didn't you?<eos> - Would you have spread your legs?<eos> - Would you have spread them?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Be gentle with me.<eos> What were you like when you were little?<eos> - As a girl? - Yeah.<eos> Solitary?
- Why didn't you?<eos> - Would you have spread your legs?<eos> - Would you have spread them?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Be gentle with me.<eos> What were you like when you were little?<eos> - As a girl? - Yeah.<eos> Solitary?<eos> I was a quiet little girl.<eos> Kind, sensible.
Most thorough clean-up job I've ever seen.<eos> - Not a spot on it.<eos> - I'll bet.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! You OK?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> From the day I decided to marry Rajan, you have been sending me... visions.<eos> You sent me a vision of a woman taking her own life.<eos> Visions of other people in distant places, even in prison, which could perhaps be a metaphor for my situation, intended for education and instruction.<eos> But then, you sent me a vision of a man... with a large... trunk?<eos> A very large trunk.
aryl fixe it.<eos> You gotta be kiing me.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> I in't mean to interrupt.<eos> Goo morning.<eos> My name is Aaron.<eos> I know, stranger anger.<eos> But I'm a frien.<eos> I' like to talk to the person in charge.<eos> Rick, right?
I'm Eric.<eos> Rick.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You save Eric.<eos> I owe you.<eos> All of you.

I work in the pantry.<eos> eanna aske me to bring these over for you an your friens.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're just cleaning up.<eos> I can see that.<eos> You still have some shaving cream on your chin.<eos> I'm Jessie.<eos> Rick.<eos> You know, I use to be a stylist.<eos> An 12 other things.
Okay.<eos> Yeah, I'm in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For knocking him on his ass.<eos> You on't like me, o you?<eos> Rick: You shoul keep your gates close.<eos> eanna: Why?<eos> Because it's all about survival now.<eos> At any cost.
You always cheer me up.<eos> You will be the luckiest man in the world.<eos> One of the few to truly know his most secret mind.<eos> You will live a life you can only dream of.<eos> And be part of the most important family in the history of the world.<eos> And one day you will tell your own son your journey and pass these blessings on to him.<eos> Can I come and help you?<eos> I could use a midwife.<eos> And then one day, I hope to be just like you.<eos> A woman doctor!
Respect? No.<eos> Power?<eos> No.<eos> You get money, to throw away.<eos> Now give it to me.<eos> You belittle me again!<eos> - Brother.<eos> - The magic word, what is it?<eos> Do not forget who addresses you.<eos> Brother?
Who are you?<eos> ! Why are you after me?<eos> !<eos> I can explain. It's... you're gonna laugh.<eos> It's so... I'm a lawyer.<eos> I... check my I.D., okay?<eos> But I was running a scam.<eos> - On my abuelita?<eos> - No, no!<eos> Not on your abuelita, not on you.
Tuco freaked you out, huh?<eos> It's cool.<eos> He doesn't know I'm here.<eos> So, uh... what can I do for you?<eos> I've been thinking about what you said out there in the desert.<eos> Those people that you were trying to scam...<eos> How much did they steal?<eos> Um, north of a million and a half bucks... I think.<eos> So, they have a million and a half bucks somewhere.<eos> In what, cash?
So, what do you say?<eos> You on board?<eos> Help us do some good.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay, here's the deal...<eos> You assaulted this man.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> I barely touched the guy.<eos> But you laid hands on him first.<eos> Finger...
I'm gonna destroy you.<eos> [Buzzer sounds] Sam: First-time offender, grief-stricken father... he'll probably only get house arrest.<eos> Well, then we can only hope that McNally and Nash are making some head way with the wife.<eos> [Clears throat] For the first time in my life, I think... I could be a good father.<eos> I know I'm not gonna be like my dad.<eos> - Oh, damn straight.<eos> - That's because of McNally.<eos> Couldn't wait to do this with her.<eos> [Sighs] Am I supposed to do this...<eos> With Marlo?
On it.<eos> Greg donnelly is on his way down here now.<eos> You said he resigned, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why? Well, employment records are vague, But there are a number of complaints filed against him.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What for?<eos> Apparently, he was having an inappropriate relationship With one of the inmates.<eos> They say who with?<eos> Rochelle dawber.
[ sighs ] You're gonna have a daughter?<eos> She's going to adore you.<eos> She's gonna adore you, too.<eos> It's pretty complicated, huh?<eos> ¶ ooooh ¶ Yeah.<eos> ¶ ooooh ¶ Where are things gonna go...<eos> With us?<eos> Up.<eos> ¶ oh, oh ¶ How?<eos> Hearts.
Hey.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Throw it around.<eos> Nice.<eos> You guys, too.<eos> Well, it's not such a bad night after all.<eos> Even though it does still smell like a zoo.<eos> Go with "earthy"...<eos> "primal."
He wasn't a soldier. He was a Prolethean.<eos> Was he?<eos> It's hard to tell who's who these days.<eos> I mean what is the wild one doing with DYAD?<eos> I'm not with DYAD.<eos> Well, you're trusting the wrong people.<eos> - I only trust my sisters.<eos> - Oh, I know, it's a family affair.<eos> With Felix, and your step mum, Mrs. Sadler, and, of course...<eos> Little Kira.
Hello, Rachel.<eos> I warned you this was personal.<eos> What day is it, hmm?<eos> M... d...<eos> - What's my name?<eos> - Night...<eos> Come on.<eos> What?<eos> What happened to my c...<eos> Corn cob.
Aw, come on, come on, you can do better than that.<eos> What's my name?<eos> Stop, stop, Delphine!<eos> There!<eos> There we go.<eos> There you go, good girl.<eos> Only I'm you now, you understand that?<eos> I'm you...<eos> And I will erase you completely, Rachel, unless you tell me what you're planning with Ferdinand.<eos> Ferdinand?
It's underway.<eos> The family chloroformed, followed by a house fire.<eos> Proven effective by the Finns.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I need a moment.<eos> Pick up! Hello, you've reached Alison Hendrix, I'm away from the phone, but leave a message and I'll get back to you in a jiff.<eos> Alison, get out of your house now.<eos> Take the kids and get...<eos> Who are you talking to in here?<eos> No... no one.
Who the hell are you?<eos> - Siobhan.<eos> - Stay the fuck away from me.<eos> You played us.<eos> Me, Brock...
Who the hell are you?<eos> - Siobhan.<eos> - Stay the fuck away from me.<eos> You played us.<eos> Me, Brock...<eos> Emmett?
Triple the dock space.<eos> It's going to kill my business.<eos> Kevin, sooner or later someone else is gonna come in.<eos> First a yacht club, then what?<eos> Condominiums?<eos> This place will look like Pompano Beach.<eos> They're offering way above market.<eos> Okay, listen, I can't do that.<eos> But what if I pay in cash?<eos> - Cash?
- And when I asked Danny...<eos> - He gave the same story.<eos> Yes.<eos> I blew it.<eos> I let Bobby feed him the lie.<eos> But when I pressed Danny afterwards... he said he didn't remember details.<eos> I knew something was off.<eos> - That's when you came to talk to us.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You, Kevin, Meg.
I've seen this movie.<eos> Don't defend this guy. It isn't your thing.<eos> He has a drinking problem.<eos> He isn't a bad guy.<eos> - So I let him off on agg robbery?<eos> Why?<eos> - In trial, you never know.<eos> Karen, we're ready for fines, community service, reparations, time already served. But no new jail time.<eos> We'll call your office tomorrow with our offer.<eos> But our only offer.
Did you come all the way from Ohio to see me?<eos> I wanted to.<eos> I brought something.<eos> It's what you gave me your third year at the convent on the date of our Virgin Mother's birth.<eos> The day that you committed yourself to God.<eos> And I always carry it with me when I travel.<eos> I was so proud of you, how far you'd come since that little Irish girl abandoned by her mother on the train west.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> You brightened ours.<eos> Brave, tenacious, spirited.

We were recently seated near each other at an Art Society dinner.<eos> Well, it was really more of an excuse to drink good wine... and show off our french.<eos> That's nice.<eos> All right, I'm through.<eos> Suction wand.<eos> Will you be *** I'm cleaning now.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Do you need assistance?<eos> - I'm not exactly and expert in this technique.<eos> - Gauze.
Just drop it.<eos> And can you describe the bag?<eos> Um, well, it's, uh, black.<eos> There's a red ribbon tied to the handle...<eos> The world's greatest mom is in the shoe compartment!<eos> You ready to begin?<eos> Yup. Be right there.<eos> I assume you don't want wine.<eos> You're not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.<eos> What heavy machinery?
So, it would be today?<eos> Huh.<eos> Well, I suppose there's something satisfying about dying on my birthday.<eos> Today's your birthday?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, that's always been a secret!<eos> Not even Amy knows!<eos> Well, I don't enjoy presents.<eos> And the thought of people jumping out and yelling "Surprise!" fills me with more dread than the words<eos> "George Lucas Director's Cut."
Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car.<eos> So... I'm just concentrating on that.<eos> Plus, it's easier around people that I'm comfortable with.<eos> Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.<eos> Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing.<eos> I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.<eos> I meant more like a little brother.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister.<eos> And sometimes, a mother.
But I made a video.<eos> I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to... go to Mars!<eos> I'm exceedingly smart.<eos> I graduated college at 14.<eos> While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD.<eos> Penicillin can't take this away.<eos> Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and... my hygiene is impeccable.<eos> In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Literally nothing.
Say cheese.<eos> Is this about the space probe he's working on without you?<eos> You betcha.<eos> The very one.<eos> Howard, you're grown men.<eos> You guys don't have to do everything together.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I'm spending tonight with you.<eos> Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.<eos> With my honeybunch.
I'll no watch Jamie waste away.<eos> Die like an animal in the woods with his foot caught in a trap.<eos> If it comes to the time when he's past the point of healing...<eos> There we go.<eos> Feeling better?<eos> Ye collapsed like a sack of grain.<eos> Scared the pish right out of me.<eos> Pardon me, brother.<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> About Jamie.
I couldn't make it out. It was something about...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I couldn't hear it.<eos> But the next morning I called him out.<eos> "What the hell was that about?<eos> What's going on?"<eos> And he wouldn't talk to me.<eos> But I think...<eos> I think he was talking to you.<eos> - Me?
I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.<eos> It was a heavy bag.<eos> And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.<eos> But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.<eos> How many you count?<eos> Four.<eos> How many do you think you can take?<eos> One if he's slow.<eos> Halt!<eos> Over the hill.
But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.<eos> Kill the boy, Jon Snow.<eos> Winter is almost upon us.<eos> Kill the boy and let the man be born.<eos> Where are the rest of the free folk now?<eos> Where have they gone?<eos> Who leads them?<eos> They followed Mance.<eos> They won't follow anyone else.<eos> What about you?
Then what?<eos> Then she rules.<eos> So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?<eos> - She's the rightful heir.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?<eos> - That's a slave ship.<eos> - Why are they anchored?<eos> They probably came ashore for...<eos> Water.
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.<eos> I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.<eos> Yes, wearing Renly's armor.<eos> Why does it matter what I wore?<eos> Do you deny all the charges against you?<eos> Fornication. Buggery. Blasphemy.<eos> Of course I deny them.<eos> You never lay with Renly Baratheon?<eos> Never.<eos> Nor any other man?
You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me, come and see his mother.<eos> He-<eos> - I tried, Your Grace.<eos> He wouldn't see me.<eos> He won't see anyone.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> There is a way, Your Grace.<eos> A way out.<eos> Confess?<eos> To the High Sparrow?
You're a free man.<eos> You could have gone anywhere.<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> Let me fight for her and I belong to you.<eos> Thirsty?<eos> Confess.<eos> I'll get out of here, you realize, before long.<eos> Confess.<eos> I can make you a wealthy woman.<eos> A lady of the court.
I've seen the army of the dead.<eos> I've seen the white walkers.<eos> And they're coming for us, for all the living.<eos> And when it's time, we'll need every last man we can find.<eos> But what if we let the wildlings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?<eos> Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.<eos> We don't stand a chance otherwise.<eos> Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.<eos> You believe that?<eos> With all my heart.
I'll come back.<eos> To your return.<eos> To my return.<eos> Aye, this way.<eos> My lady!<eos> Stannis.<eos> Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.<eos> How do you know it's Stannis?<eos> They're carrying his flaming heart banners.<eos> From the Blackwater.
Lancel Lannister.<eos> Your cousin and the king's squire.<eos> - I was lonely and afraid.<eos> - You had a husband.<eos> A husband off whoring every chance he--<eos> His sins do not pardon your own.<eos> May the gods forgive me.<eos> Other men?<eos> No.<eos> No others?
I want a lawyer.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - I want to call my dad.<eos> You know this is personal for him, right?<eos> Emma... he knows the family, the mom.<eos> I told him already I don't know.<eos> I don't know, okay?<eos> She freaked on me,<eos> And she took off with this guy.<eos> What guy?
No.<eos> Go.<eos> I think we got what he knows.<eos> Mm, and the young genius never wondered why I went to look for a pay phone with a radio in the car?<eos> Yep, this country is gonna be in good hands.<eos> ♪Caught in my reflection like you left behind my back ♪ You know, you're the only one I've ever heard Charlie say he wanted before he even met you.<eos> He says I'm special to him, but...<eos> What?<eos> Well, he's with Katie and...<eos> And you...
I'm fine.<eos> Well, thanks, and you can clock out and change those duds.<eos> I'm gonna run that name.<eos> Charmain.<eos> Look, I know it got weird.<eos> No, I just...<eos> For a second, I thought that maybe...<eos> Never gonna let that guy have sex with you.<eos> You were on drugs.<eos> On drugs.
Hodiak.<eos> Marched across the Potomac and amassed at the Pentagon, resulting in a full-scale riot.<eos> I had Charmain check.<eos> The Nankins have been the victims of crime zero times.<eos> So that lie was incredibly stupid.<eos> Most murders, you're not exactly dealing with Goldfinger.<eos> ♪ Oh, yeah ♪<eos> Very sorry, Leo.<eos> My aunt had the exact same thing. The pills just killed her appetite.<eos> Except for one thing.
Ma'am...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Couldn't have been easy for a woman like that to age, married to a younger guy.<eos> Thing is, Leo, you never called the cops.<eos> The only calls to the police involving you and your wife - were from your neighbors...<eos> - No... About you and your wife.<eos> Fighting.<eos> I took a look at the report.<eos> The names she called you.<eos> Talentless.

Not a single toss.<eos> - Be fair. I'm only human.<eos> - No, cos I know exactly how it works.<eos> You'll go to bed tonight and wrap yourself up warm, and your hand will sneak down into your middle-aged underpants, and you'll think about this flat, and me, and your nice TV, and you'll imagine, "One night, Dean will go out.<eos> It'll just be me and Freddie watching TV."<eos> - OK, I promise...<eos> - I don't even watch TV.<eos> I'm not 35, for God's sake!<eos> But you'll just imagine us, sitting there, all nice and cosy.<eos> With alcohol.
I don't know.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> So, you take it but he won't?<eos> He won't have it up his arse?<eos> But at the same time, he won't put it up your arse either?<eos> - That's about it.<eos> - I was wrong.<eos> You're completely fucked.<eos> So, not with anybody ever?<eos> Not with Steven?

You can go home.<eos> You're so scared.<eos> We could just skip this bit.<eos> We could, though, really.<eos> Cos two weeks' time, you and me, we'll just be sitting at home watching TV.<eos> We could cut out all this shit in the middle and go home. I'm tired.<eos> - That'd be nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just don't know if I can live with it any more.<eos> Your shame.
Right, I know I said I wasn't coming home, but... I'm not staying.<eos> We're going round to Lucy's.<eos> You remember Lucy?<eos> From school?<eos> So... this is Glyn.<eos> I told you about him.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Merry Christmas.
From school?<eos> So... this is Glyn.<eos> I told you about him.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> And these are for you.<eos> Hi there, Marie.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Hi!<eos> Don't worry, we're just passing by.<eos> Won't take long.<eos> We're gonna stay at Lucy's.<eos> But... this is Tony.<eos> I told you about him. Remember?<eos> Hi.<eos> Just came to say... Merry Christmas.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Merry Christmas.
But... this is Tony.<eos> I told you about him. Remember?<eos> Hi.<eos> Just came to say... Merry Christmas.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Can we go?<eos> Hello, Dad.<eos> Merry Christmas!
Are we done?<eos> Can we go?<eos> Hello, Dad.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Er... you remember Tony, don't you?<eos> I bring tidings of great joy.<eos> Peace to all men.<eos> And you, Marie.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Merry Christmas.
And you, Marie.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Er, just dropping off the presents, can't stay.<eos> Gotta go!<eos> Hi there! - Merry Christmas!<eos> - It's us.<eos> Just dropping off the presents.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Gotta go!<eos> Hi there! - Merry Christmas!<eos> - It's us.<eos> Just dropping off the presents.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Just thought I'd drop these off.<eos> It's just some... little things.<eos> There's an... extra little something for Ruthie.<eos> Careful with the cards.
We made it.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Merry Christmas to you, too.<eos> And you, Marie. Marie Christmas!<eos> Ooh!<eos> We haven't heard that one before, have we?<eos> Christmas Eve, Rosie, you'd better be good.<eos> Any chance of a beer?<eos> 'Tis the season, and all that.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Here you go.<eos> That was fantastic, last night.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> - So, what are you going to do now?<eos> - God knows.<eos> I'm a jinx.<eos> The last flat I had got flooded.<eos> The one before that was being used by gun-runners.<eos> Yeah, I'm not kidding.<eos> Like, actual guns.
You got arrested.<eos> You're still gonna have to narrow it down.<eos> Black guy?<eos> That's the one.<eos> Yeah, he was all right, the big fella, you were a little fucker.<eos> - You do remember!<eos> - When was that?<eos> Oh, months ago, now.<eos> Were you all right in the end?<eos> With the police?
And then I stopped after a while.<eos> Last time I searched for your name, you were in Vancouver.<eos> Yeah, that didn't last.<eos> I came back to London for a while.<eos> Then I went to Cornwall.<eos> Ended up in Barcelona, cos of this girl.<eos> Got married.<eos> That turned to shit.<eos> So, what are you doing these days?<eos> Things.
I need to spend six months just walking on a beach.<eos> I should do it now, I should take a sabbatical, I could go abroad.<eos> All on my own.<eos> Or maybe I could just stay at home.<eos> That could work.<eos> I just need time to sit and think.<eos> That's all I need.<eos> Lots of time, to sit and think.<eos> And then I might come to terms with it.<eos> With what?
I like you, Ren-kun!<eos> Thank you...<eos> But I... I'm seeing someone else...<eos> Hmm.. I know...<eos> Sorry...<eos> It's alright...<eos> I just want to tell you that I'm happy being able to tell you how I feel...<eos> I hope we can still talk to each other from now on as as a friend of yours...<eos> Yeah. Of course...<eos> Ren-kun, right?
A family connection.<eos> I hardly know the man, really.<eos> I should think not.<eos> An Englishwoman of fine breeding and a common Scottish criminal.<eos> Ah. Here we are.<eos> It appears he's been granted a temporary stay of execution.<eos> At least for a little while.<eos> Stroke of luck, I suppose.<eos> When was the last time you were in contact with this, um,<eos> - individual?

Jamie!<eos> Claire, how did you...<eos> You must leave.<eos> Randall will be coming back soon.<eos> Randall is here?<eos> My God...<eos> What has he done to you?<eos> But you must leave.<eos> No.<eos> Not without you.
[Mariana] I just... I don't want her to go through what we did.<eos> I don't want her to feel like she isn't enough.<eos> And to spend her whole life scared that people are gonna leave her.<eos> And I just don't think that you can be a mother.<eos> I don't think that you can take care of a baby.<eos> And maybe... maybe you can't help it, but... I don't want another little girl to get hurt like I did.<eos> - Hot date?<eos> - No.<eos> Connor and I are going to a movie with some girls.<eos> As a group.

Right?<eos> - You'll go on tour with or without me. - [scoffs]<eos> What do you expect us to do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But, you know, if I can't go, what, are you just gonna play my songs?<eos> - They're our songs.<eos> - That I wrote.<eos> I mean, who's gonna do the harmonies, Jasper?<eos> Hey, we were a band before you.<eos> Not a very good one.
Well, there's always be some uncertainty, it's a trick question, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> - Now, I'm gonna walk the rest of you...<eos> - Wow, never woulda thought Jesus' sister would turn out to be a math whiz.<eos> Was that even a math question?<eos> And please tell me you know I'm nothing like my brother.<eos> No,<eos> I do.<eos> Look... I'm sorry about how all that went down.<eos> With Hayley and everything.
Are you not part of Child Protective Services?<eos> Who else is gonna decide these things, exactly?<eos> I can't... he won't answer.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> As long as Kiara doesn't have to go back into that house.<eos> You are not sending her back there. Are you?<eos> I know people in Vegas.<eos> I'll just go there and lay low.<eos> "Lay low" with who?<eos> Other runaways?
I usually end up getting pizza or something around the corner.<eos> - Don't tell Moms.<eos> - Why the hell did you wait so long to tell me that?<eos> Screw Alateen, let's go!<eos> So you wanna help out at the assembly, huh?<eos> I just, Mat was so proud of his math score, and I beat him by like six points, and I just...<eos> Just don't wanna seem smarter than your boyfriend?<eos> Oh, honey, if he can't handle the math genius and the pink nails, well, then, he doesn't deserve you.<eos> Don't play small, my love.<eos> Not for him, not for anybody.
Otherwise, beat it.<eos> Rapist bitch.<eos> That... That was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I saw you throw the first punch.<eos> If you're gonna start a four-on-one, better pick up some moves. Because that was pathetic. Wait.<eos> What's Reflex Athletics?<eos> What are you working on?<eos> A video game.
You interrupted me and Dov.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, forget about that.<eos> Listen, you want to get a drink with me again?<eos> No.<eos> You know, well, in celebration of Helen's retirement.<eos> No, okay?<eos> 'Cause I don't know who that is, and I don't want to have a drink with you, okay?<eos> I want to have a drink with Dov.<eos> That Dov?
[Chuckles] I know.<eos> Can I tell you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Today was a perfect day on the street.<eos> I... I chased a bad guy, took him down, locked him up, did everything I've ever wanted to do on this job.<eos> But now...<eos> I don't want to be in uniform anymore.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> This.
But we distracted him with seaweed.<eos> And ice cream, 'cause he basically heard the truck from like a mile away.<eos> I think you'd be a pretty cool aunt.<eos> I think we're gonna go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, he's right.<eos> You would be a pretty cool aunt.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What about a mom?
I don't know.<eos> We... I... we find out who helped Santana, and we clear Oliver.<eos> What... by 6:00 tonight?<eos> Dov...<eos> Dov was working the Intelligence Unit before Jarvis shut them down.<eos> I mean, he's got to know something.<eos> And I would trust him with my life.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> I'll check the evidence-room records.<eos> Dov: Tonight?
Everyone here is looking for your son.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Traci: Staff.<eos> You'll have to excuse me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, so, Nick spoke to a neighbor named Gary Fulham.<eos> He was gardening.<eos> He saw the boy talking to that guy...<eos> Rhys Gray.
We all know that by now, right?<eos> Mood disorders -- depression, anxiety, bipolar i and ii --<eos> These conditions are genetic, aggravated by traumatic events, Life stressors, biochemical changes, Which means, in a nutshell, it's not your fault.<eos> All right?<eos> Marlo. Mm.<eos> Want to start us off this week?<eos> How you doing?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> [ sighs ] Well, i'm feeling pregnant --<eos> Verypregnant.
Just trust me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, anyway, like I said, I was back in my bedroom in Boston.<eos> You mean back home?<eos> Yeah, except it wasn't a dream.<eos> It was a memory.<eos> And it wasn't invasive like with the Espheni.<eos> It was, um...<eos> There was something very vivid about it, almost pleasant.<eos> Warm.
Where are we going, sir?<eos> Taking down the queen bee.<eos> To do that...<eos> We hit her where it hurts the most.<eos> We have successfully taken control of the Nathan James.<eos> My people are collecting all your work as we speak.<eos> Now, with your research and your samples, Dr. Hamada and his team will eventually learn to make the cure themselves.<eos> Wouldn't it be better for everyone if you just agreed to work together?<eos> Work together?<eos> What, on your Darwinian experiment?
So why not add a superhero into the mix?<eos> Batman was my favorite.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Maybe it was the lonely, rich kid thing, maybe I just liked the car.<eos> Lay 'em down, ladies.<eos> I got my real education backstage at the Boom-Boom Room.<eos> I guess all that's missing from this story is the girl, the damsel in distress, and the villain, but we'll get to that.<eos> All right, let's give it up for Kitty in the middle.<eos> And that's Eva on the left and Candice on the right.<eos> Drink?
She's become such a beautiful young woman.<eos> Mom loved her so much.<eos> I think she'd want her to be taken care of.<eos> Mr. Novack?<eos> Yeah, what do you want?<eos> Your wife told me you were here.<eos> I wanted to tell you in person.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Your mother's death has been ruled an accident.<eos> An accident?
Wade:<eos> Morning, Lavon.<eos> Heard, uh, you and Tucker had a "my hose is bigger than your hose" contest at fire practice yesterday, wish I'd been there to see that.<eos> It was not my fault.<eos> So what's going on with you?<eos> Oh, me? You mean, besides the fact that I-I told Zoe that I loved her yesterday and she basically told me to buzz off?<eos> (clears throat) Unless, of course, I-I misinterpreted the "door slamming in my face" bit.<eos> Well, you know, much as I... hate to leave this conversation, um, I-I got business to attend to.<eos> Yeah, very im-important mayoral business.<eos> Very pressing.
Is that true?<eos> Is it true you can get pregnant<eos> - from a hot tub? - What does 59 stand for?<eos> - Dr. Hart, is 14 too young?<eos> - Yes! So when is it okay?<eos> Personally... I think that you should wait until you are well over the age of, let's say, 35.<eos> Come on, there's no way you waited that long.<eos> Well, I am not a great example, I promise you.<eos> And you must have had sex with George Tucker.<eos> And that sexy Wade.

Not Mrs. De Havilland.<eos> Not Rhett.<eos> All of them.<eos> Shelby?<eos> That cabaret singing vexation again?<eos> Another fake boyfriend?<eos> Another perfectly decent candidate that was all a ruse!<eos> I consider my ability to smell weakness a gift.<eos> And you smell of weakness.<eos> And a hint of marmalade.
What if I raise a serial killer?<eos> I'm probably going to be a terrible mother.<eos> Look at my role model.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> Your mom was Mary Poppins compared to mine, and I turned out just perfectly, so...<eos> Listen, Zoe, having a baby is a big deal.<eos> All right, it's not so kind on your figure, especially with people with your skin tone.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> Regardless of all of that, I know that you will be a good mother, Zoe Hart.<eos> A really good mother.
We didn't.<eos> Oh. Oh, I see.<eos> Uh, so you're gonna be a single parent.<eos> Uh, well,<eos> It's not so bad. I mean... Well, you know, maybe sometimes.<eos> Weekdays and... oh, and weekends. (groans)<eos> Oh.<eos> Hello, Wade. You look good.<eos> Real good.<eos> Healthy.
Us.<eos> Everything.<eos> It is.<eos> You know what?<eos> So what?<eos> Life is full of uncertainties, Zoe.<eos> But if you have one thing... just one thing that you know is true, you hold onto that.<eos> And the one thing that I am sure of is that you are the love of my life, Zoe Hart.<eos> And I know that together we can handle anything.<eos> Even a baby.
A long, long time ago...<eos> - A man who was very...<eos> - Wait.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> No way.<eos> This is a very serious story.<eos> I'm always afraid of not understanding jokes.<eos> So... a long, long time ago there lived a very poor man who married the love of his life.<eos> She was a very beautiful girl too.<eos> But very, very fragile.
I didn't dare say anything.<eos> The shame has paralyzed my speech.<eos> I feel sick that everyone thinks I'm a girl.<eos> Then you should get your hair cut.<eos> No.<eos> I refuse to be pressured into looking like everyone else.<eos> It's the one thing about me that adds to my personality.<eos> Your personality has nothing to do with your hair.<eos> It's related to the choices that you make.<eos> Your actions.
It's in his coat.<eos> 10 euros.<eos> Now stop hurting him.<eos> You got your 10 euros.<eos> Let him go.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll stop.<eos> And don't come back.<eos> Left, right.<eos> Right, left.

That tree...<eos> Didn't it use to be red?<eos> - No, I thought it was blue.<eos> - That's what I thought.<eos> We're becoming delirious.<eos> Drugged by hunger and lack of sleep.<eos> And dehydrated.<eos> If we continue on like this, we will slowly die.<eos> Or become beggars.<eos> Or worse: punks with dogs.

And somehow he makes it.<eos> How'd he do that? I--<eos> What are you sayin'?<eos> Your husband, he said he was gonna protect his family no matter what.<eos> And I acted like I didn't understand, but... I do.<eos> It's the rock we all push-- men.<eos> We call it our burden, but it's really our privilege.<eos> I never meant for any of this to happen.<eos> You know?<eos> Not to Ed.
And then we'd undercut the market and move in on McFarland's turf.<eos> That's what we'd do if it was meth?<eos> We take away enough of McFarland's business, he's gonna hit back, and then we're gonna have all the evidence we need to get a warrant.<eos> All we need is a bottle of Log Cabin. I'll make some taster samples for sales, and then we'll deliver a drum full of water.<eos> That's foolish.<eos> I saw the crowd from across the hall.<eos> If we're going to put ourselves at risk, we have to do this right.<eos> We have to come to market with the purest, highest-grade maple syrup on the street.<eos> And then we have to actually deliver it...<eos> Full barrels of it...
I love this movie.<eos> The, uh, the scene at the beginning is my favorite.<eos> D-Do you mind rewinding it so I can show my buddy here?<eos> No, no, go to the very beginning, before this.<eos> Dude, this is the first scene.<eos> No, it's not, come here.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here we go, right here, this is the part.<eos> Hmm... bummer.
Go, go, go!<eos> - Kick me.<eos> Kick me.<eos> - What?<eos> Kick me.<eos> Y'all smell pork?<eos> You in the wrong 'hood, po-po.<eos> - Get yo' bacon-smellin' ass on.<eos> - You motherfuckers on a coffee break?<eos> Yeah, with yo' mama.
It's what she would want.<eos> It's what I want.<eos> That money was meant for you, For our sons and daughters.<eos> I wanted to fill this house with our children, Hand down the good Fraser name.<eos> I've let you down, Claire.<eos> It's me that's let you down.<eos> The truth is, I may never give you a son as beautiful as little Jamie.<eos> I don't think I can have children.<eos> I tried before I met you.<eos> With Frank.
You were in couples therapy for eight years, and the last year you were the only one who was going.<eos> This is nice, Oscar.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry I haven't been around much the last year, but it's just weird with our wives being such good friends.<eos> No, I know.<eos> Your wife hated me after the divorce.<eos> Oh, no, she hated you before the divorce.<eos> After... look out!<eos> Still, I should have been there to help you with your pain.<eos> What pain?
Not now, not now, not now.<eos> Wow, that's a lot of Lycra.<eos> Not enough but a lot.<eos> Just doing my daily yoga.<eos> I find it really centers me.<eos> Otherwise, I would be an uptight basket case.<eos> Care to join me?<eos> No, I'm going out for a run.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Well, a beer run.
It's too hard.<eos> Sir?<eos> Fighting the Leadership, raising money.<eos> We can't get them to do what they're dead set against doing, we'd need six months just to get them back to square one.<eos> We have to reverse our thinking.<eos> When the Wind's blowing at gale force, there's no point in sailing against it.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> The White House Counsel's office, please.<eos> I don't care about their schedules.<eos> If not today, tomorrow morning.
And... you gotta get out.<eos> You gotta save yourself some pain.<eos> I can't quit.<eos> Never. I- - I'll die first.<eos> I love comedy.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Is there anything you can tell me that'll make me better?<eos> Anything?<eos> Talk in a funny voice, maybe.<eos> A funny voice?
No thank you.<eos> But have not received any response yet.<eos> I came to ask if you could tell me the reasons for this.<eos> Perhaps the generalised apathy and incompetence that we all here suffer from.<eos> But, we'll assist you shortly.<eos> I'm most interested in the expropriation of the hospital land and the case against the grandfather of one of the victims, Lucio.<eos> No problem.<eos> I will myself request the files.<eos> Specifically, I'd like to know how the case was so swiftly resolved.<eos> And with the grandfather as only culprit.
- Marco.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Y... you got to have one last blowout.<eos> We'll do the watch thing again, but... but maybe we'll pull that, uh...<eos> That tar-money scam you were talking about,<eos> - get some girls...<eos> - I made a promise.<eos> Yeah, you made a promise, but it was...<eos> W... Whaddyamacallit?<eos> Under duress.
Little bodywork, paint job...<eos> Really be something.<eos> So, what you gonna do while you're here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> See the sights, you know, catch a Cubbies game from the bleachers, get a hot dog at Henry's.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Correct.<eos> I'm gonna see them tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, both of them.
"Later, tennis"?<eos> After this dramatic exit, he vanished.<eos> And it seemed that would be the last anyone would hear from Aaron Williams.<eos> No one could know that he would return to compete in the longest and arguably greatest game in tennis history.<eos> Fuck, no!<eos> His competitor in the match was Charles Poole.<eos> When you're a child prodigy, the cameras start filming early.<eos> His name is Charles Lloyd Poole, and at three years of age, he's only got the entire tennis world talking.<eos> You've got to be the best, Charles.<eos> The best.
Someone has sabotaged the system.<eos> We can't abort the launch.<eos> It's about your...<eos> Cool, huh?<eos> Scott, wait!<eos> Hey, Mr. Gold wing.<eos> Mission Control here.<eos> May I ask what you're doing in there, Captain?<eos> I was taking care of a couple of intruders when the hatch got locked.<eos> Intruders?
What do you know about earning anything?<eos> Do you think all of this was built all by itself?<eos> Do you mean this factory or whatever it is?<eos> It's much more than a factory, you ignoramus.<eos> It's a Helium-3 mine!<eos> The greatest energy source mankind has ever known.<eos> And it's all mine!<eos> Look at my work!<eos> My father would be proud of me!<eos> Proud of a liar?

Yesterday.<eos> - You look thin.<eos> - I've always been thin.<eos> The president asked me to see you in person to share the good news.<eos> The terms of your release have been finalized.<eos> We'll be bringing you home with us tomorrow.<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.<eos> What are the terms?<eos> There will be a joint press conference.<eos> - With Petrov?
This statement is important to me.<eos> Well, if anything, Claire is trying to convince him to make it.<eos> Then why did she ask for the surveillance audio to be removed?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Perhaps so he wouldn't feel on the spot.<eos> But, look, I wouldn't worry about this just yet.<eos> Claire is very persuasive.<eos> Let me be very clear.<eos> If there is no statement, there is no deal on any front.<eos> Not between us.
Oh, and Agent Fraser is on his way here.<eos> He's one of the finest we have.<eos> Military vet, three tours in Afghanistan.<eos> He's a specialist in these kinds of things.<eos> You think we need a military specialist?<eos> Oh, no, uh, I'm sorry... uh, Agent Fraser's a dog.<eos> He'll help us track the killer's dog to the killer.<eos> Really?<eos> Man, I know that we're low on resources, and that you have this need to come in and bail us out with your gas chemotherapy and, uh...<eos> Chromography.
Congratulations Abed. I'm so happy for you.<eos> But you're coming back right?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Probably.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That's six seasons and a movie.<eos> Jeff I know it comforts you to look at things through that metal lens, but this is reality. TV's rules aren't based on common sense.<eos> They're based on the studio wanting to milk their properties dry.<eos> Cheers to that and cheers to Abed.<eos> Cheers!
I'm happy when I'm around you.<eos> Happy is overrated.<eos> Grow up, Fiona.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Mick.<eos> The fuck are you?<eos> The fuck you been?<eos> With my mom.

Even the principal calls me "White Precious."<eos> Come here, you are precious.<eos> Well, all anybody cares about in Glee Club is the way you sing.<eos> Look, no one has signed up for your club yet, right?<eos> Okay. Well, having me as your first member is just gonna drive kids away even more.<eos> I have designed my entire life around people not noticing me.<eos> Look, no one has wanted to feel more invisible than I have over the past couple of months.<eos> But when I'm with these people, they remind me of the best parts of myself.<eos> And they would never make fun of me.<eos> Mmm, not to her face, no way.
You take as much time as you need.<eos> With this type of cancer, your only option is a liver transplant.<eos> I'll do it.

You know, I was thinking now that you and your sister are, uh, playing these big-time venues, maybe it's time you got yourself a real guitar teacher, huh?<eos> You're the best that there is.<eos> I mean, you're freaking Deacon Claybourne.<eos> And besides, you're my dad.<eos> I know that.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know if I'm always gonna be here.<eos> - Where would you be?<eos> - On tour.<eos> Up at the cabin or something.
He needed my help with a situation that... involved one of his artists... uh, Layla Grant.<eos> I know who she is.<eos> Anyway, he... he threw a party, and apparently...<eos> Layla took too many pills and overdosed, and they found her floating in the pool, barely alive.<eos> And Jeff panicked because she was underage.<eos> So, I made the investigation go away.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because Jeff introduced me to this woman a... a few months ago.<eos> And, you know, after I'd seen her a couple of times, I found out that she was, um... she was a professional.<eos> A prostitute?
- I've done it all, all right?<eos> All that's left is for me to just... wait on this list.<eos> Well, I'm gonna wait with you.<eos> We'll be doing it together now.<eos> I'm sorry, baby... no.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> I can't do this with you by my side.<eos> Rayna: What do you mean you can't do it with me by your side?<eos> I mean I've already put you through more than enough pain<eos> - with all my mistakes.
I'll never forget it.<eos> You were 5, and you...<eos> I was breast-feeding you backstage.<eos> Mom!<eos> Gross!<eos> So, the point is, the Opry's been my family since even before y'all were born.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> And... and that's what tomorrow night's about.<eos> So I really feel like it's important for y'all to be there...<eos> Mm-hmm. With me...
No, it's like an '80s band from England.<eos> ♪... Can't get you out of my head ♪<eos> Hey, good shot.<eos> All right, gambling man, what's your game? No.<eos> Pizza money.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> Yeah, I got to see a new band tonight.<eos> I thought since I don't get many weekends away from boarding school that we could hang out.<eos> You want to hang out?<eos> With me?
Yeah.<eos> Sorry I made you come tonight.<eos> Got to spend some quality time with my son.<eos> Don't ever apologize for that.<eos> Do you like having me around?<eos> Of course.<eos> What kind of question is that?<eos> Well, I was thinking that maybe I could come home... For good.<eos> Could be nice spending some more time together.<eos> With me or, uh, with Maddie?
Sorry I made you come tonight.<eos> Got to spend some quality time with my son.<eos> Don't ever apologize for that.<eos> Do you like having me around?<eos> Of course.<eos> What kind of question is that?<eos> Well, I was thinking that maybe I could come home...

I know who she is.<eos> Just let her in.<eos> He's a bit of a jackass, that one.<eos> I see that.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Had to give my statement.<eos> I was with her when it happened.<eos> Kinda.<eos> With Sadie?
He's a talented guy.<eos> He's got, like, 8 million hits on YouTube.<eos> He's cutting a demo this afternoon.<eos> I said I'd stop by.<eos> - Rayna thinkin' of signing him?<eos> - Well, I doubt it.<eos> She's not much on Internet artists, but if I'm gonna do my job, I need to see what's out there.<eos> Figured I'd come by and give a listen<eos> - since Rayna's got her hands full today...<eos> - With Sadie?
Let me be there for you.<eos> I'm your family.<eos> The girls are, too.<eos> Come be home with us.<eos> [Whispers] I can't.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Everything's changed, Rayna.<eos> - It hasn't changed.<eos> - Yeah, it is all changed.<eos> - Not between us.
I'm really glad you came.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> How did you pull this off?<eos> Do you know her or something?<eos> No, actually, I...<eos> I did not make it happen at all.<eos> Um, my manager did.<eos> Did you sign with somebody?<eos> When?<eos> Who?
Oh, my gosh.<eos> How did you pull this off?<eos> Do you know her or something?<eos> No, actually, I...<eos> I did not make it happen at all.<eos> Um, my manager did.<eos> Did you sign with somebody?<eos> When?<eos> Who?<eos> Uh, Jeff Fordham.
Uh, I can pick you up at 7:00.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> Did you say country club?<eos> [Knock on door] Hi.<eos> I know you're probably real angry, and I know I don't deserve your forgiveness for what I did but...<eos> Can I see Micah, please,<eos> - just for a minute?<eos> - He's not here.<eos> He's with your parents.<eos> - Parents?
We'll hit New York, we'll hit L.A.<eos> You think maybe we can all get a little sleep before you conquer the world?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Please?<eos> Yes!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It just feels so good gettin' my career back on track.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Doin' it with my husband.<eos> And your baby?
~ Yeah.<eos> So, do you want a drink, love?<eos> No, it's all right, don't worry, they'll come round.<eos> So um, how's things?<eos> It's got a name, Trish.<eos> We're managing with the MS fine, thanks.<eos> Might be going to Vienna next month.<eos> Clinical trials.<eos> Well, you know, anything we can do.<eos> Money, anything.
- It's speculative.<eos> - Umpteen variables.<eos> - Was the victim standing?<eos> - Direction of attack, etc.<eos> Well, there might be something here.<eos> I'm going to need a whole lot more to charge Dean Fallon.<eos> Wait till I get a stairlift.<eos> I used to come up here with me cuppa.<eos> You, hot chocolate.<eos> Cream and marshmallows.
- What's Frank doing here?<eos> - Drying out. Not in the usual way.<eos> Well, he's gotta go.<eos> And don't forget about dinner tonight.<eos> - Aah! Fuck.<eos> I'm sleeping.<eos> - We need to go see your lawyer lady.<eos> Woke up in the park in the middle of a goddamn Filipino monsoon.<eos> Look, we gotta get that money.<eos> - The insurance money.
You might've overdone it.<eos> I just want her to be happy to be home.<eos> You're clean, six months.<eos> You got a great new apartment.<eos> Her foster family has a house with a yard and a fucking tree.<eos> Times I was in foster care all I wanted was to be back home. And you're a hell of a better parent than I ever had.<eos> She'd rather be with you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> David was a good kid.<eos> Altar boy.

Don't ever think that you get onstage anywhere where a vast majority of the crowd doesn't think "douche."<eos> Douche.<eos> You know how you feel when you watch Imagine Dragons play?<eos> Well, that's how we feel about you.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Imagine Dragons are great and you're the douche.<eos> You know, if we just take a minute and put our hearts together, you and me right here, I think we'll both find that we're not really all that different.<eos> But we are different.<eos> We are very different, because I would never treat her like shit.<eos> Who, Marnie?
Okay, now you're talking about my fiancée, and I strongly suggest, Ray, that you proceed with caution.<eos> Yeah, I know she's your fiancée.<eos> I also know that you absolutely do not deserve her.<eos> Even remotely.<eos> You string her along for months and now you've proposed to her in some desperate bid to make it seem like you're not the most selfish person in the western fucking hemisphere, but you know what, Desi?<eos> I'm onto you.<eos> Marnie isn't some tool for you to stroke your ego with.<eos> She's a beautiful, fully formed woman, dazzling in her complexity, maddening in her mystery, and you underestimate her every fucking day.<eos> And because of that, you will never, ever make her truly happy.<eos> Truly, deeply, fundamentally happy.
How exciting.<eos> What sort of plans?<eos> Tomorrow, we throw open the gates of Athens and charge the enemy.<eos> I see... but aren't Minos' troops well-entrenched?<eos> If we die, we die like Athenians, with fire in our hearts.<eos> And what becomes of your family, dearest?<eos> No more cowering behind the walls of Athens.<eos> Every last man fights to the death.<eos> What's this?<eos> A tonic.
No.<eos> But you should talk to the head of our security, Officer Mehta.<eos> There were no specific threats against the consul that I knew of.<eos> But there was a-an incident a few hours before the consul was murdered.<eos> Tell us about it.<eos> A reporter showed up, claiming to be writing an exposé for The Chicago Star-Herald.<eos> The consul told me he'd already given this reporter an interview a few weeks before, told me to turn him away.<eos> When I did, the reporter got very angry.<eos> Started making accus... accusations regarding the consul.<eos> Such as?
- We think he's hiding something.<eos> - Hiding what?<eos> That he was involved in the murders of the consul and the reporter.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Rashid is not a killer.<eos> He was not the only one who was nervous.<eos> I was nervous, too, be...<eos> Because of what happened to the contract.<eos> The contract with Navilet?
Why buy that kind of trouble for yourself?<eos> The raza don't forget that kind of talk, carnale.<eos> That punk who got Tony in trouble...<eos> Is he legal or no, huh?<eos> And I'm supposed to forget that because we have the same color skin?<eos> No.<eos> I'm Mexican-American.<eos> He's just Mexican.<eos> That's the difference between me and him...<eos> And me and you.
Could you deal with it?<eos> Well, was she having an affair?<eos> It wasn't really an affair.<eos> You're gonna have to be a little more clear than that.<eos> Gwen said she needed to be with other men.<eos> How long?<eos> She felt very lonely.<eos> How long have you known?<eos> Things got worse when Matt got into drugs.<eos> Drugs?
So, you're the chap doing our aviation display.<eos> Am I?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about that.<eos> Perhaps something in fashion.<eos> I would like to look around.<eos> A tour of Selfridge's with a Selfridge.<eos> - I'm actually a bit busy.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> I mean with Rosalie.<eos> - My pleasure.
You interfere in my work and now in my private life.<eos> How could you possibly know my feelings for Ernest, when you have no children of your own?<eos> ~ Josie...<eos> ~ Yes, it's true.<eos> I'm not a mother.<eos> But I am a human being.<eos> There was a time when I thought you were one, too.<eos> ~ Leave me alone.<eos> ~ With pleasure, Mr Grove.<eos> With absolute pleasure.
Is (ha! it? You're irresistible!<eos> - Let go!<eos> - Stay om of this!<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm not sleeping with Pascaline. The idea is appalling.<eos> - So why does she call you?<eos> - Because she can talk to me!<eos> Like it or not, she confides in me!<eos> - She talks to her mother!<eos> - Her mother?
- Because she can talk to me!<eos> Like it or not, she confides in me!<eos> - She talks to her mother!<eos> - Her mother?<eos> She sleeps! She's in a coma! You know that!<eos> All her father cares about are her exam results.<eos> So when she needs to talk to someone she doesn't need to impress, she turns to me.<eos> - You?<eos> - Yes,me!<eos> Him!

And if there's anything you need, please just ask.<eos> Thank you all very much.<eos> Gordon...<eos> Just a moment, please.<eos> Mrs. Edwards, how are you?<eos> Such a terrible ordeal.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - I've kept things going whilst you were away.<eos> Summer florals should be at the front of the perfume display, and these brushes should be in a fan.<eos> Not a wigwam.
I'll set them straight.<eos> I've written to all the papers.<eos> We have to stand up to this.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> I'm so very happy to see you.<eos> And I hope to see you later.<eos> Harry, this is Mr. Gerrard, the architect.<eos> - Mr. Selfridge.<eos> - You've worked together before?<eos> Not on this scale.
Thanks for the dance.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - The mutton stew will be good.<eos> - Mutton stew? Oh!<eos> Is it not one of your favorites?<eos> Er... I'm in your hands.<eos> Well, the one fortunate thing about tonight is that you were with me.<eos> You were wonderful with Mrs. Edwards.<eos> Well, I nursed during the war, so I can cope with a little blood.<eos> And pretty much anything else. Builders, architects -
- Hey!<eos> - Hey...<eos> - Will I see you tonight?<eos> I work late.<eos> - Let's check in later.<eos> The Pyramid!<eos> 15 kronor for two balls.<eos> The Pyramid...<eos> - Isak! Cheers.<eos> - Cheers, cheers.
Hanna?<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I show you something before Ezra gets back?<eos> Here.<eos> So I spent all of last period in the library writing my letter to Talmadge.<eos> And I don't want to sound desperate, but I just figured, you know, if they see, like, a hundred of these every day...<eos> No, it's good, but...<eos> What?<eos> You need to make it more personal.<eos> Personal?
Let's do it.<eos> Don't move.<eos> So you watched the fight?<eos> You're supposed to be doing your homework.<eos> Got it done first.<eos> All of it?<eos> I want you to finish up before you go to bed.<eos> - I'll do it tomorrow.<eos> - Tonight.<eos> - Before school?
Hello, Jack.<eos> I heard about the wee one.<eos> That's a tough break.<eos> - You have our condolences.<eos> - And you're young yet.<eos> Plenty of time to have more kids.<eos> What can I do for you boys?<eos> We come bearing glad tidings.<eos> A match with Creel.<eos> Creel?
Good luck getting it out of her.<eos> So...<eos> We good?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> And we're done.<eos> I don't work with liars.<eos> It's not a moral thing, it's a safety issue.<eos> You understand.<eos> Grace: Eddie ever tell you about the time he hit me?<eos> Fist.
You're making this too personal.<eos> It is personal.<eos> I think you're punishing me for what happened in Russia.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Well, you said it on the plane.<eos> Appointing me was a mistake.<eos> Yeah, you said far worse things to me.<eos> Yes, and I've gone out of my way to put that fight behind us.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Like with Thomas?
- Me.<eos> - How about you go third?<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Gus is gonna go before me?<eos> You don't want to have a Samoan baby.<eos> How is it that no one in this town knows what I am?<eos> - I'm Indian.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> Dot, not feather.
-Fuck you.<eos> God, I've been wanting to do that for so long.<eos> I mean, if this is part of some sort of, uh, big-city foreplay I'm... you're gonna have to walk me through.<eos> There's a musk.<eos> So, have you fucked anyone, yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, where should we do this?<eos> Do what?<eos> The sex.
On Monday, I'd love that if you're cool with that.<eos> Cool.<eos> 6:30's great.<eos> Oh, yeah, tot-- No, I love that place.<eos> It's great.<eos> It's right--<eos> The address is the-- Um, I do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, right, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, just below it, right?
My god, you were a champ.<eos> You were too.<eos> - Damn. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, my god, I could feel my heart in my throat when Lilly was telling me about the vodka.<eos> It's like we're living with an alien.<eos> A nightmare.<eos> It's not going to always be like that.<eos> - You don't think so?<eos> - No, she will come back to us.<eos> - Eventually. - Mm.
My God.<eos> I am fighting for you, Algie. Believe me.<eos> Henry and I both are.<eos> So...<eos> So I may have no position at all at the new hospital?<eos> What about Negro patients?<eos> Our people can entertain you and you shower them with platitudes, but in the end you are no different from the rest of them.<eos> Mrs. Edwards, I believe we've heard enough out of you.<eos> My husband is as generous as they come.<eos> Towards some people.
Now, as with Eleanor, I knew sepsis was the cause, so I removed his teeth at once.<eos> There was little change at first, but I owed it to this young man to help.<eos> And so I removed his tonsils and his gallbladder.<eos> Now the distrust disappeared.<eos> So I kept on.<eos> In the end, his spleen, colon, and testicles, they all came out.<eos> Dear God.<eos> I realize it may seem extreme, but I'm happy to report the young man is now home, he's found employment, no longer struggles with his symptoms.<eos> He is leading a relatively normal life. And five years ago, that would have been impossible.<eos> Normal life?
And Algie invented it, for God's sake.<eos> I'm not quibbling about our boy's skill.<eos> I would take him over Thackery these days.<eos> But our donors believe Thack is a god and we need them to continue believing that.<eos> It's not just... it's not just their estimation of Thackery that matters.<eos> They clearly don't want the new Knick integrated.<eos> Meaning having a Negro doctor or his Negro patients?<eos> Both.<eos> If we want Algie to move uptown with us, we have to sacrifice something.<eos> So the patients.
Because I bedazzled my jazz shoes.<eos> It does not take two hours to bedazzle shoes.<eos> Uh, I don't think.<eos> I... I had another "errand" to run.<eos> Like injecting chocolate with red food dye?<eos> Okay, objection!<eos> Grounds?<eos> Oh, I'll give you grounds.<eos> Rose saw Stanley with her own two eyes.<eos> Well, her own four eyes.
People all over the world pee in buckets.<eos> I will still love you if I see this.<eos> But it may take me a while to recover.<eos> Just go out there.<eos> Please?<eos> No.<eos> What is going on, here, okay?<eos> What is the big problem?<eos> The problem is... the minute we tell people, we're gonna get hit with the questions.<eos> What questions?
I heard Wally is in the market for a second home.<eos> You can sell it to him.<eos> No... I can't just displace George.<eos> He is your tenant.<eos> You are his landlord.<eos> Or, lake-lord.<eos> It's business.<eos> Haven't you ever seen Shark Tank?<eos> In order to succeed in business, you have to be tough.<eos> Cold!
I mean, when are you gonna stop doing that?<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> This is a scheme within a scheme!<eos> Mm-hmm! Lemon: Okay, well, excuse me for wanting the two of you to see in each other what I do.<eos> Okay? Oh! Do you remember that time she got us lost in the woods looking for firewood and tried to get us to bond over our hatred of our history teacher?<eos> (laughing):<eos> I do. I do.<eos> Do you remember the time that she "accidentally" locked us in the janitor's closet at school together?<eos> That was... (laughs) You can be so annoying.<eos> So freaking annoying.
I heard it fast-tracked you to detective.<eos> Bullshit's bullshit even from cops.<eos> What about these?<eos> You were gonna tell me about that, remember?<eos> I never said that. I said it's a long story.<eos> Jerk.<eos> Let's talk about some of your defects for a minute.<eos> Let's start with that hideous mole behind your ear.<eos> Which one?<eos> This one.
If she'd found it, she would've told her lawyer.<eos> And he wouldn't be telling her to keep her mouth shut.<eos> I believe that if you trust someone, they trust you in return.<eos> On the other hand, you lied to these people.<eos> And I'm guessing that at some point in your career, you probably lied to the lawyer, too.<eos> Russ, no one's talking to you because no one trusts you.<eos> No.<eos> That's a ridiculous idea, all right?<eos> Even big-city dealers wouldn't just toss a kilo of heroin into the bushes.<eos> Agnew.
Pre-dawn?<eos> I thought teenagers were supposed to sleep till noon and rot their brains on video games.<eos> Well, maybe I got a defective one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How's Clark?<eos> That's Sheriff Hudson to you.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> News flash... he likes you.<eos> We work together.<eos> Often over dead bodies.
We only moved to Derbyshire because we thought Jocelyn had fallen in with a bad crowd.<eos> We'd no idea she was the ringleader.<eos> By 18, she'd earned enough from prostitution to get her own flat.<eos> Yes, we're her legal parents, but we haven't had control of Jocelyn - and it was the police who said it first - we haven't had control of Jocelyn since she was... 15, 16.<eos> ~ What about her 14th birthday?<eos> ~ Oh.<eos> Broken nose, me, collarbone, him.<eos> She pinned the social worker to the floor and peed on her face.<eos> I was having sex.<eos> ~ With who?
They'd wreck it.<eos> We've all put our neck in the noose for this kid, so there's no going back.<eos> You've never taken anything at face value before.<eos> Cathy can't be the exception.<eos> Patrick Llewellyn's alibi's got some legs.<eos> He said he went to meet Lucy at the Blue Anchor pub the night she went missing.<eos> It's a gay pub, Patrick's a regular there.<eos> Look, here he is, 8:04pm, March 10th.<eos> Now, there's only one camera by the front door, but that same night, he went home with the landlord.<eos> Same again with the other girls.
I admire your optimism, however deluded.<eos> If we're going to get out of this, we'll have to work together.<eos> Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> The time has come to make choices.<eos> What kind of choices?<eos> Simple ones with simple outcomes.<eos> A fair likeness.<eos> Call.<eos> To what purpose?
~ You can't be so much of a monster.<eos> I wasn't once.<eos> But this world made me one.<eos> Now, choose.<eos> Which room?<eos> ~ I don't know who is where.<eos> ~ That's the beauty of it.<eos> A choice made blind. Hoping for the best.<eos> I don't know what you've done with my wife... and my son.<eos> My baby son.
- Nothing.<eos> Shit, if I could just reach the son of a bitch, he could take down Zaman from the inside.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll keep trying. I might still have an old family contact number from our Georgetown days.<eos> You mean Raja went to Georgetown with you?<eos> Yeah, he was that kind of cokehead that never paid for it himself.<eos> Cheap bastard owes me.<eos> He did a lot of coke.<eos> Lot. - I never did it, you know.<eos> - Of course not, sir.
So, uh... Any words of advice for a first-time political prisoner?<eos> Stick to the truth.<eos> That way, you will have died an honorable death.<eos> Yeah, okay. Thank you.<eos> I guess I'll just have to figure it out on my own.<eos> I have no doubt that you will.<eos> I'm Alex, by the way.<eos> I am Vakeel Bashar, the democratically elected Prime Minister of Pakistan.<eos> No shit?<eos> Shit.
~ Aye.<eos> But in the last samples taken, there were definite signs of copper.<eos> A pity she closed before we could dig further.<eos> But if you know of anyone who'd be willing to chance a little speculation, Mr Pascoe...<eos> I'll see what can be done.<eos> I'd require discretion.<eos> I fully comprehend you, sir.<eos> ~ Mizzenmast, you say?<eos> ~ Which is part square-rigged and carries a gaff.<eos> ~ A gaff?
His 'ead be fair full 'o the mine.<eos> He's gone an' breaked me arm!<eos> Let's see.<eos> 'Tis only a sprain - but 'ee'll not be fit to cook vittles this three week.<eos> 'Ee mun' step into th' breach, then!<eos> It's all right, child - Prudie'll instruct 'ee.<eos> Talk o' the blind leading' the blind!<eos> Don't just stand there - brew us a dish o' tea while I rest me broken wing!<eos> ~ Ross, have 'ee got a minute?<eos> ~ By all means.
Good night, my darling boy.<eos> My poor wife, neglected as usual.<eos> How is your father?<eos> Rallying.<eos> Despite Choake's efforts!<eos> You look very lovely, my dear.<eos> Perhaps another night, I still feel a little weak.<eos> You seemed most... animated this afternoon.<eos> Hmm?<eos> With Ross.
My heart!<eos> ~ Fetch the doctor.<eos> ~ Damn Choake promised me Christmas dinner!<eos> He's asked to see you.<eos> I've lost all faith in this world of ours... .. and my legacy.<eos> ~ We both know Francis is not the man you are.<eos> ~ Uncle...<eos> Look after him for me.<eos> ~ Of course.<eos> ~ And our family.
I wouldn't know where to begin.<eos> "Unwell"?<eos> And not even the thought of a tete-a-tete with Ross<eos> ~ could persuade her?<eos> ~ Francis...<eos> She'll have few opportunities with Mistress Poldark to amuse him.<eos> ~ You must be relieved.<eos> ~ How?<eos> You're not the only one to disgrace the family<eos> ~ by an unsuitable attachment.
~ Francis!<eos> Consider yourself fortunate.<eos> See what you've missed.<eos> ~ Dr Choake. ~ Mm?<eos> Mm.<eos> I've puzzled you out.<eos> Was I so hard to fathom?<eos> Well, I thought so, but your recent nuptials have made everything clear.<eos> It delights you to thumb your nose at society, because you consider yourself above the niceties by which it operates.<eos> Not above. Just indifferent.
♪ Wi' your heart mating. ♪<eos> Good night.<eos> It's a curious thing.<eos> We envy a man for something he has.<eos> Yet the truth may be, he hasn't got it after all.<eos> And we have.<eos> Am I rambling?<eos> Ignore me.<eos> Merry Christmas, cousin.<eos> Merry Christmas.

Let's get gone.<eos> Thank you, sir!<eos> 'What brings you to town?<eos> '<eos> Insane optimism?<eos> The fond hope that my banker can drum up sufficient capital to buy out our discontented shareholders.<eos> ~ Before selling to the Warleggans.<eos> ~ I wish you well.<eos> Let us change the subject.<eos> By all means.
To my profession.<eos> And all the better for it.<eos> ~ But...<eos> ~ I never think of her now!<eos> I'm sorry you've had a wasted journey.<eos> If you wish to raise money to buy out your shareholders, you have only one option - raise a mortgage on Nampara.<eos> And risk the very roof over my head.<eos> And with a wife and young child to support.<eos> You'd advise against.<eos> Most emphatically.
It's not that kind of party.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, don't look so sorry for yourself.<eos> It'll be nothing but gaming and toping and dawn-to-dusk business talk.<eos> Will you go, then?<eos> If only to please Francis and throw George off the scent of my latest ventures, but at least you can be spared.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> Hmmm.<eos> To town.<eos> To what purpose?
- Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - No, come on.<eos> - What?<eos> - Uh, nothing, man.<eos> - I'm not getting anything off you.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Something bad is gonna happen.<eos> To you.
She's at work.<eos> Why aren't you dressed, man?<eos> We got work to do.<eos> The jig is up, dude.<eos> It's over.<eos> What?<eos> Don't shoot the messenger, okay?<eos> They're done with us.<eos> Word is, the docks are hot.<eos> - Which dock?
Hey, look, I'm only trying to help, okay?<eos> You wanna ask this guy to lower the gun, and I can talk to you?<eos> I guess you really don't know who I am.<eos> It's fucking late, you know that?<eos> Is it too late for me to apologize to you?<eos> I was...such an asshole.<eos> Yeah, you were.<eos> A really big fucking asshole.<eos> And I don't wanna be that.<eos> Not to you.
That's the thought you can't fight when you meditate, me in a dress?<eos> What do you look like as a girl?<eos> I tell you, my friend...<eos> I am a real beauty... all cheekbones and attitude.<eos> Huh?<eos> The body makes a decision the conscious mind refuses.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm really glad that you caught Jason's murderer.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> And girl.
As long as I'm paying the mortgage on this house, I retain the rights to have an emergency key.<eos> There is no emergency.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> My heart is breaking because my wife is sleeping with another man.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I start sleeping with someone and suddenly you care?<eos> Where were you six months ago?<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> Sleeping with half of Portland.<eos> Two women.
[laughs] Well, let's get down to brass tacks, shall we?<eos> I wonder where that saying originated.<eos> I've never seen a brass tack. It's like that saying "let's kill two birds with one stone."<eos> Let's not.<eos> Why are we murdering birds?<eos> Robert, can you just get to the point?<eos> What are the results?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> ♪ Your buddy did the hokey-pokey ♪<eos> ♪ With your mother ♪
That's, like, the worst thing you can do.<eos> I'm glad you ran into me.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What would you suggest?<eos> Well, your body needs a workout.<eos> You really need to keep it moving.<eos> So, like a run?<eos> Yes, but with less vertical pressure on the knees.<eos> What you're looking for is something high-intensity, really get the heart pounding. Definitely indoors.<eos> And maybe... - maybe with a partner. - Huh.
It's not too bad when you get the hang of it.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> How do you think Greta will go?<eos> - Mum.<eos> - She'll blitz it, no question.<eos> Greta's had her fair share of problems at school before, Elliott.<eos> - That's why we're asking.<eos> - Really?<eos> With like older kids?<eos> Ones her own age, too.
I told them I didn't want a party.<eos> I didn't want people I hardly knew here.<eos> I mean, they'll take one look at me and think I'm a complete deadshit moron.<eos> Probably.<eos> - What do you think of my suit?<eos> - It's nice.<eos> - I'd much rather wear that than this.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you might even get lucky tonight.<eos> - With who?
He might hear you, and you know how objectionable he is right now.<eos> Vickery could have done it.<eos> What do I know? About homicide?<eos> Not much.<eos> Fortunately I do, and I stink at taking advice, so onward to glory, young buck.<eos> I swear none of us knew any of that drug stuff until we read it in the papers.<eos> Art wasn't like that.<eos> He was... "Sweet."<eos> "Generous."<eos> "Fun."

- Do you...<eos> - Today, Gravely!<eos> This is a nice room.<eos> Cascadia girls' school.<eos> It's for problem kids.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> Unicorns and rainbows and stuffed animals in her room, but open her closet door... there's nothing but black clothes, stink of cigarettes.<eos> Uh, girls grow up.<eos> Kids go through phases.<eos> Same thing with Lacy Siddon.
We don't use the terms "good," "bad," "students."<eos> We like to refer to the girls as "punkins"...<eos> "punks" for short.<eos> It acknowledges where they come from, but in a fun way.<eos> Talia's mother believes that she was doing drugs.<eos> Most children experiment with substances.<eos> It's unavoidable.<eos> We believe in allowing our punks to find themselves through trial and error in a safe environs.<eos> We're gonna have to talk to Talia's friends.<eos> Especially the bad, stupid ones.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em, ma'am.<eos> We're not here for you.<eos> We just want the guy who entered.<eos> Simon Muraayn, have you seen him?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Drop the gun and get on your knees!<eos> You stuck your head in the wrong door!<eos> And now you're gonna get it blown from here to the Stank Belt.<eos> Who are you with?<eos> You with the scavvies?
Pree, please.<eos> Let's not lower the Royale's standards.<eos> Oh, sweetums, this is Westerley.<eos> Low is the standard.<eos> You're just in time, we're helping D'avin decide on a job.<eos> Hey, I got it!<eos> Algae farm night watchman.<eos> - Boom! - Actually, John, there's something I should tell you.<eos> I know you want me to stick around and get a regular job, but I've been considering... another option.<eos> Killjoy.

If you pass the tests, you have a berth on Lucy.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, you don't suck at it.<eos> And new blood's good sometimes, keeps things interesting.<eos> Plus for some dumb reason,<eos> - Johnny seems to like you. - Sort of.<eos> Say I was a badass today.<eos> I'm saying you helped us make the warrant, save the girl, and keep a weapon of mass destruction away from a crazy lady.<eos> If you want to scrub toilets in the Badlands, fine... but if you want more of that... - come be a Killjoy.<eos> - Killjoy...
They've just been replaced by me being furious you wouldn't let me sleep in your bed.<eos> Don't be ungrateful.<eos> Not like you actually inconvenienced yourself for me.<eos> Can't masturbate now because of you.<eos> Were you going to?<eos> No, but you've taken away my freedom.<eos> This... this right here, what we're doing here, is the loneliest thing I've ever done.<eos> Sleeping with you is lonelier than being alone.<eos> Go back to your room, then.<eos> With all the monsters?
Her name is Yrsa.<eos> She's like us.<eos> You like this girl, don't you?<eos> You feel very connected to this boy.<eos> I remember what it was like to first share someone's every thought and emotion.<eos> This is very dangerous.<eos> I was in love with Angelica from the moment our eyes touched.<eos> Love inside a cluster is pathological.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Sometimes.

I thought I... I would stand here and want to die again.<eos> Or worse, that I would stand here and not want to.<eos> Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I don't know who I am.<eos> I still think of you...<eos> coming to my school.<eos> Come with me.<eos> It's like something that happened to someone else.<eos> The me that loved you... that wanted to have a huge family with you... that me's not this me.<eos> That me is here with you.<eos> And with you.
Are we really calling them that?<eos> Think about it. They killed Tracy and walked away.<eos> They killed Lucas and walked away.<eos> Why would they leave and come back to take the bodies?<eos> Someone else has to be taking them.<eos> But the bodies aren't just bodies.<eos> They're...<eos> They're failures.<eos> So if the Chimeras are all failures, what's the success going to be?<eos> Bad.

And now they're back.<eos> All because a few teenagers, who never even considered the consequences, decided to reignite a supernatural force they barely understand.<eos> The Nemeton.<eos> How do you even know about that?<eos> I know because I saw it.<eos> Kira, whatever you're doing, please stop.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> It's just happening.<eos> Who did you come with?<eos> - Our friends.
Yeah, we're fine.<eos> It's just a scratch.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, wait, wait!<eos> We need them.<eos> We're all called upon to serve his glory... but the Master has anointed you above the others.<eos> This is a great honor and an even greater responsibility.<eos> All due to your connection with your dear one.<eos> - Zack.<eos> - Yes, him.
Thank you.<eos> Okay, you two, just word of warning -- You're not fooling anyone.<eos> That is not true.<eos> Okay, well, you're not fooling everyone.<eos> I will locate albert reid.<eos> Niedermayer, you get the lieutenant and almond up to date.<eos> Reid: Yeah, I gave gu a bad review.<eos> Psychics are supposed to help, not ruin your life.<eos> Almond: Well, you called him a fraud.<eos> And a conman.
You know, there was a moment there, you know, back when you guys were first, you know, seeing each other, I came home one time, and you guys hadn't gotten together yet.<eos> And I met her for the first time.<eos> I mean, wow.<eos> When I met her for the first-- And she-<eos> - You know, there was...<eos> Damn.<eos> - There was a thing there, you know?<eos> - "A thing."<eos> What's "a thing"?<eos> Between her and me.
- No. - Military?<eos> - I was told... that Mr. Donovan is discreet and not afraid of violence.<eos> You've heard of my son's abduction.<eos> Yes.<eos> Last night, the kidnappers contacted the media.<eos> This morning, they demanded $5 million in ransom.<eos> Don't you think that's strange?<eos> - Could be.<eos> - You've dealt with this thing before.<eos> - Kidnapping.
I fought them off.<eos> I stabbed one with a pen and shot him.<eos> The other got away with the money.<eos> - Who am I?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Never seen you before in my life.<eos> Good.<eos> My father's gonna kill me.<eos> Smell that?<eos> Jasmine.
It was already a mess when I got there.<eos> Casey's idiot friend Nick is dead.<eos> Media's turning my son into some kind of action hero.<eos> You even made one of them run away... just in case I was the kind of man that would ask insurance... to cover the 5 million that you just returned to me.<eos> Are you?<eos> My father was a criminal, Mr. Donovan.<eos> He ensured that I didn't have to be.<eos> And your father?<eos> What did he do?<eos> Nothing good.
You're not really worried about the kids, Gin.<eos> It's that study that you're worried about.<eos> I let my kids go for nothing.<eos> I never meant to hurt Virginia.<eos> No.<eos> You never do.<eos> Our father was a monster.<eos> "When you get down on your knees, son, and beg for mercy," "that's when I'll stop."<eos> You were just a kid.<eos> A boy.
Give me your honest opinion.<eos> If it seems in good shape, maybe we should have a press conference.<eos> Trust that our work can finally speak for itself.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll read the book.<eos> Henry?<eos> Did the doctor say he'll be okay?<eos> Yes, Henry's going to be fine.<eos> So fine, in fact, that he's in town, celebrating with Tammy.<eos> Tina.
I'm not interested in being in charge.<eos> I want to work, I want to do my thing.<eos> I'm not interested in product managing.<eos> Well, I'm not either.<eos> Look, I've been watching people chat on the network while they're playing, sometimes even after for hours on end, and I think there's a real opportunity for a community to exist outside the games.<eos> So if you just help me with the managerial side, then I can play around with that and still keep my hands in the guts of the network and I'm a happy camper.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, dickhead.<eos> Those computers you sold us were counterfeits.<eos> Bummer.
I got nothing to admit to.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You're a predator.<eos> This is not my fault.<eos> Oh, so now you're gonna blame the victim?<eos> Uh-uh, buddy.<eos> That doesn't play.<eos> You're done.<eos> I swear to you on my mother's life...<eos> Your mother!
- Down he goes. - One...<eos> - You're a bum, Masters!<eos> Four...<eos> Five...<eos> Stay down.<eos> You're beat.<eos> A man's got to know when he's beat, son.<eos> A man has got to learn.<eos> Nothing but a damn fool.<eos> Goddamn fool.
Am I?<eos> Misled?<eos> Misled?<eos> Look at this.<eos> "Too many people of any category together can lead to a ghetto situation"?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Your Honor, I know we're well past your deadline for approving the affordable housing component, but the cardinal's turnaround has the council marching backwards.<eos> They're asking for a new vote on the consent decree.<eos> They're saying that your decision is antireligion.<eos> Or anti-Catholic.
I mean this... This could be the best house in Yonkers.<eos> You know, a little work, a little money.<eos> - A lot. (CHUCKLES)<eos> - Always wanted a house like this.<eos> - How much is it?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - (GIGGLES) You don't know? - No, no, no.<eos> I never called the number.<eos> Shit, I didn't have you with me. I wasn't mayor of Yonkers.<eos> - "Youngest mayor in America," right?
She's at the grocery store and Daddy's at work.<eos> So, how you doin', little sis?<eos> - I'm getting better. - Mm-hmm. Feeling better.<eos> Not that they trust me to go anywhere or do anything.<eos> I've been thinking, maybe you and Jaron could come stay with me at my apartment.<eos> I mean, if Ma and Daddy see you all right, they gotta come round to trusting you again.<eos> For real?<eos> I want you to come out with me today.<eos> Meet a friend of mine out of Dunbar Homes.<eos> - A friend?
- Yep.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You think I'm kidding?<eos> And sometimes I have to go in my house and pull the shades down just to get away from them.<eos> If-- if I were you, I'd just go about my business.<eos> If you see them, say hello.<eos> Yeah, if they don't say hello back, then fine, but at least no one can accuse you of not being polite.<eos> And that's what we've been doing.<eos> - And what about the dogs? - Yeah.<eos> - What dogs? - The...
Have you always lived here?<eos> Did you grow up somewhere else?<eos> - Somewhere else.<eos> - So how'd you end up here?<eos> - I ran away from home.<eos> - That's a very brave thing, Eva.<eos> New places can be very intimidating especially on your own.<eos> Why don't we talk a little bit about the home that you ran away from?<eos> Who did you live there with?<eos> My brother and my father and... my mother.
You still want to press charges?<eos> I didn't want to press charges in the first place.<eos> It's over, Ted.<eos> That right?<eos> I'll be out of your hair soon.<eos> On my way.<eos> Your mother's gone to get some food.<eos> Gonna do something for your, uh... for your deal, I guess.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Just her way.
God... is nowhere near this place.<eos> You were supposed to share your vision.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I didn't know until I was back up there in front of all those people, but I am through living a lie.<eos> Joshua, think about what you're throwing away here!<eos> This is lunacy!<eos> I guess the old man was right.<eos> What are you gonna do now?<eos> Follow the path.<eos> The real one.
Because 10 more G.I.s got discharged.<eos> I had to show a guy from Canarsie how to use a rivet gun.<eos> Ohh. I think I have tuberculosis.<eos> Thanks, by the way.<eos> You loaned this to me last night while you were at work.<eos> It looks better on you.<eos> Kind of thing might really catch a man's eye...<eos> Say, on a... date?<eos> Well, don't hold your breath...<eos> Especially with tuberculosis.
I'll make you some tea.<eos> Wow.<eos> Peg, you look like a million bucks.<eos> Wait.<eos> Were you out out?<eos> In a manner of speaking.<eos> Oh, Peg, I'm... I'm really proud of you.<eos> I knew you were too great a catch to be alone for too long.<eos> I want you to tell me all about it...<eos> In the morning.
You need to determine where his true loyalties lie.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Well, we've got it.<eos> We've got the first two songs for invitationals.<eos> Uh... don't we need more people just to participate in invitationals?<eos> No, you don't need a full glee club for invitationals.<eos> It's a trial run for future competitions.<eos> No judges or prizes.<eos> More stage time for us.<eos> Twinning.

They gonna be found.<eos> Bunkie wouldn't hurt nobody.<eos> I understand, baby.<eos> He was like a father to you.<eos> Come here... (sniffling) Come here.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Don't you ever touch me again!<eos> Hakeem...<eos> Don't disrespect your mother like that.<eos> Hakeem...
'Cause we can't take Lucy this deep.<eos> The sand here, it reflects electromagnetics;<eos> it fries the navs, whatever.<eos> - Besides, wasn't that fun?<eos> - Let me simplify, Rookie bad air make ship go boom.<eos> Badlands are what the Company leaves behind after they strip an area bare.<eos> Hell of a place to hide a baby maker for blue bloods.<eos> Clever.<eos> - Does that horizon look hinky?<eos> - Whoa, easy with the technical terms.
He was never really mine, but I hoped I would stay in his life, teach him about my home.<eos> Help raise a Qreshi leader who understands Leith.<eos> There's certainly time.<eos> I need you to take Clara and I home.<eos> Your farm?<eos> No.<eos> - That's not my home anymore.<eos> - Don't say you're staying a Vessel.<eos> No.<eos> A Guardian.
Our circuit takes us up and down the J star cluster.<eos> When you are done working off your fare, we can drop you off at any one of the colonies along our route.<eos> Until then, we own you.<eos> Every fight you win goes towards paying down your fare.<eos> The further you wanna travel, the more you gotta pay off; the more you gotta pay off, the more you gotta fight.<eos> Fan favorites get more matches, so let's try to look pretty out there.<eos> Now... watch and learn.<eos> Listen, what would it cost me to pick my first opponent?<eos> Depends. Who you got in mind?<eos> Coby Andras.
Asshole.<eos> Mom died three years ago.<eos> Mom died?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know.<eos> How?<eos> She had Quinsy pretty bad the last couple of years.<eos> Couldn't find you to tell you.<eos> But that's exactly what you wanted, huh?<eos> Cut ties with everyone?<eos> Even me? Huh?
You're making a really big mistake here.<eos> Biggest mistake I ever made was having you for a friend!<eos> You need a ride, Mr. Lindsey?<eos> The boy lived on a dead-end street, no forced entry, killed not far from home, with boots and jacket on.<eos> Think a 5-year-old left in the middle of the night, without making a sound, with someone he didn't trust?<eos> You've profiled cases like this before at the FBI.<eos> What possible motive could anyone have for killing his young boy?<eos> Jealousy or sex.<eos> Really?<eos> Over a 5-year-old?
I don't know what kind of space.<eos> I just need space.<eos> Take all the space you need.<eos> I'll be by myself while Veronica takes her space.<eos> You won't be by yourself, you'll be with your precious angels who you run for every second.<eos> Well, I'm so sorry, they can't take care of themselves.<eos> Please, you'll be running after them when they're 35.<eos> At least one parent will.<eos> - Get out.<eos> - My pleasure.
Some torn rags, some matches.<eos> So... there's no question that you're going away for the attempted murder of your cousin Vito, yeah?<eos> So what?<eos> Well, and since I'm pretty sure that you used this same bag of tricks for the fire this morning at Sean Markel's, I'll bet that's his DNA on the brick.<eos> Which means that you're going away for that attempted murder, too.<eos> So what?<eos> Oh. We've got the forensics report from Guziewicz's house, and once we match the kerosene to the glass, then you're going away for that fire, as well.<eos> For what?<eos> The fire.<eos> Last night.
Students.<eos> With big ideas and big mouths.<eos> Why do the parents want her found all of a sudden?<eos> Probably got tired of her embarrassing the old man.<eos> It's all in the files.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... So, what's my contract exactly?<eos> Find Julie Mao, if she's still here on Ceres, detain her, and ship her home.<eos> Kidnap job.<eos> My pleasure.
Really?<eos> For the last couple of weeks, and if that is the...<eos> Me? Flirting with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh! No, you, sir, are the flirt.<eos> You are the flirt!<eos> And the reason i said no to you Is because you are a serial boyfriend.<eos> You jump from one bad relationship To another bad relationship.<eos> And when the new ones don't work out, You just recycle the old ones.<eos> Like tansy!
G.T.'s here.<eos> He can help!<eos> And bail us out when we go to jail.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> What's-what's going on?<eos> Scooter took me to dinner, But he didn't propose.<eos> Well, maybe he'll do it another time, tans.<eos> No, he won't live to get the chance.<eos> Turns out he's seeing someone else, Someone from work.<eos> Melissa lynn.
Uh, i was hoping to... Um, to talk with dr. Breeland.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He told you who i am?<eos> Yes. Yes, he did.<eos> Look, i...<eos> I had no choice but to come here today, you realize that.<eos> (sighs) i did a Terrible thing.<eos> For 15 years, i've lived with that.<eos> With that guilt.

Nothing escapes from them that causes you any comfort.<eos> Screams fill some of those places, but the corridors do not echo screaming... because I hear music.<eos> The Studiolo is a small, fierce group.<eos> They have ruined a number of academic reputations.<eos> Appearing before them is a peril.<eos> You were very eager to see me discredited,<eos> Professor Sogliato. - Hm!<eos> You sang for your supper before the dragons at the Studiolo.<eos> And you sang very well.<eos> First, applause, and then by... wet eyed acclamation. Hm!
prime cuts went to nobility, second to the clergy, third to the bourgeoisie and fourth to the army.<eos> The quinto quarto, the offal, went to the poor.<eos> The fifth quarter?<eos> The innards of a carcass constitute roughly - a quarter of its weight.<eos> - El quinto quarto evolved from necessity to become high tradition.<eos> Sibilo caratteristico.<eos> When the lungs whistle, the dish is done.<eos> Coratella con carciofi.<eos> Purple artichokes served with spring lamb's liver,<eos> - lungs and heart. - Hm...
I am learning all sorts of new things about myself these days.<eos> I'm learning new things about you, too.<eos> Imitation allows us to better understand the behavior of others.<eos> I have great empathy for you, Will.<eos> Both of us eviscerated and accused --<eos> I have literally felt your pain.<eos> We have matching scars.<eos> You need a friend friend.<eos> You will leave this hospital under a cloud of suspicion.<eos> Not a cloud, a fog.
I'm still in the office.<eos> I've locked the door, like.<eos> Coach has already left, has it?<eos> Nah, it stops for half an hour so's the driver can get his dinner.<eos> Where does that happen?<eos> He sits on the bus.<eos> Er, he's got a flask and some cheese and pickle sandwiches.<eos> ~ No, it's ham and cheese and pickle...<eos> ~ Right.<eos> ~ .. sandwiches.
~ And then did you find...?<eos> ~ Tell us in your own words, Stuart.<eos> What happened next exactly?<eos> I cannot exactly remember.<eos> I pushed her on the floor and then I had me way with her!<eos> And then I killed her!<eos> I killed her!<eos> How?<eos> How did you kill her, Stuart?<eos> With me bare hands.
Hello?<eos> Gemma, it's me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I can't see you any more, John.<eos> 'Don't call me again.<eos> I'm sorry.'<eos> I'll write you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You been messing around with me life, Bacchus?<eos> ~ With your wife?

♪<eos> We are walking, yes, we are, we are walking, we're doing a little side-step and twirl.<eos> Alright, not the twirling type, I understand.<eos> Umm clearly what we have here... is the Swedish flag.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> No cross, no blue divided into quarters.<eos> Exactly, the intention of the famed, underground Swedish painter...<eos> Svea Svenssonsson who depicts here a... country divided.<eos> By what?<eos> Music.
Zeus?<eos> He's the one who put me there in the first place.<eos> So you escaped?<eos> I'm not bound to Tartarus, Bo.<eos> I'm bound to Hades.<eos> My father.<eos> So you two are Bonnie and Clyding it, huh?<eos> Tell me, do you two prefer Persades or Herdephone?<eos> When he was released, so was I.<eos> With a promise.
She's... fine.<eos> Lexa, too.<eos> Lovejoy's key card will get you into the armory.<eos> The guns are locked, but the guard has the key.<eos> I can lure him away or...<eos> No.<eos> There's no time.<eos> Once I get the guns, how do I get them to level 5?<eos> They're watching every door.<eos> Maybe not.
Bellamy's counting on you.<eos> Everyone's always counting on you.<eos> Well, what do you want from me?<eos> You trusted Lexa.<eos> You let a bomb drop on Tondc.<eos> You let all those people...<eos> I am doing the best I can!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, it's not good enough.<eos> Oh, Bellamy.
You did the right thing, Paige.<eos> Do you think that's a comfort?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Key's on the counter.<eos> You know, my father never would have killed Varick if you weren't around.<eos> He fell in love with the idea that there was always gonna be someone there to save him from himself.<eos> I'll have my girl check on you in the morning.<eos> Are you sure you can't stay?<eos> Santa Monica.<eos> By the pier.
Raymond.<eos> ...of an unidentified adult male.<eos> Sources are currently saying the victim may have been an employee of the Finney organi...<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Conor's at a friend's house, and, uh...<eos> Abby's out looking for Bridget.<eos> Why is she looking for Bridget?<eos> Sit down... there's something I got to tell ya.<eos> Bridget got involved with someone at school.<eos> Who?
Here you go.<eos> Imagine.<eos> Ooh, Swiss francs!<eos> Time to take my wife for a night on the town.<eos> Hey, wait a minute!<eos> So, what kind of lunch do you pack?<eos> Wow, Elon, you're like Willy Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.<eos> Uh, I'd like to offer you something.<eos> But all I got is coffee.<eos> With cream!
What happened after?<eos> - You really don't remember this?<eos> - No, I was 7 years old.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I remember Sarah drowned.<eos> - And I remember Dad was devastated.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then Danny got hurt.<eos> - Right.<eos> His shoulder.
Busted.<eos> Oh, you busted me cold, Mom.<eos> You busted me cold.<eos> I haven't done this since I was a kid.<eos> Your father did not approve.<eos> You know, for all his libertarian ways, he was a bit of a stick in the mud.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The stick was stuck somewhere anyway.<eos> I was fun once.<eos> Even a little wild.
Well, see you.<eos> Hey, uh, Carol?<eos> You know I did this, right?<eos> Yeah, I know, Phil.<eos> It was... a lot of work and it took all night and I had to go to a library and read a bunch of crap.<eos> Yeah, it's very, very obvious it was you who did it.<eos> Feels good, I'll admit.<eos> It feels good to be so selfless.<eos> Anyway, we can talk more about it at dinner.<eos> Okay.
Hey.<eos> I just wanted to apologize for what I said.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just came to give you an update.<eos> Nat called already.<eos> I guess, you know, we don't have to worry about Cooper coming around anymore.<eos> For now.<eos> Well, I was just gonna leave to meet a client, so...<eos> At night?
Yes, I can see how that would earn you some enemies.<eos> Well, it was worth it.<eos> That boy, Winston, he's something special - a smart lad!<eos> He'll be the first man of colour to make the Bar, you mark my words!<eos> Dr Blake has better things to do than listen to your raves, dear.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Tell me, you don't recall speaking with Emma on the night of the bonfire?<eos> No, no, sorry.<eos> I was quite preoccupied with my work, I'm afraid.<eos> Your work?
Now I'm a Browns fan, all the way.<eos> No, sorry,<eos> I don't think we're talking about the same thing.<eos> Um, I'm worried that Kurt is, uh... depressed.<eos> Oh. No, deeply.<eos> And I'm concerned about him.<eos> Look, I-I walked in on him, and he was reading this.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing.
It's amazing.<eos> We-we sing and we dance and it's full of inducing community-based activities.<eos> Look, uh, Kurt... it's not like I got a problem with it.<eos> I'm all for singing and dancing, but the point of this was for you to feel what it's like to bond over a shared goal.<eos> Well, Glee Club is-is kind of like that.<eos> At the end of the term, we-we perform at this big competition in front of an audience.<eos> Against other schools, you know?<eos> So it really is like a sports team?<eos> Yeah, yeah, uh, kind of.<eos> Except with choreography and Beyoncé.
The guy with the perfect life needs to hang out with the damaged goods.<eos> Who you calling "damaged goods"?<eos> No one!<eos> I'm just saying that I don't trust him.<eos> I mean, he already gets everything that he wants.<eos> What is he doing barging into our club and taking it over?<eos> Mark my words, he's gonna get some jocks and some Cheerios! To join him, and then we are gonna get pushed out.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Nobody pushes out Mercedes Jones.<eos> Or Kurt Hummel.
Yeah, use your feet to support you!<eos> Come on! Don't stop, Roderick!<eos> You're not even trying!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go! Stop being such a wuss!<eos> That was pathetic.<eos> You have the athleticism of a couch cushion.<eos> Okay, you know, none of your tough love, drill sergeant crap is helping me at all.<eos> - Don't be so sensitive.<eos> - "Sensitive"?

But probably not what we're looking to do at the bar mitzvah.<eos> I'd love to see a new combination, though.<eos> Maybe something with you and Jane in there.<eos> Maybe Roderick.
I beg your pardon?<eos> Well, for instance, we learned that you were not born in the Panama Canal Zone, you did not fight in the Falklands War, you did not play any role in extracting the dictator Noriega, nor is there any evidence whatsoever that you were ever waterboarded.<eos> Now, Geraldo, I'm gonna stop you right there.<eos> I waterboarded myself.<eos> You did not direct the TV movie.<eos> The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, you don't have Trinidadian roots, nor were you ever, even for the shortest time, the tambourine player for Wilson Phillips.<eos> I played tambourine for Wilson Phillips.<eos> Geraldo, I-I'd like to respond to some of these allegations.<eos> You've claimed to have romantic involvements with Dan Quayle,<eos> Stephen Baldwin, Matt Lauer,
This is McKinley, dude.<eos> Yeah, your sexist empire doesn't even exist.<eos> Our look is iconic.<eos> Synonymous with tradition and excellence.<eos> Not to mention, it elevates anyone who wears it to sex-symbol status.<eos> Wait, I'll take one.<eos> Women love these.<eos> Do they?<eos> Come on, guys, we've welcomed you to our school with open arms.<eos> Semi-open.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!<eos> All right, everyone, take five.<eos> And then we're doing it all over again.<eos> Sue Sylvester,<eos> I think I speak for all of Vocal Adrenaline when I say we'd be honored to have you as our coach.<eos> Sam, good, I need your help;<eos> we have to figure out what to do with this whole Warbler crisis, especially now that Sue is on the attack.<eos> So here, will you put this jacket on?<eos> Um, I think you're making a mistake.<eos> With the jacket?

People's memories these days ain't so good.<eos> Back in the day, I couldn't wait to see this view.<eos> Me and the boys, driving in Friday nights.<eos> Kings of the castle.<eos> Kings don't have bodies in the trunk.<eos> Tell that to Macbeth.<eos> What's this about you moving to Florida?<eos> Did you hear about Rigoletto?<eos> Heard he retired.<eos> Yeah... in pieces.
Now, beyond that, beyond these walls... he may well face a judgment of his own making.<eos> But here... in this courtroom... the judgment is yours... and yours alone.<eos> - I need to talk to him.<eos> - He sends his apologies.<eos> I don't care about his...<eos> Where is he?<eos> This needs attention.<eos> He's indisposed.<eos> With what?<eos> Art.
What's the offer?<eos> The world's becoming more corporate-- this was their pitch to me.<eos> And in this new world, there's no room for family business.<eos> So war.<eos> They're offering to buy the whole operation, then pay us to run it.<eos> Bottom line.<eos> Bottom line-- very little changes on the ground.<eos> We may actually earn more.<eos> But instead of running it, we report to them.<eos> - To who?
Apparently, one of your victims was a judge.<eos> - A judge, huh? - Uh-huh.<eos> The older woman.<eos> Out of North Dakota.<eos> Papa!<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes?<eos> What's the story?<eos> What story?<eos> About the oyster.
Do you miss it?<eos> What?<eos> Well, the-- the country-- you know, the wet, the heat, the bugs?<eos> Do you miss that?<eos> God, no.<eos> It's this quiet I can't get used to, this... frozen winter.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Can't argue with ya.<eos> Did you work the tunnels?<eos> The--
The market says offer more money, we offer more money.<eos> Whatever the pluses and minuses dictate.<eos> And on the Gerhardt kid-- this Rye?<eos> Get this.<eos> He gunned down a judge-- some small hick town a couple hours south from here-- then disappeared.<eos> On the run now, we're thinking.<eos> On the run is good.<eos> On the run we can use.<eos> Find him.<eos> You, not them.
From above.<eos> Some say they take you to their ship and probe you in places you don't want to mention.<eos> I believe their purposes are more benevolent.<eos> As the caretaker to the zoo, strange happenings occur, they are near.<eos> Strange happenings, huh?<eos> I wondered what was causing that.<eos> You think it worked?<eos> What's that, hon?<eos> I said you think it worked?<eos> Today, with the car?
I was 10 when they came.<eos> Soldiers in uniform with that... folded up flag.<eos> You were in Chicago, I think.<eos> Mom says.<eos> There's that picture in the hall of you and all the kids.<eos> That winter in Bear Lake.<eos> Everyone else in coats, but Elron's in a t-shirt, makin' muscles.<eos> What would he do now?<eos> You know?<eos> Now with this.
He's got a crippled arm.<eos> Now, see, I don't see that.<eos> I see heart and will.<eos> I see spirit.<eos> I see grandpa after the war.<eos> Right, Pop?<eos> Grandpa, who stows away on a boat, comes to America, and builds an empire.<eos> Compared to that, what have you ever done?<eos> Or me?<eos> Arm or no arm?
Me?<eos> I can fix the toaster.<eos> Well, maybe just, uh...<eos> Do you think maybe... you could watch Molly for a bit?<eos> I just don't-- I'm not sure<eos> - if I can keep my eyes open right now...<eos> - Okay.<eos> For some reason.<eos> Watch who?<eos> Me!

Where you been?<eos> I just met a-a friend.<eos> You think you're grown, is that it?<eos> What?<eos> With your clothes and your hair and no bra?<eos> Like you know somethin' about the world?<eos> Being grown's got a price.<eos> Kid gets slapped when he's bad.<eos> When you're grown, you get the fist.<eos> Or the knife.
Or cover 'em in bacon and leave 'em for the dogs.<eos> I stabbed him!<eos> The Indian. He wanted a haircut and I stabbed him with the scissors.<eos> In the back.<eos> Boy, she makes us look like the gang that can't shoot straight, doesn't she?<eos> Our beautician.<eos> It's worth mentionin', you know, in the spirit of full disclosure,<eos> my plan, it worked.<eos> I made a deal for Dodd.<eos> With, what, the Gerhardts?

Knock it off!<eos> Hey, I got to go to Austin for the day.<eos> I know.<eos> Erin already asked me to watch Amy.<eos> How you doing?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - 'Cause it's okay not to be fine.<eos> You know, you don't have to be so tough all the time.<eos> You know, if you need to cry, you can cry.<eos> Over what?
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm bringing you home.<eos> Raul. Hey.<eos> - You hear anything?<eos> - Nothing useful.<eos> Guess we'll never know where the clues'll be hidden.<eos> Come on, Erin. God's not testing us, he's messing with us.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go talk to that guy over there.<eos> See if I can get any info out of him.<eos> Why him?
She vanquished Finn, yes, but only after she herself resurrected him, and though lauded for saving Rebekah from Eva Sinclair, how do we know she didn't have a hand in waking that demon in the first place?<eos> Niklaus, if we cannot trust one another, we can't work together.<eos> No.<eos> We cannot.<eos> Aiden.<eos> To what do I owe this visit?<eos> I just wanted to tell you that Hayley, Jackson, and Hope are at Marcel's jazz club, and they're safe there, very well protected.<eos> Well, you can hardly be my eyes and ears there if you're standing before me.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Uh, for this.
Loyalty is in my DNA, but I can't live with myself if I'm spying for Klaus because I'm not cut out to be a double agent, so I'm gonna tell Jackson everything.<eos> What?<eos> Because it's so much better to be killed by Jackson than Klaus?<eos> And even if he doesn't kill you, then what?<eos> Then meet me in two hours.<eos> Let's get out of here and finally start our life together.<eos> Wow!<eos> You really want to just...<eos> Go...<eos> With me?
I did die here and all, but, well, this was the first place I ever felt like myself.<eos> I know this is all really fast, but if you want this, I'll see you in two hours.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> - Of course, I'll be there.<eos> - Ok.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, Aiden.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Whoa!
After a while, I don't see them either.<eos> And how many is it gonna take before she disappears?<eos> - Come on. - Uh-uh.<eos> You need to know that she is back and on the loose.<eos> Now I need to find her before the witches do so I can save my friend who is trapped inside of her, and I came to you because you are the only person in this city who knows her inside out.<eos> Look, man.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend, but if Eva is back in control of her body...<eos> Then you need to let the witches put that body down.<eos> Eva will use up your sister just like she did the others.<eos> The others?
Then she gets a fight.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You're entering Eva's mind.<eos> If she kills you in there, you will be lost, and if you kill her before you free Rebekah, then Rebekah will be gone forever.<eos> Once you have Rebekah, then and only then can Eva be dealt with.<eos> We got it.<eos> You need a weapon.<eos> How am I supposed to take that with me?<eos> This is going to hurt.<eos> Ok.
You're quiet.<eos> Are you having misgivings?<eos> I was just looking for a polite way to ask what the hell is taking so long.<eos> Well, we can begin now.<eos> Once we're linked, I'll no longer have to sleep for 100 years again.<eos> Your concerns for my status will ease, and I will finally be able to focus on hope.<eos> I will only need a single drop of her blood, and then her power shall be mine, also.<eos> What do you want to do about Freya?<eos> She served her purpose.<eos> So tonight...
And what might that be?<eos> He has to get her to link to him.<eos> My brother wishes to bind himself to our enemy?<eos> She'll be virtually indestructible.<eos> He said I ha to convince you that everything he had to do he had to do alone.<eos> You had the wrong ingredients to kill Dahlia, and he has to buy time before he finds the right ones.<eos> How?<eos> Ha ha!<eos> Ohh...<eos> With your strength,
Elijah...<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> We have another plan.<eos> Rebekah and Davina found a way.<eos> If we can replicate hope's magic, we can lure Dahlia into a trap, after which, I'll kill her myself.<eos> All we need is a vial of hope's blood.<eos> I'll give you her blood.<eos> I'm trusting you, Elijah.<eos> The moment our home is safe, you can return hope to where she belongs...<eos> With family.
You didn't.<eos> But you did have a good teacher.<eos> You were looking for Malcolm that night.<eos> We know about each other.<eos> Wait, Malcolm knows that you're the Arrow?<eos> I am amazed that he didn't tell you.<eos> Then why did you... tell me?<eos> Why now?<eos> Because Ra's al Ghul is coming for us.<eos> All of us.
It doesn't have to be like this.<eos> Bro!<eos> I dropped my first body with that piece.<eos> You know the deal;<eos> you take me down first, you walk out alive.<eos> He actually tagged me.<eos> All yours, boys.<eos> Your attorney doesn't have your best interests at heart, Mr. Fisher.<eos> Otherwise, you'd be walking out of here a free man.<eos> Yeah, more like a dead man.
Besides, you don't own a jet anymore.<eos> In 1854, I encountered an illusionist in Vienna, and he was dazzling, magnificent, powerful, and then nearly half a century later, I stumbled upon this man again.<eos> He was withered, broken, dying.<eos> You see, a magician can cheat many things except one.<eos> Please.<eos> I was your horseman.<eos> Let me hunt for you once more.<eos> Allow me to prove to you my reborn loyalty.<eos> Al Sa-Her, face your death with honor.<eos> Or at least dignity.
All men seek guidance, a purpose.<eos> The means to live without pain.<eos> Those who journey here have given such an exchange For their fealty.<eos> You mean they have to kill for you?<eos> No, Mr. Queen, they have to die for me.<eos> Is all of this supposed to impress me?<eos> No.<eos> It's to inform you.<eos> Surely men have branded you a murderer,<eos> A torturer.
Your resurrection wasn't a gift from these waters, Rather by force of your own will.<eos> And what better heir to immortality Than someone who has already claimed victory over death?<eos> I didn't defy death just to become an instrument of it.<eos> We are justice.<eos> Isn't that what you've dedicated your life to?<eos> Then why confine your crusade to a single city... When I can give you a whole world to save.<eos> By executing anyone who stands in my way?<eos> You would command resources that you cannot even fathom.<eos> Numbers greater than any army.<eos> And more loyal.
And more loyal.<eos> Now, if you wish for them to renounce killing as you did, Thy will be done.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> It's called<eos> The League of Assassins for a reason.<eos> The League's reason would be your own.<eos> You would be Ra's Al Ghul.<eos> And what if I say no?<eos> Then you are free to leave.<eos> With your compatriots,
What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for you, actually.<eos> I missed your sister.<eos> I suppose I wanted something to remind me of her.<eos> Now's really not the best time.<eos> Are you...<eos> Having problems with your father?<eos> I have some experience in that area.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> With you?
What's happening is not your fault.<eos> Shrieve is to blame, this is his doing.<eos> I can't get through.<eos> Everyone's calling the police.<eos> We're all inoculated, remember?<eos> I want to get back to my son.<eos> Have not been back to this place since I pledged myself to the League.<eos> What happened here?<eos> When I joined the League, I was conscripted with another man.<eos> Damien Darhk.
You can right my wrongs.<eos> You...<eos> Can be better than I was.<eos> You can save this city.<eos> I love you.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> I promise that for one of you, it'll be well worth your time.<eos> You've read the briefing.<eos> With the proper resources, you can own...<eos> Armageddon.
Then what?<eos> You're going to jail, too?<eos> I can't just do nothing.<eos> I think John's right.<eos> I think you're struggling with doing nothing;<eos> with Roy, with Ray, but right now, you need people to help you.<eos> You need to let them.<eos> Maybe...there is something more going on with you than just what's happening with Roy and this meta-human.<eos> You have sacrificed everything to be the Arrow.<eos> Even you and me.
Which is why I no longer need to be one.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Ra's took the Arrow identity from me.<eos> I couldn't be that person even if I wanted to be.<eos> And I don't want to be.<eos> I told you that... I couldn't be the Arrow and be with you.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> You told me that I have become someone else, and I would like to... maybe discover a little more about that person.<eos> If you'll come with me.<eos> With you where?
Be safe out there, ok?<eos> As safe as anybody with a mask on can be.<eos> But, actually, I was thinking, um, maybe I'll call myself the Red Arrow?<eos> I think I already told everyone to call you Speedy.<eos> As we agreed.<eos> We've come a long way, you and I.<eos> I've always looked at you as a son, Oliver.<eos> And I'm glad we got to work together to trust as we did.<eos> I will never forgive you for what you did to Sara.<eos> And my sister.
I've got it.<eos> So did you hire a florist?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Didn't that cost a fortune?<eos> At my wedding, I'll have the bridesmaids make the flower arrangements and I'll spend the extra money on the dress.<eos> Anything?<eos> No, clear.<eos> You seeing anybody, Cutter?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> The Arrow.
Digital images can be fabricated, and I can't go to a judge with any of that.<eos> What about my statement?<eos> You mean your uncorroborated testimony?<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Because you and Oliver are old friends.<eos> You, uh, hurt yourself signing depositions?<eos> At the gym, actually.<eos> Right, you were training with that, um,<eos> Wildcat Grant, right?
- He's German?<eos> - Beats me.<eos> I traced him as far back as med school. Dead-ends there.<eos> - What about Miranda's family?<eos> - Father is deceased.<eos> Tracked down the mother in Provo, Utah.<eos> Hadn't spoken to her daughter in 10 years.<eos> Contacted every morgue and hospital up and down the east coast.<eos> No Jane Does matching the description.<eos> Same with the baby.
I have a cold<eos> I just wanted to give you one perfect birthday, but I ruined it.<eos> Again.<eos> You didn't ruin anything.<eos> Let's just get you to bed.<eos> Surprise!<eos> We're making today a perfect day for you<eos> We're making today a smiley face all shiny and new<eos> - There's a fine line between chaos<eos> - And a hullabaloo
No, he was impersonating me.<eos> Dyson, it's Bo.<eos> We need to get Jack now.<eos> I'll fill you in on the way.<eos> That's why Aife thought we made a plan together.<eos> She's not crazy, she was tricked.<eos> We need to get him.<eos> Yeah. Before he does this to somebody else.<eos> Tamsin, let's go.<eos> The other night.
Henry?<eos> Henry? !<eos> Daddy!<eos> Can someone tell me what the hell I just saw?<eos> Three people just walked out of that facility.<eos> They're clean.<eos> Whole area is.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> It was supposed to be a secret between me and...<eos> Drill.
Cereal and, uh, fruit?<eos> Lavon always makes the strawberries into a smiley face.<eos> Cereal and fruit is fine.<eos> So, I, uh... stopped by Earl's yesterday.<eos> - Yeah? - The only heirlooms he's got are a neon beer sign that he set up as the nightlight over my crib and a blanket I didn't recognize that smelled vaguely like armadillo.<eos> - Oh. - But don't worry, all right?<eos> I got this covered, Doc.<eos> Operation heirloom will not be met with failure, all right?<eos> Hmm? There you are!<eos> And with the pastries.
Why, thank you Wade.<eos> You know, I-I... I do pride myself on being a decent person.<eos> And... and one who doesn't enter into things lightly.<eos> What in heaven's name is going on here?<eos> Okay, look, uh...<eos> I want you to hear it from me.<eos> I have started dating your daughter.<eos> And I-I love her, sir.<eos> Which daughter?<eos> ! Wh... Uh, Lemon.

Wh... Uh, Lemon.<eos> Of course, Lemon.
- May I speak with you, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, guys, this is Grace.<eos> Her husband is my husband's lover.<eos> For crying out loud...<eos> I'll tell you that love is cruel but it teaches us who we are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why are you still here with your convicts?<eos> - We have to leave in ten minutes.<eos> - Ex-convicts.
- You said to be myself.<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> - You said to be myself!<eos> Okay. But less of yourself because it's too much.<eos> You're too much.<eos> Too much talking, and over-sharing, and hugging.<eos> And I'm sorry, but I told you those shoes are inappropriate.<eos> Do you see anyone in this room with shoes like that?<eos> - I've worn them a million times.<eos> - But not with me.

Yeah, okay.<eos> - Come on in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Your friend from college?<eos> Is... Larissa all right?<eos> What's your relationship?<eos> We understand Ms. Moscovitz works as a life coach.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. In... in a way.
I met one on an adventure cruise to the Galapagos.<eos> Fascinating woman.<eos> Well, "princess" Dmitri Green told us that he was referred to Larissa by Dr. Morton Fleck in East Portland.<eos> Dr. Fleck is not gonna tell us anything.<eos> Doctor privilege?<eos> He might speak to a prospective client.<eos> Yeah, but where will we find someone who seems maladjusted to women, unable to commit to an intimate and loving relationship, and uncomfortable with sex outside the type that requires financial remuneration?<eos> Dr. Fleck, I have a problem.<eos> I'm afraid to get undressed.<eos> Before sex?
I told you, the kid liked me.<eos> Ran errands for me.<eos> You know, kind gestures from friendly merchants.<eos> Brown paper bags full of cash.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'm gonna let Sambo collect my take.<eos> So you're telling me that this kid was your buddy on the beat and you don't know who's investigating his murder?<eos> Detective, I'm not a detective.<eos> Who you been talking to?<eos> The Black Pimps?
Well, here's the good news.<eos> If you choose to stay, it'll be rent free.<eos> Will he agree to that?<eos> He will.<eos> You can't argue with free rent.<eos> We'll make this okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Sam, kick this racist out.<eos> My pleasure.
He wants to go to the newspapers.<eos> He's gonna be okay.<eos> They won't stop looking for him.<eos> He needs to be okay.<eos> I'm scared, Charlie.<eos> Nobody's gonna hurt you.<eos> I'm scared for you.<eos> Uh... me...<eos> Most scared I ever was, I was little.<eos> Real tiny.
How are you?<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Heard cutler dropped the hammer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I wouldn't cut that hair just yet.<eos> Maybe... maybe a trim, maybe shape it a little.<eos> Wanna tell me what you're talking about?<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Undercover.
You texted your apology.<eos> It seems to beg for a face-to-face conversation, don't you think?<eos> Uh, I am too hungry right now to work out if you're joking or not.<eos> Your skull just turned into a giant animated ham.<eos> All righty, then.<eos> Marvin Webster here, family man, two kids, suburbs, owner operator of Sea-Tac Bug Whack until someone ran him over in the Whole Lotta Lotta car park.<eos> Should be a pretty safe brain to eat.<eos> Said nobody.<eos> In my old life, I was a lot of things.<eos> A doctor, a fiancé, a fan of Pilates.
Angel, I got your back.<eos> Thank you, baby.<eos> Hey, great to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> Have a good day now.<eos> (whistling) Seriously?<eos> What?<eos> You're really gonna ask me, "What"?<eos> You were totally just flirting with her.<eos> With Bethany?
Well, we could draw you some charts.<eos> Diagrams, footnotes.<eos> But it wouldn't be any less complicated.<eos> Small town life.<eos> In Magnolia Springs, I can hardly go a day without running into somebody I dated.<eos> Right?<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> How many people have you dated?<eos> Oh, plenty.
It just goes so great with mine!<eos> I was thinking maybe we could sing a little song for everybody later.<eos> (laughs) Sometimes you're just so hilarious, Shelby.<eos> Hey. Great job, Meatball.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's about the tragic breakup at the altar between me and a certain singer whose initials are L-AL.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Well, op with that tomorrow.<eos> Really?<eos> Not something peppier?
Really?<eos> Not something peppier?<eos> No!<eos> No, you got to draw them in with that voice.<eos> Make the women fall in love with you and then hit them with a bolt of energy, you know?<eos> And then you close with that rockabilly tune that you got.<eos> You leave them wanting more.<eos> And in between the songs, I can walk out amongst the crowd.<eos> Work them with my charm.<eos> And my jokes!
So she knew about the affair before we did.<eos> Yeah, which gives her plenty of motive,<eos> Gives her lots of time to plan this murder.<eos> It's a great theory, Except carol was home the night of the murder.<eos> Yeah, there's that.<eos> [ elevator bell dings ]<eos> Paul's wife, carol, is our prime suspect.<eos> Well, that explains the barbecue sauce.<eos> We think she found out paul was having an affair And set out to destroy him with his biggest courtroom success.<eos> The cork murder.
That's why I was in his office.<eos> I was having no luck trailing him.<eos> I mean, he eats at the same vegan restaurant for lunch, and he goes to the same yoga place every afternoon.<eos> And I had to find something.<eos> You know, e-mail, a love letter.<eos> Which is why I visited his office.<eos> Which is why you broke into his office.<eos> Well, the client gave me the key, so... technically, it's a gray area.<eos> When's the last time you spoke to Zoe?<eos> Last night.
I was just confused.<eos> He always talked to me about everything.<eos> Then one day, he started shutting me out.<eos> When was the last time you spoke with him?<eos> The day he died.<eos> He told me he was out of town on business.<eos> The investigator e-mailed me pictures of him at some cheap motel here in Boston.<eos> I called him and I accused him of horrible things.<eos> Who did you think he was having an affair with?<eos> Our account Renee.
! No!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Fine.<eos> This is what you get for thinking with your... gun.<eos> I understand you were the only account for Mamaki since it started?<eos> That's right.<eos> I handle most of their financial affairs.<eos> Dylan and Zoe are more visionaries than business people.<eos> Were there any issues?<eos> Cash flow problems?
Not long ago, a medical degree wasn't even required<eos> - to be certified, so...<eos> - This is a really big deal.<eos> And N.E.M.O. is very lucky to have you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Nemo?<eos> Oh, no relation to the vengeful submarine captain with a bitter hatred for British imperialism.<eos> Why is everyone looking at me like that?<eos> Oh, Nemo's the little striped clown fish.<eos> With the tiny, tiny fin.
Oh. Um... it's delicious.<eos> Oh, we need a cake knife.<eos> - Scalpels are clean. - Oh.<eos> Oh, wait. Whoa. Whoa.<eos> I am all up for dead people getting props, but I draw the line at autopsy tools.<eos> Ma, back me up on this!<eos> Whoa! What I could do to a pork chop with these things.<eos> Rizzoli.<eos> Okay, I'll just, uh, take this to the fridge.<eos> Not the morgue fridge.
Why did he target Jeremy Fritz?<eos> Uh, daddy's latest move was to get Westley Jr. a job at Fritz's investment firm.<eos> Piedmont worked for Fritz?<eos> For about five minutes. Fritz fired him a month ago.<eos> He didn't think he should mention a disgruntled ex-employee?<eos> Maybe Fritz didn't realize he was disgruntled.<eos> He also didn't know that this job was Westley's last chance.<eos> Or what? Daddy takes his allowance away?<eos> This guy never worked for anything his whole life...<eos> Except for one notable skill.

That's the hill, Jammer.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're almost home.<eos> That's okay.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Just hang in there, pal.<eos> Just hang in there.<eos> Sir, can I help you?<eos> -Shalom.

Your Congress won't do anything that would hurt us.<eos> Trust me, arms can be twisted.<eos> Plus, I'm mishpocha with every Jewish senator--<eos> Boxer, Schumer, Feinstein.<eos> It's not the Jews who protect us.<eos> It's Texas, South Carolina, Mississippi. It's your right wing, neocon super-Christians, and they don't even like Jews.<eos> They just need us here to keep the lights on for their fucking messiah.<eos> Please, neocons are easy.<eos> You can buy off a neocon with a handjob from a ladyboy.<eos> ...with Prime Minister.
You're a clever girl, Joanne.<eos> I'm sure you could figure something out.<eos> You know I hate it when you throw my words back at me.<eos> No, no, baby, baby, please!<eos> It's 15 seconds to midnight - and Pierce is the Apocalypse.<eos> - You let go of my feet<eos> - and you stand up. - Please, please, Joanne!<eos> Okay, all right, listen. If you help me save the world, from now on, I swear I will be nicer to your sister.<eos> How much nicer?<eos> A lot nicer.
I'll resist appropriately, yeah?<eos> I presume that answers your question.<eos> - Now go.<eos> - Time out.<eos> I'm not sure I should just whip it out right here.<eos> Come on, boys, get on with it.<eos> - Man, this is fuckin' crazy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, what did you think we did around here for kicks?<eos> Charades?
Don't worry about it.<eos> Just some casual discourse.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - They were doing it.<eos> - That's a fuckin' lie.<eos> - Alex! - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> - Whoa! You two were alone together? - Yeah.<eos> So what?<eos> I can be alone with whoever I want.<eos> - Not with him.
Well, it's a big house.<eos> No-one's tried to catalogue it since great Uncle Basil.<eos> What a fruitbat he was.<eos> He organised the heirlooms in colour order, according to their aura.<eos> So you don't go over to the part of the house where they work?<eos> They use dangerous chemicals!<eos> No, they said it was safest for me to stay clear.<eos> Not that I mind, of course.<eos> No, I'm quite happy here with Terrance.<eos> Terrance?
~ It was just a thought.<eos> ~ Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I should be stronger than this.<eos> Father Brown.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> ~ Hello. ~ What can we do for you?<eos> Perhaps I should start by saying that I know what you do.<eos> Not exactly, but I know that you're more than historians.<eos> And I've had a thought... and I wondered if you could help me?<eos> What with?
~ Why?<eos> ~ We have our man.<eos> The ticket clerk saw a man fitting his description.<eos> He bought a ticket to London.<eos> Sir?<eos> Father Brown.<eos> That'll keep him out of our way.<eos> That's the train for Birmingham.<eos> Ah. The thing about my job is you do drink an awful lot of tea and I do like my sugar.<eos> And the inevitable biscuit.
Which is why I can't accept this.<eos> - Where'd you get all that loot, anyway?<eos> - Just working at the inn.<eos> No way.<eos> Well, my dad left me some money.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't go down that road again.<eos> What road?<eos> The one I went down with my brother.<eos> With my ex-husband.
Hear ye!<eos> Hear ye!<eos> Cereal is what put Battle Creek on the map.<eos> And kept it on the map.<eos> And that is why I am damn proud to be pouring the opening bowl at our 31st Annual Breakfast Day!<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> You ready, TomCat?<eos> Here we go!<eos> Good morning!
- Who's shooting at me?<eos> - Uh... we were kind of hoping you could help us figure that one out.<eos> Well, I got 85% in the last election.<eos> It was a very low turnout.<eos> Well, I assume someone who's not gonna bother to vote for me is not gonna bother trying to shoot me.<eos> Like, it's local politics!<eos> It's potholes, dead animals and snow removal.<eos> And it matters. People care about that stuff because it's their home, it's their community, which is everything.<eos> Okay, well, give them the crackpot file.<eos> Crackpots?
No.<eos> But I'm asking you for a favor as a friend.<eos> Hmm, I enjoy purchasing marijuana from you.<eos> I am sorry I have misled you into thinking and believing that we have friendship.<eos> - Good-bye<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Zhao.<eos> I'm not asking you to adopt them, just, you know, leave the door open and let them cross back over into Pakistan.<eos> Hmm, I get caught, I making iPads in Shenzhen factory.<eos> - Kill myself.<eos> - Okay, whoa, whoa.
This is Lieutenant Gail Sweet with US Navy public affairs.<eos> It is my pleasure to inform you that your ex-husband and father to your children, Commander Zeke Tilson, has been found alive and well.<eos> He's being evac'd back to his ship as we speak.<eos> So he's okay?<eos> He's fine.<eos> And on a personal note, I want you to know, this whole experience has made me feel weirdly closer to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> I mean, with everything that's going on with the baby... you're sort of family now.<eos> What baby?

HILDY: 5-Henry-10.<eos> We have confirmation... there are only two shooters.<eos> - [screaming] - Repeat... only two shooters.<eos> KOTO: 5-Henry-200.<eos> Terry, you got a green light. Take a shot if you have it.<eos> Check your ear.<eos> Terry, are you okay?<eos> - I lost you. - [breathing heavily]<eos> - Front of the bus.<eos> Engine block. - [gunfire]
Copy that.<eos> Okay, nobody's home... neither kid.<eos> All right.<eos> CSI?<eos> Couple computers, some video-game consoles... stuff Keefer can dig into later, but...<eos> Right, but that's gonna take time.<eos> Well, Rentman caught a graze to the ear.<eos> Checked every hospital, drugstore, and pharmacy in an eight-by-eight.<eos> - Don't you report to somebody?<eos> - Not you.
Alfie.<eos> SoMa.<eos> Down by the warehouses.<eos> Idiot.<eos> I told him hitting that concert was a stupid idea.<eos> What concert?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> He's dead... right?<eos> Concert...<eos> warehouse district.
Okay, I don't give a shit about diversion, all right?<eos> And I don't think this lady does either.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm just gonna say it. That was really fun.<eos> I know, it was a one-time thing.<eos> Are you going to your diversion peer group?<eos> Uh, yes, I'm on my way.<eos> Jackie.<eos> - What is that smell?<eos> - Banana.
But hear this-- you must be very clear about people's roles at this hospital.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Let's you and I sit down and go over all the ins and outs to ensure something like this doesn't happen again.<eos> Say, lunch next week?<eos> Did my disciplining you just turn into lunch?<eos> You okay?<eos> Are you?<eos> Next time you guys see me, I might be hanging with Matt and Ben.<eos> Or the Yaz.
Very rustic.<eos> It's dragging on a bit, but great.<eos> Monsieur Lucien is having a hard time.<eos> Miss Lena dreamed of acting, but now she teaches.<eos> They make a sweet couple, eh?<eos> Married for two months and still...<eos> In love...<eos> They stayed in their room all day.<eos> It was like their...<eos> Nuptial suite.

But then one day, unannounced the big boss-um of the boss-ums, the one of all the outlets and me already being the under boss-um of our outlet.<eos> So, I received him, I made a big splash with an elegant lunch, best restaurant-um.<eos> And then when I was to serve him the vin-um I flung half a bottle on his shirt.<eos> Tie, vest-um, whatever.<eos> Know what he said?<eos> The boss-um of the boss-ums drenched in C? tes du Rh? ne.<eos> He said:<eos> "Leon, I see that you have been to the right schools."<eos> Sorrel soup!<eos> With dill.
The one with tuberculosis, I had to serve cream all day.<eos> It's colder than yesterday.<eos> It'll be better after the rain.<eos> This after that and not the other way around.<eos> Ti-ri-ri!<eos> When an icycle mounts a bicycle it makes a tricycle.<eos> A sheet for this one, an enema for that one...<eos> I've seen it all.<eos> Won't you help Catherette with the peas?<eos> And the sauce?
She was naked before him.<eos> I'll never know anything about her.<eos> I'll ask the husband if his rooster was nude too.<eos> Sir!<eos> A terrible thing, sir!<eos> Somebody killed Lena's cat!<eos> - Charlie?<eos> - Yes, Charlie...<eos> He usually slept with me but that night, I got home after "Star Wars".<eos> Only this morning...
Something that disquiets him.<eos> - What, do you think?<eos> - Some sin?<eos> This priest, a colleague, sin, conscience, crime, remorse surfaces...<eos> He bothers, he's too much...<eos> Almost like the teapot.<eos> All these things which stay behind, are becoming more and more present...<eos> Everything is hybrid, as Leon says.<eos> - What would you do to her?<eos> - To whom?

It's like at a station, waiting for a train to depart...<eos> - Would you like some wine?<eos> - A drop.<eos> Blood down the drain!<eos> Would you believe that seventeen years ago, my Leon was quite fit?<eos> Dodging and contrast.<eos> - Care for anything else, Father?<eos> - Camembert.<eos> Oh, Camembert, here it is!<eos> With salad.
Is it still the cat?<eos> The cat-um is but a detail...<eos> On the other hand, you my old boozing partner.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Bring your nose-um closer!<eos> To sniff you?<eos> I've put on some cologne!<eos> Tiriri!<eos> - You coming with me?<eos> - The other way.
Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Did you see him, Mr. Witol?<eos> Yes, in the forest.<eos> - And?<eos> - He wants us to join him.<eos> - What for?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Admire his landscape?<eos> At night?
Carpe diem!<eos> The weight of the here and now has become like the bleurgh, decisive.<eos> Aren't you over doing it, a bit?<eos> There will be a full moon, it can be romantic.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Leon, the arrows, the piece of wood, the axe, everything.<eos> But what is curious, very curious, is that it changes nothing.<eos> I'm drowning with Lena.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> With your shitty-tum thriller.
He to himself for his own.<eos> Yes, we kept an eye on each other.<eos> But Catherette could have come and lurked in the shadows.<eos> And that could have been the murder.<eos> Ralph and Lang, of course...<eos> It's here.<eos> Lena!<eos> You will become a great writer.<eos> Will you help me to become a real actress?<eos> A real actress?
Not used to hearing voices outside my head.<eos> I hear voices from all directions.<eos> In the gnawing sameness of your days did you look at the shape of things?<eos> At... what you were becoming?<eos> I wasn't becoming anything.<eos> I was... standing still.<eos> Exactly where he left me standing.<eos> Like taxidermy.<eos> Hollowed out and filled with something else.<eos> Not something else.
I am Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi from the Questura di Firenze.<eos> I was wondering if you ever met your predecessor?<eos> Never met him.<eos> Read several of his monographs.<eos> The officers who first investigated checked the Palazzo for any sort of note.<eos> Farewell note, suicide note...<eos> Found nothing.<eos> The going assumption is, he eloped with a woman. And her money.<eos> What is the going assumption regarding Professor Sogliato?<eos> Still no word?
I think his wife?<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I-I wanted to hurt you For threatening to go back to your wife, Not ruin you.<eos> I hate myself for leaking that video.<eos> I swear.<eos> You are the most expensive fling I have ever had.<eos> Well, I judged him too harshly.<eos> He's certainly not sleeping with his wife.<eos> Or the murder victim.
Cade thought that they did, but he was just being...<eos> Paranoid.<eos> That's how I'd describe him.<eos> He said that he didn't like having the information that he did, and that rival companies could possibly be coming after him for it.<eos> Did he tell you what kind of information he was talking about?<eos> Cade was consulting on 15 classified projects for the military and NASA.<eos> I didn't even know all the details.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> A week ago.<eos> Last night.
No.<eos> I loved him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Coroner confirmed C.O.D.-- asphyxiation.<eos> He was strangled.<eos> There were signs of a struggle, some odd skin abrasions they think were due to a stun gun.<eos> They also recovered a small children's toy block that was in his mouth.<eos> A message from the killer.<eos> What was the letter?<eos> A number.
Zee: What are you doing here Jack?<eos> Jack: You leave my daughter alone.<eos> Mine turned on me, so what makes you think Bo won't do the same to you?<eos> Jack: Father knows best.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay, I'm just still getting used to that.<eos> Look, can we talk about...<eos> How things are going with your Dad?<eos> You mean, Jack?<eos> Right, him, too.
♪<eos> Dead?<eos> Freyja is Dead?<eos> Did she bleed out?<eos> Choke on a meatball?<eos> I really don't know what happened.<eos> The point is, you're gonna need another way to lure Hades back to Tartarus.<eos> So you're in?<eos> If we decide to pursue this, it has to stay on the down-low.<eos> Just between us.
You release a flock of ravens.<eos> It's called a Black Cloud.<eos> Where do I get these ravens?<eos> I only want you to summon the Light Fae.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, power in numbers, right?<eos> We're gonna need all the help we can get.<eos> The Dark have no place at our Councils.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Between the Light and Dark?
It's every morning.<eos> Sounds like you could use a boost.<eos> I feel very hydrated.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Best cure for a hangover, besides greasy diner food, you know?<eos> You are a man of many vices.<eos> Says the jailbird nurse.<eos> I was there for two days, and I don't even remember them.<eos> Ah, what was your poison again?<eos> - Pills?
Thanks for letting me stay here, guys.<eos> It's nice to feel welcome somewhere.<eos> And don't worry, I won't be here long.<eos> This is temporary.<eos> They're gonna come looking for me.<eos> You know, this'll be good.<eos> You know, this is a nice change of pace.<eos> I could use a break from people. Yeah, with all their, "Oh, Phil, do this, do that, you're a jerk...."<eos> Oh, no, this is good, this is nice.<eos> Solitude, loneliness, friends.
Uh-huh. And... ooh, Social Security, right there.<eos> This is fun to notarize again.<eos> Oh, man, once you break the seal...<eos> It's a notary joke.<eos> I wish Glen were here.<eos> He would've gotten a kick out of that one.<eos> It's official.<eos> It's official.<eos> Friends?<eos> Friends.
- Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do... right there.<eos> That's just a bruise, sweetie...<eos> I bumped into something.<eos> Come on, go brush your teeth.<eos> - Do I have to?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What are you guys up to?<eos> Um... n-not much.
Well, I hope it's worth the trip.<eos> The system is no longer working.<eos> The system is sick.<eos> Infected, polluted, and corrupt.<eos> In a way that can no longer be healed.<eos> The system has been brought to its knees.<eos> The infection is spreading.<eos> There is only one course of treatment.<eos> And the illness must be eradicated by any means necessary.<eos> No matter what the cost.
Thank you for this.<eos> I shall endeavour to be there.<eos> I look forward to it.<eos> Right.<eos> Au revoir... Inspector.<eos> And now, yesterday's results from Thirsk.<eos> 2.50, The Archibald House Novices Hurdle.<eos> First, Mr. Neil...<eos> Dr. Fairfax has had a cancellation...<eos> - Second, Half A Policeman...
That's very impressive, but unfortunately it can't go into her file because under diversion she's not allowed to touch patients.<eos> It didn't happen.<eos> Mrs. Akalitus, a word?<eos> And you come, too, Jackie.<eos> We are going to do some couples counseling.<eos> Doctor, I didn't know you were also certified in couples counseling.<eos> Oh, I'm not, but I've had years of experience.<eos> Granted, I was the one being counseled, but still.<eos> I have terrific relationships with all my ex-wives.<eos> - Or nearly all.
While you were off playing "Iron Chef," I called us both in off-duty.<eos> This is a first for me, Bernie.<eos> No, nothing wrong with a little fun, huh?<eos> - You know, lightening up.<eos> - Are we still on that?<eos> I just don't understand your cold war against Jackie.<eos> Help me.<eos> Let's just say I've been through this before.<eos> Been through as in drugs?<eos> And alcohol.
- What about us?<eos> Uh, when are you guys tying the knot?<eos> Yeah, you're starting a family.<eos> I'm sure the topic's come up.<eos> Well, it came up, and this one promptly fled the damn state.<eos> Zoom!<eos> Like the Road Runner.<eos> To be fair, my timing wasn't, uh, ideal.<eos> W-But you're planning to get married at some point, right?<eos> - Yeah, of course, eventually.
Hold the phone!<eos> You're saying the world's ending?<eos> !<eos> We had no idea that was happening!<eos> Oh, we got to get through that bucket list fast.<eos> After the doc heals up Chicken, we're gonna go confront that bear - that's been giving us dirty looks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I'm gonna learn how to read!<eos> A chicken will be sent to bed, a city street will run blood red.<eos> - Red? !
Could be a rapture.<eos> - It's the right thing to do.<eos> - Okay, well, you're going first, - in case she has a big dog or something. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Go.<eos> Hi, Marjorie.<eos> Us again.<eos> I know you didn't - remember us earlier...<eos> - Of course I remember you... how could I forget the way you evil queen bees treated me?<eos> Um, yes, I mean, once we were unkind...<eos> Cruel.
Because you're worried about me or because you want to see me dead?<eos> I was in jail yesterday.<eos> I'm supposed to be in jail today.<eos> You think he doesn't know that?<eos> You don't think he's maybe a wee bit suspicious?<eos> Possibly wants to pat me down?<eos> If she was gonna run, she would've run while we were waiting outside the change room.<eos> What are you...?<eos> What...?<eos> He hey, hey!
Lucy, check the O2 levels on my suit sensor.<eos> Oxygen optimal.<eos> No toxins detected.<eos> Let's get this party started, shall we?<eos> Time for some treasure hunting, boys.<eos> Lucy's plugged in.<eos> We'll be right over.<eos> Protocol says we clear the ship then detonate it, so mines?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Big ones.
No engines.<eos> No coms.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - How long ago was this?<eos> - Couple years maybe.<eos> More?<eos> - You lose track...<eos> - We would've been happy to get you out of here if your pal wasn't too busy trying to hijack my ship.<eos> Lady, you see what he did to my leg?<eos> His fingers?
In real life, they will be much bigger.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, I have decided three bathrooms, eh?<eos> So families will not have to fight over the morning washing.<eos> Any news on my nursing license?<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Yes, I haven't forgotten our arrangement, but we have to be patient, right?<eos> It's not like ordering a hamburger from a fast-food café.<eos> Uh, congratulations, by the way.<eos> - For what?
- ...diabetes... - Oh, my. - ...high cholesterol.<eos> - And...<eos> - Wait for it.<eos> - ...uncontrolled A-fib.<eos> - Nicely done.<eos> I take it you two know each other.<eos> Lydia knows everybody.<eos> She should run for mayor.<eos> And what medications are you on, Lydia?<eos> None right now.
Mmm. Delicious.<eos> Thank you, shauna.<eos> See you soon.<eos> May I help you? Yes.<eos> These shoes seem to have been sent to me by accident.<eos> Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry.<eos> These were for dr. Isles.<eos> I understand, expect I -- I don't understand why these went out.<eos> They were supposed to be held here With all her other selections.<eos> All of her other selections?
Beety dickson said he saw that thing a-flapping the other day.<eos> Said it reminded him to get some new tires for his wife.<eos> That's great, dad.<eos> Somebody return those rims outside?<eos> A guy got behind on his payments.<eos> That's the first one, isn't it?<eos> So far.<eos> Not bad when you think about it.<eos> When's the last time you talked to mama?<eos> Margaret?
Money's becoming more and more virtual.<eos> Illuminating.<eos> I have a ten.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Well, he just wanted a change, I guess.<eos> Did he discuss it with you?<eos> Not in detail, no.<eos> Well, that's one of the things I want to speak with him about.<eos> Daniel is gonna have to be more accountable to others of his whereabouts.<eos> As in officially.
Marcus doesn't live here anymore.<eos> Do you know where we can find him?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> He's over in Zone B.<eos> Okay. What's Zone B?<eos> It's where they burn the bodies.<eos> Okay, look, has anyone else been by here... looking for him?<eos> Group of kids around our age?<eos> They had a girl with them.<eos> Dark hair.
There's a lot of people out there in the city that need protecting.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need you.<eos> We all need you.<eos> Okay, you will need to rest because you can't help anybody if you can't walk.<eos> If I need to jump out of a speeding car to help somebody, I will.<eos> I got a bunch of samosas and a guy who speaks three different Hindi dialects.<eos> Great, hi.<eos> Can you take over here?<eos> With pleasure.
I don't think I'm pretty.<eos> But I got a nice ass.<eos> Hottest ass in this school.<eos> First you look at a girl's ass, the face afterwards.<eos> I take in your ass and eyes together.<eos> Your breasts too.<eos> I hear you're not too free. - Three hubbies.<eos> - I'm not married.<eos> You're seeing three guys.<eos> - Who?
Why do you still seem sad?<eos> I am sad.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's joyful.<eos> I see my childhood ending.<eos> His trip to Russia.<eos> He went to Minsk with his friend...<eos> Zylberberg.<eos> They came back two days late. Paul had a black eye.<eos> A black eye!
He was a great scientist.<eos> He had an incredible mind.<eos> But his research...<eos> He... went to far.<eos> And when the others discovered what he had done, he was banished to the Void forever.<eos> He died there.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> But why... why did they banish him?<eos> He became obsessed with his research... began experimenting with forces beyond his control.<eos> The Aether?
Yours isn't.<eos> But you know about curses and Troubles...<eos> How?<eos> I got the story from some nut job.<eos> He said a demon couple came here 500 years ago, cursed people with some black stuff.<eos> Spooky wise man story...<eos> It just seemed like easy money.<eos> Two demons from 500 years ago, you couldn't have made that up.<eos> I want to talk to this wise man who told you that story.<eos> Walter?
- There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> You are who you were always meant to be.<eos> (scoffing): Oh, well...<eos> Thanks, Deepak, but what exactly is that?<eos> - Crockers are Trouble collectors.<eos> It's been that way for hundreds of years.<eos> Do you know the story of Roanoke Island?<eos> - Yeah, it was a European settlement where everyone disappeared.<eos> - The colonists were cursed.<eos> Troubled.
Do you guys think this is where Holbrook is hiding?<eos> Well, Aria's gonna text us when she's at the Grill.<eos> If Holbrook's with her, then that gives us time to go and look around.<eos> ( cell phone ringing ) That was fast.<eos> Who's driving?<eos> Hold your horses, it's for me.<eos> Hey, Ted.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll meet you there.<eos> Pastor back?<eos> Yeah, this morning.
He'll do the same thing on the witness stand, even if he knows what she's capable of.<eos> What do you think she's capable of?<eos> A lot.<eos> I've seen her do things.<eos> I've seen her talk people into things.<eos> I mean, the way you girls used to follow her around--<eos> Used to.<eos> I know you're not on the best of terms, but the police have a theory.<eos> They think she had help.<eos> With Mona?
I drove by the house one night to check on the children, hoping to get a glimpse of them, make sure they were okay.<eos> But the drapes were drawn and... I didn't stop.<eos> Well, why not?<eos> I was afraid of what my ex-husband would do if he saw me.<eos> When you filed for divorce, you cited physical abuse.<eos> Sam beat me.<eos> I ran away.<eos> I thought that the children would be better off without me.<eos> Better off?<eos> With an abusive alcoholic?
Hold on.<eos> Maddie, your dad's on the phone!<eos> You just caught us.<eos> We're on our way out to soccer practice.<eos> Here she is.<eos> Hey, Maddie.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> Soccer practice at night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Too hot during the day.
Rolled down the window.<eos> Said, "hi." "Want to go to the movies?"<eos> He wanted to.<eos> Ahead, you see the bridge.<eos> Under the bridge, that's where he died.<eos> We're going off-road here.<eos> Left under the bridge.<eos> Our first location is ahead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Under the bridge.
All right. We're all aware of the security risk here.<eos> Mr. Waits is gonna direct us to the crime scenes, and we will be on top of his every move.<eos> If and when we find crime scenes, we pull Waits out and call in the coroner.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Okay. Let's bring him out.<eos> Emergency power, back there on the wall.<eos> Crate, check it.<eos> Got it.<eos> Where to?<eos> That way, through there.
Mary is a bastard.<eos> Waste can be saved and the proper order of things asserted.<eos> Meanwhile, I want you to go to France.<eos> I want a marriage contract for my daughter. A French prince.<eos> - Stephen Gardiner is...<eos> - You're very unwilling today.<eos> You don't like the French?<eos> Perhaps you would prefer an alliance with the Emperor?<eos> You're very friendly with his man, aren't you?<eos> Chapuys?
I'm sorry."<eos> And that's precisely what we're trying to avoid with Janet.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not good with fancy words.<eos> Janet's the clever one.<eos> She'd know what to say.<eos> Um... when... when their dad left,<eos> I was worried that I wouldn't be able to cope.<eos> Not with the others so much.
What about your job?<eos> You still put in for a transfer down here, work different cases maybe?<eos> I don't know how it all works, you know.<eos> There was an opening before.<eos> If they haven't filled it yet, maybe.<eos> Would you bring the kids down here for summers?<eos> Yeah, there's a school down here, the Gulliver School. Supposed to be the best in Miami.<eos> I'd get them in there.<eos> You already looked it up?<eos> What about Tasha?
Er... my name is Jonathan Strange.<eos> What is it that brings you to Venice, Mr Strange?<eos> Army business?<eos> My wife died.<eos> Venice was always a city she particularly longed to visit.<eos> ~ Oh, Mr Strange.<eos> ~ And I am studying.<eos> Experimenting.<eos> New magic.<eos> With what object?
- Oh.<eos> We're checking because Mr. Caspere kept an apartment in the city. Mmm. And his phone records show a lot of phone calls coming to this house.<eos> 1:00, 2:00 a.m.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't pay attention.<eos> Is upstairs line.<eos> Business.<eos> So, how long have you been married to Mr. Chessani?<eos> Mayor Chessani.
No!<eos> No! Who left door open?<eos> Where'd you, uh, pick up that accent?<eos> Accent?<eos> You racist woman. Mmm-mmm.<eos> I admit, it's a total put-on.<eos> Different roles for different jobs.<eos> I have a lot of friends.<eos> And what is it you do?<eos> Specialty events.

Threw him a co-producer credit.<eos> Real sorry to hear what happened.<eos> Cut.<eos> Was he around here much? Nah.<eos> I mean, he came by.<eos> We were in prep. Helped out with PD, zoning.<eos> That producer credit come with a paycheck?<eos> Back end, yeah.<eos> What about that car?<eos> The Caddy?
Yeah, he liked it here.<eos> One of them older guys, never left the bar, just wait for the girl to walk up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know anyone he ever left with?<eos> Uh, a few of the girls here for sure, but I wouldn't try talking to them.<eos> You'd just get them into trouble.<eos> He like boys?<eos> More like he likes to watch. Had me and this girl go at it while he sat in the corner.<eos> You do girls?<eos> In a pinch. With the right medication.
How'd a water stain get there?<eos> It rained maybe twice this last year.<eos> It's like everything's papier mache.<eos> Stop thinking.<eos> I don't like being on a ledge.<eos> Nobody gets rich on their own money.<eos> I never really knew what to do with it.<eos> Money.
Dixon is secondary to you, staging out of Vinci.<eos> You'll be working under a Ventura detective commanding the task force.<eos> That clear to you, Detective?<eos> 10-4, Lieutenant.<eos> Just one question. Am I supposed to solve this or not?<eos> Just no surprises, Detective Velcoro.<eos> Ray accepts dualities must be effected to, uh, serve public interests.<eos> I really do.<eos> Bound?<eos> Vinyl fabric.
But he didn't.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> We're not gangsters, Frank.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> Since Caspere's remaining interests have been voided,<eos> I can provide you the same parcel, same price.<eos> $7 million.<eos> The same?<eos> We were quoted 10.<eos> Not by me.
I need coke, crystal, and whatever the fuck they call MDMA now.<eos> We move it through the club, you get paid plus five.<eos> It's a risk, Frank.<eos> For me, not for you.<eos> Our men handle sales.<eos> No, I run the club.<eos> I control who moves what and when and they answer to me.<eos> Your only concern is your money.<eos> Santos had his own arrangement.<eos> Mexicans.
Oh, your marriage was busted years ago.<eos> Or you never would have been in that hotel.<eos> You didn't even give it a chance.<eos> There was no chance.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck this, partner.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Fuck off?<eos> I've been a friend to you.<eos> With friends like these...
Let's check them out.<eos> Hit up working girls for anything about Irina and Caspere.<eos> Dixon, follow up with canvass.<eos> Split those kas up with the other dicks.<eos> Woodrugh, work prosts looking for Irina.<eos> Anything come from hookerland?<eos> Tascha was a hooker.<eos> Hasn't been around.<eos> Rumors of elite parties Caspere might have attended.<eos> High-end girls.
I don't know.<eos> 'Cause he's a wet brain alky.<eos> I have this new program, see.<eos> Because my powers of influence are so meager in this sublunar world of ours, I try to limit the people I can disappoint.<eos> And I make sure to know the difference between my obligations and somebody else's.<eos> ♪ breaking up is harder ♪ ♪ than it seems... ♪<eos> Don't do that.<eos> It was-- it was-- it was good seeing you.<eos> I didn't realize you had been on my mind.<eos> ♪ pictures on the mantel ♪
Caspere concocted the idea of the parties with Tony Chessani.<eos> Tony's a pimp with political ambition.<eos> His father doesn't participate in the gatherings.<eos> Tony's service makes him friends with those men of affluence you mentioned.<eos> Lays the groundwork for deals that Caspere facilitated.<eos> What else?<eos> I th- - I think both men used the occasions to compile potential blackmail material on their guests.<eos> Rumored Ben had footage of various important people.<eos> McCandless.<eos> Who?
It meant something to me, what you said.<eos> I want to thank you for telling me that.<eos> We both could have used different parents.<eos> Don't worry about kids now.<eos> This is between you and me.<eos> Seems like nobody's been home.<eos> Want to call local?<eos> Get us in here?<eos> Now we're following birds.<eos> Carrion birds.
Took a couple kicks last night.<eos> Can you talk about it?<eos> There'll be some new people operating at the clubs for a while.<eos> Few days a week.<eos> What people?<eos> Mexicans.<eos> Something else to solve.<eos> In the midst of being gangbanged by forces unseen, I figure I'd drill a new orifice, go on and fuck myself for a change.<eos> Frank, what can you pull together?<eos> Liquid, right now?
I can get money back.<eos> I know where there's money.<eos> Osip and Catalast, there's a big cash exchange tomorrow night up in Ojai.<eos> McCandless' place.<eos> Crystal Ranch. Osip's turning over $12 million for Caspere's shares.<eos> $12 million, Frank.<eos> Who's gonna be there?<eos> I don't know for sure.<eos> It's a handoff.<eos> Security.
Can you just keep it shut for a few days?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, don't worry.<eos> We'll play nice.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Business is good.<eos> Profits are strong and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock on which this economy is built.<eos> And, yes, we had to take some losses in our subprime department last year, but those losses will be contained at only 5%.<eos> Now, in our residential sector...
This level of criminality is unprecedented, even on fucking Wall Street.<eos> Jamie...<eos> And this is me being honest here, okay?<eos> It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street.<eos> No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this just because it comes from two guys in a...<eos> Sorry, garage band hedge fund that thinks it's the apocalypse.<eos> Wow.<eos> I thought you were for real, Casey.<eos> You know, I'll have to say I really did.<eos> Really?
Morning, Mama.<eos> Jupiter.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Need help?<eos> - All done.<eos> English, please.<eos> Vladie.<eos> Look, Jupiter I know we don't always see eye to eye.<eos> But, um...<eos> - ...well...
Kaulder?<eos> As long as the Hexen heart beats, she's never truly dead.<eos> No, you can't!<eos> You'll die.<eos> I'm ready to face that reality.<eos> No!<eos> There must be another way.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> When I was pulled into the shadows, I saw that there were things much worse than her.<eos> In the darkness.
The world without you.<eos> We still need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> The Axe and Cross betrayed me.<eos> I can't trust anyone.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> 800 years I've been on this road.<eos> Always hunting.<eos> - Always. ..<eos> -Alone.
- I think we covered this.<eos> Yes, I'd like to hear it again.<eos> I had a drink with my neighbors.<eos> - I came home. - OK. He was drunk.<eos> Things escalated.<eos> He said he was just going out for a drive, and then, um...<eos> And then you showed up, in the morning.<eos> Were either of you having relations... with other people?<eos> No. I mean, issues... yes, but, um...<eos> nothing like that.
Good.<eos> So...<eos> One day at Fenway Park... Ted Williams...<eos> You know who he was?<eos> Oh, come on... The Thumper?<eos> Career batting average of 3.44, right?<eos> What!<eos> ?<eos> .. Yeah... that Ted Williams.<eos> Anyway, so...
Cheers.<eos> The great paradox of all this is that... The better our engines get the further we can see.<eos> But now I see the future.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> The event's line has not even reach us yet.<eos> I don't think I'll ever understand why so few people care about history.<eos> The future has its charms too.<eos> When can talk about ours.<eos> - Ellis...<eos> - Not the distant future...
- Specially this weekend.<eos> - Second choice?<eos> - Yes<eos> - Forty years, baby.<eos> Come on...<eos> Second choice?<eos> Honey, you're blowing this all out of proportion.<eos> Am I?<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> Yeah. As a matter of fact...
Women are pink.<eos> Women are pink?<eos> - Who's the first United States President to be born in a hospital?<eos> - Jimmy Carter<eos> Jimmy Carter<eos> - Beginner's luck<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Try again.<eos> At what event did the Hula-Hoop make its debut?<eos> In 1956... at the World's Fair in New York.
Hey, my boy said you could hook me up.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Come on, bro.<eos> I could use an ounce if you got it.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> - How about...
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!<eos> Until late one afternoon...<eos> Farmer John?<eos> Miss Ella.<eos> It's your father, miss.<eos> He took ill on the road.<eos> He's passed on, miss.<eos> He's gone.<eos> To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.<eos> And your mother.
You shouldn't be this deep in the forest alone.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> I'm with you, Mister...<eos> What do they call you?<eos> You don't know who I am?<eos> That is...<eos> They call me Kit.<eos> Well, my father does when he's in a good mood.<eos> And where do you live, Mr. Kit?<eos> At the palace.
Who are you looking for?<eos> No one.<eos> It's that girl in the forest, isn't it?<eos> That's why you were so generous with the invitations.<eos> Father, it was for the people.<eos> I know you love the people, Kit.<eos> But I also know that your head's been turned.<eos> But you've only met her once, in the forest.<eos> And you would have me marry someone I met once, tonight.<eos> A princess.
Ella couldn't wait to write down all that had happened, so that she might remember every single bit of it just as if she were telling her mother and father about the palace ball and her time with the prince.<eos> Above all, the prince.<eos> You've come.<eos> Good.<eos> Father.<eos> Don't go.<eos> I must.<eos> You needn't be alone.<eos> Take a bride.<eos> The Princess Chelina.
His agent at the time was none other than Hollywood powerhouse Ari gold, who has since moved on from the agency business, and is now the head of the studio that is producing "Hyde."<eos> You see it with pro athletes.<eos> You... you see it with movie stars.<eos> They want to share the ride with their friends.<eos> It makes it feel more real for them.<eos> And were you okay with this?<eos> No, I was not okay with it.<eos> I hated it.<eos> I mean, I found this kid off a mentos commercial.<eos> Really? Yeah.
You're gonna let everyone see the fuckin' movie but me.<eos> Ari, you are all that matters.<eos> I want it to be perfect when I show it to you.<eos> I can't just write you a check.<eos> I got to deal with these co-financiers in Texas.<eos> Do you know how hard I have worked to avoid going to Texas?<eos> Do you know what they do to Jews in Texas?<eos> Look, Ari, I didn't take an acting fee on this, which you know is more than the $10 million over budget we are.<eos> You're 15 over.<eos> Really?
You were invited?<eos> Drama wants me to see his scenes.<eos> You weren't?<eos> I'm in Texas.<eos> Smell the cow shit?<eos> Oh.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I actually wanted to see you face to face.<eos> We are face to face, yoko.<eos> In three dimensions.
We are face to face, yoko.<eos> In three dimensions.<eos> Why?<eos> Eh... no.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Could we have lunch this week?<eos> I don't typically have lunch with my ex-assistants, Lloyd.<eos> Not unless I need something from them, which I can't ever imagine being the case with you, so what's up?<eos> I'm getting married!<eos> Oh, God.
Take a piss test.<eos> Fine, but If I pass, you drink it.<eos> Guys, did you know Emily was seeing Armie Hammer?<eos> The lone ranger?<eos> I thought they broke up.<eos> I guess they still talk.<eos> I played softball with the guy.<eos> He's out of his mind.<eos> I'd leave it alone, bro.<eos> Really? Yeah.
Why does it look like there's enough food here for 300?<eos> I don't know, 'cause there's supposed to be enough for 500.<eos> 500? !<eos> Well, and ronda.<eos> Look, Vince, this was supposed to be an intimate thing so we could get some feedback.<eos> Relax.<eos> Turtle thought we'd do better with a big crowd.<eos> Don't worry, I got everyone walking' through that door signing an nda, so they can't talk about it.<eos> And where are you gonna sit 500 people?<eos> On the couch?
Have you seen anything I've done, or...?<eos> Uh, not in complete, but I've seen that trailer for that new one you got comin' out maybe 500 times.<eos> Maybe you want to finance something for me to star in.<eos> I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're an actor, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What've you been in?<eos> Everything.
Oh.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're an actor, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What've you been in?<eos> Everything.<eos> Have you seen him in anything?<eos> Um, I, uh...<eos> I've seen him in "viking quest."<eos> Really?
Oh, shit!<eos> Of all the guys I never thought I'd catch fuckin' in my room.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, don't be.<eos> I love it.<eos> I love it.<eos> Hi, ronda Rousey.<eos> I won 500 bucks on your last fight.<eos> Can't wait to watch.<eos> Really?
Go fuck yourself, Ari.<eos> Forgive and forget, buddy.<eos> No?<eos> Hey, schindler.<eos> Leave no Jew behind!<eos> Ari?<eos> !<eos> Listen, Lloyd, I love you, but I just... I can't commit.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, God.
You're gonna pay for this.<eos> I'm gonna hunt you down, and you're gonna fuckin' pay for this!<eos> Johnny, I'm so sorry.<eos> This wasn't... yo, Johnny, want to drop me at editing?<eos> Yeah, sure, bro.<eos> What the fuck are you doin'?<eos> You think I should start a vodka company?<eos> I think you would kill it.<eos> But I don't even drink.<eos> Really?
Yo, e!<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> Nobody walks in L.A., e. You look stupid.<eos> My life is over.<eos> Come on, Travis!<eos> Open the door!<eos> I'm dealing with Ari on this, Vince.<eos> On what?
I can't keep up with this guy anymore.<eos> I just wanted to say that that was really fast for me.<eos> I don't usually do that that fast.<eos> Oh, me either.<eos> It was something about you.<eos> Like, you... you just seemed so...<eos> Sweet and innocent.<eos> Is that an act?<eos> No.<eos> Really?
'Cause you haven't returned any of my fuckin' calls.<eos> Ari, I have people here.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Didn't realize you were in the middle of a work session.<eos> Maybe I should call security and have your ass dragged out of here.<eos> How'd you like that?<eos> Hey, I am sorry about that, but we do have what are known as protocols.<eos> Even in this lawless town.
I don't see how that fuckin' matters.<eos> No, this isn't the time or the place, but...<eos> Just know that I will enjoy sneaking up behind you and snatching' the fuckin' life out of you.<eos> You know what I'm talkin' about, right, drama?<eos> You guys enjoy your salads.<eos> Well, that was awkward.<eos> He's a lot bigger than I thought.<eos> Why didn't you just tell him it wasn't true?<eos> Because it is true.<eos> Really?
Wait outside.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yes, God damn it.<eos> Wait outside.<eos> I'm real sorry about that.<eos> Um, I have a copy of the movie.<eos> Vinnie chase's unfinished cut.<eos> I think If you take a look at it, you're gonna see that your money is in secure hands.<eos> I saw it last night, Larsen.<eos> Really?
I just don't like it.<eos> Well, maybe you just don't fuckin' get it, you bean-counting little suit.<eos> Ask Vince.<eos> See what he thinks.<eos> What's that?<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's about Vinnie.<eos> And the boys.
- Is it bad?<eos> - No.<eos> It's OK.<eos> She'll walk.<eos> Assuming I can keep it from getting infected.<eos> So, you're a doctor, now... huh?<eos> That's funny, I... always figured you'd leave this place.<eos> I am.<eos> In two weeks.<eos> Toronto.
Looks like your bear found Johnny.<eos> Good God almighty!<eos> Lord, have mercy!<eos> Chewed his leg, right off.<eos> It wasn't the bear that killed him, though.<eos> Lookee, there.<eos> He was shot.<eos> I had a bad feelin' when I saw him hangin' out with them guys.<eos> You have anything to do with this, Douglas?<eos> With this?
What the hell's happening?<eos> Don't know yet.<eos> Some kind of viral outbreak.<eos> CDC ordered a military containment perimeter.<eos> Is most of the town evacuated?<eos> As many as we could.<eos> This thing hit so hard and fast, we're still trying to contain it.<eos> What about everyone at the party?<eos> Were they evacuated?<eos> What party?
I wanted to tell you I saw your dad the other day at the hospital when I was makin' my rounds.<eos> Whywashe at thehospital?<eos> I don't know, but he was.<eos> My dad and hans are fuckin' delusional.<eos> "The best father i knew how to be"-- what the fuck, like it was all my fault?<eos> All this?<eos> What?<eos> Of the hans thing, of the trial, of all that was so that you could write about something different.<eos> So what?<eos> Back to me.
-Good night.<eos> You know, that song, it's beautiful.<eos> It's just a little short.<eos> But other than that, it's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you know, what we were talking about before, you shouldn't give up.<eos> -I agree.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Dinner tomorrow?<eos> Not that.
It's so cool!<eos> And I love everything in it!<eos> It looks like it could be a house.<eos> And maybe he lives in here!<eos> --And I'm sure he really does.<eos> But it's still cool, and I can't even stop talking!<eos> I wrote him, and then I talked to him on the phone.<eos> So, do you know Dr. Kurtz?<eos> Sometimes he does a talk-back thing on his blog.<eos> On his what?

- We'll have, uh, dinner afterwards.<eos> You know what I like about you?<eos> You never give up.<eos> Some dinners are worth fighting for.<eos> I left something in the room for ya.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You probably left me a big mess, is what you left me.<eos> Well, you know, rock stars.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Another life, huh?
-I don't want his piano.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> Well, it took six hours to move it out of the Hilton and I don't know anyone else in New Jersey.<eos> So tough shit.<eos> Look, it's a $30,000 instrument, Tom.<eos> Sell it, for all I care.<eos> How's your health?<eos> I find out in a few days.<eos> Ah.<eos> Your age.
- Hey, what are you looking for?<eos> - I can't find Bob.<eos> - Did you look underneath?<eos> You're not supposed to say the S-H-I-T word.<eos> The what?<eos> - Did you just spell that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, you're not supposed to say it.<eos> I'm allowed to say it under special emergency circumstances.<eos> - Well, actually...
You mean to tell me you haven't had Kan Chow Chicken yet?<eos> You're gonna love this.<eos> They feed the chicken's raisins.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> Makes the chickens taste sweet.<eos> Raisins?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> What do they the feed the chickens in the US?<eos> In the US?
There he is!<eos> Take that, dirty Jap!<eos> Maybe this'll let him know that "slants" ain't welcome...<eos> I finally understood why they don't let flat feet into the Army.<eos> Five groups of 10 "Hail Marys" and five "Our Fathers."<eos> In Latin.<eos> Sancta Maria, mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae.<eos> Amen.<eos> Now you.<eos> In Latin?
Oh, yeah?<eos> Show him our pass.<eos> - Still nothing, Leo?<eos> - I can't find her.<eos> It's too big.<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> This is too much.<eos> Forget the chair.<eos> I'm going to the port.<eos> In your wheelchair?
They're watching me very closely.<eos> The church?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The church.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'd like to get me disbarred.<eos> In fact... put that away.<eos> Put it away.<eos> I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form.<eos> Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Where was that?<eos> Uh, St. Ambrose in Dorchester.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's the one who introduced me to father Shanley.<eos> He was a street Priest.<eos> Long hair.<eos> Very hip.<eos> He invited me to his apartment in back bay.<eos> Where in Back Bay?
We couldn't see the scope of this.<eos> No one could.<eos> Robby, this started with one goddamn Priest.<eos> Macleish sent us a letter on 20 Priests years ago.<eos> Sacha found the clip.<eos> You freaking kidding?<eos> Twenty Priests?<eos> When?<eos> Uh, just after Porter.<eos> December '93.
We're headed five blocks north.<eos> "To the citizens of The Capitol, our war is not with you."<eos> To the citizens of The Capitol, our war is not with you.<eos> "You will be a vital part of the democracy that follows our victory."<eos> Be a vital part of the democracy that follows our victory.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Boggs.<eos> This is a good spot.<eos> Through there, in the courtyard.
Make no mistake.<eos> They are not coming to liberate us.<eos> They are coming to destroy our way of life.<eos> They are coming to bury us.<eos> Is he still in the mansion?<eos> Peeta?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I recognize the room.<eos> Where is that?<eos> About five blocks away.
Rumor has it - they were about to go public. - Yeah.<eos> Share what they had built with the whole world.<eos> Unfortunately, that never happened.<eos> Why not?<eos> I think we've shared enough, young lady.<eos> So, as we've decided to trust you, please trust us and tell me where'd you get it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you mean, honey?<eos> I kind of got arrested and it was in with my stuff.<eos> - In with your stuff?
I was just "the hunchback".<eos> Or "freak", if you were being kind.<eos> But the truth is, I didn't hate them for it.<eos> It's hard to judge cruelty when you've never known kindness.<eos> Besides, I always had someone to look up to.<eos> When I wasn't performing, I served as the company's doctor.<eos> I became fascinated by the science of medicine.<eos> Particularly of human anatomy.<eos> I wanted to understand everything about this internal universe that makes us who we are.<eos> The brains, lungs, bones, muscles.
Your flaws, though they're glaring and massive, are merely social not intellectual.<eos> I find your work astonishing and to be perfectly frank brilliant.<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Quite beyond my own ability to comprehend.<eos> Could you create another one?<eos> I could, and a whole lot more beside.<eos> But that would take considerable resource.<eos> As you are aware, I do come from the third richest family in England.<eos> As a result, I can provide you with whatever it is you so require.<eos> In that case, yes.
You must heal.<eos> And when you return, you will see things how they really are.<eos> Is that precious?<eos> I took possession of this when I was... ten.<eos> It was a very cold winter that year.<eos> We lived in the country then. It was a happy time.<eos> We crept out of my bedroom window because we wanted to play in the snow and so we did.<eos> Until we were engulfed by a blizzard.<eos> I almost died.<eos> Anyway, when...
Yeah.<eos> Man, I see a lot of taking on the way to enlightenment.<eos> What's being given back?<eos> Trust me.<eos> We give back.<eos> Do you need privacy?<eos> No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Everybody leave?<eos> Yeah, mostly.
Okay.<eos> I gave Time magazine full access, the whole campus.<eos> Bandley, Apple II, Lisa.<eos> I gave him Sculley, Markkula.<eos> I gave him Woz, I gave him everybody.<eos> What should I call the person who thought it would be a good idea to hand these out?<eos> I'm not telling you who it was.<eos> It was done without malice, it's been taken care of.<eos> You have a half hour, and we have things to talk about.<eos> Like what?
Lisa made a painting on the Mac.<eos> The Macintosh, Apple's near-mythological home computer, has gotten off to a rocky start in its battle with industry titan IBM.<eos> With sales originally projected to be 1,000,000 in the first quarter, Apple has sold only 35,000 of the user-friendly machines.<eos> The insistence by Steve Jobs that it'd have what's called "end-to-end control," which is a way of saying that it's not compatible with most outside hardware or software is the Shakespearean flaw in a machine that had potential.<eos> Apple Computers closed two of its factories today in the wake of disappointing sales.<eos> Do you know how many Macs were sold last month? 500.<eos> In a move that surprised some, but not all, on Wall Street, the board of directors of Apple Computers voted today to fire its co-founder, Steve Jobs.<eos> Did he jump, or was he pushed?<eos> His ex-boss, Apple CEO John Sculley, refused to comment.<eos> However, in an exclusive interview,
His ex-boss, Apple CEO John Sculley, refused to comment.<eos> However, in an exclusive interview,<eos> Steve Wozniak has slammed the integrity of his old friend Steve Jobs.<eos> He calls Jobs "an insulting and hurtful guy."<eos> Jobs is hitting back with a new company and a new computer.<eos> Apple has a new competitor.<eos> Steve Jobs' Black Cube is aimed at the education market.<eos> Few people have the ability to make the world wait, but that is just what Jobs is doing with his new company, NeXT.<eos> Focus seems kind of sharp.<eos> On the slide?
She's sitting with her friends, and she said she'd rather not come back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell her...<eos> Take her aside, I don't want to embarrass her in front of her friends, but tell her I just scared the shit out of Andy, and this time, nobody's paying her fucking...<eos> - All right.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> But do your thing, where you sound old and wise because of the broad, tragic European canvas of your life.<eos> You know I wasn't born in a 19th century shtetl, right?<eos> Please tell her it's important.<eos> - Everything all right?
It's too late, it already happened.<eos> The Bieb and I tag-teamed The O last weekend after his concert.<eos> It was great.<eos> I saw that.<eos> It was a good show.<eos> It was great.<eos> It was probably the best one she's ever had.<eos> Amanda. Mm-hm. Mile-high club, or in an elevator?<eos> She'd rather go down than up.<eos> Really?
"Um, well, we"<eos> Wait, what are you doing at my house?<eos> Hey, take it easy, okay'?<eos> We found your daughter...<eos> You're at my house with my daughter, and I don't know who the hell you are.<eos> All right, whoa, chill. Who are you'?<eos> Hey, pal, try to see it from my wife's perspective, all right'? Our daughter disappears, and then she shows up with a bunch of strangers.<eos> Fine, whatever.<eos> Look, we stopped at Chapman's Cafe and, I mean, we found her in the parking lot.<eos> The parking...
Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> Come here.<eos> Lucy was right.<eos> You have the most beautiful eyes.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No.<eos> No, you listen to me.<eos> My daughter is missing.<eos> Someone's been killed in my house.<eos> My house.
- What the heck is that?<eos> - Who puts broccoli on pizza?<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Congratulations, San Francisco, you've ruined pizza!<eos> First the Hawaiians and now you!<eos> What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza?<eos> Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?<eos> Still, it's not as bad as that soup.<eos> At that diner in Nebraska.
But we've been through worse!<eos> Tell you what, let's make a list of all the things Riley should be happy about. Fine.<eos> Let's see, this house stinks, our room stinks.<eos> - Pizza is weird here.<eos> - Our friends are back home.<eos> And all of our stuff is in the missing Van! Come on.<eos> It could be worse.<eos> Yeah, Joy.<eos> We could be lying on the dirty floor.<eos> In a bag.
We just set a record.<eos> It's not a good one.<eos> The most points ever scored against this school, and it's halftime.<eos> You think that's funny, Mitchell?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Well, then why are you laughing?<eos> You're our captain, elected by these guys.<eos> Our only senior.<eos> The time for you to make an impression was in practice this week.<eos> On the field tonight. Not now.
Finish strong!<eos> Palo Alto, McFarland. Morro Bay, McFarland.<eos> McFarland. McFarland.<eos> Good, Danny, you never stopped.<eos> You never stopped.<eos> And McFarland.<eos> Coming in with a combined score of 35, the winner is...<eos> Centennial.<eos> Second, Palo Alto, 41.<eos> Third, Morro Bay, 61.
We have begun our descent to our home planet.<eos> Please turn off all portable electronic devices.<eos> Who's gonna stop me?<eos> Perhaps you haven't noticed the air marshal.<eos> Have your cups lost their suck?<eos> Slipped on some drool?<eos> Larry H. Zeeblezorp will have you rolling in space credits.<eos> Wow.<eos> This place is completely alien, but everything's in English.<eos> Just like Canada.
Do not fear.<eos> You are among friends.<eos> We are the resistance.<eos> We don't believe in the barbaric consumption of other species.<eos> So, what do you eat-- space broccoli?<eos> Space broccoli has the most advanced feelings of any creature in the universe.<eos> I stepped on a piece once, and it cried for six years.<eos> Frankly, they are a little full of themselves.<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> Um, earth broccoli.
Camp Bloodbath."<eos> Am I ever going to live that movie down?<eos> I mean, it was 20 years ago.<eos> Honestly, if you ever become an actor, don't ever do a slasher flick.<eos> You wouldn't catch me dead in a movie.<eos> You're the actress here.<eos> Damn straight.<eos> And I'm no actress.<eos> I'm a movie star.<eos> Mel's?
- Just say the words! - What words?<eos> Billy Murphy was a kid who went to camp here years ago.<eos> Tell me the story again!<eos> Hurry!<eos> He was always picked on for being different, ugly.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Don't stop!<eos> And then one summer, the hottest one on record, the kids decided to play a little prank on him.<eos> - Where the hell are we?<eos> - A flashback!
I was pretty good at some of the classic games.<eos> Classics. You mean like Halo and Call of Duty.<eos> No!<eos> The real classics.<eos> Defender, Pac-Man, Asteroids.<eos> Games you played in an arcade which was a building outside of your house.<eos> You would go there with your friends, listen to music, cute girls everywhere.<eos> In ancient times, they called it "socializing."<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> - Video games.

I need you to sign the work order.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mrs. Van Patten, are you in the closet?<eos> Yes.<eos> Not judging, but what are you doin' in the closet?<eos> I'm mostly crying.<eos> A little drinking.<eos> Probably equally crying and drinking.<eos> Something I do often, also.<eos> But why in the closet?
Absolutely not.<eos> God.<eos> Sorry, I thought we were having a moment.<eos> We were.<eos> A moment.<eos> Look, you seem like a very nice guy, but I just met you, okay?<eos> And, no offense, I don't think my rebound guy is a 210-pound person that installs flat screens for a living.<eos> First of all, 208.<eos> And, wow, I didn't peg you as the snobby type.<eos> Snob? Me?
Shoot for the head!<eos> The mushroom things are in the way!<eos> You shoot the mushroom things!<eos> Like the game!<eos> Guys, every time he hits a mushroom, he's gonna change direction!<eos> My God!<eos> Will you please find the pattern and anticipate!<eos> I don't know the patterns!<eos> Sergeant Duff!<eos> 12 o'clock!
Okay, no problem.<eos> I'll find it.<eos> I don't know if you have plans, but I would love to take you to dinner.<eos> You could even invite your mom along.<eos> It'd be fun.<eos> Oh, thanks, Dad but, we already have plans with Daniel.<eos> Dad?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> Totally cool.
Keep moving!<eos> Come on.<eos> Hurry! Help!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Help!<eos> Keep moving! Keep moving!<eos> Let's go! Help!<eos> There's a girl trapped in a town car!<eos> Where?<eos> In the parking garage!
Your parents will be worried sick.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Another aftershock! It's okay. It's all right.<eos> Run! Run!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Hey!<eos> That was my spot!<eos> You know, when you were talking to Blake... that was the first time I heard you say Mallory's name since we lost her.<eos> Hey, did you know that Blake keeps pictures from our San Francisco trip?<eos> Yeah, in her memory box.
- Well, it's his story.<eos> Ask him.<eos> - Nick, you coming?<eos> - They did have big tits.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> We'll talk about this Monday, OK?<eos> - OK.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Big scenes. Europe next week.

Is that clear Mr. Hale?<eos> You have your conditions, I have mine.<eos> You get paid after the procedure, I maybe dying, but I'm not a fool.<eos> Settle your affairs and fly to New Orleans on Tuesday.<eos> Your death needs to be public Mr. Hale.<eos> Have lunch at Commanders. I recommend the chicory coffee.<eos> You've reached the residence of Martin and Judy, please leave a message.<eos> Sorry to bother you with at the ranch Martin.<eos> You mind meeting me for lunch?<eos> In New Orleans.
Run!<eos> Everything you'd go back and change... if only you had more time.<eos> Look who's up.<eos> Sleeping Beauty.<eos> You were farting in your sleep again, you know that?<eos> How would I know that, dickhead?<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> More like dead to the world.<eos> - Danny in yet?<eos> - In the office.
- Since when do you give a shit if I'm happy?<eos> This is for your own sake, right?<eos> I say I'm happy, that life turned out all right and then you don't feel so guilty about leaving.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So are you?<eos> I'd be happier if I were still fighting, but....<eos> I used to watch your fights.<eos> - That's fucking bullshit.<eos> - Over on Church Street.
You kidnapped my mom!<eos> Who is Mimom?<eos> No, "my" mom!<eos> What did I say?<eos> - I knows how to find her.<eos> - How?<eos> That information is at Boov Central Command.<eos> - At the Great Antenna.<eos> - What?<eos> In Paris!
So,behonest,Nick.<eos> Tell me about my good qualities, and if I believe you, you're free as air.<eos> You're a great man, Mr. DeMarco.<eos> A peach of a guy.<eos> You're the best.<eos> A genuine top of the line human being.<eos> You failed so far, Nick, but I'm gonna give you one more chance.<eos> So go ahead, talk about me.<eos> The fuck are you thinking about, huh?<eos> Corsica.

Mr. DeMarco's waiting.<eos> Take five.<eos> Nicholas.<eos> Nicholas.<eos> Baby.<eos> I heard you were up over 500 last night at the Gate.<eos> Talk of the town.<eos> Do you remember, when was it?<eos> A couple months ago when you had us beaten for 200 grand?<eos> Right here at the Nugget?
English? Oui.<eos> Is it difficult? No, it's easy, but...<eos> Good night.<eos> I saw you...<eos> I saw you swim in the reservoir, in the barrage. Oui.<eos> It's not allowed, is it?<eos> You don't swim?<eos> I do in English.<eos> But not in French?<eos> In England...
I don't know.<eos> Maybe it has blood running from its eyes like tears, as it limps across the fields.<eos> What are you saying? - I dive.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You have to breathe out or it goes up your nose.<eos> I know.<eos> Fuck, no. In Paris.<eos> I just visit with my aunt.<eos> - A holiday?<eos> - Not really.
Must be cold.<eos> Hmm, to begin.<eos> After... it's like fire, you know, in the skin. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We never swam in the reservoir.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I think it's not allowed.<eos> But we walk round it. It's very beautiful.<eos> I used to swim.<eos> In the sea.
I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> We've done this so often, packing up.<eos> But we were always moving somewhere else, somewhere better or bigger.<eos> Weren't we, Elliot?<eos> Not just... giving things up.<eos> Your mother's sad.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> My mother is in...<eos> it's like an 'ospital, but different.<eos> Like an asylum?
How?<eos> I mean... Smoking.<eos> The first was just... but now her...<eos> - Head?<eos> - Yeah, and everywhere.<eos> My father says she... she's like a different person because of... of the cancer.<eos> Not my mother any more.<eos> At first she was funny.<eos> She made really strange comments, you know?<eos> Really.
Is it for me or for a studio audience?<eos> Both.<eos> He says I will be not happy if I see her now.<eos> Like I'm a baby that will have bad dreams.<eos> He wants you to remember her when she was funny, when she was well, that's all. Stop it.<eos> And you hit someone.<eos> Do I come this evening?<eos> If you want.<eos> Your mum asked me.<eos> Really?
You just say things. It's not appropriate. - We're on holiday.<eos> - Well, no, we're not.<eos> We're in France.<eos> French people talk about these things.<eos> - Or is that only in Paris? - I don't know.<eos> You're being vulgar.<eos> I thought you liked carrots.<eos> Wait a moment.<eos> We'll see you on the bridge.<eos> Which bridge?
- I'm done. That's it.<eos> That's usually what happens when I pee on the beach. Yeah.<eos> - Drag queens. That's, uh... - Heh-heh-heh.<eos> Ooh, doing drag queen stuff.<eos> - You love drag queens. - Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Yep.<eos> - I am one, so I seek out my people. - Heh.<eos> - You are one? You are one?<eos> - Mm-hm. On the inside.<eos> - Mostly.

- "Oh, yeah, I heard that's real nice, ma'am."<eos> - Listen to him!<eos> - Is that what I sound like?<eos> You're good!<eos> Damn.<eos> Don't think I don't know what you're doing here with those girls.<eos> How do y'all know my daughter?<eos> We just met her in Jacksonville at a...<eos> - It was a bar.<eos> - A bar!
He didn't pick you.<eos> He used you.<eos> So, the night of the 15th, you were honest with her about your debts for the first time?<eos> Maybe it was too much all at once like that, but... yes, I told her everything.<eos> She had tears in her eyes.<eos> But I intended to put it all out into the open.<eos> Go on.<eos> So I told her. I told her that we weren't paid up on the condo. And that we'd have to move again.<eos> About the credit cards that I'd gotten by forging her father's signature.<eos> About the counterfeit checks.
Sandy?<eos> Sandy, are you home?<eos> Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is.<eos> What is all this stuff?<eos> Sandy?<eos> Don't touch that!<eos> Incoherent muttering.<eos> Sandy?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Okay?
You!<eos> Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flipping!<eos> Yeah, that's my job!<eos> How did you get here?<eos> You cannot breathe air.<eos> Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole, and...<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> That's not in the book.<eos> Book?
Yeah, that's my job!<eos> How did you get here?<eos> You cannot breathe air.<eos> Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole, and...<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> That's not in the book.<eos> Book?<eos> There is no magical dolphin in this story.<eos> What story?
Welcome to Billy Bob's Bait Shop. How can I help you?<eos> Yeah, hi.<eos> Uh... We're here for, uh, so much fun, it's a crime.<eos> Villain-Con!<eos> All right!<eos> Here we go!<eos> Well, this is it!<eos> I wanna tell you, and I really mean this.<eos> I really appreciate what you did back there with the cops.<eos> Really!
When you knew me all along you stalker bitch! Why don't you come back here... and say it to my face, you little whore!<eos> Fuck you, River!<eos> Don't you dare fucking come back!<eos> I never fucking loved you.<eos> Jordana, we have to go.<eos> River!<eos> Look at me, River!<eos> My meds!<eos> Your meds?<eos> In the cabinets!
How about that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Miss Kavanagh?<eos> May I take your coat?<eos> Oh. Yeah. Um...<eos> She's...<eos> Okay, so...<eos> Mr. Grey will see you now.<eos> Okay.<eos> This way, please.
Watch it!<eos> I'm not the man for you.<eos> You should steer clear of me.<eos> I have to let you go.<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Grey.<eos> All right, pencils down.<eos> Please take your final exams to the back of the classroom.<eos> Final grades will be posted in two weeks.<eos> Hey.<eos> You all good?
Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> We are so partying tonight.<eos> on, my God.<eos> This is way too much.<eos> No, this is exactly the right amount.<eos> You're getting it all over my face.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> Wow.<eos> No, Kate.
I just got a little distracted.<eos> Sorry I missed your graduation, honey.<eos> I heard it was lovely.<eos> And your new beau?<eos> Ray told me all about him.<eos> He sounds like quite the young man.<eos> Of course, I would have preferred to have heard about him from you.<eos> Ana?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Nothing.
Why do you care so much about the contract, Christian?<eos> Don't you like me the way I am?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Then why are you trying to change me?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I need more.<eos> I want more.<eos> Hearts and flowers?<eos> That's not something I know.<eos> Ana, please.
Nice meeting you.<eos> She just stonewalled me.<eos> I mean I don't If I can use him in the book at all.<eos> That sucks because, I mean, he would have been the cornerstone of the whole frigging...<eos> Look, he wrote one surprising album.<eos> He had a lot of potential.<eos> And it sucks that he died so young.<eos> Yeah, but hon, how many stacks of dissertations have been written about, you know, I mean, hell.<eos> You got Cobain, you know, Buckley,<eos> Arbus, Elliott Smith, Nick Drake, David Foster Wallace.
Dick move!<eos> You're... You're his enabler.<eos> Hello.<eos> That's the walk of shame.<eos> So, this is where the magic happens?<eos> If, smashing your head against the screen is magic, then yes.<eos> What you got so far?<eos> You have one of those drawers in your kitchen full of unrelated items, like, the small appliance manuals, dead batteries, egg beaters, how he lost his virginity, his go-to joke, his theories on why Thursday was the greatest<eos> day, and everything else that I can't forget.<eos> In no apparent order.
Hey!<eos> Finley.<eos> Is everything ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hopped on the 6:00 AM to Portland.<eos> Don't know what happened, but somehow -the cab ended up being... -Stay.<eos> -$248.<eos> -Stay!<eos> I definitely only had enough money for tip.<eos> -Crazy expensive, Maine. -Right.

Uh... Um... No.<eos> You just walked out of there.<eos> Well, I interviewed.<eos> But you got a box with office belongings.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I brought it to the interview to show confidence.<eos> Do you have any sales experience?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Great.<eos> Foot Locker.
We have to push, Mr. Trunkman, Mr. McWinters, Mr. Panther.<eos> Push?<eos> Yes, we have to push your meeting, if you please, until Friday, 11:30.<eos> I don't please.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> There are no rooms left in the whole city.<eos> It says that it's the G8 this week.<eos> Oktoberfest, too. Folsom Europe.<eos> And the Berlin Marathon.<eos> This week.
You're too old to sleep in a room.<eos> Okay. Uh...<eos> Where can I sleep?<eos> You can sleep in the stairwell, in the hallway, or in the Business Centre.<eos> Okay.<eos> The Business Centre.<eos> Hey, it's Dad.<eos> So, I've been trying to reach you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Berlin.
I know you're tired.<eos> I'll sit in the chair.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I thought you were gonna sit in a chair?<eos> Please let me be here.<eos> I need to lie down, too.<eos> We don't have to talk about work or anything.<eos> All right.<eos> What should we talk about?<eos> Marriage?
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.<eos> Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.<eos> Although I will admit, God did give Miss McAdam an advantage when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.<eos> No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis, but you're sensible.<eos> So, you're having the room and that's that.<eos> Will the other girls not mind? Oh, I expect so.<eos> What don't they mind?<eos> Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?<eos> There's a dance?<eos> At the parish hall.
Mmm! Do you hear that?<eos> "Jim and I. Jim and I."<eos> It won't be long now by the sound of it and your mother will have a wonderful day out.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> There they are.<eos> - Hello, Mrs Byrne. How are you?<eos> - Jack.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> What about?<eos> The future.
Stop me from going back to America?<eos> Perhaps you didn't even know.<eos> My name is Eilis Fiorello.<eos> - Putting you through now.<eos> - Thank you. How can I help?<eos> I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.<eos> I think people spend even more money after a wedding.<eos> Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.<eos> She was buying firelighters in Broom's.<eos> Firelighters in August.
- The show's about to start, Benji. - Right.<eos> Just take your position. - Tell me what you see. - Okay.<eos> Nice tux, by the way.<eos> Lights ready, Act One preset.<eos> Final preparations complete.<eos> Everyone standby please.<eos> Join the IMF!<eos> See the world!<eos> On a monitor.<eos> In a closet.
That's interesting.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's a skiff.<eos> A secure computer facility.<eos> Offline, ultra-contained.<eos> It's impossible to hack into from the outside.<eos> It's essentially a digital safety deposit box.<eos> Very strange thing for a young lady to be carrying in her sundries.<eos> Where's it located?<eos> Morocco.
I'm afraid she has a point.<eos> Two, you let me walk away to an uncertain fate.<eos> You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.<eos> But some part of you suspects you've met your match.<eos> And being a gambler, you'll probably end up handing Lane that disk, whether you want to or not.<eos> That is entirely possible.<eos> And option three?<eos> Come away with me.<eos> Right now.<eos> Oh, boy.
Can't you see it?<eos> William Brandt, sir.<eos> He says it's urgent.<eos> I had a feeling you'd come to your senses, Brandt.<eos> I'm only calling you because I have no other choice.<eos> I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe. I can understand that.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - London.<eos> - Reroute us to London now.<eos> - Where in London?
- It's very confusing, isn't it?<eos> How do you know it all?<eos> - Mostly from drinking.<eos> Yeah.<eos> More you drink, more you learn.<eos> In that case, I am, uh, the foremost expert in Jägerbombs.<eos> I will walk you through it all...<eos> It's been a pleasure to serve you, Chef Oshowole.<eos> Chef who?<eos> Uh, Oshowole.
We can tie into multiple lines, diffuse our footprint, keep hopping DNS addresses.<eos> Plus military-grade fiber.<eos> How many bathrooms?<eos> Fat-Ass Farhad is flying in.<eos> - Two, coed.<eos> He still got irritable bowel?<eos> Man, he should do a cleanse.<eos> Horst, he is a 400-pound Persian. He is not gonna do a cleanse.<eos> Where you been staying?<eos> Hyatt again?
- Seriously.<eos> - All right.<eos> Aren't you gonna ask about Dad?<eos> I heard he was dead.<eos> Nice to hear that your finger's on the pulse. Hm?<eos> His cardiac pump fail?<eos> Yeah, must have died out a short time after the car ran him over. Hm.<eos> Hey, if you need work again, I can get you a bouncer's gig.<eos> All right?<eos> If not here, somewhere else.

Hm.<eos> Hey, if you need work again, I can get you a bouncer's gig.<eos> All right?<eos> If not here, somewhere else.<eos> You'll never see me again.<eos> All right...<eos> Good luck!<eos> With... everything.
If I leave the bullets in, it'll heal over... and I'll get migraines.<eos> But you... god, you have no problem doing that?<eos> I have pliers in my head.<eos> It hurts.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know how that works.<eos> How come you're not brain dead or something?<eos> I should be.<eos> But I'm not.<eos> Oh, god.
Clint, you've had a tough week.<eos> We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.<eos> You know I've seen this before, right?<eos> I still don't know how you do it!<eos> Smell the silent judgment?<eos> Please, Stark, by all means.<eos> Uh-Oh. Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.<eos> - Get after it.<eos> - It's physics.<eos> Physics.
In... Strings.<eos> I had to kill the other guy.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> You killed someone?<eos> Wouldn't have been my first call.<eos> But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> I see a suit of armour around the world.<eos> - Ultron.<eos> - In the flesh.
Black market arms.<eos> There are conventions. All right? You meet people.<eos> I didn't sell him anything.<eos> He was talking about finding something new, a game-changer.<eos> It was all very Ahab.<eos> This?<eos> Ah, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.<eos> Those are tattoos, this is a brand.<eos> Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."<eos> In a much less friendly way.
Go.<eos> Did you guys copy that?<eos> We did.<eos> I got a private jet taking off across town.<eos> No manifest.<eos> That could be him.<eos> There.<eos> It's a truck from the lab.<eos> Right above you, Cap.<eos> On the loop by the bridge.
We've gotta own it.<eos> Make a stand.<eos> It's not a loop.<eos> It's the end of the line.<eos> I wasn't sure you would wake up.<eos> I hoped you would.<eos> I wanted to show you.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> I think a lot about meteors.<eos> The purity in them.
On our side?<eos> I don't think it's that simple.<eos> Well, it better get real simple real soon.<eos> I am on the side of life.<eos> Ultron isn't.<eos> He will end it all.<eos> What's he waiting for?<eos> - You.<eos> - Where?<eos> Sokovia.
- I'm sorry.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> Everything's just screwed-up. I'm not thinking straight.<eos> There's something wrong with me.<eos> Well, where are you staying?<eos> The Fregoli.<eos> La-di-da, you're doing well.<eos> It's boring. Everything's boring.<eos> Okay, I could meet you there.<eos> At the bar.
I got her pregnant. We're having a baby.<eos> Make sure it's yours.<eos> Okay. 'Cause I doubt it is.<eos> Look...<eos> Why would a rich slut like her hang around a loser like you?<eos> Think about it.<eos> You okay, baby?<eos> Someone should fucking die.<eos> You got anything?<eos> In the glove compartment.
Move a little to the left, please.<eos> Adele, you are restless.<eos> I worry too much, you know that.<eos> About what?
Move a little to the left, please.<eos> Adele, you are restless.<eos> I worry too much, you know that.<eos> About what?<eos> The future.
Oh, we haven't even arrived, and you're already trying to get rid of me?<eos> That's not what I said...<eos> I just meant you don't have to come.<eos> Anyway.<eos> I want to go to the Belvedere to visit my aunt.<eos> You know, the postcard doesn't do her justice.<eos> You were born in Vienna... - ... Mrs. Altmann?<eos> - Yes, yes, I was, yes.<eos> Uh, just around the corner, yes.<eos> Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Bruno Grimshitz.<eos> - Grimshitz?<eos> ! The paintings were taken off the walls of your family home and carefully transported to the Belvedere.<eos> Certain facts had to be altered, like your aunt's name and her Jewish provenance, of course.<eos> For a short while after the war, she became simply known as... "Woman in Gold."<eos> So her identity was stolen as well.<eos> It wasn't enough to rob your family and try to destroy it.<eos> No. You had to be eradicated from history.<eos> So the paintings reached the Belvedere.<eos> In 1941.
Look, I know it's going to sound crazy, but... a spirit.<eos> You sure you want to tell him?<eos> - Maybe it's time.<eos> - What's time?<eos> The spirit.<eos> She's here.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Where is this spirit from?<eos> - She lives in Seoul.<eos> - Korea?
- Korea?<eos> She's a businesswoman.<eos> My age exactly.<eos> Born the same moment I was.<eos> The first breath I took, she took too, but in Korea.<eos> What a thing, yeah?<eos> She's here now?<eos> Sort of.<eos> - Actually, she's in prison.<eos> - Prison.
Adam fell off that frigging bike and it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen.<eos> Am I... Do I exist in the world?<eos> Are you guys even seeing me right now?<eos> Please, look at this.<eos> Dude, you're crazy.<eos> Ready, go.<eos> Play.<eos> I'm ready, I'm ready.<eos> Right there.<eos> In the mirror.
I'm not seeing anything.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> -Crap.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - What does that even...<eos> -Give me the camera.<eos> Give me the camera.<eos> Look at yourself. Your hair. - What is it?<eos> What?<eos> - On your head.
-it's off! That is not cold!<eos> Do you know what "cold" means?<eos> - Do you feel the power?<eos> How is this happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it all the electromagnetic energy?<eos> Then explain this.<eos> Come here, Chris.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> - Oh, my God.
I haven't got a game face.<eos> Somebody say something.<eos> Okay, thank you for letting us use your battery.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> What are you going to do with it?<eos> Well, we're gonna test it. We're gonna...<eos> But I thought you already tested it.<eos> Yeah, yeah, but we haven't tested on a living organism.<eos> So now you're going to test it on people, right? No!<eos> - Bacteria first.

David, it's me.<eos> David, it's me.<eos> Jess,no!<eos> Jessie!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Jess!<eos> Oh, God, please.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, my God, no!
Occupational hazard, I suppose.<eos> Where do you live?<eos> Nowhere now.<eos> I guess you're staying with us for a while.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say you stranded me here on purpose.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> When people die, they either bury 'em in the ground... or they're burned down into a box like this.<eos> There's a person in there?<eos> How do they do it?<eos> In an oven?
I don't know.<eos> You got everything a kid could ever want right here.<eos> My wife grew up in a place like this.<eos> You have a wife?<eos> Had.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> She's the one in the box.<eos> How'd she die?<eos> There was...<eos> a fire in our house.
Just like my late Morris.<eos> Morris. Now, he was American and you're Italian, and your name originated how?<eos> My name.<eos> My Italian name is Geltrude.<eos> Geltrude.<eos> And then he called me "Trude," and then became more American. "Trudy."<eos> Trudy.<eos> Why don't you come with your entire family, on my late Morris' boat?<eos> Bring the children, bring the grandchildren.<eos> Like a motorboat?
Joy<eos> What is happening to you, Mother?<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> Are you in love with Touissant?<eos> I was feeling alone.<eos> And I didn't even realize it, you know?<eos> And then<eos> What did the patent search find?<eos> Trudy just wanted to be careful. And this guy found a man that's in Texas who worked for another guy in another country where they have an idea that might be similar to my mop.<eos> What country?

And this guy found a man that's in Texas who worked for another guy in another country where they have an idea that might be similar to my mop.<eos> What country?<eos> Hong Kong.
So, this guy in Texas<eos> We're supposed to pay him a royalty on the patent as a protection, right?<eos> Right.<eos> To be safe from any claims.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Please stop using the word "we."<eos> None of this is your money or your business.<eos> But the same guy also owns a manufacturing plant that you guys say that it's cheaper than any other place?<eos> -Yes.<eos> In California.
Oh, my...<eos> Come on.<eos> Good boy.<eos> - Claire?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I was hoofing'.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I tried to call you.<eos> Colm was here.<eos> In the house?
No, I know.<eos> Yes, you will...<eos> you will call me if you hear anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my God, where were you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Leia, where were you?<eos> I went for a walk.<eos> A walk?
Are you okay?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Leia, where were you?<eos> I went for a walk.<eos> A walk?<eos> For seven hours?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did you walk?<eos> I don't know, a park.<eos> What park?
That's my life in there too, my house.<eos> I'd rather not do this with a lawyer, Marcy.<eos> And I wish you'd cared half as much about us as you care about your things, but...<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Nothing's fair.<eos> Sooner or later, Marce.<eos> Fine.<eos> Later.<eos> If you need anything, I'm not far.<eos> Over on Highland?
Buddy, take him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on. Come on, Jakey.<eos> Are you all right? You all right?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It was a good plan.<eos> How'd it go so wrong?<eos> Hey, Franco, are you talking about Jakey?<eos> My brother?
The city bit him like a fox.<eos> He went mad, he went insane.<eos> He killed Eric.<eos> He made a deal with Garza to kill me.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, no, it ain't his fault.<eos> You see, he got sick.<eos> He just got sick, is all.<eos> You've got to put him to sleep.<eos> At his ranch.
- Excuse me?<eos> Yes, I was telling Mavis about the other monster-human couples in town.<eos> - I am not a werewolf. - Oh.<eos> I thought...<eos> Well, you're welcome to stay and have some cupcakes.<eos> Vampires will be friends forever<eos> Through the centuries together<eos> Even in the brightest sunny weather<eos> Vampires will be friends forever<eos> Literally
Yes.<eos> To the...<eos> Sorry about all that stuff.<eos> I guess they thought you'd like it.<eos> Why do I feel so weird here? No, hon.<eos> They're being weird.<eos> I think they're just trying to help me.<eos> I mean, I grew up knowing nothing living inside that hotel.<eos> And you learned about everything growing up in Santa Claus.<eos> Santa Cruz.
Maybe if Dennis grows up away from Transylvania, he won't be so freaky.<eos> Like me.<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> Mavis, you're a blast.<eos> You're so full of life and curious about everything.<eos> If Dennis grows up to be just like you, I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.<eos> I love you, Johnnystein.<eos> You know what?<eos> As long as we're all together, we'll be happy anywhere.<eos> Even at the hotel.
Many young people would do anything to Live in a big city.<eos> Like Leningrad.
In a couple of years time, you'll be much more prepared...<eos> What is it?<eos> You forgot something?<eos> You won't even let us try!<eos> It's not that simple, Marta.<eos> - It is! We wanna go, but you won't let us!<eos> - Look, Marta...<eos> You think we're no good?<eos> - No, that's not it...<eos> Why then?
Haven't you all lost a relative to the Spanish or the English?<eos> And was that republican blood or Orangist blood?<eos> No.<eos> It was Dutch blood.<eos> It's our blood.<eos> This is our country.<eos> A country we conquered from the water.<eos> A country where we earn our own happiness.<eos> By working hard in the villages and cities.<eos> In the ports and on the main land.
Ah! My Lord. Come and join me.<eos> I'll be with you very soon.<eos> Majesty. What's the matter?<eos> Don't you like girls?<eos> You have locked us before the French?<eos> No, I wanted to discuss with you first.<eos> You surely don't expect me to betray my country, do you?<eos> I expect you to do your duty to the family.<eos> Is that the only thing you could think of?<eos> My family?
Come on, back to work.<eos> Get down there and pick up those cannons.<eos> According to reliable sources, the Republic of Netherlands and unstable, sir.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Master Buat is a loyal rittmeister.<eos> You're executing such a loyal servant?<eos> Who is he serving?<eos> He went to the king of England behind my back.<eos> In the national interest.<eos> Your interest.
I have absolutely no doubt this machine will revolutionize clay mining as we know it.<eos> Turn it off, please.<eos> Have you tested it? Full-scale?<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> We're very close.<eos> But we hope that, with funding...<eos> So, actually, what you have is a toy, and some fancy words.<eos> Mr. Cushing, I...<eos> You've already tried, and failed, to raise capital in London, Edinburgh,<eos> Milan.
It's absurdly sentimental.<eos> The aches that you describe with such earnestness.<eos> The pain, the loss.<eos> You clearly haven't lived at all.<eos> In fact, you only seem to know what other writers tell you.<eos> That's enough!<eos> You insist on describing the torments of love when you clearly know nothing about them.<eos> I'm not done yet!<eos> What do you dream of?<eos> A kind man?
How have you been keeping?<eos> Never better, Sir Thomas.<eos> Finlay, this is my wife.<eos> I know, my Lord. I know.<eos> You've been married a while.<eos> Awhile?<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> I'm not sure what he was talking about.<eos> His family worked for ours for centuries.<eos> In fact...
Can you hold on?<eos> Go.<eos> You thought you were a writer.<eos> With your ghosts.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You have nothing to live for now.<eos> Sign.<eos> All the women we found...<eos> London, Edinburgh, Milan.<eos> America.
Go.<eos> You thought you were a writer.<eos> With your ghosts.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You have nothing to live for now.<eos> Sign.<eos> All the women we found...<eos> London, Edinburgh, Milan.<eos> America.<eos> Yes, America.
And let me say right here and now...<eos> Alright, that's enough, that's enough.<eos> We agreed that my colleague would do the speaking and rightly so for while her language may be... salty, it has great economy and pith.<eos> I don't care about any of that.<eos> No, listen and learn, son.<eos> Tea is an herb that's been dried out.<eos> So to bring it back to life, you have to infuse it in boiling water.<eos> That is boiling water.<eos> Everywhere I've been in this country they slap down a cup of tepid nonsense you know with the teabag lying beside it which means I've got to go through the ridiculous business of dunking it in the lukewarm piss waiting for the slightest change of color to occur.<eos> And at my age...
And others are doing jobs they never thought they could do.<eos> One Queen was so close to her elephant that when she passed away, the elephant stood beside her tomb for three days before dying of grief.<eos> We should all know such love, just not necessarily from an elephant.<eos> And sometimes they're right, they can't.<eos> - When were these built?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - What period are we talking about?<eos> Ah... yeah.<eos> 17th... 17th century.<eos> 17th century.
Jean used to accuse me of doing it deliberately to annoy her.<eos> Whereas, the best way was to stand in front of her and fold up a road map the wrong way.<eos> You're happy.<eos> I've just got a text from Laura.<eos> Well, five texts, although I could only read the first one.<eos> I hate this machine.<eos> - Turns out she's coming here.<eos> - I thought she was going to Mumbai.<eos> She's taking a diversion to see her old man.<eos> In his natural habitat.
Why did you come here, really?<eos> To pay my respects to you.<eos> There's nothing I admire more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never get to sit.<eos> Others will.<eos> That's what counts.<eos> How long are you staying?<eos> I fly tomorrow morning.<eos> It's a punishing itinerary, I'm afraid.<eos> In which of your hotels do you think I should spend the night?<eos> Second or the first?
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I came up with a great idea.<eos> Let's just run away!<eos> Some place that no one would ever think to find us.<eos> Mexico.<eos> Let's just leave this material world behind.<eos> Live in a one-bedroom shack.<eos> Oh, God.
Entrada.<eos> What the fuck are you doin', man?<eos> It's called Capoeira.<eos> It's a Brazilian martial art.<eos> But don't be fooled by its beauty and grace.<eos> It's actually quite deadly.<eos> This is deadly?<eos> That's deadly?<eos> Stab. Ow!<eos> Stab.
It's actually quite deadly.<eos> This is deadly?<eos> That's deadly?<eos> Stab. Ow!<eos> Stab.<eos> Stop. Stab.<eos> Stab.<eos> Guards!<eos> Guards! What are you...<eos> Stabbity stab, stab, stab!
Yes.<eos> I want you to go over there and I want you to fight one of them.<eos> That's insane!<eos> They're...<eos> They're behemoths.<eos> They would break my spine.<eos> Yeah, well, those are the type of guys you're gonna see in San Quentin.<eos> So you gotta shake that fear, man.<eos> I want you to go over there and punch that big-ass dude in the mouth.<eos> Oh, my God.
Were... were they...<eos> Keistered? Yeah.<eos> Were they... Were they keistered?<eos> Most of 'em.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're about to simulate a prison riot.<eos> Understand that this is the most dangerous situation there is.<eos> Prisoners are scared. Guards are scared.<eos> The key to survivin' is to not freak out.<eos> Good lord.
Oh, shit!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off!<eos> Damn it.<eos> This is the end, guys.<eos> You going down.<eos> That's great.<eos> I spend my whole life in Crenshaw, and now I'm about to get killed by some white guy from Beverly Hills?<eos> On a yacht!
Some Penn State?<eos> Some Pepperdine?<eos> Pomona?<eos> Princeton?<eos> I'm not getting into Princeton.<eos> He's not getting into Princeton.<eos> Um, so, is that it?<eos> No, honey, it's not it.<eos> Your father and I want to talk to you about something kind of sad.<eos> What?
I shouldn't have told you to pretend to be dead.<eos> That was really insensitive.<eos> I mean, I'm sick. I'm not dying.<eos> Yeah, I know, but I just...<eos> Now I'm being all weird about it. And I can't get un-weird, 'cause I just...<eos> Despite what you said, I'm clearly still sitting here thinking "death, death, death, death, death, death."<eos> That's exactly what I'm talking about!<eos> So if this was a touching romantic story this is probably where a new feeling would wash over me... and suddenly we would be furiously making out with the fire of a thousand suns.<eos> But this isn't a touching romantic story.<eos> Anyway...
Yep.<eos> But we did still become friends.<eos> Daniel Craig's thing is, he's got an accent, right?<eos> So he's used to talking with his mouth in a weird shape which is why he has pouty lips, like a woman.<eos> Lickable technology, like, I could text you a sandwich.<eos> There's a button on the nape of his neck, under the skin.<eos> Just push it if you want him to stop.<eos> Do you believe animals just live in our house, and everyone's cool with it?<eos> Like, real animals?<eos> Anyway.
I like your room, Rachel.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Greg thinks it's too girly.<eos> No, I love girly, I think it's fine.<eos> Well, it ain't too girly.<eos> "Yo, this some pink puffy bullshit."<eos> I mean, Hello Kitty posters and chocolate and naked dudes all over the wall.<eos> They make me want to throw up for real. Hey, if you're gonna throw up, don't do it in here, okay?<eos> This is her room.<eos> Anyways.
So college is unlike the senseless chaos and sickening enormity of high school.<eos> High school is the mouth of a great demon biting and chewing and smushing people in the face.<eos> It is simply overwhelming.<eos> In all seriousness, I am looking forward to college because I didn't really fit in in high school, because of my weird rodent face...<eos> No.<eos> ...and a habit of saying the dumbest possible shit.<eos> No!<eos> The sheer pastiness of my complexion overwhelms all who behold it with existential nausea.<eos> "In high school, I never truly felt comfortable...<eos> "...in my own skin.
I believe in you.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Damn.<eos> So again, if this was a touching, romantic story we'd obviously fall in love and she'd say all the wise, beautiful things... in life's twilight or whatever.<eos> And then she'd die in my arms.<eos> But again, that's not what happened.<eos> She just got quieter.<eos> And unhappier.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> For real.

You can practically just download the chicks.<eos> You sure couldn't pull tricks like that in my heyday.<eos> You just log onto a chat room, finding millions of lost souls dying to chat and this often leads to something.<eos> There are multiple cases of people finding their soul mates online.<eos> Sealing their vows, even.<eos> But even if it doesn't lead you all the way to the altar, it's a nice way to get a taste of life.<eos> Have your cake and eat it too.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> We're just chatting...<eos> about war and peace.
What's up, Fúsi boy?<eos> Driving around as usual?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hear the weather is getting pretty nasty, is that right?<eos> Yeah, it kind of looks like a storm, right now.<eos> Well, they could drop an atom bomb and I wouldn't notice all holed up in my little studio bunker.<eos> But I was thinking of you earlier.<eos> This morning I was browsing through the radio archives and came across this gem<eos> - I know this is right up your alley.<eos> - Really?
Loading and unloading airplanes.<eos> Wow.<eos> Do you get free tickets then?<eos> Are you going to take me on a trip?<eos> What?<eos> Maybe you can just sneak me into the Duty Free.<eos> To me the transit area is even more fun than going abroad.<eos> It's like you've started a journey but everything has yet to happen.<eos> I've never been abroad.<eos> Really?
- What do you do?<eos> - Me?<eos> Well, actually, I work in a flower shop.<eos> Is that why you've got so many flowers?<eos> Yes.<eos> I love flowers.<eos> I'm impressed!<eos> It's a shame that you're still single, dear.<eos> - Well, that could be changing.<eos> - Really?
It's like how I need to keep studying.<eos> I understand.<eos> There is people in town who still check their mailbox every morning even though there hasn't been mail in forever.<eos> It's a fugue state.<eos> It's like a what?<eos> Oh, it's like when you forget everything.<eos> And you're in this weird state.<eos> You don't realize anything that's happened to you before.<eos> You seem normal in every other way.<eos> A fugue state.

My father cut it.<eos> Your father?<eos> Your father around here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he's around.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Where is he?<eos> I just want to talk to him and see what he knows.<eos> He's in the woods.<eos> In the woods.
Not honor.<eos> I mean, that falls kind of with respect and admiration.<eos> Maybe just kind of a... Just a general sense of...<eos> Missing, you miss him.<eos> - Yeah, I miss him.<eos> -You miss him. Yeah, yeah. I motherfucking miss him.<eos> What're you doing?<eos> You up in heaven? Raping angels?<eos> Good for you, buddy.<eos> - Oh, God. -What the fuck?
You look like the guy that owns the one house that ruins the whole street.<eos> Have I bombed anything, you think?<eos> You look like you've never made a correct decision.<eos> Even<eos> I have definitely given a back-alley blowjob.<eos> I gotta admit I kinda like this.<eos> I want to hit you into the corner pocket.<eos> Now I know why the coat-check girl didn't like me.<eos> I look like fucking shit.<eos> So far so good on this future shit, huh?
What did you do with my nitro?<eos> How can I take what doesn't exist yet?<eos> It exists in the past.<eos> How can it not exist in the future?<eos> The past, the future.<eos> All very cute.<eos> But who's to say the past isn't anything more than the future of this present?<eos> So, nitro is from the future?<eos> Like Terminator.<eos> - Yeah.
It's Satan.<eos> Like, I'll finger your dog, I don't care. As a joke!<eos> As a joke! I have some advice for you. If you don't want to be considered a sex offender, don't take a shit in a sandbox that happens to be in a playground.<eos> Okay? Don't do it. 'Cause guess what?<eos> You have two things, a record and a fucking nickname.<eos> I know it's a potentially risky move...<eos> Wedding sorbet!<eos> As a palate cleanser, of course.<eos> I mean, I'm not insane.<eos> Oh, my God!
Here we go.<eos> That's actually not bad.<eos> You know, it's, like, kind of sweet.<eos> What's happening to him?<eos> This is totally normal.<eos> The nanobots are attacking the narcotics.<eos> How long has he been on heroin?<eos> It was a Ladybug.<eos> - Wait, the sticker?<eos> -Yeah, on the neck.
People are shooting each other.<eos> I'm getting out of here.<eos> Okay. Here's the thing, Soph,<eos> I've seen our future together and I will be the first person to admit that it is fucking insane.<eos> The drugs, the constant partying.<eos> It's enough to make anybody ask, "When is enough enough?"<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just stay with me here.<eos> Just stay with me. Did you change?<eos> Yeah, in so many ways.
They think I know how to find my father.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's my father's life.<eos> What else do you know about him?<eos> Just what I told you.<eos> You must have something.<eos> How old is he?<eos> Seventy two.<eos> Where was he born?<eos> Ukraine.
What else?<eos> Lung cancer.<eos> Last known sighting was in a hospital Seúl, Korea in 2011.<eos> He was engaged in some clinical trials... in something called nanomolecular inhalation therapy<eos> He was stage 3 then.<eos> So, travel will be difficult.<eos> Does he have money?<eos> I think so.<eos> Somewhere warm with advanced medical facilities.<eos> A city.
Does he have money?<eos> I think so.<eos> Somewhere warm with advanced medical facilities.<eos> A city.<eos> Hobbies?<eos> What does he love to do?<eos> Orchids.<eos> He was an expert in orchids.<eos> What languages did he speak, John?<eos> English, Russian, Mandarín and Tamil.

It was too quick. Fire Dept was here too quick.<eos> - Someone called them before the crash.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> It means he was never in that helicopter.<eos> Get them out.<eos> What was your mistake?<eos> I don't make mistakes.<eos> You needed me to know that you were better than me.<eos> Where is he?<eos> On the roof.
Large volumes.<eos> They all sell within minutes of each other.<eos> Just at the soft close, at 13:13 and 13:14.<eos> Timed perfectly when to dump.<eos> What's that?<eos> DAWAI: Bank accounts.<eos> Foreign.<eos> Same place, all three.<eos> Where?<eos> Hong Kong-
Yeah.<eos> Your note said that you know me, but I don't know you.<eos> But that's not really true, is it, Hathaway?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know you.<eos> Ah, you do? (SCOFFS)<eos> Well, that makes one of us.<eos> Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I don't even know who I am.<eos> Where I am.<eos> In what country.
20% is too much, Hathaway.<eos> You talking points?<eos> Well, people die on this planet every day.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Grieve?<eos> Because I knew him?<eos> He's not here anymore.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> Not about money.<eos> Not about zeroes or ones or code.
But to get killed because I'm waiting in line like I'm in freaking Walmart.<eos> That's not why I paid you 65,000 dollars.<eos> Now get me off of here.<eos> That's it.<eos> Plant your feet one at a time.<eos> All right, thanks for coming by. Uh...<eos> Look, Base Camp's, you know, chockablock full this year, so, I think it would all benefit us greatly by coming together like this and, you know, working out some kind of plan and schedule.<eos> What, like some kind of rota?<eos> Yes.<eos> On Everest?
Just so long as you guys are clear.<eos> If you work for me, you use oxygen, otherwise you don't work for me.<eos> You don't have to ask, mate.<eos> I've been up there before without O's, Rob.<eos> I don't need to do it with clients.<eos> All right, next we have to fix ropes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Particularly above the Lhotse Face.<eos> Hillary Step need new fixed rope.<eos> And South-East Ridge as well.
Of course, now I have to reach the seventh.<eos> That's not an answer.<eos> No.<eos> Why any summit?<eos> Doug.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Why?<eos> Come on, tell 'em about the kids. What?<eos> Tell 'em about the kids.<eos> - Whose kids? - Oh...
Ang Dorjee!<eos> Base Camp, do you copy, over?<eos> Helen to Rob, go ahead.<eos> Helen, please.<eos> I need a bottle of gas at the top of the Hillary Step.<eos> I can't get him down without it.<eos> I'm really stuffed.<eos> Understood that you need a bottle of oxygen at the bottom of the Hillary Step.<eos> We are sending it up to you, as soon as we can.<eos> At the top, at the top.
- Just keep your energy, mate.<eos> - Helen.<eos> Once you catch a break, you move, you know the drill.<eos> We've got a stash of oxygen on the South Col.<eos> Whoever needs it can have it.<eos> That's the way, thank you.<eos> Mal's team are gonna go up, they're gonna mount a search as soon as they can.<eos> Anyone who's going, we're gonna leave at dawn, weather permitting.<eos> - Of course, Helen.<eos> At dawn.
- You gotta keep moving.<eos> - Tired.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I'm tired.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Come on.<eos> Slow and steady.<eos> Come on, keep moving.<eos> Yes, I'd like the number of the American Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal.<eos> - Yes, Nepal.
- Hey, Luke.<eos> It's Sophia.<eos> I was wondering if maybe you wanted to hang out sometime - or grab coffee or something.<eos> - No, no. I'm okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I guess I should just let you go, then.<eos> I'm just messing with you, Sophia.<eos> How about dinner?<eos> You mean, like a date?<eos> Yeah, like a date.
You really should eat something.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Is that what Ruth would want?<eos> How do you know about Ruth?<eos> Did you read my letters?<eos> What do you care?<eos> You're done.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> She was a beautiful woman.<eos> In every way.
How do you know about Ruth?<eos> Did you read my letters?<eos> What do you care?<eos> You're done.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> She was a beautiful woman.<eos> In every way.<eos> I can see why they were so precious to you.<eos> I haven't been able to read them for years.<eos> Even with my glasses.
Wow! How mean.<eos> She is right!<eos> - They have in common.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Why us brought this creepy place?<eos> The boy with the 13 times ...<eos> He was here?<eos> he is dead.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> No ... what?
You've had a really shit couple of years.<eos> It's good to see you, though.<eos> Fuckin' life, ey?<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I can't even imagine what it is you must be going through.<eos> It's made me think a lot about my past.<eos> Addressing it, you know...<eos> the things I've done.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about something.<eos> What?
Shit!<eos> Bill!<eos> Peter!<eos> Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Bill!<eos> Son!<eos> Get down!<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> About kids.
- Yes.<eos> I'm you.<eos> What do you mean, you're me?<eos> Toby dumps me.<eos> To prove that I'm better off without him,<eos> I send him photos of me snorkeling a girl.<eos> What time did you steal Toby's computer?<eos> I found out Toby was dead online, ran over, say, 7:30.<eos> What did it look like?<eos> His room?
Like I said, white knight, boring boy scout.<eos> If I was Toby and a girl sent me photos like that, I'd figure it was an invite for a threesome.<eos> Had a lot of threesomes, Moto?<eos> - Regular amount.<eos> - Regular amount is none.<eos> I was a mixed martial arts fighter.<eos> We attract groupies.<eos> Hey, you think that's the reason they attached me to this unit?<eos> I'm the guy you can count on in a fight.<eos> And for threesomes, apparently.
I got nothing.<eos> You got me.<eos> And you've got only a piece of me.<eos> I have to find myself.<eos> For me.<eos> Goodbye, Dom.<eos> -DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE- LOS ANGELES DIVISION<eos> You're disappointed, aren't you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The last arrest.
Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.<eos> How did Buster take the news?<eos> I can't tell him.<eos> If he knew about the baby, he'd stay here with us.<eos> And with all that's going on, you're gonna need him by your side.<eos> Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.<eos> And come home together.<eos> Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Tokyo.
So you all wanted me to break into a police station, fine.<eos> Then you asked me to stop a tank.<eos> I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.<eos> Then you came up with this brilliant idea... to shoot down one of the largest airplanes, ever.<eos> I shot that shit outta the sky... It's nothing.<eos> But this right here, my friend... happens to be the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my life.<eos> I forgot that, you were the only one to bring that plane down.<eos> No, only thing I've ever seen him take down was "No knees" Denise.<eos> Remember?<eos> At prom?
Ears ringing?<eos> No?<eos> Where's my shoe?<eos> It flew off when you crashed.<eos> When you start experiencing any of those things, let me know. Okay?<eos> I don't know whether to thank you for rescuing me... or to kick your ass for throwing me off a cliff.<eos> Thank us or kick our ass, huh?<eos> How about you tell us where that device is?<eos> I mailed it to a friend.<eos> In Abu Dhabi.
But not dressed like that.<eos> What?<eos> Something wrong?<eos> There's a billion things wrong.<eos> But not in this moment.<eos> You look handsome.<eos> I feel awkward.<eos> You and me both.<eos> Seeing you dressed like this... Just reminds me of something.<eos> Of what?

Nicolette, seriously!<eos> I remember once enjoying a rigatoni dish.<eos> So, I'll get that and I'll get the bowties.<eos> And there's shells.<eos> I remember looking across the river at the unblinking lights of Manhattan buildings. Wondering who lived there.<eos> X can be anything, any number, that's what's crazy about X.<eos> I just wanted to enter those spaces and crawl up on the floor and go to sleep.<eos> X doesn't roll like that, X can't be pinned down!<eos> I was part of it now.<eos> On the fifth floor, in a temporary commercial apartment.
Which parties?<eos> Because sometimes I look like I have fat arms.<eos> I like fat arms.<eos> I'm going to help you with this restaurant.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do for you.<eos> We'll take my 43 stacks or dimes and pay back the other investors whatever they're in for thus far.<eos> You got a space already? A lease?<eos> We'll put it up for rent immediately.<eos> It, uh, cool neighborhood?
My royal Lord, you do not give the cheer.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Sweet remembrancer!<eos> Now, good digestion wait on appetite and health on both.<eos> Here had we now our country's honour roofed, were the graced person of our Banquo present,<eos> who may I rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance.<eos> His absence, sir, lays blame upon his promise.<eos> What is't that moves Your Highness?<eos> - Which of you have done this?<eos> - What, my good Lord?
- The shepherd whose father you people killed.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Ask if we can ride inside!<eos> Tell him our grandma is Serbian!<eos> Hex, Serb!<eos> What?<eos> Did you ask?<eos> - What?<eos> The soldiers!<eos> About the ride.
Amen.<eos> How big is the population of Belgrade?<eos> A million... and a half.<eos> Will my schoolteacher be a man or a woman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Will there be many students?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Listen...<eos> In that school, there'll be a lot of kids you don't know.<eos> All sorts... Good and bad.
Deadly.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Ask him.<eos> Are you okey?<eos> Yeah.<eos> -Sure?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Im not going with you guys.<eos> -What?<eos> To Candor.
A peacock crest?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I mean, I'd imagine there is.<eos> But I wouldn't know exactly what's in the box, would I?<eos> I'd better be going.<eos> Your frock.<eos> That's our secret.<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Local girl.<eos> Up on the hill.
You must have your... situation in hand by now.<eos> Besides... Una's inundated.<eos> I came here despite all I heard about you.<eos> Could you take your cardigan off, please?<eos> But no-one's been displeased with your work.<eos> Unlike that... talentless Una.<eos> Don't tell Elsbeth I said that.<eos> Oh, no, never.<eos> It's all very hazy now, but... you left, I seem to remember, when your mother became unwell.<eos> Not... not quite in that order.
I was just joking--<eos> If you had any idea what's been going on with Sonja, then you wouldn't do as you do.<eos> Whatdoyoumean "going on"?<eos> Sonja, please, wh-- what's going on?<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Ah. Ah. What?<eos> Ha.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's, uh--<eos> Really?
I don't think so.<eos> It was all over the radio.<eos> And the TV.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> With Cat.<eos> I was helping him with his boat.<eos> Where?<eos> What do you mean "where"?<eos> At the, um, marina.<eos> Up in Newlake.
Hmm. I'm going to need a couple.<eos> May I ask you something?<eos> You're not from around here.<eos> No,I 'mjust,uh , passing through. Here'smyprivate telephone number.<eos> Icanshow you around.<eos> Iweighedit .<eos> Thirtyfivemillion is all we can carry.<eos> Maybethewoodblocks that were heavier than the money.<eos> It'll all have to be small denominations.<eos> Yeah, and different currencies.
Onewayto beat the competition, huh?<eos> Funny guy, huh?<eos> Policewouldnotdisclose the size of the ransom demanded butitis assumed to be significant.<eos> What?<eos> The ransom note.<eos> What?<eos> The ransom note.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did we leave it?<eos> In the copier?
What do you got?<eos> What have you got?<eos> Come on, think.<eos> Alright, I'm thinking...<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Alright, alright!<eos> I think me and Willem go and we get the money.<eos> Thefiveof us can't stay in this car soWillemandIare going to ditch the car andthenwe dig up the money.<eos> Then I think what, we meet you guys in four hours?<eos> The boatyard. Out at Newlake.
One, two, three, four! Five, six, seven, eight!<eos> Are you okay? I don't know, it just... It just hurts!<eos> Tony, go get ice.<eos> Mary, Mary. Breathe.<eos> Top of section one and two, ready? Where did you learn this?<eos> YouTube!<eos> Three and four! Can I have your attention, please?<eos> I wanted to be the first to tell you that people at the state level have caught wind of what's going on here, and our school has been invited to the state invitational for the first time in seven years!<eos> What? !<eos> With only one condition:
I'm not afraid of anything.<eos> Except maybe love.<eos> Listen to you. You're crazier than your patients!<eos> Am I?<eos> How's it going with Mary?<eos> It's not.<eos> How come?<eos> Because she's nuts, man.<eos> Got all kinds of crazy shit going on.<eos> What kind of shit?

- Oh, no. No, no, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Dang it!<eos> Ay, yeah, this is the one that is always overheating.<eos> It looks like we just need some water and we'll be good to go.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Mrs. Riva... are you concealing a communication device in your chestal area?<eos> My chestal what?
Oh, no.<eos> Dang it!<eos> Ay, yeah, this is the one that is always overheating.<eos> It looks like we just need some water and we'll be good to go.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Mrs. Riva... are you concealing a communication device in your chestal area?<eos> My chestal what?<eos> My boobs?
I lit the mayor's kid on fire.<eos> - It's not funny.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> It's super funny.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess it is a little bit funny.<eos> And I wouldn't care so much, but my father was a very respected man.<eos> And I turned his name into a joke.<eos> He died a few years ago.<eos> In the line of duty.
With a baseball bat, so...<eos> Oh, a 10-41 Apple.<eos> Copy that.<eos> And my other sister, she dated a similar piece of shit.<eos> Maybe call it my hot-button issue, if you like.<eos> I hope you don't have a third sister.<eos> Three felony assaults, plus a history of established behavior... will definitely end you up in more than an ankle monitor.<eos> More like a jumpsuit.<eos> An orange one.<eos> In prison.
Your father would be very proud.<eos> It's time for you to go home and get some sleep.<eos> I can't sleep knowing she might kill somebody or...<eos> This isn't our jurisdiction.<eos> It's the DEA's problem now.<eos> And even if you're right... maybe this is the universe's way of cleaning this up.<eos> - If I could just go there... - That's impossible.<eos> Security'll be too tight.<eos> You know what you should be thinking about?<eos> Your next beat.
That's scary.<eos> Mixer, you have connections in the video business, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> - We'll start there.<eos> It's all improvised but from now on.<eos> We're a band and we have to stick together.<eos> All together!<eos> Fun is fun but where will Red sleep?<eos> Where?<eos> In the best motel in the country.
Polak doesn't care at all if we're the best.<eos> He doesn't get that there is Laser and nobody else for a long, longtime.<eos> Listen, we all pitch in.<eos> I'll organize everything and you just come and play.<eos> I promise you won't regret it.<eos> - Why is this one so sad?<eos> - A faulty injection mould.<eos> - I told you to change it.<eos> - But the whole bunch was already made.<eos> - Morning.

We ask a fireman.<eos> So far we weren't able to confirm anything.<eos> We didn't find a body and chances of survival in such temperatures are small.<eos> Plus the current is so strong that we don't know where to look.<eos> What a tragedy.<eos> Rogers Cool VWlson.<eos> Once there was Pavarotti and now it's them.<eos> Tomorrow night. Atomic, Gensonina, Laser<eos> - Oh fuck, he replaced us.<eos> On the desert at dawn.

Atomic, Gensonina, Laser<eos> - Oh fuck, he replaced us.<eos> On the desert at dawn.<eos> They will have guards at the from. But here, here and here should be clear.<eos> The only condition is that we go in separately.<eos> Like in the movies.
I'm Austé<eos> Sangailé<eos> Thanks I work all summer at the power plant canteen<eos> Come by to get a coffee<eos> Hello<eos> A comet in the snow<eos> The teaspooni<eos> Thank you<eos> Do you live far away?<eos> In Vilnius
I don't know where they are.<eos> Maybe ... these drawers.<eos> I don't know, maybe... in the kitchen, let's see.<eos> The drawers...<eos> It's strange.<eos> If you can't find one, I'll be by again.<eos> Wait a moment!<eos> Probably...<eos> My mother...<eos> On the refrigerator.
Today, audiences ask us for a different commitment, films which are not just entertainment, but which affect our reality.<eos> That's why the task of cinema is to give voice...<eos> Yes, sure, the task of cinema!<eos> Why have I been saying the same things for years?<eos> Everyone thinks I can understand what's happening, interpret reality, but I don't understand a thing anymore.<eos> - She refuses to go to the hospital.<eos> - Refuses?<eos> She can't, it's already been decided.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - In her room.
You see, the domain of a man's upper lip is his sovereign ground...<eos> - Every Mortdecai man before me had the same.<eos> Why can't I?<eos> Oh, I happen to be terribly fond of it, and I have had every intention of seeing it through.<eos> You mean it's going to get bigger?<eos> It will come to fruition, yes.<eos> Oh, darling...<eos> You really won't shave it off?<eos> I can't, my duck.<eos> Not at this juncture.
Every subject of the Crown and every cashew in the Kingdom shall sleep safely.<eos> Johanna, you look lovely.<eos> Alastair.<eos> You do look lovely, darling.<eos> So absolutely lovely.<eos> - I thought that was you.<eos> - Radiant...<eos> Martland also met Johanna at school.<eos> After a three-year courtship, he finally worked up the courage to express his feelings to her.<eos> In verse.
If you are growing that excrement on your lip to please another, know this: I will kill her.<eos> Oh, Alastair.<eos> It's so lovely.<eos> Do come back.<eos> It's so wonderful to have someone of reasonable intelligence to converse with.<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> Do I detect a slight crack in the marital armor?<eos> A mere tiff, old bean.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Oh, really?
- Maybe I should have an affair.<eos> - Wouldn't that be funny?<eos> - Hilarious.<eos> - Do you think I could keep it a secret?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Well then, what's the point?<eos> Now, tell me, what are you and my husband working on at the moment?<eos> Well, in vague terms there's a very bad man who wants what I want, and I'm trying to stop him.<eos> And what does a missing Goya have to do with national security?<eos> In vague terms.
You remember this?<eos> - What is it?<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> - In my wallet.<eos> - Who took it?<eos> - I did.<eos> I don't remember you ever being in my bedroom.<eos> I wasn't in your bedroom, silly.<eos> I was outside.<eos> In a tree.
- We met in a pub.<eos> - But it was a lovely romantic pub.<eos> It was a Yates's Wine Lodge.<eos> Do you remember the first thing you ever said to me?<eos> - "Vodka and tonic, please."<eos> - And I said?<eos> "Pint or a half?"<eos> What is the worst-case scenario?<eos> - We never see her again.<eos> - Alright, second worst?
- Alright, second worst?<eos> - You hungry?<eos> - No.<eos> - Little snackette?<eos> - No, don't need it.<eos> So... how long have you two been seeing each other?<eos> - Not long.<eos> - Not long at all.<eos> How did you meet?<eos> - At work.
- You hungry?<eos> - No.<eos> - Little snackette?<eos> - No, don't need it.<eos> So... how long have you two been seeing each other?<eos> - Not long.<eos> - Not long at all.<eos> How did you meet?<eos> - At work.<eos> - At a party.
- Sorry. Old habit.<eos> Everybody knew they were doing it.<eos> Nobody told me.<eos> It's rough.<eos> I'll admit it's rough.<eos> I was really traditional about the whole "don't sleep around when you're married" thing.<eos> Hands-arse.<eos> That's right.<eos> I bet you proposed on the top of a Tuscan hill.<eos> Cephalonian, actually.
When you get married, you make a promise you can't keep, but, by God, I was gonna try, and I'll never regret that.<eos> Which is more than you can say, sat up there on your single perch with all your judgements.<eos> Why-y-y-y-y don't you use it<eos> Try-y-y-y-y not to bruise it<eos> Buy-y-y-y-y time, don't lose it<eos> They're not judgements, they're theories.<eos> - Very different things.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - You know your problem, Nancy?<eos> - What?
- Oh, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You need to man up.<eos> I married that woman and she tore out my heart but I'm still standing.<eos> I'm still putting myself out there.<eos> And who are you to say that my marriage was doomed?<eos> Who are you to say that the girl I met tonight, the girl I was supposed to meet tonight, wasn't the girl of my dreams?<eos> You need to let me get on with my sad single-man life crisis and keep your cynical wisecracks and theories to yourself.<eos> Why-y-y-y<eos> Why-y-y-y Why-y-y-y
Oh, that is perfect.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> All right, got it.<eos> Hold that real quick.<eos> All right, man.<eos> Wait, don't you want this?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> What if you lose that thing or it breaks?<eos> It's already up in the cloud.<eos> What cloud?
Hey, wait! Let me warm up real quick.<eos> You made it.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you said it was close.<eos> Not that close.<eos> This is Frankford.<eos> Tough place.<eos> You wanna be a Philly fighter, this is the place to go.<eos> Philly fighters, you know, I think they're the toughest guys in the world.<eos> In a lot of ways.
Um...<eos> I just was feeling a little weird about...<eos> ...some of the stuff, and I think the intel... on Rayna's location seems a little too easy.<eos> I just...<eos> Something doesn't feel right.<eos> It'll be right when we get Rayna behind bars and that nuke back in our hands.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know. All my alarm bells are going off with this one.<eos> Really?
Looks like they put you up in The Shitz-Carlton.<eos> Try and get some sleep... and we'll get started first thing in the morning.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do when I see that Rayna woman.<eos> I want her dead for what she did to Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You're not gonna get anywhere near her... so there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Really?
It sounds romantic.<eos> I hope you get lucky!<eos> God damn it, if I was trying to sound romantic... you'd be lying on the floor, soaking wet and breathless... wondering what came over you.<eos> But I'm not, so get the fuck out of my way!<eos> I need you to rein it in, buddy, okay?<eos> If you take out De Luca, we don't have a shot at getting Rayna.<eos> So take it down, like, 5,000 notches!<eos> Take it down?<eos> That's how you get polonium-210 slipped into your drink... and go 18 months in intensive care for radiation poisoning... and go six months without eyesight... while everybody you've ever loved is gunned down!<eos> Really?
I did get upgraded to premium economy once... which was pretty plush.<eos> Premium economy.<eos> Sounds like a pen for dirty animals.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> But it was not quite like this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> Can't just be because I remind you of some sad Bulgarian clown.<eos> You remind me of my mother. Oh.<eos> Really?
I'm gonna go to De Luca's and back up Fine.<eos> You know where the villa is?<eos> I know everything.<eos> One day, lady super spy...<eos> Susan Cooper...<eos> I will fuck you. ♪ The danger is I'm dangerous<eos> ♪ And I might just tear you apart<eos> I love this new car smell.<eos> Really nice.<eos> Oh. Mmm.
All right, motherfucker, don't push.<eos> You're gonna get your pictures.<eos> There's enough 50 to go around.<eos> You know I just helped kill a terrorist, right?<eos> You ever see Kanye do some shit like that?<eos> He never, never!<eos> Isn't this wonderful?<eos> I was hoping to spend the rest of my life in jail.<eos> Give me some quality time to deal with the fact... that I was sleeping with the man who killed my father.<eos> Anyway.
He's got a wife called Betsy and I think you two should talk.<eos> - What are you talking about? - Just call her.<eos> Hello?<eos> Erm, Betsy Andreu?<eos> Speaking. Hi, my name is David Walsh.<eos> You're the guy who writes about Lance?<eos> Well, I write about other things, too.<eos> - Yeah, Lance. OK.<eos> I was there. You were where? In the room.<eos> In what room?
Nope.<eos> Let me tell you a story about where I come from.<eos> It's a magical place of sunshine, sing-a-longs and s'mores.<eos> And of course, obstacle courses.<eos> That place sounds fun.<eos> Oh it's fun, Ted.<eos> Fun, fun, fun, 'til his buddies took his penis away.<eos> Oh my God it's you...<eos> Jeff.<eos> In the flesh.
You're not gonna make me shit out of my mouth, right?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> Here get on the bed.<eos> Get on all fours.<eos> JustlikeIusedtodo withmygrandpa.<eos> Now, faceplant.<eos> Now I'm gonna raise up that a little.<eos> Now am I going to feel a little prick?<eos> God, I can't believe you talked me into this shit.<eos> Oh, God.
Sorry, he just gets a little protective of me.<eos> There's a lot of creeps out there.<eos> Yeah, there sure are.<eos> They seem like good guys.<eos> But uh, why don't we just go back to my house for Hulu and tacos?<eos> I'm so tired. I'm just gonna head home.<eos> No.<eos> You are in no condition to drive, young lady.<eos> Why don't you just spend the night on my couch or, in my bed again.<eos> Head to toe.
I can't be a doctor.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> I'm gonna do it right in front of your face.<eos> I'm gonna chug 15 beers right now.<eos> Oh, that's so cold.<eos> Beer's cold.<eos> Instant rebuff.<eos> Just leave me here.<eos> Okay, guys, here we go.<eos> Almost there! Almost there!
You play football, right?<eos> -Yes. How was the game today?<eos> It was alright. Tough, but we won.<eos> Did you score?<eos> No, I'm one of the goalkeepers.<eos> How long have you been in Iceland?<eos> -About three months.<eos> Do you have a boyfriend here?<eos> -No, not really.<eos> How about in Brazil?
Hey, listen, when do you have to re-register for the rape thing?<eos> I can't stay anywhere longer than two weeks.<eos> Okay. 'Cause obviously, you know, with the kids and the neighbors and Violet's party...<eos> Wait, that's my party, too, buddy.<eos> I'm gonna be a big boy this year.<eos> All right?<eos> - I know.<eos> - Don't worry, don't worry.<eos> Two weeks and I'll be staying in a hostel.<eos> Not a youth hostel.
Okay.<eos> Hey, listen, you had mentioned before, you know, something about Facebooking Dusty.<eos> You're Facebook friends with her?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Okay, what does that mean?<eos> Technically, she blocked me.<eos> What do you mean, technically?<eos> Well, I may have recently hack friended her.<eos> Okay, does that mean that you can see her page or...<eos> Theoretically, yes.
No, way ahead of you there, buddy.<eos> She is definitely alive.<eos> - I was way off on that one.<eos> - Okay. All right.<eos> Are there any status updates or, you know?<eos> Just says, "Went on my honeymoon, off the grid for two weeks."<eos> What?<eos> I think she may have taken those coupons and gone on your honeymoon without you.<eos> Jesus Christ, why do you know about the coupons?<eos> - What coupons?
Jose's band and Gabe's old band, actually.<eos> Erstwhile!<eos> - What?<eos> - I prefer erstwhile.<eos> All right, so without any further ado, the erstwhile line up of Jose and the Borges.<eos> Yay, Daddy!<eos> Thank you, Kate.<eos> This is dedicated to your couch.<eos> When was the last time you smoked a joint at a children's birthday party?<eos> August.
No, I...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, no, I've seen plenty of movies.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I can hear you fine.<eos> I don't know why I can, but I can, seriously.<eos> You get better service in Mexico.<eos> Yeah, Mexico.
But it was still looking at you?<eos> Blind eyes.<eos> Have you tried... talking to it?<eos> Well, I would suggest that... we... we raise your dosage to 1.5 pills per night.<eos> You should keep on writing down your dreams and... Next time, why don't you try... talking to that 'creature', as you call it.<eos> What should I say?<eos> Imagine... you're on a train, and a stranger keeps staring at you.<eos> On the train?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Or at a bus stop, for example.
I don't care!<eos> How many?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How many girls have you slept with?<eos> I've slept with three women.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I have slept with three women, too.<eos> How many guys?<eos> What, this year?<eos> This year?
No.<eos> Made sure of that, didn't he?<eos> Where's the hire sansho?<eos> The prickly ash.<eos> If it's not there, I'm sure I don't know.<eos> - Did you throw it out?<eos> - Why would I do that?<eos> For spite and malice.<eos> Where'd you get words like that?<eos> The dictionary.
She can barely read!<eos> Go after her.<eos> Apologise for saying things that were meant to hurt.<eos> You were cruel!<eos> If you don't apologise, you will regret it.<eos> - People always say that.<eos> - Because it's true.<eos> Moi, je regrette tellement.<eos> - You regret...<eos> - So much!
Scored high marks, got assigned to a Bristol Blenheim, Mark IV.<eos> Blown out of the sky.<eos> First time up.<eos> All his mates who worked the motor pool came home without a scratch.<eos> I shouldn't have said what I said.<eos> Lesson there, then.<eos> Don't say everything you think.<eos> Look.<eos> - How did you find that?<eos> - In your desk.
He would have stolen our food.<eos> Mouse can have my food, I'm not hungry.<eos> He would've brought in germs, bit us in our sleep.<eos> Mouse is my friend...<eos> And you splatted him dead.<eos> No I didn't, he's hunky-dory.<eos> - Are you tricking me?<eos> - No, Jack, I swear.<eos> He's safe at home in the backyard with his Ma.<eos> What backyard?
Jack, there is two sides to everything.<eos> Not in octagon.<eos> Yeah...<eos> - But...<eos> - An octagon has eight sides.<eos> But a wall, ok?<eos> A wall is like this.<eos> See, we're on the inside... the mouse is on the outside.<eos> - In outer space?<eos> - No, in the world.
I want to be four again.<eos> Do you remember how...<eos> Do you remember how Alice wasn't always in Wonderland?<eos> She fell down, down down deep in the hole.<eos> Well, I wasn't always in room, I'm like Alice.<eos> I was a little girl named Joy.<eos> Nah...<eos> And I lived in a house with my mom and my dad.<eos> You would called them Grandma and Grandpa.<eos> What house?
Ma!<eos> Open the door. Open!<eos> - Jack! Where have you been?<eos> - Ma, I'm in the world!<eos> Ma!<eos> Can we go to bed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'll take us somewhere to sleep soon.<eos> No, but bed...<eos> In Room.
Can we go to bed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'll take us somewhere to sleep soon.<eos> No, but bed...<eos> In Room.<eos> Ma, Maa!<eos> Good morning, sleepyhead.<eos> I was waiting so long for you to wake up I fell asleep again.<eos> Are we on another planet?<eos> Same one, just the different spot.
- This, that's you.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> And Stacy Benton.<eos> And Heather Noel and Laura Sullivan.<eos> We were on the relay team.<eos> I was the anchor.<eos> I was really fast.<eos> We did track.<eos> Real track?<eos> On a field.
Yar, without organized religion, I've lost me moral compass.<eos> Also I've, uh, I've been addicted to Oxy for a while now... yar.<eos> Now, this is what I have got in mind.<eos> I will whisper even though we are alone.<eos> All right, people, Marge has brought this heathen to aid us in our time of need.<eos> Please do not call me a heathen.<eos> It offends Hanuman, the monkey-headed lord of winds, who believed the sun to be a ripe mango...<eos> Okay, I get it, I get why you say it.<eos> Apu thinks we can get the money at the casino playing blackjack.<eos> The casino? !
Okay, but if I'm sleepy at work tomorrow, I get to tell everyone why.<eos> Oh, boy, oh, boy. 1:00 a.m. loving and 2:00 a.m. steak?<eos> Night-marriage rules!<eos> I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, the revue.<eos> Oh, I got so many questions.<eos> What are the skits about?<eos> Uh, pop culture and current events.
Eddie, they're all actors and writers and directors, just like us.<eos> They're Nazis. They're just too cheap to buy the uniforms.<eos> They invited Congress out here.<eos> And are they all Sam Woods and Hedda Hoppers?<eos> Please, let's not demonize people we don't really know.<eos> I say we go for it.<eos> And you know who you're gonna be talking to there, don't you?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Wayne.<eos> I wanna say one thing about a place I love.<eos> No, not Hollywood.
- Oh, yes.<eos> Those were his exact words.<eos> Be in touch.<eos> Very well.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> You too.<eos> I suppose he wants you back.<eos> Well, no.<eos> No, no. He... He just stopped by to talk about a screen credit.<eos> On Spartacus?
But he's still hungry!<eos> You think I'm out of my mind?<eos> ...but you are so too, if you run, so jump!<eos> The mother of life!<eos> The elixir of live!<eos> What's an elixir?<eos> A magic potion!<eos> Cure and toxic, Mother and father, life and death. All in one.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, hey hey, hey dwarf!
That's an awful lot of blood.<eos> I'm guessing you missed your femoral artery, because, frankly, you'd be dead by now if you hadn't.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> But God knows what other damage you've done.<eos> Doesn't look good.<eos> Now, I'd love to stay and chat, but I gotta get going.<eos> I wouldn't want you to think that I was being unfair.<eos> So I'm gonna give you the same chance that you gave me.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what you said.<eos> About fate.
In 1944, the Soviet army appeared on the borders of Estonia.<eos> The gate was open.<eos> In the courtyard stood a truck.<eos> Father, mother and Kadri was made ? into a truck. As it's the most normal thing in the world.<eos> 27 th July Line Sinimad-Tannenberg<eos> What happened to them?<eos> They sent them to Siberia.<eos> Could not you have something to preduzmeš?<eos> -Treci Online!<eos> Saaresto on the phone!
She does not have them.<eos> What is it called?<eos> -Erik.<eos> No lower part? -No.<eos> -Donji Part, bottom part ...<eos> Here's the bottom part.<eos> Get away!<eos> -Nosi Up!<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Nothing.
Let me know.<eos> ~ I'm sure he's fine. ~ Yeah.<eos> What, does he not like being at home now?<eos> ~ They're really busy, him and Nige.<eos> ~ 'Joseph Miller was remanded back into custody after pleading not guilty here at Wessex Crown Court to the murder of 11-year-old Daniel Latimer, whose body was found on the beach at Broadchurch, in Dorset.<eos> Sharon Bishop, QC, representing Mr Miller, tonight maintained her client's innocence.'<eos> ~ No. No, don't. ~ Mr Miller vehemently denies the charge against him and is looking forward to defending himself in a court of law.<eos> ~ That's really not fair.<eos> ~ '.. from here at Wessex Crown Court.<eos> Now to the studio.'
~ Knowing the truth and getting justice isn't the same thing.<eos> ~ We understand that.<eos> No, you really don't.<eos> Not if you've never been through this.<eos> I'll need to know everything about you, everything about Danny, everything about the Millers.<eos> Nothing will stay hidden.<eos> Joe Miller has got a tough defence team.<eos> They'll move fast and fight dirty.<eos> ~ In fact, they already are.<eos> ~ In what way?
I'm really sorry.<eos> I got super depressed after we broke up, and, uh... my schoolwork sort of started to slip and I got cut from NYADA.<eos> What?<eos> Uh... when are you gonna go back to New York?<eos> I think I'm going to take a little break.<eos> I wanted to be home, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I moved in back with my parents.<eos> And I-I got a job.<eos> At Dalton.
- You're very funny, Mr. Draper.<eos> Give me Tricia's number.<eos> So glad you could make it.<eos> They canceled everything, so it seemed to be fate.<eos> You look ravishing.<eos> I feel a little underdressed.<eos> Where were you tonight?<eos> No, it's true.<eos> On every single flight, there's always one blanket completely soaked in urine.<eos> - In first class? - Oh, yes.
You're shameless, you know that? Do I have a lunch today?<eos> No, but you have a busy afternoon.<eos> I scheduled a meeting next Monday with Mr. Rosenthal at Menken's Department Store.<eos> Mrs. Katz didn't want to meet?<eos> Well, it was a very awkward conversation because apparently she stepped down a few months ago and passed away last week.<eos> What?<eos> Rachel Katz?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you that.<eos> Last week?
I mean, eventually, but stepped out in smaller increments to stay under that top tax threshold.<eos> I'll have to buy an apartment building to keep any of it, and then I've got to be a landlord.<eos> Sounds like a real pain in the ass.<eos> Look, I was caught by surprise, but I didn't know your history with McCann.<eos> What did you do over there?<eos> I never fit in.<eos> I'm not Irish.<eos> I'm not Catholic. I can read.<eos> (LAUGHING) It's good you're playing ball, or you'd have no future.<eos> In advertising, maybe.
~ Where is he?<eos> ~ He's gone back to Bruton Street.<eos> Bruton Street?<eos> Our Lucas will fetch him.<eos> They'll have him here by tomorrow.<eos> ~ ..<eos> Lucas!<eos> ~ No! No, no, no, no.<eos> He's gone to visit an uncle in Chatham.<eos> ~ Where in Chatham?
Which man?<eos> He was the book of the Raven King.<eos> He said... my fortune was written on his body.<eos> ~ And the fortune of your masters.<eos> ~ Vinculus.<eos> I helped hang him.<eos> ~ Where did you hang him?<eos> ~ Huh?<eos> WHERE did you hang him?<eos> In a ravine, not far from here.
- Your Majesty...<eos> - Yes?<eos> You can't imagine how the modesty of this young virgin is being put to the test by your offer.<eos> I...<eos> All my heart's aflutter.<eos> I feel faint.<eos> But all I can promise you today is this: come back in a week's time and I will give you a part of me that alone illustrates my beauty.<eos> Which part of your body will you grant me?<eos> A finger, Your Majesty.<eos> A finger?
Any word from Forensics?<eos> They picked up your friend's body about an hour ago.<eos> They said they should have results back by tomorrow morning.<eos> His wife says he killed himself.<eos> Now, Mr. Burke, I know that you think that nothing seems to make sense in this town, but one very important detail you haven't mentioned is that you were in a big-time accident with a very large semi,<eos> the doctors found bleeding on your brain, they wanted to drain the blood, but you fled the hospital.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Is the body in the morgue yet?<eos> Sure is.<eos> In the hospital.
Our goal was to conduct unbiased, empirical research on exceptional human abilities.<eos> Psychokinesis, ESP, precognition. Things that are typically considered fringe science or parapsychology.<eos> Dr. West, and the rest of us, quite frankly, all believed that there was real science to be discovered in these areas.<eos> We had a good time doing what we were doing.<eos> We were underfunded, of course, but we were still relatively young, so it didn't matter.<eos> In the first few years alone, we published close to 30 journal articles between us.<eos> And there were some truly exceptional cases.<eos> All documented.<eos> Well, we did a lot of different kinds of tests, but... probably the most effective one to measure clairvoyant abilities were the Zener cards.<eos> This one?
Back then, it was different than it is now.<eos> Now everyone has a therapist.<eos> They go for anything... stubbed toe.<eos> But back then, you went if it was something bad.<eos> And especially if medication was involved.<eos> And in my husband's case, it was.<eos> - Why do you say that, Henry? - You don't understand.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I see what's happening.<eos> - At work?
It was so difficult.<eos> She knew... too much.<eos> Think of any object.<eos> - Something in the room? - No, it doesn't have to be.<eos> No, let's make it something not in the room.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Draw what you see, please.<eos> - And what object were you thinking of?<eos> - A hammer.
- Yeah?<eos> -Come here, I want to talk to you.<eos> -Anne got it all wrong.<eos> I told her she didn't know anything about my private life, not that I was dating a married man.<eos> -Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.<eos> -You believe me just like that?<eos> -Of course I believe you.<eos> You never lie.<eos> -You know it's time for you to start thinking about what you want.<eos> -What?
-Has Karen found a job?<eos> -Oh, not yet. It's hard with two kids.<eos> I said I'd take care of them, but she is a good mother.<eos> She wants to be with them.<eos> -What about Bobby?<eos> -Well, he can't take a job while he's trying to raise money to open his own repair shop.<eos> It takes all his energy.<eos> But at least they are a happy couple and that's the most important thing.<eos> How's Jenny?<eos> -Jenny's fine.
-No.<eos> -Imayhavegrownup in a trailer park, Bryce butI 'mwarningyou ifI don'tget Worthing divorcer in the everyonewillknow about your past.<eos> -Hello?<eos> -Anne. What're you doing here?<eos> -Are you busy?<eos> -No, just ironing.<eos> Camilla told Bryce if she doesn't get Worthington Manor in the divorce settlement, she'll expose his past.<eos> -I saw Jenny this morning.<eos> -Oh,yeah.<eos> Where? -Nordstrom.

Okay, why don't I start it with the title, and then you can just segue into the theme.<eos> Or I could start with the title, and then we could both segue into the theme.<eos> Welcome, everyone, to our very first Glee Club rehearsal.<eos> First, I would like to welcome back our distinguished alumni who have so graciously agreed to stay an extra week.<eos> So, thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> Yeah, how exactly are you guys doing that?<eos> Oh, I can bend time and space with my mind.<eos> Okay, so, as you very well have heard, the glee club has a grand and glorious tradition of starting each week with a lesson where we explore every musical genre under the sun.<eos> But mostly Katy Perry and show tunes.<eos> Not this week.
These rotten tomatoes are getting restless.<eos> Great.<eos> Appreciate her, too.<eos> A good nemesis only makes you better.<eos> Break a leg.<eos> Well, that can't be good.<eos> Okay, you ready for this?<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Oh! Okay.
- Hi.<eos> - Where were you? - It's a long story.<eos> - You changed the set list?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> We got Kitty.<eos> And Spencer?<eos> Yeah, well, that was thanks to Sam.<eos> ♪ That's all I wanted ♪<eos> ♪ Something special, something sacred ♪<eos> ♪ In your eyes ♪
Where are you from, Ben?<eos> Seattle.<eos> And where do you live?<eos> Seattle.<eos> And where is home, Ben?<eos> Do you need me to repeat the question?<eos> I already told you where I live.<eos> I didn't ask you where you live.<eos> I asked, "Where is home?"<eos> Seattle.
The school...<eos> very dedicated.<eos> It's all about shaping the mind of the child.<eos> Your wife is a teacher at that school?<eos> Yes.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Everyone raves about the buffalo burger, but if you ask me, the trout is sublime.<eos> Buffalo burger.<eos> So, how does everybody feel about the, public executions?<eos> What?
Why...why Switzerland, Maestro?<eos> Well, it's close to Italy, and after London and New York I was director at the Venice orchestra.<eos> - Of course!<eos> - For twenty-four years.<eos> Silly of me!<eos> And are you still directing or composing, Maestro?<eos> No. I'm retired.<eos> Maestro, as I indicated you In my letter, I work For the Ceremonies and Events Office at Buckingham Palace.<eos> - You work for the Queen?<eos> - In a sense, yes.
No. I'm retired.<eos> Maestro, as I indicated you In my letter, I work For the Ceremonies and Events Office at Buckingham Palace.<eos> - You work for the Queen?<eos> - In a sense, yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I find monarchies so endearing.<eos> If I may, Maestro... Why exactly do you find the monarchy endearing?<eos> Well, because it's so vulnerable.<eos> You eliminate one person And all of a sudden The whole world changes.<eos> Like in a marriage.
- There is only one thing I still remember.<eos> The precise moment when I learned to ride a bike.<eos> And this morning... As if by magic...<eos> I remembered the moment right after...<eos> When you fell off?<eos> - How the fuck did you know?<eos> - Well, that happens to everybody.<eos> You learn something, you're happy and then...you forget to brake.<eos> - How is the work on the role going?<eos> - Pretty well.
Is it the orchestra?<eos> Is it the soprano?<eos> Is it the Queen?<eos> Please don't insist.<eos> Personal reasons.<eos> But what are these bloody "personal reasons"?<eos> "Personal" means I am not obliged to answer.<eos> Let's see if we can resolve these personal problems. I mean...<eos> What is it that's wrong?<eos> The soprano.
You read Novalis?<eos> Even actors from California when they're not getting drunk and snorting coke and hanging out with anorexic models occasionally read Novalis.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just an old man with prejudices.<eos> And what does Novalis say?<eos> "I'm always going home."<eos> "Always going to my father's house."<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> The future.
Come on, man. Come on, baby, you know I got you, right?<eos> -Okay.<eos> -I got you.<eos> You're my nigga-nigga-noga.<eos> You know that shit, right?<eos> All right. Yeah.<eos> All right, right. Now go open up your trunk.<eos> -Oh, okay, all right.<eos> -It's all cool.<eos> Casual like, no big d.
Crazy is as crazy does and you dragged crazy here.<eos> And I don't even know what that does or what that is.<eos> You see what I'm saying?<eos> I don't know, rose. We just thought it would be, like, safer here.<eos> Safer from what?<eos> Wait, why do you think it's dangerous?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Like I said to you before because of the...<eos> The what?<eos> The monkeys.
And you turned on the lights and gave their biggest boogeyman a name.<eos> What's happening now, what you think they're doing to you, that's nothing.<eos> I've done my own research on this NFL Brain Injury Committee.<eos> You know what Dr Elliot Pellman is?<eos> He's a rheumatologist.<eos> He's a specialist in arthritis and joint pain.<eos> Can you tell me what a rheumatologist knows about the brain and brain disease?<eos> Corporate men like this, in this country, usually go to Harvard or Yale.<eos> He went to medical school in Guadalajara.<eos> - Mexico?
Convince them, Julian.<eos> You know, my father can't remember a goddamn thing.<eos> He never played a day of football.<eos> He was too busy working in a factory, you quack!<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You take your bullshit science, go back to Africa.<eos> And get away from our game!<eos> What happened?<eos> Roger Goodell just said that... Justin Strzelczyk may have gotten his concussion swimming.<eos> In a swimming pool.
Then I will get another job in another city.<eos> That would be fine.<eos> That would be fine.<eos> " Bennet. "<eos> all I asked is that if you did this, we both came out okay.<eos> Not professional ruination.<eos> Whoever...<eos> Whatever takes over for me, they're going to want the CTE information, you know that.<eos> What if they show up here with a warrant?<eos> On suspicion of what?

Authorities still can't say for sure how far toxic contamination from an abandoned weapons facility several stories underground has spread beyond the blast site.<eos> Over 5 square miles of the city is now a quarantine zone.<eos> Everyone still living within the area has been forcibly evacuated.<eos> We are continuing to get reports that more and more people are leaving.<eos> They can't tell us who did it.<eos> They can't tell us why.<eos> I've got friends and neighbors who've already left, and I'm thinking we should do the same.<eos> Something is being kept from us.<eos> Who was responsible?<eos> ♪ And overnight ♪
Well, a couple of my crew.<eos> We do odd bits for the Silver Streets from time to time.<eos> Dickie thinks my lads are too stupid to know what he's talking about.<eos> Okay.<eos> This one's a pass.<eos> But next time.<eos> What?<eos> What about my stash?<eos> Go get Dickie.<eos> So...
Move it out!<eos> You have reached the voicemail of...<eos> Jonas Flack.<eos> Please leave your message after the tone.<eos> Hi. Not sure why I keep calling.<eos> Miss the sound of your voice, I suppose.<eos> Jonas.<eos> We need to talk about your boyfriend.<eos> I know where Jonas is.<eos> In the Quarantine Zone.
! I need you to calm down.<eos> Jonas!<eos> I want to see Jonas.<eos> Jennifer, you need to calm down.<eos> Don't tell me...<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm down and listen to me.<eos> We need to know more about those things that you've seen.<eos> The things you write about.<eos> Your blog.
I'm a secretary.<eos> Daniel worked downstairs in Legal.<eos> I didn't know him very well.<eos> But he was always nice, you know?<eos> But it's hard to meet people in the city, so I asked him if he would have a drink with me.<eos> You asked him?<eos> Like I said, he was a nice guy.<eos> We met at the Three Roads bar, on 49th Street.<eos> We had a few drinks, and the next thing that I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment covered in blood.<eos> His blood.
Okay.<eos> Here's what I don't understand.<eos> I'm the man in charge of the pension funds and I find out one of my secretaries has discovered my illicit activity.<eos> To make matters worse, she's now telling people about said activity.<eos> Which, obviously, I can't have.<eos> So I decide to take action.<eos> But why don't I kill you?<eos> They tried.<eos> Yeah, the second time.<eos> In the jail.
You know, not recently.<eos> But all the necessary paperwork is in order should an orphan perish in a fall.<eos> Now get up there!<eos> And while you're aloft and closer to our Lord, you may reflect on your festering souls.<eos> Your souls that fester as do the leaves.<eos> See!<eos> I was right!<eos> She's hoarding all the rations.<eos> Where's she hiding all the grub?<eos> Her office.
They have an ancient prophecy from when the fairy kingdoms reigned on this island.<eos> The prophecy tells of a boy born of the love between a fairy prince and a human girl.<eos> A boy who would be disappeared from this world until he was old enough to return and lead an uprising against me.<eos> A boy, so says the prophecy, who could fly.<eos> Have you come to kill me, Peter?<eos> I don't believe in bedtime stories.<eos> "Me...<eos> Me.<eos> I promise that you will see me again, in this world or another.<eos> "Or another."

That's a bad man down there.<eos> And them cartel dudes we're in business with are even worse.<eos> Do you want a front row seat at a couple more family funerals?<eos> That's right.<eos> Stack knows where you live.<eos> Things go wrong, you think he'll be shy about telling those guys who's responsible?<eos> Your mom and dad are family to me, Justin.<eos> So do us all a favor and keep your mouth shut.<eos> Did Kyle know about your business?<eos> My business.
So here's to your last night in Boston.<eos> I know this trip hasn't been easy, but I couldn't be more grateful for what you're doing.<eos> I owe you big time.<eos> Hey, what are illegitimate half sisters for?<eos> (Chuckles) Crazy that this is what had to bring us together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sort of bummed I have to go back to Florida tomorrow.<eos> Really?<eos> God yes. There are so many cute guys here.<eos> Case in point.
Didn't you say that I was too selfish to do something like this?<eos> Guess we're both full of surprises.<eos> So, how long are you grounded?<eos> I'm only allowed to go to work until school starts.<eos> Where do you work?<eos> Wait.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Hot topic?<eos> Actually, I work at a tattoo parlor called Alchemy.<eos> In the south end.
He was getting text messages when we were at the hospital yesterday.<eos> Oh, I'm fine.<eos> The doctor's like 99% sure it's nothing, so...<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I guess that's somewhat reassuring.<eos> - Somewhat?<eos> - Graham...<eos> I'm just saying, statistically speaking, 1% is only helpful in understanding the likelihood that something will happen.<eos> If you're the 1% that it happens to, then for you, the cancer's totally 100% back.<eos> - In theory.
What do you think is keeping you from believing?<eos> Honestly, I've never really been much of a believer.<eos> And then, you know, I spent all that time in the hospital going through chemo and...<eos> Just never found God.<eos> I looked, but, um...<eos> I even went to the chapel once.<eos> But yeah, he wasn't there.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Was anybody there for you?<eos> At the chapel?
And you seem nice.<eos> A little quirky, but so am I.<eos> So how do you know my Dom?<eos> Hmm. And then we were on this break and I slept with a guy from my support group.<eos> - Hmm... - One time.<eos> One time. I mean, okay...<eos> One time then.<eos> A few times since.<eos> Just...<eos> Anyway...
I couldn't bring myself...<eos> To tell him I'm a criminal.<eos> So I lied to him.<eos> I lied to my son.<eos> And that's actually the thing I regret the most.<eos> And that's the thing he hasn't forgiven me for.<eos> But...<eos> All you can do is keep showing up, ready to be forgiven, and hope that one day he'll be ready too.<eos> Wow, you are just so peaceful...<eos> About everything.
That rhymes.<eos> Wait, does it?<eos> You can't go home like this.<eos> No, I just... I just need to lie down for like one second.<eos> Just a quick little...<eos> Come with me.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> My place.<eos> I remember this place.<eos> Oh my God.
Okay?<eos> If we're gonna share this office, I need some respect, too.<eos> Okay, if we're talking about respect, would you please ask your clients not to stand outside my door and talk.<eos> It's very distracting.<eos> Well, they stand there because there's only two chairs in our waiting room.<eos> And there are more than two people trying to gain citizenship to this country, but, yeah, sure, I'll tell them to keep it down.<eos> I mean, you need to focus while you're advising your clients on whether to serve red or green grapes at their next yacht party.<eos> Sorry.<eos> (Sighs) Where were we?<eos> My shirt.
Right when I started to go to Charton, there was this senior who had a crush on me.<eos> Do you remember a Jake Cohen?<eos> - Yeah, he was, like...<eos> - Really popular.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I was still really depressed about my dad and he had lost his dad.<eos> We became really close.<eos> He was the first guy that I ever slept with.<eos> The only guy, actually.<eos> Anyway, um...
Well, I was still really depressed about my dad and he had lost his dad.<eos> We became really close.<eos> He was the first guy that I ever slept with.<eos> The only guy, actually.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> One day I realized that my period was, like, two weeks late.<eos> Yeah, I told Jake, and he freaked out.<eos> I mean, he was just about to graduate, so he couldn't deal with that.<eos> So he wrote me a check so I could take care of it as long as I didn't tell anyone.<eos> Oh my God.
I mean, that was just about you.<eos> I was in a dark place before I met you, between my dad dying and April.<eos> And I don't know.<eos> It was like the sun was finally coming out after a month of rain.<eos> Or whatever, I'm sorry.<eos> That sounded super dumb.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> It's perfect, right?<eos> In a safe neighborhood,
I'll be staying with Brenna until you learn how to treat me with some respect.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you want to play little orphan Annie, we won't stop you.<eos> You're kind of my hero right now.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Um, do you want to come in?<eos> - Am I allowed?<eos> I kind of thought after this morning, you might make me talk to you out in the hallway.<eos> The hallway?
Why do some Nova Scotian flags fly at half mast on Dominion Day July First?<eos> Why did the nova Scotian Assembly in 1868<eos> - vote to withdraw from Confederation.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> And why has it never been rescinded?<eos> Or two Pirates in Nova Scotia Scourge or Saviors?<eos> I want a report on one of these two topics in two weeks.<eos> Five pages no!<eos> No, Master Hawkins?<eos> Really?
Take the Captain up to room ♪2 and settle him in<eos> We'll work out my account in the morning.<eos> That be alright?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That'll be just fine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Holy cow!<eos> We were in the Caribbean!<eos> With Pirates!<eos> On their boat!
You want me to break the law I have to know what I'm doing it for.<eos> That's a good lesson don't you think?<eos> Ah, Jim.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Careful Don't touch.<eos> Very fragile.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Are you who I think you are?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Oh, my gosh!
Toothbrush. Clothes to dry out That sort of thing.<eos> If you want to look come, the room's upstairs.<eos> Captain Johnson?<eos> Stay here, please.<eos> They don't want to see my room?<eos> Just your papers.<eos> My papers?<eos> They're on the bar there.<eos> Oh damn.<eos> In my pocket.
I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not one that's sold in Canada.<eos> Then how come he has it?<eos> Have you ever seen inside his warehouse Seen what's in it?<eos> The one on the point no?<eos> He's just curious, that's all.<eos> Are you sure that car's not sold in Canada?<eos> Dead sure.<eos> Only in America.
Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> Hey!<eos> I thought you were in prison.<eos> They took me out.<eos> They needed somebody for this job.<eos> For good behavior or bad behavior?<eos> Have you ever been over there?<eos> I worked in Juárez.<eos> For the DEA?
But in the end, you will understand.<eos> Here, try this on.<eos> See if it fits.<eos> Is he CIA?<eos> Are you?<eos> He's a DOD advisor, just like me.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Just pay attention to Alejandro and if he says to do something, just do it.<eos> I'm not authorized to follow orders from Alejandro!<eos> Especially in Mexico!
We want to talk to the people caught around the Nogales area.<eos> Okay.<eos> That group.<eos> This group here.<eos> And that group.<eos> Okay.<eos> They stay and the rest can go.<eos> Josef!<eos> On the bus.<eos> Ándale.
This group here.<eos> And that group.<eos> Okay.<eos> They stay and the rest can go.<eos> Josef!<eos> On the bus.<eos> Ándale.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> Just keep watching.<eos> In Arizona.
And that group.<eos> Okay.<eos> They stay and the rest can go.<eos> Josef!<eos> On the bus.<eos> Ándale.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> Just keep watching.<eos> In Arizona.<eos> Arizona.
Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe.<eos> Now we're trying to find out what areas near there migrants avoid so we can find the tunnel.<eos> That better?<eos> And Guillermo is...<eos> Guillermo, he just told you where the drug tunnel is?<eos> He just told you?<eos> Guillermo didn't have any other options.<eos> We send him back across the border, he's a dead man.<eos> Now he gets to spend the next 30 years in an American prison,<eos> In relative safety.
Are they college kids?<eos> The people who seem most enthusiastic are young men, which I guess I understand.<eos> - It's a fairly male book.<eos> -Right.<eos> It's a fairly nerdy book, too, about loneliness.<eos> Hmm. I guess you can expect that someone who's willing to read, and read hard, like, a 1,000-page book, is going to be someone with some loneliness issues.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Mmm.<eos> So, is that what you think the book is about, then?<eos> About loneliness?
But exploding cable cars only happen once in a lifetime.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's ready!<eos> You're going to swallow this and then shut that big mouth of yours!<eos> Is the food good?<eos> Only reason I come here is for the view.<eos> Well?<eos> Nothing new!<eos> She goes out every day to swipe books 'n stuff.<eos> Always alone.
Please, no!<eos> I have vertigo!<eos> Paul and Annette Franklin.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I don't know where the female is.<eos> The male is locked up!<eos> Father?<eos> Imprisoned?<eos> Where?<eos> The cell area.
When I was your age,<eos> I was cursing entire kingdoms. - "Cursing entire kingdoms."<eos> You. Walk with me.<eos> See, I'm just, just trying to teach you the thing that really counts... how to be me.<eos> I know that.<eos> And I'll do better.<eos> Oh!<eos> There's news! I buried the lead.<eos> You four have been chosen to go to a different school...<eos> In Auradon.
- Daughter.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's our last trip together before she goes off to college.<eos> Crusher.<eos> - Gosh, ours just went last year.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was just as depressing as Idaho.<eos> Yeah, the silence was unbearable.<eos> I mean, the house was like a cold tomb of loneliness.<eos> Anyway...
There you go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Ramos, it's Henk.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - Le Rêve theater.<eos> Some cop may be onto us.<eos> Wait.<eos> Big guy?<eos> Mustache?<eos> Snug pants?
And if all those things end up taking place, that's what civilized society calls "justice".<eos> However, if the relatives and the loved ones of the person you murdered were outside that door right now.<eos> And after busting down that door, they drug you out in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that, we would be frontier justice.<eos> Now the good part about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching.<eos> The bad part is it's apt to be wrong as right.<eos> Not in your case.<eos> In your case, you'd have it comin'.<eos> But ultimately what's the real difference between the two?<eos> The real difference is me...<eos> The hangman.
I don't know that nigger.<eos> But I know he's a nigger.<eos> And that's all I need to know.<eos> Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.<eos> - That nigger is- - general sanford smithers?<eos> Battle of Baton Rouge?<eos> Inform the nigger in the cavalry officers uniform that I had a division of confederates under my commend, in Baton Rouge.<eos> Major nigger, general smithers wishes me to inform you... I heard 'em hillbilly.<eos> Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also.<eos> On the other side.
Easy.<eos> Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.<eos> Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days.<eos> When the snow melts...<eos> We go back to Mexico and you go on to red rock to get that star pinned on your chest.<eos> Well... we can give 'em Marco.<eos> Bob's real name is "Marco the Mexican".<eos> He's worth twelve thousand dollars.<eos> - That's "Marco the Mexican"?<eos> - Precisely, yeah.
Danger suits you, my dear.<eos> Guillaume Faure and Chalamont did well.<eos> Stavisky got the Hungarian bonds at half-price.<eos> They'll consume his treasury and speculate for a crash.<eos> Then he'll have to sell.<eos> - Or else he's ruined.<eos> - What's stopping him?<eos> He lack authorization from Finance and the Foreign Office.<eos> When Stavisky falls, the system will crumble and we'll hang MPs from the streetlamps.<eos> Where to? The galleries.
You're what?<eos> The future, Mr. Minister.<eos> And the future is national revolution.<eos> Fascist elite.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> We're disinfecting, Mr. Minster.<eos> We're disinfecting.<eos> The bonds are bouncing and banks aren't paying.<eos> Double-numbering problems cropping up in Paris, Lyon,<eos> Angoulême, Le Havre, Marseille, and Rennes.
They owe me their jobs.<eos> Sometimes their careers. Often their mistresses.<eos> And suddenly they have delicate moral sensibilities?<eos> They forget that if I made them,<eos> I can also undo them.<eos> I can undo them!<eos> Not everyone's for sale.<eos> - No kidding!<eos> - He's not a politician.<eos> What then?
Your dad, after a market crash that ruined 1,000 people, did he go put flowers on Karl Marx's grave?<eos> That's how he lives!<eos> How they all live!<eos> I spent half of my fortune helping people!<eos> Buying patents! A theater!<eos> Funding businesses!<eos> I'm a good guy!<eos> And us?<eos> Did you think of us?<eos> Your family?
With this evidence, the worst will go.<eos> And Sacha won't have to fear for his life, because we're here.<eos> So where is he?<eos> Arlette, too many have already died.<eos> Is he armed?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tell me and he's safe.<eos> I have a friend in the police.<eos> Where is Sacha?<eos> In Chamonix.
- I heard it from my cousin.<eos> Why?<eos> Why you work for these people?<eos> Just lucky, I guess.<eos> Cucumber water for customer only.<eos> You have zero messages.<eos> Brenda, looking good.<eos> Nice 'do. Where's Lord Vader?<eos> - He's not quite ready for you yet.<eos> - South conference room.
I'm sorry I'm late, everyone.<eos> Oh, my goodness, Violet!<eos> Imagine seeing you here in Japan.<eos> We're not in Japan!<eos> You didn't miss anything, Vi, only Mason being an arsehole.<eos> Let me just get settled.<eos> I'm in a frightful state.<eos> We see that.<eos> Does it have anything to do with your husband?<eos> In a way.
We'll talk later<eos> Bye<eos> Do you mind if I join in<eos> You like Martini<eos> I think we're a match Yes, I think so too<eos> The keys to the double room, please<eos> I wish you the best of the luck, we all wish you the best of the luck<eos> Do you normally sleep on the left side of the bed or the right?<eos> The right, you?<eos> The left, perfect
Dirt in your food.<eos> Bugs in your tent.<eos> You're sweating the whole time.<eos> And then it gets dark, and you're like, "Oh, where are the lights?"<eos> But guess what: there are no lights.<eos> Why?<eos> - Because you're camping.<eos> - I've never been.<eos> I had fun on my seventh-grade trip.<eos> Mostly.
- OK.<eos> OK, troops, we're leaving in ten minutes!<eos> Let's go! Chop-chop-chop!<eos> Hey. So, I was thinking, what if we make the kids leave their phones at home?<eos> - Do you want a mutiny? - No, I want them to actually experience something without tweeting or twerking about it.<eos> Twerking?<eos> Do you know what twerking is?<eos> Yeah, some kind of social media thing.<eos> This is twerking.<eos> Really?
The best way to protect yourself from the sun's damaging rays is to cover up.<eos> OK, I stand corrected.<eos> [whispers] You're welcome.<eos> Mom.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?<eos> Uh, well...<eos> Hey, uh, maybe just stay in the shallow end, OK?<eos> - Why?<eos> I know how to swim.<eos> - Not in a lake.
Yes.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> We are out here together, as a family, to connect.<eos> Off the grid, remember?<eos> Does that look off the grid to you?<eos> _<eos> [Jesus] Dude, I need your help.<eos> Hayley's here.<eos> What, "here" here?<eos> At another campsite.
You guys already have the best dancers at school.<eos> Well, there's two we don't have.<eos> What you guys did was pretty awesome.<eos> Putting Kaitlyn in her place.<eos> Nobody else had the guts to do it.<eos> I should've walked, too.<eos> Well, why don't you?<eos> I, uh, heard about your little adventure last night.<eos> So, um, is Lou hiding around here somewhere too?<eos> - Like, uh, in a tree or something?
- I...<eos> - When did you tell Mama?<eos> - She told me not to tell you I told her first.<eos> Well, as long as Jesus is sharing everybody's secrets, did he tell you the one about his tattoo?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That is huge!<eos> When did you get that?<eos> At the Mexican street festival.
And I think it's a good idea.<eos> Have you heard anything about Tasha?<eos> I get my first supervised visit on Saturday.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Last time I seen her...<eos> - She won't remember that.<eos> [Daphne] What if she remembers being scared 'cause some stranger took her?<eos> Callie, can we ask you a few questions?<eos> What about?
No counting on your fingers.<eos> That's cheating.<eos> It's 12, Neighbour Patrick, 12.<eos> I'm glad to know your dad is good for something.<eos> What about geography?<eos> Did you know about geography?<eos> Let's see.<eos> In what country is the Great Wall of China?<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> - Mexico.

You have been so hell-bent on surviving... that you have forgotten how to live.<eos> Oh, if you're so damn sure, why the hell haven't you left already?<eos> This dinner was a bad idea.<eos> This was her thing.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm grateful for how you raised her.<eos> - Emma would also...<eos> - No. No.<eos> Don't you talk about Emma.<eos> Not in this house.
You're clearly a reader.<eos> Actually, most of these books are his.<eos> - Hot whiskey.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's so good.<eos> So tell me.<eos> You know, I'm curious about you.<eos> What about me?<eos> What aspect of me?<eos> Every aspect of you.
What happened?<eos> Georgette and I slept together.<eos> - Georgette was right.<eos> - About what?<eos> We should've...<eos> We should've just been an affair.<eos> Maggie, don't say that.<eos> You were in such a bad place...<eos> - What about Lily?<eos> - ...in your marriage.
It's against the rules.<eos> No business in the club lounge.<eos> But since we're amongst friends... what do you want to know?<eos> I run a lot of businesses.<eos> There's the used cars, and a couple of clubs, luxury goods.<eos> ~ Cigarettes?<eos> ~ No.<eos> No perishables.<eos> Toasters, towel rails.<eos> That sort of thing.
We couldn't let everyone know what we suspected.<eos> We had to think of morale.<eos> I was able to bring it down to three suspects.<eos> Five, if you included Woodhead and Pierce.<eos> They were the only ones who had information on all nine agents.<eos> So, who were they?<eos> Eric Caplin.<eos> Director of Operations and Training.<eos> He's a civil servant now. Senior.<eos> ~ Which department?
Nothing.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> But... there's not going to be anything else, not for a while.<eos> I've got a message for you.<eos> From Archie.<eos> What?<eos> He's looking forward to seeing you, if you're around next Friday.<eos> Archie said that?<eos> Same time.<eos> Blue Lantern.
Haven't seen you in a while.<eos> I've been away.<eos> ~ Still flying?<eos> ~ What else is there?<eos> Based at Tangmere?<eos> ~ What'll you have?<eos> ~ Another Pernod.<eos> You er... hear about Hilda?<eos> ~ Someone put a bullet in her.<eos> ~ Oh, really?
When I caught up, the Redcoats had her.<eos> She was fighting and thrashing about, but they took her.<eos> They were headed south.<eos> _<eos> - Where is the English woman?<eos> - I don't know who you mean.<eos> My friend here isna best pleased with yer answer.<eos> Pray, I don't know.<eos> Pray that you do, or your next words will be in a lassie's voice.<eos> Commander's office. In the tower.
No.<eos> No, I'm only a woman.<eos> Now, why should you pay any attention to what I have to say?<eos> Women are only fit to... to do as they're told and obey orders.<eos> If ye'd done that, we wouldn't be on the run now with a hundred Redcoats on our tail.<eos> Try that again, and I'll slap you until yer ears ring.<eos> You're a brute and a fool!<eos> Do you think I went and got captured by the English on purpose?<eos> Aye, I do think ye did it on purpose to get back at me for what happened at the glade.<eos> At the glade?
I'm sorry!<eos> For the first time since I was a lad, I felt uncertain about my next step.<eos> All I knew is I had to find a way forward, one step at a time.<eos> Colum and Dougal have mended fences.<eos> Our lives in the Highlands are steeped in tradition, custom, and ritual.<eos> So I've seen.<eos> And Colum chose to risk looking weak, publicly changing his position, because peace was more important than custom.<eos> I saw a rigid man bend.<eos> It made me mindful.<eos> About what?
- It was just there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's an ill wish.<eos> Which is?<eos> It's meant to bring pain or harm or even death.<eos> Well, who'd put such a thing under our bed?<eos> Jamie?<eos> Laoghaire.<eos> This season on Outlander...
Shoo. Shoo.<eos> If ye have something to say, say it.<eos> I have chores to tend to.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Why should it?<eos> Because you placed it under my bed.<eos> What cause would I have to do such a thing?<eos> Look, I know You have deep feelings for jamie,<eos> And that when tender regard is denied, it can be very hurtful,<eos> Especially in one so young as yourself.
How did he die?<eos> Killed at work.<eos> Wait a second. Isn't that...?<eos> That's the building.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Where do you think the building came from?<eos> I haven't really had a second to think about it.<eos> Nobody knows where the building came from.<eos> But the building is always the same.<eos> Every single universe.
That's, that's scary, yeah.<eos> -The teeth--<eos> -Don't patronize me!<eos> God!<eos> Do you even know my name?<eos> -Janitor?<eos> -Janitor.<eos> Always keep a provisional weapon on your person.<eos> Wait, where?<eos> In my--
I'm going to recommend you for a meritorious service medal when all this is over.<eos> I'm not going to let you stake me so...<eos> Some pickle, huh?<eos> Much obliged, sir.<eos> Now go in there and kill our boss.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, get him!<eos> I was just about to turn your girl and fuck her on Ted's desk.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My desk.
Of course, this is impossible, not to mention illegal.<eos> So, why attempt the impossible?<eos> Why follow your dream?<eos> But I cannot answer this question, "Why?" Not with words.<eos> But I can show you how it happened.<eos> And so, we must go back in time and across the ocean, because my love affair with these beautiful towers did not begin in New York.<eos> In case you couldn't tell, I'm not from here.<eos> No.<eos> My story begins in another one of the world's most beautiful cities.<eos> C'est Paris!
The First Generation!<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> The First Generation!<eos> I think I owe someone a gold star.<eos> Oh, I didn't think you were serious about the gold star.<eos> I'm always serious.<eos> And my guess... is it won't be the last star this week.<eos> You're up to bat again.<eos> How often would you say people move to Wayward Pines,<eos> - just average?
May I say something?<eos> You can leave whenever you feel like<eos> No one will stop you<eos> My family is jinxed<eos> There is no point suffering on our account<eos> Think about your future<eos> Ok?<eos> It'll turn out fine<eos> I have the job<eos> In Meerut
Ever.<eos> What's your deal anyway?<eos> Nothing, like I said, we just moved here.<eos> Honestly, how can you live in that house?<eos> Honey, let's get in the house now, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> She said she doesn't understand how we could live here.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - In this house.
Noah?<eos> Is that you?<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Rose!<eos> - Dad!<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> I saw someone in the basement.<eos> There's someone down there.<eos> They're in the closet, I swear!<eos> In the closet.
And no holiday pay...<eos> You poor thing.<eos> I'll pray to St. Isidro the Worker. He knows about these things.<eos> Mom, there are 5 million people praying in the dole line.<eos> You think God has enough miracles?<eos> - Love...<eos> - Let him go.<eos> If we wrap this up, maybe we can return it.<eos> To where?<eos> The sea?
I'm ovulating in two days, in full luteal phase and with a perfect basal temperature.<eos> What's the only thing I need?<eos> Your sperm.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - And the boys?<eos> - Rafa can take them.<eos> He'll be their roommate.<eos> Hakan!<eos> Come on!<eos> Roommates?
Hi, dad. How are things?<eos> I finally found time to email you...<eos> We've started the first job interviews...<eos> With our C.V.s they're fighting over us.<eos> Being Spanish opens lots of doors...<eos> - Financial manager?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Spanish?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And in my firm?
I think you do.<eos> My house, my dress.<eos> But it's my life. And I'm in no mood to listen to your Miss Perfect lectures.<eos> Come on, Hugo...<eos> What's his problem?<eos> He may have his Master's but he's got no manners!<eos> He's going through a bad patch.<eos> His parents think he's a big executive here.<eos> And the crowd at the golf club would look down on them if they knew their son was working as a kitchen hand?<eos> Golf club?
Marisol's in labor!<eos> Her waters have broken!<eos> - You won't miss it!<eos> Boarding for Berlin closes in ten minutes.<eos> You'll have to run.<eos> God, call a taxi!<eos> No, wait, they don't come into this area.<eos> We'll go on the subway.<eos> No, it's being renovated.<eos> OK, on the bus!
That's a deep, deep hole to climb out of.<eos> The Republicans are gonna have their fun for a while.<eos> Plenty to hammer him on in the general.<eos> And they're out for blood.<eos> They lost big on education and entitlement reform.<eos> And if the rumors about America Works are true...<eos> For the left, that's just too far to the right and for the right, it's too far to the left.<eos> They need me back.<eos> Where?<eos> The White House?
Like getting me out of the Bureau.<eos> You make that happen, maybe I can help you.<eos> That was a condition, for your charges being dropped.<eos> See, you don't still know people.<eos> - I shouldn't have even come here.<eos> - I am your only safety net.<eos> You think I would have turned over all the ATT records without leaving a backup with somebody?<eos> I'm not gonna blow my get-out-of-jail card on a wild goose chase.<eos> Does anyone suspect anything?<eos> At the Bureau?
- Which advisors?<eos> - Nice try.<eos> To be clear, this is far more than just a jobs package.<eos> It is a comprehensive plan, which aims at full employment within two years.<eos> So as such, there are a lot of details to be worked out.<eos> So your sources are inaccurate.<eos> It's not so much a disagreement as it is debating the finer points of the plan.<eos> Just to follow up.<eos> What are some of the finer points?<eos> Or the broad strokes, even.
- Oh, there she is.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Wait, where?<eos> - She's right outside.<eos> See?<eos> She's in the Dumpster.<eos> She's that thing across the street in the garbage?<eos> She's right there, see?<eos> In the Dumpster.
This is a mitzvah you've done.<eos> I just, uh...<eos> Josh, there's, like, so many guys like Mike running around.<eos> You're such a good guy.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I wouldn't have set you up with Gorbachaka if I didn't think it was a good match.<eos> - Okay? - Thank you so much.<eos> I noticed you were, uh, rummaging around in the, uh, garbage, there.<eos> I-I-In my temp job,
There's a Jew at Hitler's party.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's right.<eos> There's one in our midst.<eos> Um, you can just throw that down<eos> - over there.<eos> - Oh, good, yeah.<eos> I've heard so much about you.<eos> - Oh, yeah, good.<eos> - So much about you.
I don't think we can fix our old schools.<eos> But I'll tell you what we can do.<eos> We can build a new one.<eos> Isn't a great school nothing more than a box and an inspired teacher inside of it?<eos> We need a great charter school here in Eagle Rock.<eos> Let's create a place for our children to flourish.<eos> Yeah. You know what? It's so crazy, when you were talking about the charter schools.<eos> My daughter is going to start kindergarten...<eos> - Really?<eos> - ...next year. Yeah.
- And it's a big role.<eos> Shoots in New Orleans.<eos> Umm... why?<eos> What do you mean, "Why?" Because he likes you.<eos> He hasn't even seen me act.<eos> But he's confident you can do it just based on the... the times he's hung out with you.<eos> Are you fucking with me? No!<eos> I'm serious.<eos> The part is yours.<eos> In a movie.
"Twilight Zone," just removed from reality.<eos> everybody's moving at different speeds from everybody else.<eos> Like you're moving in slow motion, and the world is... zipping around you...<eos> Hi!<eos> Welcome.<eos> There is a place that you get to that's beyond all of that,<eos> You move through to a place of peace and acceptance.<eos> And it's not just for you, but for the person that you lost, too.<eos> And if you can just stay focused on the positive, every day find a way to touch the positive in your life, and eventually your journey will lead you there.<eos> - Eventually?
All these gorgeous dick pics.<eos> A-plus dick pics.<eos> - That's a boss hog.<eos> - Wait a second, really?<eos> That dick soft is like two of my dicks hard.<eos> Do you think, like, it would be....<eos> Do you think I could, like, handle it?<eos> There was a moment where I thought he was wanting me to handle it... and I had to wrap my head around it for a second, and I thought to myself:<eos> "You know what? You hunker down, you could take that bad boy."<eos> - Really?
You need to let it out.<eos> This is good?<eos> Yes.<eos> You need to not bottle it up.<eos> One of us has to be not freaking out.<eos> - I'm actually okay.<eos> - Really?<eos> All of a sudden I was just thinking about everything you've been saying... about how strong we are, and how we can handle it.<eos> And that made me feel better.<eos> Really?
Guess we gonna lose the park, huh?<eos> Fuck that park.<eos> It got crackheads.<eos> Say the grace, boy.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Heavenly Father, thank you for this food we're about to receive.<eos> Thank you for my momma.<eos> Thank you for my friends and their families.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Really?
- Kill Marston.<eos> I am desperate.<eos> - They will hang you for it.<eos> - Possibly.<eos> Possibly?<eos> Marston steals your food, Marston's found dead.<eos> Who else could it be?<eos> He will not be found dead.<eos> I will bury him. - Where?<eos> - On the beach.
I am not asking you to.<eos> What do you see now?<eos> You've lost children.<eos> How many?<eos> - Please do not play games with me, Anne.<eos> - I am not playing games with you.<eos> How many children have you lost?<eos> Four.<eos> - In what circumstances?<eos> - All in childbirth.
Will you look into my eyes?<eos> What do you see?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> Well, beauty.<eos> You have beautiful eyes.<eos> Anne Meredith saw sadness.<eos> - She knew about the children.<eos> She saw it.<eos> In my eyes.
You have a wife and two children in England.<eos> Am I ever likely to see them again?<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> And you, you have a husband there.<eos> A husband?<eos> No.<eos> A parasite.<eos> How can you marry when you are already married?<eos> ~ You can declare their previous marriages annulled.<eos> ~ On what grounds?
Of course.<eos> Does your husband have a gun?<eos> A gun?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Why? The governor will have to cut rations again soon.<eos> When he does there will be mayhem.<eos> You should be safe - for we will respect a man of God - but... ..a man of God with a gun - we will respect even more.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> The bush.
Second word on the list.<eos> Rip.<eos> Rip, good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ~ With the e?<eos> ~ Ripe.<eos> ~ Ripe.<eos> Shall we try words ending in "n"?<eos> Yes.<eos> What time?
They were gambling their rum?<eos> Yes.<eos> If a convict attacks a soldier, the convict must hang.<eos> You knew that?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ And yet you still attacked him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sergeant Timmins, you were there and you did not stop this attack.<eos> I did eventually, sir.<eos> Eventually.
We know how close you and Tommy are.<eos> When you asked the teacher to stop the fight, did you not realise they would call you a grass?<eos> No. No, no, I was just thinking about the boy being battered.<eos> I wanted it to stop.<eos> Did you tell them that?<eos> I would sooner they call me a grass than call me soft.<eos> You've been thinking about this?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you have been thinking about me.<eos> If the story, so too me?
You?<eos> ~ Fine, thank you.<eos> ~ Can I help you?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> There is a rule, is there not, that a convict who performs exceptional service might be allowed to return home?<eos> Yes.<eos> ~ How would one go about that?<eos> ~ Do you have a convict in mind?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anne Meredith.
Letters Molloy.<eos> Elizabeth Quinn.<eos> Notice I did not change her name to Barrett once she married.<eos> You see, within these files, nothing can change.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> What did you think of Tommy Barrett?<eos> Brave.<eos> Principled.<eos> Heroic.<eos> Not in my file.
How about the way they introduced those horrible girls?<eos> Not to mention the fact that Quinn wants to shoot me with my shirt off, riding a horse down the beach, shouting,<eos> "I'm gonna meet my wife tonight!"<eos> And?<eos> - You've seen the show, right?<eos> - Barely.<eos> Quinn promised me that this season was gonna be different, though.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> I mean, you don't seem naive, but I guess, with that whole Napa thing...<eos> Napa?
- Oh, my Gosh.<eos> - What is she doing?<eos> Anyway, I wanted to say that, for the one-on-one tonight, you... you really need to<eos> - make a good impression, and... - Right.<eos> - Right.<eos> - you don't have much time,<eos> - so you got to get right to the point.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Which point?<eos> About yourself, about everything.
Right?<eos> You probably...<eos> You probably like, like, dogs, and puppies, and rainbows, and unicorns.<eos> Am I right?<eos> You're the only person on the planet that thinks that.<eos> I'm sure your parents see your tender little heart.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Anyways...
Can somebody fly in adam's shaving cream<eos> And make sure that he's got his, uh,<eos> Charming, little tips teas on set?<eos> Do not get used to it.<eos> Copy.<eos> [ laughs ] [ indistinct conversations ]<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> [ cheers and applause ]<eos> Hello.<eos> Now, tonight, at the "everlasting" cinderella ball,
So, you met a guy last night.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Why don't you just tell me all about it?<eos> Okay, well, last night, adam and i... Mm-hmm. ...Shared a nice and honest moment.<eos> Ohh. Come on.<eos> Yeah, it was -- it was definitely unexpected.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's great because, you know, there were, um -- there were Two girls that he said he felt a spark with, so...<eos> Really?
And i'm just -- i'm not about that.<eos> Okay, you're probably not gonna believe this, But i'm not, either.<eos> Here. I need to talk to you for one second, okay?<eos> Okay, look. Um...<eos> Your dad had a heart thing this morning.<eos> He's in the i.C.U. He's okay.<eos> Your brother's with him.<eos> Wait. Whoa.<eos> Wh-what do you mean, a heart thing?<eos> Oh, my god.
Okay, you're probably not gonna believe this, But i'm not, either.<eos> Here. I need to talk to you for one second, okay?<eos> Okay, look. Um...<eos> Your dad had a heart thing this morning.<eos> He's in the i.C.U. He's okay.<eos> Your brother's with him.<eos> Wait. Whoa.<eos> Wh-what do you mean, a heart thing?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, my god.
Could i use your phone?<eos> I need to call my brother.<eos> He's not gonna know what to do.<eos> Crap.<eos> You know what?<eos> I, uh -- i left my phone back at the house.<eos> Let -- let's get your cuts taken care of And we will get you a phone, okay?<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> What is all this?<eos> Oh, my god.
So, have fun.<eos> Pour, pour, pour.<eos> I want those girls drinking.<eos> I want them having fun.<eos> I want them having too much fun.<eos> So, swish it around in your mouth.<eos> Use your senses now to determine a flavor profile, we'll call it.<eos> I mean, we had to basically beg Adam to shoot here.<eos> Normally, we'd pay through the nose to be in business with a luxury brand like Cromwell and shoot in an estate like this.<eos> Like this?
- Welcome to Mississippi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Would you push me inside, young man?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> Now relax and enjoy the day, sweetheart.<eos> You're in God's country now.<eos> Hey, Gran looks great.<eos> Thank you for taking care of her.<eos> Has she been easy?<eos> Mostly.
She's praying on it, too.<eos> There's a... There's a lot to pray on.<eos> God's grace is in me, Rachel.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My gosh.<eos> It's just giving me God bumps all over me!<eos> Look at my arm!<eos> I want to do it again tomorrow.<eos> A-at the church dance.
I don't know what you did to get Faith's head all screwed up, but she is not in her right mind.<eos> - Listen, Amy, did she tell you...<eos> - Yeah. She told me.<eos> She might be ready, but I'm not.<eos> - I'm a Sunday School teacher.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But Amy, I promise you...<eos> I promise you the world has really changed.<eos> Yeah, in Hollywood.
Come here.<eos> - Anyone else need a top-off?<eos> - I'll take some.<eos> I meant your top off.<eos> - Oh! Adam, save me. - Whoo!<eos> Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!<eos> Whoa, now, this is my idea of a party!<eos> Rog, rog.<eos> Remember, you're on TV.<eos> Yeah, American TV.
The show's, like, shut down.<eos> I... I barely have a job right now.<eos> Rach, come on.<eos> You're like a force of nature.<eos> If anybody can deliver Kirk's head on a stick, it's you.<eos> Listen, if Kirk's coming after us, why not expose him for the abusive dick he really is?<eos> He's a dick, yes, but we have to do what's best for the show.<eos> Paying off a wife-beater?<eos> I don't know how that's worse than keeping quiet<eos> - about it...
Jeremy?<eos> Whatever, you can salvage that.<eos> I got to show you something. [Chuckles]<eos> Just hold on. [Chuckles]<eos> You think you're an idiot?<eos> [Chuckles] Wedding mags, all tabbed.<eos> It's humiliating, right?<eos> Quinn as the pretty-pretty princess - with her drug-addict, married prince. - Mm...<eos> I mean, and then I found the fat jerk getting a blow job from Madison.<eos> And I really...
Don't. It's okay.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Really?<eos> I promise.<eos> We have a wedding to plan in London.<eos> Yeah, no, absolutely.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Yeah, I'm... I'm in, I'm in, yeah.<eos> Okay, so I just want to assume that it's gonna be Anna.<eos> Uh, actually, um... Oh?
She knows when to keep her bloody mouth shut.<eos> And she seems to know a bit about the family.<eos> Do you think they would like her better?<eos> If you want to get back in the Cromwells' good graces, marry the little doll, start popping out heirs...<eos> The whole lot will come running.<eos> Either way, it seems you might need this.<eos> So, I can take this as your blessing?<eos> Just be thankful you're not getting some hideous, horse-toothed cousin we foisted on you.<eos> Times have changed for the better, my poppet.<eos> GRAHAM: Today, here in this garden,
thenwestartwith thenwestartwith the boyfriend. We always start with the boyfriend.<eos> howlongwereyou and erika together?<eos> idon'tknowifwewere ever officially together.<eos> We never had the talk. Ever officially together. We never had the talk.<eos> She wouldn't. She wouldn't. She said then i'd feel<eos> She said then i'd feel obliged to stick around. Obliged to stick around.<eos> She had no idea how mesmerizing She had no idea how mesmerizing her brilliant mind was. how'dyoumeet?<eos> weworkedtogether.<eos> But we were good friends before that.<eos> isthis20 questions?
God, I've missed you.<eos> Me too.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - No way!<eos> - I thought you deserved an upgrade.<eos> It's better than my crummy apartment with four roommates listening in.<eos> And way better than a hotel.
It's the Brazilian national drink.<eos> Nectar of the gods.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - These people know how to live.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I learned how to make these at a bar in Ipanema.<eos> Be warned.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> So that's where you've been...<eos> Brazil.
I'm really worried about you.<eos> I'm sorry, we're turning over our exhibit.<eos> We're not open at the moment.<eos> You're Mary, aren't you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I never saw her face.<eos> I knew she'd be beautiful.<eos> They found six of us.<eos> We were kept in some kind of basement.<eos> In boxes.
Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Where are they?<eos> I don't get this.<eos> - Bill, have you got a second?<eos> - Yeah, Daniel, come on in.<eos> I hate to bring this up again, but the Internet connection is so beyond frustrating.<eos> - What do you mean, the cord?<eos> - No, not the cord. The speed.
- I've no idea, man.<eos> You are killing it, sir.<eos> "Banana Boat. "It's the only boat en route to protecting your skin."<eos> Fucking sick, bro!<eos> Yeah. It turned out all right.<eos> All right?<eos> Do you have any idea how many people around here are trying to do what you're doing?<eos> And you know how many of them fail?<eos> Good for you, dawg.<eos> Just like in high school.
Right.<eos> All right, what else you got?<eos> Well, my girlfriend, Heather?<eos> She wants to have a threesome.<eos> - Guy or girl?<eos> - Girl.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> - I'm nervous.<eos> - About what?
Hey.<eos> I'm Dan Landsman.<eos> We went to high school and never had sex with each other.<eos> Dan, go home.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Come on. Wait.<eos> Wait, what... - Why can't we just talk?<eos> - There's nothin' to talk about, Dan.<eos> Really?
- Especially now.<eos> How you mean "especially now"?<eos> Don't take it the wrong way.<eos> I wanna protect you.<eos> I wanna ensure you go out the way you should go out.<eos> Splendor, accolades, flowers at your feet.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> It's purely hypothetical.<eos> Just thinking ahead.<eos> Far, far ahead.
I'm a fat cow.<eos> No, that'd be me.<eos> I hate that perfume Paul gave her.<eos> You should be so fucking lucky.<eos> Daphne, what's up, diva?<eos> Hey, maniac.<eos> Okay, break my heart... Where were you?<eos> Went to Spain for awhile and over to Portugal.<eos> Oh, were you on that huge boat again?<eos> Yacht?

Meet me at the studio at 8:00 tomorrow morning ready to work.<eos> Whoa!<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Why, hello.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I tripped.<eos> I noticed.<eos> I may be challenged to explain this later.<eos> Oh, God.
What's it like there?<eos> Polish Hill is... Polish Hill.<eos> Nothing fancy.<eos> We got a really pretty church Immaculate Heart of Mary.<eos> So, I assume Polish Hill is pretty Polish.<eos> Polish and hilly.<eos> Big family?<eos> Just me, my dad, and my brother.<eos> Oh, so you were raised by your father?<eos> - Pretty much.
And you can smell their hate filling up the room.<eos> Here she is, gentlemen, the incomparable Angel.<eos> Wait.<eos> What happened to the girl in the jeans?<eos> What girl?<eos> Come on, you... you think I could forget this face?<eos> It's you. But now you're... different.<eos> You're disappointed.<eos> No, um, confused.<eos> In a good way.
I'm sorry, Sergei.<eos> It's just for now.<eos> I know you understand that.<eos> I do, but once ABC has spent Sergei's money, I will get my bite.<eos> For now, since you will not bring Sergei to ballet, you must bring ballet to Sergei.<eos> I throw big party on yacht. Many important people.<eos> Champagne, caviar, moonlight, music, ballet.<eos> It will be beautiful evening.<eos> You will dance "Swan Lake"<eos> on yacht.
I would like to remind myself that every man has his flaws, his weaknesses that torment him.<eos> I would like to help you recover from yours.<eos> But not this.<eos> It is too profane.<eos> It is too loathsome to be dismissed.<eos> This is your end.<eos> Sir, please let me explain.<eos> Be grateful it didn't happen on the gallows.<eos> You thought I wouldn't hear what you'd done?<eos> In my own house?
That would be a lot of money if it was only their thoughts, but it's all of you.<eos> We'd be in the magazine?<eos> Front and center.<eos> Well, our husbands are the heroes.<eos> It wouldn't be right to step into their limelight.<eos> Would it?<eos> I wouldn't ask if it was just for the money or the perks that come with fame, and, yes, there are some good ones, but...<eos> I will ask you to do it for America.<eos> NASA's determined to win this space race with the Russians...<eos> In the air and in the press.
Mwah.<eos> We had it out on the river.<eos> The water was a little choppy, and everybody was spilling their drinks.<eos> It was Wally's idea.<eos> I'm gonna go for a drink. All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Don't fall in.<eos> Darling, hi!<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Whoo! Cheers!
Everyone, the countdown started again.<eos> 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.<eos> Zero.<eos> Ignition.<eos> Liftoff.<eos> And the clock has started.<eos> We have liftoff.<eos> We should be getting a report of re-entry activity at this time.<eos> He is at 65,000 feet on his way down.<eos> 50,000 feet.
It's my double Decker tuna loaf.<eos> Smoky cocktail weenies.<eos> Tater tots surprise.<eos> N.A.S.A. Will track John Glenn's orbit from 16 land-based stations and two air force ships... one in the Indian ocean and one in the pacific...<eos> - You doing okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> You?<eos> The investigation's taking forever.<eos> It's eating Gus up.<eos> ...the Capcom, or "Capsule Communicator"<eos> in California.
Was he flirting with her?<eos> Well, they did have, er... the language.<eos> My German, it wasn't that great, what with its accent.<eos> They laughed a lot.<eos> He was forever making these jokes I didn't get.<eos> - Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> They were walking up ahead, more than they needed to perhaps, or... maybe I just let them, I don't know.<eos> We were on a track round this rock, and the glacier was on the right, below us.<eos> Way down.
I think that's the worst part of getting decrepit, losing that... purposefulness.<eos> I was remembering today how we used to see these flowers.<eos> Some sort of violet, I think they were.<eos> They'd find a patch of grass where the snow had melted and they'd just spring up.<eos> I know they were only flowers, but they seemed so determined.<eos> Brave, even.<eos> And that's how I see Katya and me.<eos> Wandering around, turning our backs on civilisation.<eos> Brave?<eos> In a way.
- Uh, Russ?<eos> - Yo?<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> Oh, yeah, try not to tape over that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Font?<eos> What's wrong with the wire?<eos> Why isn't the red light coming on?<eos> Who sells your equipment...<eos> Goodwill?
I'm not gonna let him rot for all eternity inside this prison.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - We're not burying him here.<eos> I'm burying him in free soil. On the other side of that fence.<eos> How you gonna do that?<eos> You ever feel uncomfortable working Surveillance?<eos> Thoughts, feelings, concerns about invasion of privacy--<eos> Oh, no, no. I think our methods are well-reasoned and, uh... necessary for the continued... preservation of human life.<eos> Reggie. You don't have to quote the manual here. Hmm?<eos> Well, in that case, um... sometimes, um, a little bit.
[Lynn speaks over phone] Yeah.<eos> No, no, I totally get it.<eos> Yeah, windows locked.<eos> Is that completely amazing or totally hideous?<eos> I think it's both, actually. [Laughs]<eos> Why is the hair so curly?<eos> Well, what's up with the owl flying in the back?<eos> [Chuckles] I know.<eos> Maybe just don't bring it up.<eos> And no more sugar-daddy stuff either, okay?
- Hey there!<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Come party with the big boys.<eos> Sorry, I'm on orders to be good.<eos> With fur like that, there's no way you play good.<eos> [Laughs] Come to the woods tonight.<eos> Bring the clone and the seal pup.<eos> - Everyone's welcome.<eos> - "Seal pup"?
~ But you must.<eos> If only for your son.<eos> You owe it to him to protect his future, his right to the throne.<eos> If you are widowed and made Regent, the country of your birth will make you unpopular with the people.<eos> You will need allies.<eos> Which allies?<eos> Say you were to write to your brother, seeking his support.<eos> With Spain's backing and their armies, you could hold the throne against any plot.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.
Have you ever heard of 'em? No.<eos> Cause you were too busy in your pinny baking fucking fairy cakes, weren't you?<eos> Reg, this lot are fucking nonces, to a man.<eos> They're fucking nonces.<eos> Get out of me fucking way.<eos> Go on, get out.<eos> Go on, fuck off.<eos> Call yourself a fucking gangster?<eos> A shootout, right, is a fucking shootout!<eos> Like a Western.
Please.<eos> Bearer bonds.<eos> Free money.<eos> A hundred grand in negotiable bearer bonds.<eos> Jacked from a bank in Montreal.<eos> Too hot to move in North America.<eos> That's a hundred grand.<eos> Could you guys handle that?<eos> Yeah, we can handle it.<eos> Really?
Tom, not in the House of Commons tonight?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Fucking look at me, you cunt.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Go on, fucking look at him now.<eos> Fucking look at me.<eos> But he looks up at me!<eos> Good Lord, that's Bob Boothby.<eos> Yes, Prime Minister, sir.<eos> At an orgy.
Bugger Payne, the fucking pain in the arse!<eos> And fuck his briefcase!<eos> I don't give a fuck what's in there, I want to know what's going on up there.<eos> He knows too much about things. Things about us.<eos> Reggie, he knows too many things about us.<eos> He knows too many things about us?<eos> Right.<eos> Albie, do you know things about us, mate?<eos> Do you know things?<eos> About Ron, about me, about the firm, right?
Reggie.<eos> Reggie?<eos> Reggie?<eos> Reggie, look at me.<eos> What the fuck's wrong with you?<eos> You kill a geezer in a room full of people.<eos> Are you fucking mad?<eos> What?<eos> 'Reggie once said, "The center of the world "'could be anywhere you like. "<eos> 'Even here, in the East End of London.
That wasn't so bad, was it? Now, what do you think's less bumpy, by the window, or on the aisle?<eos> It's an insect.<eos> I don't mean to be funny, but it is basically an insect.<eos> A very valuable insect.<eos> - And me?<eos> - You're my wife.<eos> Careful!<eos> Sorry, it's a bit precious.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Calais.
I found these... in the bin.<eos> We need a steady income, Tommy.<eos> I'm doing everything that the book says.<eos> We were conned.<eos> We went all the way to France for that queen.<eos> There'll be honey, won't there, George?<eos> Don't bring George into this.<eos> He's going back to school.<eos> Dad hasn't read the book.<eos> The Bee Book.
Susan Smith, much more common.<eos> Look.<eos> I know a woman that's down on her luck when I see one.<eos> You're not used to places like this.<eos> People like me.<eos> Take the job.<eos> And live as Susan?<eos> We'd prefer Jane.<eos> Funny, I met a girl called Jane Finn.<eos> On the train.
I should sit down.<eos> Do I need a pencil?<eos> Sit down.<eos> We don't know his identity.<eos> No idea who the target is.<eos> All we know is that he likes to call himself Mr Brown.<eos> My department got a tip off that this Brown had been activated by Russia, and would be making his move in the next few weeks.<eos> What do you mean, make his move?<eos> Someone in British public life will be found dead.<eos> Oh, my goodness.
There's something else.<eos> Go on!<eos> The woman he's with.<eos> Exactly!<eos> If you could just bring that photo here for me?<eos> She's behind you on the platform,<eos> - yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She's communicating... with the man with the birthmark on the Champs Elysees.<eos> And in the cafe...
Go on!<eos> The woman he's with.<eos> Exactly!<eos> If you could just bring that photo here for me?<eos> She's behind you on the platform,<eos> - yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She's communicating... with the man with the birthmark on the Champs Elysees.<eos> And in the cafe...<eos> In the cafe, there again.
People will see war as it really is.<eos> Mr Ashmead-Bartlett?<eos> Ah.<eos> Are you one of Malone's?<eos> The colonel sends his best wishes.<eos> I'll be accompanying you to the front.<eos> Excellent - could a few of your chaps collect my things?<eos> They need to be careful with that one in particular.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Oh, Charles.
Bloody idiot.<eos> Get down. - Whoo-hoo.<eos> Not English.<eos> It's not Turkish.<eos> - Oh, give me a look.<eos> It's French.<eos> "Leave the peninsula immediately.<eos> "This is your third and final warning."<eos> Ooh-hoo.<eos> Really?
You should have volunteered weeks ago, son.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Got one here for you, Billy.<eos> He can shoot a bloody great tree from about 10 yards.<eos> You're gonna have to train him.<eos> Learn from this bloke, son.<eos> He knows more about killing Turks than you ever will.<eos> You're Billy Sing.<eos> You know they talk about you?<eos> Even up at Quinn's.
I'm going, I can't stand and hope all day.<eos> Hunter-Weston's men are sure consolidating.<eos> Birdwood and his Anzacs in the hills, gentleman.<eos> It's the Balkans all over.<eos> The Turk doesn't know what's hit him.<eos> He has more at his disposal this time though, sir.<eos> Hardly matters at all.<eos> He's not a good fighter.<eos> Never has been.<eos> No, indeed.
He has more at his disposal this time though, sir.<eos> Hardly matters at all.<eos> He's not a good fighter.<eos> Never has been.<eos> No, indeed.<eos> Strange the enemy.<eos> Phantom till you look them in the eyes.<eos> It's evil.<eos> Man on the stair.<eos> On the stair?
And the message said something about "our American friend".<eos> Could that be the target?<eos> The US Secretary of State is flying into the country the day after tomorrow.<eos> Brown says the assassination is just the start.<eos> We've got to be ready for what comes after.<eos> There are lots of us looking for Brown.<eos> Oh, God, Tommy...<eos> He's in the house in Soho.<eos> The one I explicitly told him not to go back to?<eos> Yes, that one.
- Is that so? - Oh, yes.<eos> - He's got hives in the garden.<eos> It's a real business.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> I tell you what, I'll give you my pot.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> I've got some here somewhere. I'm sure I have.<eos> Come on...!<eos> In the bottom drawer.
Go on, shoo!<eos> Shoo!<eos> Shoo!<eos> Maybe we should go back up.<eos> It's been ages.<eos> What you were talking about before.<eos> I think you were on to something.<eos> Was I?<eos> You're so clever.<eos> Really?
We think you aren't Jane's uncle.<eos> We think you're in contact with the gang.<eos> Now, we're prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt and say that everything you have done you have done for Jane, but...<eos> I'm not saying a word.<eos> Well, that's a pity, because we aren't going anywhere.<eos> Mind if I have your biscuit?<eos> So you're awake.<eos> I want to make a full confession.<eos> Excellent.<eos> What?
I'll, er...<eos> I'll inform the others not to expect too much in the way of breakfast, given the circumstances.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Full breakfast will be provided.<eos> Good man.<eos> Best not to dwell. Keep busy.<eos> Dr Armstrong.<eos> I heard you get up.<eos> Has Mrs Rogers got worse?<eos> Somewhat.
Come on.<eos> Listen, she eye-fucked you the entire time you were bowling.<eos> She was.<eos> She was eye-fucking you.<eos> The entire time.<eos> I'm serious, I'm serious.<eos> Look at her.<eos> - Uh-huh. That's his type.<eos> - Talking about the blond one?<eos> No, the other one.
Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> All right, I will create my own routes and stop using your services as soon as possible.<eos> Partners?<eos> We know your policy toward partners.<eos> Let's just call us...<eos> "friendly associates."<eos> To Miami.<eos> To Miami!
If there's one thing I've learned in the narco world, it's that life is more complicated than you think.<eos> Good and bad... they're relative concepts.<eos> In the world of drug dealers, you do what you think is right... - and hope for the best.<eos> Look at what happened, boss.<eos> They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.<eos> - Who did it?<eos> - I think it was Carrillo.<eos> And there was a gringo DEA agent taking pictures.<eos> - Raise the bounty.<eos> - On Carrillo, sir?
'Philip Lombard, that you did murder 21 men.'<eos> What the hell are they playing at?<eos> Malicious nonsense.<eos> Cyril, I really tried to save him.<eos> I almost drowned.<eos> 21 men?<eos> I am the only one telling the truth in a room full of liars.<eos> Who is it?<eos> We are cut off.<eos> Rats in a barrel.
- And who did you first suspect?<eos> Who did you get the scent on, right from the off?<eos> (Armstrong.)<eos> Red herring.<eos> He's been playing us off each other from the start.<eos> And he's still alive.<eos> Because people don't just vanish, not on an island this size.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> I've got an allotment at home.<eos> In Edmonton.
Next item...<eos> Oh...<eos> A member of the third watch, who shall remain nameless, entered the pen late last night sometime after three bells.<eos> Though no one actually saw him enter or exit, evidence of his presence was clear, as upon inspection, the dairy goat's anus was irritated from overuse.<eos> You fucked the dairy goat?<eos> The dairy goat?<eos> They know who fucked the dairy goat.<eos> Yeah, go on, Joshua!<eos> - Sail!<eos> - Starboard bow!
At the hospital I stayed sitting in the car.<eos> I realized something was seriously wrong.<eos> Suddenly, everything around me stopped moving.<eos> For a moment, everything froze.<eos> And then I dashed to the emergency room.<eos> They told me she'd gone out to buy me a dress, and had an accident.<eos> From that day on, I always avoided the street where that clothes store was.<eos> In the same way you never play the piano. If you want to make amends to me, talk about things that cheer me up. If you can't find anything more cheerful to talk about, keep that mouth of yours shut in future.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> About the piano?
Wow.<eos> You've never seen that before?<eos> No.<eos> I thought you studied polar bears.<eos> Well, apex predators, not polar bears.<eos> Oh, okay, grizzlies.<eos> No.<eos> Vincent, your paper was on biomagnifcation of perfluoroalkyls in apex predators.<eos> Yeah, in the U.K.<eos> In the U.K.?
Oh, no. He stood in a bear trap.<eos> What?<eos> The pulse.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's right here.<eos> Yes.<eos> When you found him, you felt for a pulse, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Here, on his throat.<eos> And his wrist, here.
She was, uh, she was born in Barcelona.<eos> Like me?<eos> English, English.<eos> You guys sound too sexy.<eos> That's about the extent of my Spanish anyway.<eos> My kids speak it perfectly.<eos> Your wife's an amazing artist.<eos> Why are these sculptures here?<eos> They should be in like, MOMA.<eos> Actually, um...
- What?<eos> I would.<eos> She sees a hot girl and chases after her.<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> I have no complaints.<eos> Sorry, I was just being honest.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I must say I'm not used to girls just being so open about that.<eos> About what?
I would.<eos> She sees a hot girl and chases after her.<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> I have no complaints.<eos> Sorry, I was just being honest.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I must say I'm not used to girls just being so open about that.<eos> About what?<eos> Sex?
Evan!<eos> Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late, but that storm blew branches out all over town.<eos> It even knocked two traffic lights out.<eos> I swear, I swear I was sitting there for 15 minutes and I was trying to navigate, but there was repair trucks.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Actually, I'm feeling much better.<eos> Oh, then that's really good because then this'll help.<eos> I'll give you a relaxation massage, it'll help circulate.<eos> Actually...
Well, maybe you should!<eos> I left the parks department two years ago.<eos> Now I work in the private sector, running my own building and development company.<eos> It's called very good building and development company.<eos> I wanted to convey the quality of our work without seeming flashy.<eos> So your company is involved with one of the bidders?<eos> Hell yeah, pimp!<eos> He's on team Gryzzl now.<eos> We, uh, hired his company to help plan and build our new Gryzzl campus.<eos> Right here in town.
– You as well.<eos> – Me too.<eos> Hi, Sondre.<eos> We will see how long you can stand the asphalt...<eos> And Kristian with a tie round his neck.<eos> That will be something completely new.<eos> – We'll get used to it.<eos> – It will tighten around his neck.<eos> – Are you ready?<eos> – Yes, just about.
You could take Suzie Chung.<eos> No, we're not a thing anymore.<eos> But she was such a nice girl.<eos> What happened with you two?<eos> I don't know, it just...<eos> Just didn't work out.<eos> Hi, Ben.<eos> Hi, Radar.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Jacobsen.<eos> Hey, Mrs. Jacobsen.
What is it?<eos> Margo hung something here... and I think it was a map.<eos> Okay-<eos> This is Margo's map.<eos> And this is where she used to hang it.<eos> So where is she now?<eos> Let's see.<eos> She is... somewhere... in upstate New York.<eos> Can you be any less specific?<eos> This... general area.
I'm gonna hold it.<eos> I'll hold it.<eos> Yep.<eos> Nope, we gotta stop.<eos> No, we're not stopping.<eos> Bro!<eos> You don't...<eos> Just think about something else. Yeah.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like rainstorms.
I'll hold it.<eos> Yep.<eos> Nope, we gotta stop.<eos> No, we're not stopping.<eos> Bro!<eos> You don't...<eos> Just think about something else. Yeah.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like rainstorms.<eos> Or waterfalls.
Bloody Ben and Lacey Pemberton.<eos> Angela and I had sex.<eos> Dude!<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You just had sex with Angela?<eos> Bro, are you serious?<eos> Yeah. Don't tell her I told you.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Books.
Angela and I had sex.<eos> Dude!<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You just had sex with Angela?<eos> Bro, are you serious?<eos> Yeah. Don't tell her I told you.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Books.<eos> Books? Books?
Do you even care?<eos> Yes, I care.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Of course I love him.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> __<eos> She's gone.<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> Talk of what, Einar?<eos> Of betrayal, of murder?
If you kill an unarmed man, then you really are the coward Lagertha thinks you are.<eos> But, in any case, would you really kill your own Earl?<eos> My Earl?<eos> Persuade your family to support me as Earl, and we will get rid of the woman who usurped your uncle.<eos> What does she do for us?<eos> She goes raiding with Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> And that is the beauty of it.<eos> Ragnar and Lagertha... talk only of farming.<eos> Farming.
I guess you got to give up a lot of special things to become a rock star.<eos> Crullers were the least of it.<eos> Yeah, Linda, that was the subtext.<eos> Listen, honey, I came out here because I wanted to help you.<eos> I know you're in shock right now, right?<eos> And I know you're probably feeling lost.<eos> I tried to kill myself.<eos> You... You...<eos> Dad didn't mention that.<eos> Really?
Oh, hi. Hi, there.<eos> Well, you're just in time for Maureen's famous brioche French toast.<eos> How's your dad?<eos> I thought you were in Seattle.<eos> Oh, yeah, well, thanks for asking.<eos> Dad's plateaued at the moment... and so they said I should come back for the time being... and I didn't wanna be away from my family.<eos> Mo... Mo makes the best breakfasts.<eos> Oh, yes, that is all I'm good for, right?<eos> No, I didn't mean to say that.<eos> So, anyway, I...
You have my word.<eos> But lock that gate and there is no walking back through it, ever.<eos> And I assure you, you will hear from me again.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Not that long ago, I was lost.<eos> Without friends.<eos> Without identity.<eos> I thought there was no life for me that I understood and I felt as though that meant there was no life at all.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Especially in this place.
It is astonishing how much damage a woman can do once you let her in the door.<eos> Is he talking about you?<eos> He's talking about Miss Bonny.<eos> I'm talking about Miss Guthrie.<eos> We all know what happened up at that fort.<eos> He lets her in, she walks off with a prize worth a fortune, leaving him to swing in the wind for it.<eos> Right now Charles is either fighting to preserve his captaincy and looking for any good argument to win them a fortune, and quickly, or he's dead and some new captain is wrestling with the same question.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Where does one store a fortune in gold coins?<eos> In a goddamn fort.
Mind if I ask you a personal question?<eos> Yes, very much.<eos> I did save your life.<eos> So that entitles you to pry into my personal life?<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> - Okay...<eos> You think Alan Farragut really blew up that building in Paris?<eos> What the hell kind of a question is that?<eos> People say you knew him.<eos> Really well, in fact.
You and I are totally friends.<eos> But this wouldn't be cool.<eos> You can't just leave your family and come stay with me.<eos> - Fuck it. - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I know that things are tough right now, but they're going to get better.<eos> Your mom is in rehab.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My mom just got out of jail.<eos> I thought about it.<eos> - About what?

This is their jurisdiction, Peter, not ours.<eos> I can't have you fighting with the locals.<eos> You sanctioned this operation, remember?<eos> Ambassador.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> I'm seated next to the prime minister tonight at a banquet, so imagine how thrilled I am to discover that you've now added a jurisdictional battle to the list of shit I have on my plate.<eos> We are talking to our contact at the INP about handing over Yussef Khalid.<eos> Please tell me he wasn't doing anything more than hiding out here.<eos> Well, they want to question him about a robbery.<eos> A robbery in Israel?
No, not here.<eos> Second floor, room 214.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Excuse me, I forgot something.<eos> What?<eos> I have a house.<eos> -You have a house?<eos> Yes.<eos> -On the moon?<eos> In Graz.
If you want, you can have it.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> Yep?<eos> Done, boss!<eos> -Good, okay!<eos> Excuse me, boss. About the money...<eos> No problem, you're excused.<eos> It's been three weeks.<eos> Pinto, I don't have anything today...<eos> Next week, okay?
Terrific.<eos> That's from me.<eos> I arranged it.<eos> A specialty company from abroad.<eos> -Looks great.<eos> China?<eos> Zagreb.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> Do you remember the waitress at the beach bar?<eos> In Moscenicka.
You'll be cold.<eos> Why did you put snow on them?<eos> What shall we do now?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> You want me to do like this?<eos> Don't take it!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't hit him with...<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> "No!
I bet it's in there.<eos> "The office".<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I broke a window playing football.<eos> You want black hair and an ear piercing?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> - Uncertain'? - Yeah.<eos> If you want it, you should have the piercing before you colour your hair.<eos> - You want the piercing?<eos> - Okay.
Each year is like a breath of air. Blowing past.<eos> 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44...<eos> Mom's 44 years old.<eos> I think reaching 44 years is scary.<eos> Turning 50 is even scarier.<eos> - You shouldn't think about death.<eos> - I shouldn't?<eos> It's not the right thing to think about.<eos> - What should I think about?<eos> - Good things.
Go ahead, tell me.<eos> It was something like ten days ago.<eos> I get of the subway at Grand Boulevard.<eos> I went to a cafe and they were there.<eos> He was holding her hand.<eos> Then...<eos> Yesterday...<eos> Yes, yesterday...<eos> They were in the same cafe.<eos> On the terrace.
Probably, but it's also a hallmark of hernia repair.<eos> I just checked medical records - the baby died at six weeks from a heart defect.<eos> Andrea had tried IVF on and off for ten years when she got pregnant.<eos> They buried their daughter at Ewell Garden of Rest.<eos> Two junctions along from the service station, three from the hotel.<eos> Sleep.<eos> Drive.<eos> Mourn.<eos> But they would've come through it.<eos> Eventually.
Then there's personal experience.<eos> - Of getting shot?<eos> - Of getting married.<eos> Two days before my wedding, I didn't have time to pee.<eos> I, I didn't have you down as married.<eos> I'm not. I was 21 and it was all over extremely quickly.<eos> Right.<eos> No record of Steven Lakhani being stabbed in the arse.<eos> However he was accused of intimidation two years ago.<eos> In what context?
Did you pack one of these?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The Battle of Thermopylae and the Six Day War - common theme - the triumph of the few over the many.<eos> You're interested in history?<eos> I'm interested in strategy.<eos> You pack your clothes like a soldier.<eos> Did someone show you that?<eos> I got it off a website.<eos> But you don't have a computer.<eos> A book, then.
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Meereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.<eos> Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?<eos> When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen?<eos> Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.<eos> Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.<eos> The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed men and the former slaveholders.<eos> All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.<eos> Good.<eos> They did ask for some concessions.<eos> Concessions?
~ No cake!<eos> ~ Well done, Trixie!<eos> ~ Bravo, old thing!<eos> We saved you some streaky bacon.<eos> Oh, marvellous!<eos> Born in a car!<eos> I really do believe that was a first for Nonnatus House.<eos> And very possibly a first for Poplar!<eos> I think we were called to one born on a bus once.<eos> And one on a platform down the Underground.
Now.<eos> Don't forget to tell the foster mother about the knickers.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> You can tell me where my kids are any time you like.<eos> I think you'll find your kids are no concern of yours any more.<eos> I'll have you know I was out working to support them.<eos> Family allowance doesn't go nowhere when a father legs it.<eos> Where exactly do you work, Mrs Teeman?<eos> In a licensed establishment.
~ No, neither do I.<eos> You were booked in for a hospital delivery.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was clean, it was efficient, it was everything I wanted it to be... apart from safe.<eos> The London is excellent.<eos> I can promise you, neither you nor your baby were in any danger.<eos> It didn't feel like that.<eos> I didn't feel safe.<eos> Where do you feel safe?<eos> Here... in my home.
That's the ticket!<eos> That's it!<eos> That's it!<eos> See, you don't need my help.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Do you hear that? !<eos> Isn't that a beautiful sound?<eos> A little boy.<eos> ~ Is he all right?<eos> ~ Very much so.
~ The last of the beef.<eos> ~ Where's mine then?<eos> You get spoiled enough, Dad.<eos> Don't pretend different.<eos> How do you stay so clean in here?<eos> He don't do nothing, that's how.<eos> We don't all need to make a song and dance of an oil change.<eos> I am a model professional.<eos> I like him clean and tidy, Dad, so don't go upsetting me now.<eos> Not in my condition.
Couldn't sleep all night for worrying.<eos> I hope you told 'em we won't stand for it.<eos> ~ Going around arresting decent men.<eos> ~ Marie, please.<eos> Cos it ain't true, is it?<eos> What the copper said?<eos> I don't want him near my garage.<eos> What you tell people about the trial, that's your business.<eos> They won't hear it from me.<eos> Trial?
Excellent.<eos> That's two in one day.<eos> And how is her mother-in-law?<eos> I tried being firm with her - it seemed to work.<eos> Mr Robbins just called - he thinks his wife is in labour - but you've been on your feet since breakfast.<eos> Go and alert Nurse Franklin - she should be ready to take over.<eos> KNOCK AT DOOR<eos> Wakey-wakey!<eos> Trixie?<eos> Oh, Trixie!
I came because I'm a father myself.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Any sons?<eos> One.<eos> And I promised his mother, before she died, I would always keep him safe.<eos> I'm sorry... for your loss... .. but this isn't your business.<eos> Last year, he was almost taken from me... by polio.<eos> So, you see, I know a bit about family promises.<eos> I've let my father down.<eos> By your own measure, yes.
People go to prison for getting rid of babies.<eos> The mothers and the women who do it.<eos> They keep saying it's allowed, if you're sick and they do it in a hospital.<eos> Still a crime if you don't want it done, and we want that baby, don't we?<eos> Do you want it, Vaughn?<eos> I want you.<eos> I just...<eos> I feel like I'm such a liability, needing needles and wee tests every day, and now this...<eos> It's like people say when they get married,<eos> "In sickness and in health."
Oh! Mr Buckle!<eos> No need for formalities, I'm here on a personal matter.<eos> Oh. Cos you said Mrs Gee.<eos> I thought you must've come to check up on my map reading.<eos> I am getting better, but I still find it a bit difficult to tell my left from my right.<eos> ~ At least, if I have to do it in a hurry.<eos> ~ Mrs Gee... ~ Violet.<eos> ~ Violet.<eos> I wonder if you you'd do me the kindness of accompanying me to a function next Saturday night?<eos> Oh. A function...?
~ Anyway, I wanted to show you this.<eos> "Wild Peach".<eos> Isn't it glorious?<eos> I'm hoping Mrs Prendergast has had a better night.<eos> The baby isn't settling, at all.<eos> I don't think those parents have slept for a week.<eos> ~ Oh, poor thing.<eos> ~ Lovely day again, Nurse Crane!<eos> Ooh-hoo!<eos> Like a furnace in here already.
In Poplar in 1960, the midwives of Nonnatus House were on perpetual duty.<eos> New life arrived with every season, at every time of day.<eos> And in the mists and darkness of the autumn... Nearly there, my love.
The Smiths, the Dents and Nonnatus.<eos> DOOR OPENS<eos> I'm always saying what a small world it is.<eos> I'm afraid it's no coincidence that you're all here together, Mr Dent.<eos> Paperwork, is it?<eos> For the babies?<eos> Please sit down.<eos> Our baby's in the hospital.<eos> What's this all about?<eos> The hospital?
I wish I could say you have all the time in the world, but a decision will need to be made over Deborah's surgery.<eos> Surgery?<eos> But she's just a tot.<eos> She needs a great deal of care.<eos> She's very delicate.<eos> She needs her mother.<eos> She needs someone capable.<eos> And you think I'm not?<eos> You never took anything seriously.<eos> Not school, or life.
We have the name tags, the identification records.<eos> I couldn't love Angela more.<eos> Not even if I'd given birth to her.<eos> It's the same as I feel about Timothy.<eos> And if you were in Marion or Shirley's place?<eos> If you had the choice?<eos> So different, what those poor parents are facing.<eos> Angela is ours.<eos> There are a billion other babies out there, but I don't think of them.<eos> Only of her.
Copy.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I'm in, Commander.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Vogel, where are you?<eos> - I'm in the kitchen.<eos> - OK.<eos> Commander, I can't let you go through with this.<eos> I am prepared to cut the suit.<eos> Absolutely not.
~ Does he?<eos> ~ His view is, if two young people wish to be together, what is there to wait for?<eos> Can it be?<eos> ~ Isn't a ghost!<eos> ~ See for yourself!<eos> We 'eard you took a bullet!<eos> Dodged a few.<eos> And got a title?<eos> Cap'n Poldark!<eos> An' the war?
What of them?<eos> Even worse than Grambler.<eos> Derelict, both of them.<eos> Your land?<eos> Barren.<eos> There's nothing for you here, boy.<eos> Your future lies elsewhere.<eos> A change of profession.<eos> The law, perhaps?<eos> Or even the church?
TIM:<eos> You don't mind if I record this?<eos> MAN:<eos> What year were you born?<eos> TIM:<eos> Pardon?<eos> MAN:<eos> Your birth year.<eos> Oh, 1959.<eos> October.
I get ticked off that some people get this nice little boat ride, you know?<eos> Instead I'm in the quicksand with the snakes!<eos> I shouldn't have to put up with it.<eos> TIM:<eos> OK.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, because most people have only seen these things in a book or something like that.<eos> Like a leopard.<eos> The other night on the stairs, I saw one for real.<eos> Where were you?<eos> In the Congo.
It didn't have a name.<eos> It's not as though...<eos> I mean, I've hardly been with...<eos> I got something.<eos> (Kisses)<eos> I couldn't decide between 'ribbed for her pleasure' or... we're not gonna fuck, Tim.<eos> Most people have only seen these things in a book or something like that.<eos> MAN:<eos> The other night on the stairs, I saw one for real.<eos> In the Congo.
I can't do this anymore.<eos> - Do I get an explanation?<eos> - Does it really matter?<eos> - Your husband?<eos> - No.<eos> - Somebody else?<eos> - There's no time for anyone else.<eos> There isn't even time for this.<eos> Then what's the problem?<eos> My kids.
I don't know.<eos> But I'm not above yodeling.<eos> That's Swiss.<eos> Swedes are more into free childcare, herring, and depression.<eos> Check this out.<eos> It's a tattoo Josh did.<eos> Wow.<eos> It says, "You have to see it IRL."<eos> What's IRL?<eos> In real life.
Ah, how you feel, sir?<eos> I'm feeling good. How are you?<eos> Good. Good. You looking to upgrade?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm looking for a truck for fishing in the Keys.<eos> Oh, fishing.<eos> I grew up fishing.<eos> My daddy taught me early.<eos> Yeah, I still do some.<eos> Where, back in Biloxi?
Let us see the desk.<eos> Would you not want to get this ruined?<eos> Do not you say "my guy."<eos> He is not "my guy."<eos> Yes, he is "your guy." Who about are we talking?<eos> We are talking about a guy whom did my client?<eos> So, do not make him "my guy."<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> My point is, the guy insured by your client, He does not deny that any of these things happened.<eos> "These... These things"?

I am a partner in Waters, Cowan and Donovan.<eos> I had been admitted to the New York Bar in 1941.<eos> You had charged with 3 counts and 19 overt acts, conspiracy to transmit United States defense, atomic secrets to the Soviet Union.<eos> Conspiracy to gather secrets. And, failing to register as a foreign agent.<eos> Have many foreign agents register?<eos> If you do not mind my asking, Sir. Since your arrest. Where have you been?<eos> I could not say certainly.<eos> You do not know.<eos> They drove me to an airport. And, put me on a plane, took me off the plane.<eos> Somewhere hot.

Making them prove it matters.<eos> The fiction is...<eos> Whether you did it or not does not matter.<eos> The state has to prove it, that you are a spy.<eos> You are not curious.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I always assumed you were an artist.<eos> My wife, she is the artist.<eos> She is a musician. In the Children's Orchestra of Moscow.<eos> What instrument?

Supply at 1,800.<eos> Inverter?<eos> On, light out.<eos> He was treated as a combatant in that war. Until it no longer suited our government to treat him.<eos> Accordingly. He not gave the protections. We give our own citizens.<eos> He subjected to treatment that, however appropriate for a suspected enemy. It was not appropriate to a suspected criminal.<eos> Fuel transfer?<eos> Transfer switch off.<eos> Destructor?<eos> Destructor safety.
That Rudolf Abel will never do.<eos> Should not we? By give him the full benefit. Of the rights that define our system of government.<eos> Who we are.<eos> Is that the greatest weapon? We have in this Cold War.<eos> Will we stand by our cause less resolutely? Than he stands by his.<eos> The President announced. That a NASA weather plane disappeared four days ago north of Turkey.<eos> And, the Space Administration fears. That its pilot died in the crash.<eos> Radar showed the plane wandering off course. Deep into Soviet territory before contact was lost, complicated any effort to recover it. Or the remains of the pilot.<eos> Now the news out of Washington.<eos> In a close vote today.
Thank you.<eos> - So, I am confused.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do not care whom I talk to... If it is about an exchange of personnel.<eos> Are you the person to talk?<eos> Yes, yes, yes, of course!<eos> We should talk.<eos> Please, have a seat Mr. Donovan.<eos> How did you arrive to the Eastern sector?<eos> The train. The S-Ban.
Abel for Powers you sell to the Soviets.<eos> I am not very sure, the problem is... If the arrangement satisfies two parties, three, or four.<eos> What difference does make?<eos> The arrangement does not satisfy this part.<eos> Now, Mr. Vogel, please...<eos> Obviously, you do not know who with you are dealing.<eos> The interest of the German Democratic Republic.<eos> To deal with... Is it seems dealing with another sovereign power?<eos> The United States.<eos> An equal power.
It was the fellas behind the scenes.<eos> - The intel gatherers, the code crackers.<eos> - Ah, yeah.<eos> I need you to be my West Wing wiretap.<eos> I need you to spy for me.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Selina freezing you out, old-timer?<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Cycle of abuse continues.<eos> Like the Catholic Church.

- I believe I have the skills, ma'am.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Fine.<eos> You do it, Kent.<eos> Okay... what?<eos> Ma'am, today is a very special day.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm building a road map to peace.<eos> Not just that, ma'am.<eos> Not just that.
Yeah, you did.<eos> You just did.<eos> You j... you just said Labor Day.<eos> I said I would never mention that, ever.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Okay, look, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm sorry if I lost my temper a little bit.<eos> I am so sorry for the words that I just spoke.<eos> You know, in...<eos> In a relationship...
My talents are being wasted here.<eos> - I'm like Picasso and I'm stuck painting fences. - Yeah.<eos> Senator Wilkie has been begging to see me.<eos> And lots of other people want meetings, too.<eos> VP Doyle's a lame duck.<eos> And you know what you do with lame animals?<eos> - You care for them.<eos> - You shoot them dead.<eos> Oh, no, yeah, I got you.<eos> Kinder in the long run, actually.
- Yeah?<eos> - It's Ben.<eos> - Hey, what's going on?<eos> - The storm's happening.<eos> Ma'am, you've got to get back to DC faster than a speeding drunk.<eos> Is North Carolina about to be blown off the map?<eos> Yeah, six hours till flying cow time.<eos> This is a potential tragedy that could be great for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> And now the weather.
Jeez, I wouldn't last 10 seconds in a men's room.<eos> But between us, I just think honesty is the best policy.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> So, in that spirit, maybe somebody could now kindly tell me what the fuck is this other data breach.<eos> Uh, Kent?<eos> - Bill? - Hmm?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa there, Trigger.
- Shit.<eos> - Excuse me for one second.<eos> I'm not saying we will, because we won't, but if we do lose and you're an outgoing president, you could...<eos> - I could pardon you? - Yes.<eos> That wouldn't look good.<eos> You'd be the first person to say that.<eos> I'm not entirely sure I would in this circumstance.<eos> - If there's any way...<eos> - Hey, Bill, I got a lot on the line with my presidency right now, so I don't really have time to be thinking about your whatever the fuck it is.<eos> - Probable imprisonment.
- You think you would have won?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> If you had been the candidate, you think you would have won?<eos> - ( laughs ) - 'Cause that's the speculation, you know.<eos> What do you think, Karen?<eos> About something specific, or...?<eos> Should the president and I have swapped roles?<eos> - For?<eos> - For the election.<eos> This election.
Well, this is a long glass of frozen strawberry fuckup.<eos> Hey, listen, Ben, you've got to do something.<eos> I don't want to be a bagman for the toughest guy in D block.<eos> - All right, stop it, Gary.<eos> - Okay, look, get Pierce here.<eos> Okay?<eos> Right now.<eos> I'm gonna take control of this situation that I don't know anything about, right?<eos> Because I am the only one who seems to be...<eos> Capable.
Yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't...<eos> What?<eos> It just doesn't seem worked out to me.<eos> Well, I mean, it was worked out enough to win TechCrunch Disrupt.<eos> Yes, and congratulations, you won 50 grand, but you're asking us for 200 times that.<eos> Richard, look, we all know about your amazing... compression rate, but let's not be naive here.<eos> You can't expect to just throw money at an algorithm and beat one of the largest tech companies in the world, so why don't you rework this a little and come back in with a little more?<eos> Maybe next week?
Morning.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, two weeks, you guys are now sharing clothes, huh?<eos> What?<eos> It's cute, and I haven't done my laundry in weeks.<eos> Yeah, it's a choice.<eos> What?<eos> If it looks stupid, I'm gonna change it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Fine?
Really?<eos> Yeah, growing up I used to think the pool looked so rock star.<eos> We are swimming in that pool, bitches.<eos> We're doing it.<eos> I will definitely go swimming with you, Doris.<eos> Even though my legs are painfully white at the moment.<eos> Should we check in before we go to the funeral home?<eos> No, I want to see him.<eos> I need to see him.<eos> Oh god.
I don't want to. - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> But I never went and saw my dad's, and I always regretted it.<eos> Oh my god, are you making me feel guilty in a funeral home?<eos> Thank you, that's very classy of you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Oh, wow. Oh my god.
- Yeah.<eos> Is that the boyfriend?<eos> Paddy, let's just... Let's just back up.<eos> - Come on. - Yeah.<eos> - Can we talk? - Yeah.<eos> Right now?<eos> What's up? What's happened?<eos> I saw... fuck.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> At the Farmer's Market.
Yeah, you're gonna believe that from the gay Walter White?<eos> - Or Tron, or whatever you are.<eos> - No, it's Gordon Freeman.<eos> I don't know what it's gonna take to convince this woman that she's in love with me.<eos> - That is so intense.<eos> - Yeah, that's a little intense.<eos> You know what's less intense?<eos> Sonny and Cher karaoke duet.<eos> - Right? Inside, I got a karaoke machine!<eos> - Karaoke!
GILFOYLE: We'll have three main cabinets in the center.<eos> I'll try and pull 220-volt power from the washer-dryer for all the cooling units.<eos> -So you'll need this entire space then? -Yep.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll move my things.<eos> -What? -JARED:<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll have it all in my car in no time.<eos> Wait, Jared, uh, are you living here?<eos> In the garage?
You're obviously Pakistani, but the name Dinesh is Indian, isn't it'?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wow. That's exactly right.<eos> You know, most people, ignorant people, don't even know those are two separate countries.<eos> GILFOYLE: And they don't care either.<eos> - How do you know about my name?<eos> -l'm an Army brat.<eos> My dad was stationed in Karachi when I was a kid.<eos> It was a beautiful place, full of beautiful people.<eos> Kind of like this room, right?
I am a wanderer, and sometimes people offer me hospitality and I sleep on a straw bed, and sometimes I... sleep rough with the cattle for warmth.<eos> It is all one to me.<eos> Is that true?<eos> No.<eos> No, I prefer the straw.<eos> But do not think that I offer nothing in return, hmm?<eos> I tell stories.<eos> Stories about my own travels.<eos> Stories about the gods.<eos> Or both.
This is wrong.<eos> It's wrong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> And nothing happened.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I wanted something to happen.<eos> I wanted something to happen between you and me.<eos> Right there in the water.
Look what I caught!<eos> Look!<eos> Look, by all the gods, look what I caught in my nets.<eos> Thorolf!<eos> My son!<eos> My poor son!<eos> Raud!<eos> They must have drowned, for I can find no marks on their bodies.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> So far out to sea.
Yes, he was a good man.<eos> Judith?<eos> Yes.<eos> What is the matter with you, Judith, huh?<eos> You have been like this for many days now.<eos> Are you ill?<eos> Do you want me to call the physician monk?<eos> No.<eos> There is nothing he can do for my condition.<eos> Condition?
Come the spring, I will be invading a country called Frankia.<eos> And I would like to invite you.<eos> Erlendur, son of Horik.<eos> I have awaited your coming.<eos> If you truly knew what the gods had in store for you, you would go dance naked on the beach.<eos> This year, we shall attack Paris.<eos> This is the River Seine.<eos> Now I don't know where it starts, but it arrives here and it widens.<eos> It widens around this island.<eos> And on this island...
Perhaps it was fated?<eos> And perhaps it is fated that I shall win it back some day.<eos> Lagertha.<eos> I see you are making yourself comfortable here as well.<eos> I have come to join with King Ragnar and you in the attack on Paris.<eos> Whatever else divides us, that simple fact unites us all.<eos> We will fight and perhaps, who knows, we will die together.<eos> And if we don't?<eos> Then we will take care of the future.<eos> My future or yours?
Father?<eos> Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.<eos> You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.<eos> That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.<eos> I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.<eos> Count Odo, I am determined not to quit the city.<eos> Not in its most urgent hour of need.<eos> These next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.<eos> I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage<eos> or belief.
Not without seriously risking losing that mast.<eos> Drop the anchors.<eos> Repair the stay quickly.<eos> I'll get a team, clear the hold.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to divert men away from the prisoners.<eos> We can't leave a saboteur down there.<eos> I don't intend to.<eos> There are men in Whitehall who could potentially find a proposal such as yours to be plausible.<eos> On religious grounds, on economic grounds.
Oh, what?<eos> You're not joining us?<eos> Oh, I wish I could.<eos> Unfortunately, I have this thing with Matt LeBlanc.<eos> Mm.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Everything in this room is free?<eos> Rooms.
It starts with, like, 12 people.<eos> Six people. Yeah.<eos> Six people.<eos> And they're all in these boxes.<eos> Well, they don't start in the boxes.<eos> They, uh...<eos> Oh. Oh, right. Right, right, right.<eos> No, they're not in the boxes yet.<eos> - They start...<eos> - In the chairs.
Six people. Yeah.<eos> Six people.<eos> And they're all in these boxes.<eos> Well, they don't start in the boxes.<eos> They, uh...<eos> Oh. Oh, right. Right, right, right.<eos> No, they're not in the boxes yet.<eos> - They start...<eos> - In the chairs.<eos> In the chairs. (Laughs)
Mm?<eos> ...a certain...<eos> I don't know, maybe I'm crazy... between you and Helen.<eos> Mm-hmm. - Really? - Yep.<eos> - Huh. - Uh-huh.<eos> But you're not...<eos> Mm? Since when?<eos> What's today?<eos> Oh. Oh, my God. Please tell me this isn't just because you work for her.<eos> No! No, no.
You remember mine?<eos> I may have jerked off to it.<eos> - It was good, right?<eos> - Good enough.<eos> I made enough from that one tape to move to Brentwood, and that was just me and some black guy.<eos> Imagine...<eos> I'm not making a sex tape with you.<eos> I'm not talking about now.<eos> I still have the one from...<eos> From what?
Wow.<eos> On the other hand...<eos> full disclosure... he killed 11,000 people... in January.<eos> - This January?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Got ya.<eos> What would I have to do at this thing?<eos> Just show up, schmooze a little.<eos> There might be a group of you singing happy birthday.<eos> What language?

There's optional tours to, like, ancient temples, or you can visit a uranium mine.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you aware that this man is a mass murderer?<eos> Uh, yeah, I've heard some mixed things.<eos> Let me see.<eos> He has killed hundreds of thousands of people.<eos> So I guess the party won't be too crowded.<eos> Jesus Christ, he slaughtered 11,000 people in...<eos> In January.
It was on my nightstand.<eos> Now, when you say to a person, "not inside me," that doesn't give them license to just shoot it the fuck anywhere.<eos> - No, it does not.<eos> - I'm sorry. A little aim...<eos> Is that asking too much?<eos> - Totally fair.<eos> - Stupid bazooka dick.<eos> You know, that was the last guy I was ever with.<eos> And I'm not saying he was the reason, but, ugh, talk about going out with a whimper, literally a whimper...<eos> A whimper and then a fart.
To her, not to me.<eos> Ow.<eos> Try not to move, sir.<eos> Great, so at 86, I'm circumcised.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You like Friends.<eos> Don't let him die in there.<eos> Good luck, Mr. LeBlanc.<eos> - See you on the other side.<eos> - The other side?
Oh, come on.<eos> It's sweet.<eos> Pubie.<eos> Worst pet name ever.<eos> I know.<eos> Scrunch?<eos> Got to go.<eos> Did I ever tell you my dad was in Korea?<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> No, not the war, the country.
Got to go.<eos> Did I ever tell you my dad was in Korea?<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> No, not the war, the country.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> He just disappeared one day.<eos> I'm, like, 14.<eos> I go over to his apartment, and all his shit is gone, just fucking gone.<eos> Months later, we find out he's living in Korea.<eos> Korea?

If i were a dog, i'd be dead by now.<eos> - Hey, look at this. It's the set model for our new show.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're actually building the entire house on the stage.<eos> Three stories, and all these walls come out, So they can shoot from one floor to another.<eos> - Huh. Anyway, you got to see this.<eos> - Well, that's a vagina.<eos> - Yeah. My kid did it.<eos> - Aw, even more disturbing.
- Are you okay?<eos> [swallows] Sorry.<eos> I just don't think he's-- [gags]<eos> - Do you need to-- - mm-hmm.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Do you think she's ever gonna tell us?<eos> - Are we absolutely sure?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - What month do you think she's in?<eos> - 11th?
I can't--<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> You're breathing.<eos> - A key?<eos> After two weeks?<eos> It's just-- it's too much too fast.<eos> Oh, did i tell you?<eos> She already invited me to stanford For her daughter's graduation.<eos> - Aw. - In june.

'cause i got to say, i could totally see that now.<eos> - [sighs] You know... [chuckles]<eos> We don't need to bore your mother with work talk.<eos> - She can't hear anything.<eos> Ma, look out, koreans!<eos> Believe me, if she could hear... [all chuckle]<eos> So susan sarandon?<eos> - Where?<eos> - That she heard.<eos> - Well...
Mm, not for me.<eos> You know Helen.<eos> When she gets an idea in her head...<eos> Please, I am begging you, don't do this.<eos> Come on, we've got history.<eos> Oh, I think we are all aware of our history.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> Because she told you about...<eos> Absolutely not.
- It's Ron.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I don't even recognize that guy.<eos> What's he been in?<eos> Real estate.<eos> He's the agent.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You were on his show.<eos> His show?
You ever ski? What?<eos> No.<eos> I tried it once.<eos> Couldn't walk across the snow for the boards on my feet.<eos> But you told me, ned.<eos> You swore to me.<eos> Yeah, well, guess what.<eos> There are things in this world that we don't know.<eos> Well-- hey, hey!<eos> Easy on the car.
Do you have weapons?<eos> I have a 12-Gauge and a rifle, but I don't really think of them as weapons.<eos> Oh, and also a knife that somebody found at the bar.<eos> It's called a butterfly knife, but it really looks nothing like a butterfly.<eos> This is a serious thing.<eos> Why do you take it so lightly?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Kill him?<eos> People die for less.<eos> At weddings, sometimes.
We're gonna find them.<eos> Ben.<eos> Has there been any more news?<eos> They won't know anything for a couple hours.<eos> Oh, Ben.<eos> Ben, you must take comfort in the fact that you are not alone in this.<eos> There's great strength in unity.<eos> It will carry us through any storm, no matter how fierce.<eos> You told them?<eos> About Amy?
They deserve to know.<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> Ben, have you thought any more about our conversation yesterday?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Everyone wants to hear from you, Ben.<eos> They need to.<eos> This town, it's coming apart.<eos> I'm sure you heard.<eos> There was another attack last night.<eos> Yes, on the fence this time.
~ No, I don't think so, but we could check the house.<eos> ~ Good.<eos> Because if Elias kept this in his safe, it has to be important.<eos> Dwayne?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I've just run ten miles.<eos> Are you trying to keep fit?<eos> No, I was chasing an informant.<eos> Oh. Did you catch him?<eos> Eventually.
Hello?<eos> 'Inspector, I think we've found who got the key cut.'<eos> You have?<eos> Good!<eos> Who is it?<eos> A locker key was cut five weeks ago by Lucy Thomson, Elias's daughter.<eos> Why do you want to search my room?<eos> We've got a witness who says it was you that copied the key that opened the locker on Rue Cassini.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> That key.
Erm... see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, erm, and, er... have a great time.<eos> And don't worry about the film.<eos> No, honestly.<eos> Oh, well, old chap, just means there's more popcorn for us.<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> I wouldn't eat that all at once, you might actually explode.<eos> Right, here we go.<eos> When Harry Met Sally.<eos> Entirely in French.
Got it.<eos> Got it.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> You look tense, Claire.<eos> Maybe you should just focus on the controls.<eos> The key to a happy life is to accept you are never actually in control.<eos> Bird!<eos> You should spend a day at the beach.<eos> Get some sun.<eos> Uh, right, so...
Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?<eos> Afghanistan, sir.<eos> Did your general ever fly into battle with you?<eos> Got it!<eos> Got it.<eos> We have eyes on the target, south of the Aviary.<eos> Proceed and engage.<eos> Come on! Look alive, boys!<eos> Look alive!<eos> 10 o'clock!
I want to see how far you can throw that.<eos> - (kids laughing) - Take it easy.<eos> Rog, I'm on my way to lunch.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> It'll just take a second.<eos> Someone over there accidentally gave notice on our lease and I need you to fix it.<eos> Oh. Well, actually...<eos> Actually what?<eos> You really need to talk to Jim about it.<eos> About what?
~ I'd say Clive of India.<eos> No, no, g-gentlemen, this magic is extremely dangerous.<eos> Consider the condition of Mr Pitt's body and indeed, Lord Nelson's.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> I suppose they must have both come a deal unravelled by now.<eos> But I can furnish more blockades, gentlemen...<eos> All manner of weather spells.<eos> .. and, and, and I-I have in mind a line of sea beacons, magical defences to ensure that these islands can never be invaded again.<eos> However... it is my belief that we should do all in our power, even in a time of war, to ensure that English magic is... respectable.<eos> Er, indeed?
By private transaction or by auction?<eos> Auction.<eos> Mr Strange, please.<eos> Your leaving is of great pain to me, sir.<eos> It is of great pain.<eos> I hope, sir, that your change of heart does not result from any offence I may have given you?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Mr Strange, in the past I've feared the appearance of another magician, but when it happened I was in fact delighted.<eos> I fear I am sending you to the war unprepared.<eos> In which case...
Excuse me?<eos> Hello, I am the magician.<eos> I wonder where in Lisbon I might find Wellington?<eos> LORD Wellington is not in Lisbon.<eos> Well, where am I to find him?<eos> Lord Wellington does not stay in one place, sir.<eos> Lord Wellington goes wherever he is needed.<eos> And Lord Wellington is needed everywhere.<eos> His Lordship's in the Lines, sir.<eos> Ah, the Lines.
Hello.<eos> I'm the magician.<eos> Are you indeed?<eos> Winespill!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> HENS CLUCK<eos> Do you, by any chance, know when Lord Wellington will come back?<eos> I do not.<eos> Lord Wellington is...<eos> In the Lines, yes.
"by spilling a pan of jam upon it."<eos> HE TUTS<eos> Bloody old bitch.<eos> Who is it, then?<eos> Thomas Potter, eh?<eos> Bloody Thomas Potter.<eos> Sorry, Ned.<eos> I am expecting a parcel.<eos> Does she not say anything about me boots?<eos> ~ Boots?
Brains, too.<eos> I'm the archivist, notary, volunteer fire chief and chancellor of the exchequer.<eos> Well, technically, treasurer but since I ordered the business cards, too, who's going to stop me?<eos> Not a lot of town government, huh?<eos> Not a lot of town.<eos> Not much interesting around here.<eos> Et pourtant, je suis interesse.<eos> We should probably ask about that local history stuff.<eos> Je pense Que vous etes interessant.<eos> Or, like, anything at all.
You wanna bring Paris here or you wanna make it feel like you're there?<eos> Don't get me wrong, it's a nice town, just I've got a whole warehouse full of memories of this place.<eos> It'd sure be nice to have at least one wall of memories of somewhere else.<eos> Anything else.<eos> No, I know what you mean.<eos> Like not having a story that doesn't start off, "you remember that night at Jimmy's bar?"<eos> Or "remember that waitress?<eos> Oh, yeah, you remember her because we go to that diner every weekend."<eos> "You remember what happened at the town barbecue?"<eos> "Oh, which one, that one?" "No, the other one?"
Did you do that?<eos> No, I think it's just a... oh, no.<eos> The capacitor was amplifying the harmonics exponentially.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Will it still work?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If this doesn't work the energy won't just blow out the gas lamps.<eos> It's going to blow everything around it.<eos> For how far?<eos> For miles.
This makes me happy.<eos> Happy Mother's Day, Ma.<eos> Happy Mother's Day.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Ma... so, you ready for things to get goin' again?<eos> I got a brand new LED headlamp.<eos> I think we're going to take a little break, darling.<eos> Actually, a long one.
You could have waited to give it to me.<eos> You didn't have to come in the rain.<eos> I couldn't wait.<eos> I was excited over it.<eos> Will you have one with me?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> I'm trying to finish this book I started a long time ago.<eos> - What's it about?<eos> - About Heidegger and fascism.
He doesn't care about his own kids.<eos> I deliver them to him, they don't want to go.<eos> They're crying.<eos> They're crying.<eos> What does Frank do?<eos> He sticks 'em in a corner of the garage he works at.<eos> And they sit underground all day.<eos> I mean, they should be outside, in the fresh air.<eos> And now he's gonna switch custody to Frank?<eos> - On what grounds?

You must've decided that he deserved to die.<eos> And so you stole Rita's keys, and April saw you.<eos> - Hey, listen, come here.<eos> - No.<eos> Come here.<eos> I made the choice to help that woman.<eos> You had it right the other night.<eos> I always said you had a first-rate intelligence.<eos> In the park?<eos> On the bench?
Whoever you are looking for, lady, I can tell you now he's not here.<eos> Signora de' Medici?<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Please, this way.<eos> I am servant to the House of the Medici.<eos> They call me Shbeeb.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> And I know the nature of the services you provided for my husband.<eos> I would do anything for Lorenzo the Magnificent.<eos> Indeed.
Father?<eos> Leonardo, please.<eos> Not now.<eos> I am a banker.<eos> Money is my currency.<eos> There is nothing that cannot be bought.<eos> I say we make them an offer.<eos> A ransom for the survivors, the remaining populace.<eos> I mean... even godless infidels must have a price.<eos> With all due respect,
- I don't know.<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - Trent, I'm conflicted.<eos> - You're conflicted.<eos> - My heart wants one thing and my mind wants another.<eos> - Is there someone else?<eos> - I never see him.<eos> He lives out of state.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Maryland.
- I'll still do anything for you.<eos> That's how stupid I am.<eos> - I know I'll commit murder for you.<eos> - Well, that makes me happy.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I'm glad you came.<eos> - Me too.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> - My parents.
- Seems like you moved on though.<eos> - Ray?<eos> Nate, we're capable of loving more than one person in our life.<eos> One day you'll have someone else and I'll be the one jealous.<eos> - Are you jealous of Trent?<eos> - Should I be?<eos> - We fucked.<eos> - Great.<eos> Lube?<eos> - Same place.
- No.<eos> - Just cuddle?<eos> - Nate, I really shouldn't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because of Ray.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About this.
- Just cuddle?<eos> - Nate, I really shouldn't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because of Ray.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About this.<eos> About last night.
Don't... d-don't try and move.<eos> Don't try and move.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What happened?<eos> You had to go into surgery.<eos> They found some bleeding or... or something,<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> It's okay, though.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Okay.
What will London be like when that one's Lord Mayor?<eos> From Germany.<eos> It came packaged as something else.<eos> I almost sent the boy away.<eos> ~ If you want to know...<eos> ~ I don't want to know.<eos> .. it's Tyndale's New Testament, Liz.<eos> You should read it for yourself.<eos> It's in English - that's the point.<eos> Not Latin.
But that kind... they always weep when they see the hangman.<eos> I did, but... .. with things the way they are with Wolsey, I thought...<eos> Thomas More is here.<eos> Well, I expect you invited him too.<eos> ~ Gracia.<eos> ~ Prego.<eos> Did you want to talk about me, Master More?<eos> You can speak while I'm here, I have a thick skin.<eos> No-one was talking of you.<eos> Of the Cardinal, then?
- Those are her things.<eos> We thought you might like some pears.<eos> They're from our garden in Suffolk.<eos> Pears repeat on me.<eos> Were you planning on staying long?<eos> Not with that din going on.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Still, it's nice to feel we're doing our bit for the homeless.<eos> I'd like to keep it like this. Simple.<eos> - Monastic.
What with all this to-do, I think I'm about to be taken short.<eos> Can I use your lavatory?<eos> No!<eos> The flush is on the blink.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've got a meeting at the BBC.<eos> What about?
Are you all right?<eos> Yeah. It's the van.<eos> - It gets very close.<eos> - I imagine.<eos> You're tall.<eos> My husband was tall.<eos> I'm Mrs. Vaughan Williams.<eos> I won't shake hands. Gardening.<eos> What, the composer'? Greensleeves?<eos> Among other things.
There's some massive birds on the wall.<eos> There never are. There's nothing on the wall.<eos> You're imagining things.<eos> There are.<eos> And there were, lined up on the garden wall, four peacocks from the Hall.<eos> So, boa constrictors in the street, peacocks on the wall. It seems that both at the northern and southern gates of my life stands a deluded woman.<eos> - Except you just said they aren't.<eos> - Aren't what?<eos> - Deluded.<eos> - Well, not in this particular instance.
Whereas my contemporaries lovingly chronicle their first tentative investigations of the opposite sex, or their adventures in the world of journalism, I'm stuck with old ladies.<eos> All right. I'm keeping a sodding notebook. But only on the off chance.<eos> She's not a project.<eos> She's not in the pipeline.<eos> I don't want to write about her.<eos> She's...<eos> She's just something that's happening.<eos> So, what do you want to write about?<eos> I want to write about spies.<eos> Spies?
I'm a busy woman. I'm a busy woman.<eos> Créme brulée.<eos> What was your first play about?<eos> Public school.<eos> Which, more accurately, is what you Americans call private school.<eos> But you didn't go to public school.<eos> No.<eos> But I read about it.<eos> And what was your next play about?<eos> Sex.
Really?<eos> Saying what?<eos> That you couldn't make your mind up.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Anything, really.<eos> It meant in a good way!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, I couldn't make it out at all.<eos> What was it about?<eos> Him, as usual.
That you couldn't make your mind up.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Anything, really.<eos> It meant in a good way!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, I couldn't make it out at all.<eos> What was it about?<eos> Him, as usual.<eos> Not coming clean.<eos> - What about?
Well, why?<eos> Most of my things are clean.<eos> Not ill, your friend?<eos> - No.<eos> - Not going?<eos> - Only to the day centre, apparently.<eos> The children always ask after her.<eos> They used to be so frightened of her when they were young.<eos> One's in Washington now.<eos> The World Bank.
I used to help her out when I could.<eos> It's what Mother would have wanted.<eos> I'm not a saint, just lazy.<eos> - I know she was an ambulance driver.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And she was a nun. Twice over.<eos> Till they got rid of her.<eos> Tipped her over the edge.<eos> She spent some time in an asylum.<eos> Banstead.
Such a bully.<eos> Did she bully you?<eos> She bullies me.<eos> Well, I had her put away.<eos> Incarcerated.<eos> Sectioned is what you'd call it today.<eos> Mind you, she got away from them, too.<eos> - Gave them the slip, ended up in the van.<eos> Does she still play?<eos> Piano?
My confessor.<eos> He said that was another vent the devil could creep through.<eos> So, he outlawed the piano.<eos> Put paid to music generally.<eos> Said dividends would accrue in terms of growth of the spirit.<eos> Which they did.<eos> They did.<eos> How's your mother?<eos> Oh. The same.<eos> Still in the coma?
Tess, people are watching.<eos> I don't care, JT.<eos> I've had it.<eos> Look, I care about you, and I've been taking care of you, but no more.<eos> You have to get over this.<eos> You have to figure it out, all right?<eos> Because God doesn't make mistakes, you're here.<eos> So, figure out the hell why, already.<eos> Nobody beats Tyler.<eos> At anything.
GROANING CONTINUES More than two, less than ten.<eos> If I get out of here now!<eos> So to pass the exam I have to be able to clear a five bar gate.<eos> Have you ever seen a five bar gate in India, let alone a civil servant leaping over it on horseback?<eos> This is how it is.<eos> One thing is given to you, and then another one is taken away.<eos> And it's all her fault.<eos> She's so selfish.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> At work.
How does it feel?<eos> Back at the spot?<eos> I'm certainly glad to be breathing.<eos> I expect you can't remember much about it.<eos> Very little.<eos> Yes, the shock, I imagine.<eos> I heard your... disagreement with your brother.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> I see.<eos> At the house?
Well, you're in no position to ask, Dr Du Maurier.<eos> You ended our patient-psychiatrist relationship.<eos> I lacked the appropriate skills to continue your therapy.<eos> I never found you to be lacking.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't provide you with a suitable substitute for therapy.<eos> Is Will Graham still alive?<eos> Will Graham was not a suitable substitute for therapy.<eos> What was he?<eos> Is this professional curiosity?<eos> Almost entirely.
I assumed he'd introduce me to the leading intellectuals of the day.<eos> This did not happen.<eos> I assumed that he'd acknowledge me in the book I was researching for him, a book on conformity.<eos> He did not finish the book.<eos> It was like drinking from a glass with a false bottom.<eos> I thought there'd be more.<eos> I was thirsty.<eos> Please call me Sholem, I would prefer it.<eos> There's no need to be so stuffy.<eos> In an elevator?
When the letters come back, the percentages, once again confirm expected prejudices.<eos> Pro-white letters get mailed more often in white neighborhoods.<eos> More pro-negro letters get mailed from black neighborhoods.<eos> A variation.<eos> I hire a pilot with a Piper Cub to fly low over Worcester, Massachusetts, spilling lost letters.<eos> They land in trees, ponds, on rooftops.<eos> Not all my ideas are brilliant.<eos> Well, it's not on the front page, strangely enough.<eos> I found it.<eos> Page Ten.
Agree?<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> I love you.<eos> It has winds of 100 km / h south<eos> And they are gaining ground.<eos> Teams remain on the ground.<eos> One must be ready to intervene.<eos> Warn them.<eos> You heard?<eos> On the Job
It's open!<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> Will have you to be strong.<eos> Bailey injured.<eos> She's in the hospital, no electricity.<eos> Must restore power.<eos> We must rescue the girl.<eos> It's understood ?<eos> Is that understood?<eos> At work.
This is just a follow-up on the death you witnessed on the Tube.<eos> We need your DNA and fingerprints.<eos> They'll just be used for this?<eos> Yeah, then destroyed.<eos> Now you swivel your bum round.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's a pretty boy.<eos> Is this the man you're looking for, is it?<eos> - You seen him before?<eos> - On the news.
What are you doing here?<eos> I thought I should be the one to clear you.<eos> 'Cause you're the reason I'm here in the first place?<eos> Well, at least this way you have to see me.<eos> Can we get this over with?<eos> I've got things to do.<eos> What things?<eos> Why are you really here, Ben?<eos> Well, you never gave me a chance to say it, but I am sorry for what happened, Lindy.<eos> For which part?
But Lindy could be out there with a sexual predator cyber-stalker weirdo, and it's my fault.<eos> So, my motto, "Why leave things to chance?"<eos> All I know is, I am sitting here opposite one of the most beautiful girls in this whole place.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Sure.<eos> Bartender, two more, please.<eos> He's pretty cute for a madman.<eos> Yeah, I travel to Europe a lot.<eos> The car shows, you know.<eos> Italy, mostly.
Is it 'cause he called you a hepcat that one time?<eos> Because anyone who would treat you this way is selfish and a coward.<eos> And we've already established he has one massive character flaw, which is that he hasn't chosen you.<eos> - Is this okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> And, finally, if all goes well, your responsibilities might include allocating trend jewelry, and helping us implement our cardigan story for spring.<eos> Oh, my God, I love cardigans, first of all.<eos> Um, also, I really don't want to boast, but I'm a little bit of an expert when it comes to trend jewelry.<eos> And maybe, like, trends in general.
These.<eos> They aren't police issue.<eos> They're novelty.<eos> I am arresting you for shoplifting.<eos> You have the right to retain counsel without delay.<eos> You have the right to free and immediate legal advice from duty counsel.<eos> Your report said cause of death was blunt force trauma.<eos> You sure it wasn't just a garbage can crushing the skull?<eos> Shoplifting.<eos> In Canada.
That's your past life talking.<eos> Don't worry, there's no alcohol on the island.<eos> Michael forbids it.<eos> - What's with the wine barrels then?<eos> - No idea, except it's not wine.<eos> What then?<eos> Better not to ask.<eos> As Michael says, embrace your own path, not your neighbor's.<eos> Amy, hey.<eos> About yesterday...
We should bring him on.<eos> You still think he's gonna ride in and save the day.<eos> I don't need saving, Peter.<eos> I'm a scientist and I use my resources, and one of our best is wasting his time picking apples - and raking leaves.<eos> - You have no idea what he's up to.<eos> Neither do I. And that's a good thing.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> He's your brother.<eos> He killed people, Sarah.<eos> In Paris.
Not one I've ever seen before.<eos> Which means that we have no idea what it's capable of.<eos> - We need to bring Alan in on this.<eos> - Whoa, no, no!<eos> - No, we talked about this.<eos> - Alan...<eos> Farragut?<eos> - He's handled hundreds of investigations.<eos> - He's here?<eos> - On the island?
I've been pregnant for the last 15 months.<eos> Hey Soren, how you feeling?<eos> - Good, I guess.<eos> - The symptoms are clearing up.<eos> - Who wants to go next?<eos> - Lizzie?<eos> Don't try to tell me that you don't know what's going on on your goddamn island!<eos> There are no creatures outside.<eos> - (screaming) - He killed people, Sarah.<eos> In Paris.
- Lizzie?<eos> Don't try to tell me that you don't know what's going on on your goddamn island!<eos> There are no creatures outside.<eos> - (screaming) - He killed people, Sarah.<eos> In Paris.<eos> After Arctic BioSystems, he became obsessed.<eos> Immortality ain't forever.<eos> - Alan Farragut?<eos> He's here?<eos> On the island? - Ah!
Pain is fleeting.<eos> It goes in the hole.<eos> Understand?<eos> Once it's in there, it never escapes.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Never. Never.<eos> I-I-I-I just...<eos> Please. Please, just get me out of here.<eos> The things they want gone go in the hole.<eos> - In the hole.
Oh, so now I'm Sarah now that you need something from me.<eos> I didn't think we'd be here this long, I'm out.<eos> You do know that too much xylitol can actually increase<eos> - your blood-sugar levels, right? - Thanks.<eos> I'll remember that when I go for my PhD in "gummology."<eos> I've got something.<eos> It's definitely a fungus.<eos> It looks like the same one we found in Soren's blood.<eos> Hmmm... Is it in all those samples?<eos> No, only in vials 3 through 9, 15 through 21, and 43 through 48.
To surpass them.<eos> To not just be another portrait on that wall, but... to outshine them all.<eos> You... you need a partner by your side.<eos> A pillar of strength.<eos> Not a sheep to slaughter.<eos> Honor me!<eos> Make me the first in a new line.<eos> You remind me of Abigail, our first mother.<eos> Let me take her place.<eos> By your side.

look at the father's name.<eos> He's listed as the father for every child over the last 400 years.<eos> Has to be a mistake.<eos> Michel Dubois...<eos> It's Michael.<eos> Michael couldn't have fathered every kid in that book!<eos> What if he did and what if it has to do with the pathogen?<eos> Come on, things are intense enough without you screwing with my head.<eos> Look, Kyle, we really need to talk.<eos> About what, a 500 year old man?
They were brought here, stripped of all non-essentials...<eos> - Like teeth.<eos> - Unnecessary.<eos> We didn't want them to chew through their feeding tubes.<eos> They became pure vessels.<eos> And once they bore Michael a child, he would end their path.<eos> Mother...<eos> Michael... the fellowship... it's not about propagating family.<eos> It's about control.<eos> Respect.
- How are you doing, pal?<eos> - Never felt better.<eos> That's good.<eos> I wouldn't want anything else to happen to you while you're here on this island.<eos> The attacks, the illness...<eos> You've had some pretty bad luck since you got here.<eos> Guess so.<eos> But I guess we both know it's not really bad luck, right?<eos> We know who's responsible.<eos> Responsible?
Take something beautiful then destroy it.<eos> And Ilaria never destroyed anything.<eos> Only in service of the greater good.<eos> Jesus!<eos> - You can't believe that, can you?<eos> - Alan, it doesn't matter what I believe.<eos> There's no defeating Ilaria.<eos> in every major city, in every branch of government. I've seen their plans.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that they might be lying?<eos> - About what?
You are my son, my family.<eos> Years at med school couldn't teach me what you did in just one day.<eos> DNA, RNA, the building blocks...<eos> That's not what it is to be human, what it means to be a man, a father.<eos> It's all the things we can't see that make us who we are.<eos> Love, hope.<eos> I want to give you everything my father didn't give me.<eos> Blood is meaningless.<eos> Family... is everything.<eos> Oh, my God!
This is the USS Portledge, you're on a priority military channel.<eos> Sign off immediately.<eos> This is Dr. Kyle Summer.<eos> We need an evac!<eos> I don't care who you are, switch your frequency!<eos> Listen up!<eos> I have a cure for the pathogen that's infecting your ships, so if you want it, you better put somebody on the line that can get me an evac!<eos> Hold for Captain Wilson.<eos> Anne!<eos> Oh, my God...
Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.<eos> He died to save us all.<eos> Do not tell Connie that story.<eos> I won't.<eos> - But you shouldn't forget it either.<eos> - Why?<eos> This cat is DEA.<eos> Mark my words, it will get justice.<eos> My name is everywhere.<eos> Newspapers... magazines...
I guess I'll have to find another girl.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> We're all going to Medellín.<eos> Some of us are even going by plane.<eos> Helena?<eos> Helena.<eos> Whose party is it?<eos> - Oh, God! What was that?<eos> That was like a .38.<eos> - About four blocks away. - Oh...
I fight for the people... not for drug traffickers.<eos> Connie?<eos> Elisa?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> - About what?<eos> You told me your husband works at the embassy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need you to speak with him and warn him.<eos> About what?
Yeah, but two what?<eos> Sergeants or officers?<eos> Officers. You know Poison.<eos> - Officers are a million each.<eos> - OK, so two million?<eos> - Yes, I'm writing it down here.<eos> - OK, talk to you later.<eos> All right.<eos> What were you talking about?<eos> Just business.
Good morning, ladies.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I'm American.<eos> I don't speak Spanish.<eos> You speak Spanish?<eos> Yes.<eos> I asked where you are headed.<eos> - Popayán.<eos> - Popayán?
right there.<eos> You want me to create an embassy ID?<eos> - Who is this woman?<eos> - What I want you to do is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy and help someone stay alive.<eos> You really think I'd be asking you if it wasn't important?<eos> She's my informant.<eos> And she could be the key to bringing down the whole Medellín cartel, so come on, Colleen, whose side are you on?<eos> Cousin, what happened?<eos> Where were you?<eos> - In the office.

Along with an innocent woman.<eos> OK.<eos> Poison will be at La Dispensaria at around midnight with his crew.<eos> Who's your contact at the embassy?<eos> Did you know she had two kids?<eos> What do you think our newspapers will think of that?<eos> Our government doesn't take too kindly to American-backed death squads.<eos> I could blackmail you with these pictures.<eos> You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail...<eos> maybe here in Colombia.
He started this fucking war.<eos> Are we going to negotiate or not?<eos> As part of Escobar's surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded, and Colonel Carrillo was transferred out of the country.<eos> For the time being, Carrillo's war was over.<eos> I don't see why they're sending you to Spain.<eos> It's not like the cocaine war is over.<eos> Galeano and Moncada are fronting for Escobar.<eos> My superiors say I play too rough.<eos> At least Escobar is in jail and... you can leave knowing you helped put him there.<eos> Jail?
Everything OK?<eos> - Boss, we have a problem.<eos> - What problem?<eos> You remember that Moncada and Galeano had a large shipment - that was seized in Boyacá?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - 250 kilos.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Can you imagine, a farmer found three million dollars buried in a field?<eos> Do you know where that was, boss?<eos> In Rionegro.
I want my husband back.<eos> If Pablo told Tata that they left... it's because they left.<eos> Listen...<eos> Pablo is your kids' godfather.<eos> He would never hurt them.<eos> Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.<eos> There are rumors that he killed Galeano and Moncada.<eos> Where, in jail?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> "In jail."
Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Oh. - I had to stop on the way.<eos> Slurpees and nachos do not mix.<eos> Unh-unh. Get a bubble gut.<eos> - You know what I'm talking about.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What's up, Junior?<eos> How you doing?<eos> - Zoey. Hey.<eos> - Hey.
No, we must turn our attention to the life and magic of the Raven King,<eos> ~ and when we do... ~ I am sorry, Mr Strange. That is the one thing we must not do.<eos> I am serious.<eos> I tell you this as a friend.<eos> Too much talk of other kings is bound to make the Government nervous.<eos> How can we restore English magic until we know what it is we're supposed to be restoring?<eos> We do not require English magic to be restored any more than it already has been.<eos> Leave John Uskglass in the obscurity Mr Norrell has placed him.<eos> Norrell has poisoned your minds.<eos> Literally, in your case.
It takes a great man to drive a car such as this.<eos> Right, son? Huh?<eos> It's terrific, really.<eos> Especially if you're going to invade Iraq.<eos> Yeah, which we should do, so where am I parking?<eos> Park it on the street.<eos> - Park it on the street?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - On the street?
Now get outta here.<eos> Mia?<eos> You know I'm right, Mia.<eos> What was that all about?<eos> So maybe Andy's in another universe with dinosaurs, or something?<eos> Without a talisman we have no way of contacting him again.<eos> Right.<eos> Talisman.<eos> Where did that come from again?<eos> The other universe.
- Sorr...<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - Hey, what are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - You're in shot, Sergeant.<eos> - Yeah, and you're out of line.<eos> We're doing everything we can to find Andy Lau.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah - yeah, you tell her, Sarge.<eos> Really?
Which makes the intersection the... woodwork room.<eos> I spent two years in this room.<eos> I never saw any talisman.<eos> Two years?<eos> You failed woodwork?<eos> Shelves are tricky. (Laughs)<eos> Let's stay on task, shall we?<eos> If I were a talisman, where would I hide?<eos> Is there anything that doesn't belong?<eos> Anything out of place?
- Right, right, right.<eos> - Yeah. Hmm. - Yep, you're right.<eos> You know what?<eos> Follow me. We'll check out the ravioli attachments for his pasta maker.<eos> Lincoln has a pasta maker?<eos> No way. Yeah, you don't know about this?<eos> The homemade pasta.<eos> He makes a different kind every Sunday night.<eos> It's on his blog.<eos> What blog?
How are you?<eos> Glad to see you.<eos> I can see that... You've got an erection.<eos> Come in!<eos> No wonder I get criticized at neighbors' meetings!<eos> Don't you remember Truman?<eos> He won't bite you.<eos> Truman, your uncle's afraid of you.<eos> Where's your luggage?<eos> At the hotel, at the end of the street.

Which one should I put? - What for?<eos> - To put him up for adoption.<eos> Do you want to put him up for adoption?<eos> Of course. What should I do?<eos> What about your cousin?<eos> No, not Paula.<eos> She lives in a small apartment, she has a cat.<eos> I'm worried, really.<eos> I haven't told him yet.<eos> - What?
What kind of burial?<eos> Who's the deceased?<eos> - Me. - Oh. It will be me.<eos> He accompanies me and helps me with all the procedures.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> One moment, please.<eos> Will you come with me, please?<eos> What had you arranged with my colleague?<eos> Well, nothing, in fact.
You can thank charlie manson for that.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm sure you can get a ride back with somebody by the end of the week. You're all paid up.<eos> People just come and go<eos> And no one says good-bye?<eos> I'm sorry, but people are free To come and go as they please.<eos> Ihaveperson topersoncall Forpeggyolson fromdonalddraper. This is peggy olson.<eos> I accept.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> Somewhere in california.
I Will.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna let you go, okay?<eos> Have a safe flight.<eos> I'll call you when I get to Houston.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Bobby!<eos> Oh, God.
I'm gonna need this back.<eos> I heard your dad's in the hospital.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Thanks, Cece.<eos> No one calls me that anymore.<eos> Better not leave town without saying goodbye.<eos> Since you were here last month, I've filed requests for impact studies and the full battery of permits.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I've compiled a comprehensive calendar to fulfill<eos> - federal, state and county regulations. - Okay.
No, I just wanted to say I think that Lou Bianco story's a dead end.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Your new story about the mafia boss who's going to prison for bribing the congressman.<eos> I just started working on that.<eos> How did you...<eos> Did you seriously just hack into my wordpress while I was getting coffee for both of us?<eos> Yeah, sorry, I didn't realize you were getting some for me too.<eos> Yeah, because I felt bad about what a bitchy thing I said earlier about your story.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Really?
Thank you.<eos> I guess the upside to having everything go wrong in your life is that you cease to have any expectations of anything or anybody.<eos> And that's an unbelievably mature thing for a person your age to say.<eos> It's just great.<eos> I guess the thing that's bothering me the most is that I have no idea what's coming next.<eos> - Mm. - I've never felt that way before.<eos> Like, I don't even know what I want to have happen.<eos> You were writing it as career option, how was that?<eos> Was it fulfilling?<eos> Fulfilling?
Wait for the test results.<eos> You don't actually buy Dad tipping out of the boat bullshit? Seriously.<eos> You need to calm down.<eos> I'm gonna cancel the ceremony.<eos> I'll call the staff and get the place ready for tonight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll deal with him.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Absolutely.
I just--<eos> I got my own personal thing, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - I have a few questions about those men.<eos> Okay.<eos> Were they--?<eos> Were they on the land or in the water or what?<eos> In the water.
Hey, hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Why aren't you at the hospital?<eos> - I need to talk to Danny.<eos> - He's not here.<eos> - Kevin called, said he would be.<eos> He said he had the--<eos> Fuck.<eos> You and I are gonna have a conversation.<eos> What about?

What are you doing?<eos> Jane's teaching Vega balance.<eos> Oh, that's useful.<eos> - How long?<eos> - 43 seconds.<eos> Don't think.<eos> If you have to think, thinking about dropping will lead to dropping.<eos> What should I think about?<eos> Anything.<eos> S'mores.
Uh Jimmy called three days ago.<eos> He said that I might hear from some people that he was in town, but if anyone asked, I should say I don't know where he is.<eos> And you didn't think that was suspicious?<eos> I figured whatever Jimmy got into, he could handle it.<eos> Not all of us are cops, T.<eos> And was anybody with him?<eos> We went to mom and dad's house to look for him, and somebody jumped Jane.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> You okay? Oh, yeah.<eos> Right as rain.
Later.<eos> Get in.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're recording me?<eos> You gonna read me my rights first?<eos> I have to put this on record.<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> What were you doing in Dallas the night Nathan Barnes was killed?<eos> You're gonna be mad.<eos> Jimmy.
I mean, here's the thing with cards.<eos> It's like a showdown in the Wild West -- kill or be killed.<eos> I mean, who doesn't love that?<eos> It's nothing like that at all.<eos> You know, I might know of a game -- big one.<eos> 5 grand buy-in.<eos> Is that something that might interest you?<eos> Deal me in there, partner.<eos> Jane's in the game.<eos> The Wrightwood Hotel?

Suit yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Amber.<eos> Are you sure you're not psychic?<eos> That is the one thing I am very sure I am not.<eos> 'Night.<eos> Good night.<eos> I feel like this is a job that will be replaced by robots someday.<eos> Someday soon.
If I was a shaman, I would tell you that to complete a tupilaq according to all the old rituals, the creature must be finally baptized in the blood of a murderer.<eos> Do you follow me?<eos> Otherwise it will have no power.<eos> Now... where would a shaman lay his hands on half a pint of murderer's blood?<eos> May I join you?<eos> This is a 20-year-old mossbank single malt whiskey.<eos> Distilled on the banks of...<eos> Dumfries and Galloway since 1788.<eos> And they have it here.<eos> In Fortitude.
You don't know me.<eos> My name's Elena.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> What happened.<eos> Not your dad's fault.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I'm so sorry, Liam.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It was Christmas day when we landed in Scotland.<eos> Prestwick.
Can't be stopped. Just keeps on coming.<eos> Anybody tries to get in its way, It goes right through 'em.<eos> Like you, dad.<eos> Yes, like me.<eos> What the hell Are you doing in my house?<eos> I fucked up.<eos> What happened?<eos> Frank Sutter.<eos> I arrested him.<eos> In the hotel.

To identify whose blood is on frank's t-shirt, We need to make a DNA comparison.<eos> I don't have time to send samples to the mainland.<eos> I don't have the equipment or the necessary skills.<eos> What about the biology department at the research institute?<eos> Stoddart's department.<eos> They would need tissue From professor Stoddart as well.<eos> An eyebrow follicle-- that is usually<eos> What we send to the forensic lab on the mainland.<eos> It doesn't hurt When you yank it out of the head.<eos> Although, obviously, In this case...

Why do you think he didn't tell you that?<eos> Frank didn't say anything about any blood.<eos> We-we went...<eos> We took Liam to the hospital when he started to scream.<eos> Why was he screaming?<eos> 'cause he had frostbite. - Frostbite?<eos> - Where<eos> Did he have frostbite?<eos> Uh, on his feet.<eos> On his feet?
He said he'd have to rewrite his report.<eos> What report?<eos> Hildur's Glacier Hotel.<eos> She can't go ahead without government say-so.<eos> The government's waiting on Charlie's impact report.<eos> Charlie said in his message that he'd found something that changed everything.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's start with wind chimes and infidelity.<eos> What about them?
I was attacked, assaulted.<eos> Look at that.<eos> He had ahold of me, and that search and rescue guy laid into me.<eos> Jason, can you give us an account with witnesses, if possible, of your whereabouts throughout Friday and into Friday evening?<eos> No, I don't think I can.<eos> Between 7:00 and 7:30.<eos> I was with my brother Ciaran in his shop arguing about money.<eos> Bring Ciaran Donnelly in.<eos> Tell us about this.<eos> That?
When I was a boy, we used to go down to the beach.<eos> One time, during the war, We found an American airman sitting down there<eos> All alone outside his tent, Just staring at the sea.<eos> We cheeked him.<eos> "hey, mister, Why aren't you flying your plane?"<eos> And he said he was just about to go on his last mission.<eos> Packed up, gave us what was left of his food, And we watched him head off. Just like that.<eos> No lonely impulse of delight,<eos> No rage at the dying light,<eos> Just matter of fact.
You.<eos> You made them do it.<eos> PFAs were present in Shirley Allerdyce, around 70 parts per million.<eos> You think that's what caused Shirley to attack her mother?<eos> We're seeing a pattern.<eos> Well, the beginnings of a pattern.<eos> These toxins are present in the brains of both the bear and Shirley.<eos> It's more than just a coincidence.<eos> So what's next? I propose we carry out another test.<eos> On what?

The trouble with larva is you don't know what they are till they pupate and hatch.<eos> If larvae passed into a living host, then that host is food.<eos> The larvae develop inside, feeding off the living tissue of the host.<eos> Dr. Allerdyce.<eos> Inside her. Th-That's what's keeping her alive.<eos> Vincent, no cutting open live people. It's unethical.<eos> We have to have a look at her.<eos> That's all, nothing invasive.<eos> No cutting.<eos> None whatsoever.
You can't run forever, Ethan.<eos> There's a moment, a moment you realize you are no longer the hunter, you are the prey.<eos> If you have been touched by the demon, it's like being touched by the back hand of God.<eos> Makes you sacred in a way.<eos> There are things within us all that can never be unleashed.<eos> What do those people do?<eos> Those who have been chosen?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Not inside the house.
How do you do?<eos> Doctor.<eos> Charmed.<eos> So you're the chappie who's going to translate the mythical language?<eos> Not so mythical as you think, young man.<eos> The Verbis Diablo, the Devil's Tongue, has roots as old as Aramaic and likely much older.<eos> It was an oral tradition for the most part like most now dead languages.<eos> We haven't entirely lost it, we've just forgotten it.<eos> And if I were to tell you it's spoken now?<eos> In London?
I'll have you know my hair is completely real.<eos> So regale me.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I can misdirect them as you see fit.<eos> No.<eos> Let her follow the bread crumbs to me.<eos> And your interest in Miss Ives?<eos> That wicked cunt is of no concern of yours.<eos> Tell me about him, though.<eos> The man.

No, they weren't here.<eos> I can't tell anymore.<eos> Take it easy, you're all right.<eos> I thought I saw them, but they weren't there.<eos> I can't tell the difference, whether they're real or in my head.<eos> I can't live with this anymore.<eos> But they're in my prayers now.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> Safe?
I said I didn't know.<eos> She asked if she must love you now.<eos> I told her it was up to her entirely.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> - Was I wrong?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> No, she must... care for me of her own accord.<eos> And did she speak of my face?<eos> In what way?
I'm not that good a shot.<eos> We used shotgun pellets in the show.<eos> Well... these aren't pellets.<eos> And I'm not in the show.<eos> You lived in the Mariner's Inn.<eos> Did I?<eos> You registered September 25th last year.<eos> Must have then.<eos> - Where do you live now?<eos> - Elsewhere.
How can I help?<eos> There was something different about the Mariner's Inn.<eos> There was a survivor.<eos> I can honestly say I've never met a woman like you.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I care for who you are, not what you wear.<eos> I was having coffee with a friend.<eos> He's in love with someone, though I don't know he knows it.<eos> She touched his hand.<eos> And on his face...
That's awfully public.<eos> Perhaps discretion.<eos> Anathema.<eos> In this house, we celebrate the unusual.<eos> We set the tune, and the world follows.<eos> That's a reckless philosophy.<eos> But exciting.<eos> The thrill of the forbidden?<eos> There's nothing to match that.<eos> In fact...
That takes more than a drop of poison.<eos> That takes everything... doesn't it?<eos> Such a price we pay.<eos> Such a price.<eos> Despite what you may think... I didn't turn from God.<eos> He turned from me.<eos> From all of us.<eos> Look around.<eos> You tell me, where is He... in this city of perpetual suffering?<eos> In this life?
Just so I can retain my unique bond with him?<eos> It's selfish.<eos> My God, let him be happy.<eos> Wood betony attracts bees for honey crushed and put into your pillow, it prevents nightmares.<eos> - Get a lot of that. - Heh, heh.<eos> When I was with Miss Croft I was more content than I ever thought I could be.<eos> For once in my life, I didn't feel like running away.<eos> I felt I had a place to belong.<eos> She was your moors your solitude.<eos> In a way.
What did she say?<eos> Ask her yourself.<eos> I am not so sentimental as my mother.<eos> Where is the future, Mr. Lyle?<eos> With her age or my youth?<eos> Whatever she promises you is a lie.<eos> Whatever I promise you is a lie but you'll live longer with me.<eos> Now... tell me about Mr. Chandler.<eos> Did you catch one?<eos> In Africa?
You have a tripod of rifles at your window.<eos> Well, can't I decorate my own house as I see fit?<eos> Any way you like.<eos> - Do you live here alone?<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> I have... a ward and my man Sembene.<eos> - Other servants?<eos> - No.<eos> In a house this large?
Yes.<eos> Yeah. You watched her rather carefully, I'd say.<eos> Did I?<eos> Of course you did.<eos> She was always your favorite.<eos> It's good we care for our daughters.<eos> Mind her, she stings.<eos> I'll leave you two to catch up.<eos> One other thing.<eos> Our theme for tonight, yes?
Our father left you to die from neglect and his lust for glory... but with me, he actually looked into my eyes and pulled the trigger.<eos> With my arms outstretched, defenseless before you.<eos> Not many men can claim to have killed all their children.<eos> You're not real.<eos> You are not here!<eos> We're here as long as you are.<eos> Do you think you can forget us?<eos> I have faced down graver threats than those conjured from my memory!<eos> Oh, well said, Malcolm.<eos> How like you.
Much like your addiction to God.<eos> I'm sorry she hurt you.<eos> I'm sorry you feel so unloved.<eos> You are a beautiful monster.<eos> And there are those who could love you... and shall.<eos> Life awaits you.<eos> - The cellar again?<eos> You should tell Miss Ives.<eos> I think she knows, in her way.<eos> Not everything, but... enough.
Stop it.<eos> Cousin, how you look.<eos> Are you quite all right?<eos> - Would you like to sit down?<eos> - Spare me your gallantry.<eos> Lily, you must come home.<eos> I am home, darling.<eos> Really, doctor.<eos> Lily's not a girl for tenement garrets, now, is she?<eos> On the South Bank, no less.
I might have an idea how to raise the funds.<eos> I've been around long enough to know that there are two sides to show business.<eos> Through my Hollywood connections, I know of a certain collector who's fascinated with freak shows.<eos> Now, this... person is willing to pay a lot of money for memorabilia connected to... your business.<eos> I have nothing from the show.<eos> You have your hands.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your claw.
Done.<eos> And I want to get rid of people keeping us apart.<eos> But this time you have to do the dirty work.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're a magician.<eos> You're going to saw those twins in half.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There's something I have to show you.<eos> Jesus, Desiree.
You got that, chickies?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have a luncheon engagement... at home.<eos> Tell me-- what have you been doing since Florida?<eos> I'm sorry that I had to run off the way I did, but... you know my motto:<eos> always leave them wanting more.<eos> I left when you left.<eos> Please, let's sit.<eos> I went to, uh, Nevada.<eos> Nevada? Ah.
All right. Well, I'm around.<eos> Don't forget to take the pie Tammy made you.<eos> Sorry to bother you, but my TV just died.<eos> Oh, well, we'll get you a new one.<eos> Soon as I'm done fighting this battle.<eos> There you go.<eos> Then it comes loose.<eos> You're the quick brown fox.<eos> Did you learn to type in the army?<eos> No, night school.
This is a Church, remember?<eos> It's disgraceful!<eos> Oh, you find language disgraceful but not this?<eos> Well, I...<eos> The parish council's not here to make a quick buck for somebody who already has more than enough.<eos> We are the guardians of something unique.<eos> We are the custodians and the stewards of a shining principle.<eos> We do not turn our backs and look away from people in need.<eos> Our vote is in response to a simple question enshrined in law.<eos> In law.
You know how much it costs to remove a child.<eos> The daughter copes.<eos> Robbie stays.<eos> Not every case is Rosie Frankham.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Manage the situation.<eos> I'm sorry, but I must get on.<eos> Two minutes, yeah?<eos> Just like that?<eos> In the road?
~ What goes on in our house?<eos> Nothing goes on!<eos> Dad...<eos> Dad!<eos> I have done you a hot milk and honey.<eos> I put a tot of brandy in it.<eos> Come and drink it before it gets a skin.<eos> ~ I don't want to be buried!<eos> ~ What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, God.
You did, yes.<eos> I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened.<eos> Your life seemed pretty hectic.<eos> Is that the rest of the story?<eos> That I stood you up?<eos> You were going to ask me something.<eos> That's why you wanted to have lunch.<eos> Ron, you were going--<eos> - I was gonna ask you for a job.<eos> In the federal government.

Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.<eos> - No.<eos> - Isn't that your motto?<eos> "Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?"<eos> Totes.<eos> And I hope that you can see now that there's nothing scary about Gryzzl.<eos> I mean, we just wanna learn everything about everyone and track them wherever they go and anticipate what they're about to do.<eos> These are really interesting issues, Roscoe.<eos> I think maybe we could debate them, you know?<eos> - On TV.
We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate, and then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.<eos> Exactly, but more importantly, we change the idea of what a pie is.<eos> I feel like that's not more important, but I-I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Picture this.<eos> Crust on the bottom, filling, crust on top.<eos> What am I describing?<eos> A pie.<eos> No, but you're in the right zone.<eos> - Calzone!
Things.<eos> Things, Donna.<eos> Our favorite.<eos> Well, where is Bluntz taking us?<eos> This is not the way to the mall.<eos> That's 'cause we're not going to the mall.<eos> We're finally gonna do something we've always talked about.<eos> No way.<eos> Treat yo' self.<eos> ♪ In Beverly Hills! ♪
What?<eos> Well, no, I am not a liar.<eos> I have never lied about anything in my life.<eos> Though I suppose you could construe camouflage as a lie.<eos> What is happening right now?<eos> Tom wanted to convey that he likes you a great deal.<eos> So he said that he could imagine marrying you. And living on an island with your kids.<eos> Wait, now we're on an island?<eos> With kids?<eos> - Plural?
Anytime your name comes up, I panic and change the subject to the Twin Peaks reboot 'til she gets bored.<eos> So you talk for one second?<eos> You're gonna spend the next couple days with her.<eos> If you talk to her directly and honestly, she can be surprisingly open-minded.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Hey, Leslie, um, I was thinking about changing the font on the itineraries.<eos> What do you think?<eos> What?<eos> Why? On what grounds?
And this is gonna be our bench.<eos> April, we have a bench in D.C.!<eos> I'm sorry, Leslie, I can't do this anymore.<eos> I don't want to work in government.<eos> I quit.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You quit?<eos> Why?<eos> Because, honestly, I don't even know if I like working in national parks.<eos> Or government.
I know we're kind of diving into this thing, but I think it's cool.<eos> I'm looking forward to the getting to know you part...<eos> Because I want to know you.<eos> They're here.<eos> Who?<eos> Come see.<eos> What's Jerick doing here?<eos> Aiden rounded up the most influential wolves so they could talk.<eos> About what?<eos> About them.
You're the threat.<eos> You're so paranoid that you can't see that this wedding can help her.<eos> She can come home.<eos> The wolves will be on our side.<eos> The wolves cannot be trusted.<eos> In your paranoid mind, nobody can be trusted.<eos> Where does it end?<eos> There is no end!<eos> Need I remind you I killed my own father in order to protect her?<eos> Really?
Listen, if you talk to Marnie, could you have her give me a call or just come to my place...<eos> Hannah's place?<eos> Um, okay, end of message.<eos> Maybe we should just leave and let her stay here.<eos> No, no, you don't know Hannah.<eos> She'll stay in there until we have a new president.<eos> She's stubborn as fuck and likes to be in bed a lot.<eos> Would it help if I talk to her?<eos> I'm really good in a crisis.<eos> No fuckin' way.
- I get that.<eos> - Why would you say that?<eos> I'm not exactly Patrick Dempsey over here, you know?<eos> I get that, but I reject the idea that I'm some sort of hideous troll whose photo you wouldn't want in your wedding album.<eos> - Here, let me see this.<eos> - I don't think you're a hideous troll.<eos> - Ow. - No, I'm not.<eos> That's what I'm... when you say that I'm not, it sounds like you think that I am, though, which is hurtful.<eos> I actually think it was the age difference.<eos> The age difference?
This actress, she violated her parole by leaving the fucking house to score, I guess.<eos> Swerves into traffic high, freaks,<eos> I'm getting flushed.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Administrative leave with pay just until IA finishes.<eos> The Black Mountain work, do you know how hard they're looking?<eos> You got a little vacation, that's all.<eos> Comes back around about this girl, and it will, you'll be reinstated.<eos> Back on the bike?
God damn.<eos> You don't have any feeling, your daughter doing that?<eos> Well, what would you have me do, Antigone?<eos> Since I've never been good at guessing your needs.<eos> Maybe talk her into doing something with her life.<eos> Maybe convey some guidance, some values she could carry.<eos> We have always disagreed here.<eos> I am not comfortable imposing my will on anyone and I haven't been since 1978.<eos> Not even to stop them walking into a river.<eos> Yes, not even then.
Yeah. She's gonna see what she can do.<eos> She said, you know, don't get my hopes up.<eos> Is your dinner okay, Ray?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You want something else?<eos> No, thank you, darling.<eos> You seeing anybody?<eos> A woman?<eos> There something else I'd be seeing?<eos> Nah, not interested in anything like that anymore.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Parties are fun, right?<eos> Is this what happens at every party?<eos> Every party I'm at.<eos> Excuse me, ding-a-ling, coming through.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My boyfriend, he's cheating on me.<eos> Your boyfriend is cheating on you?<eos> Where the fuck is that dingbat?<eos> Des Moines.
Hey!<eos> Is that our wheelbarrow?<eos> It's the prison's.<eos> I can use it.<eos> You can use it, and you can return it!<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I just want to enjoy the simple things.<eos> And you can, while we also rent out the cornfield for sex!<eos> Nothing like being down on your hands and knees, huh?<eos> In... in the soil.
You get what you pay for.<eos> When are you gonna realize that you don't get to do whatever you want because it makes you feel good?<eos> Oh, my God. You are such a hypocrite.<eos> No!<eos> You crossed a line!<eos> - I did? !<eos> - Yes!<eos> Do you think that this is what I want?<eos> ! To be here in this...<eos> in this grocery store?
Yeah.<eos> Right outside.<eos> He smells good, too.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> No.<eos> - What?<eos> We know where you can find drugs.<eos> You ratting someone out?<eos> Yeah, but not one of us.<eos> One of youse.
It's gonna be a long day for you, Rabbi.<eos> Got over 70 inmates keeping kosher now.<eos> Out of?<eos> - Two hundred-something.<eos> - Wow.<eos> You brought in a rent-a-rabbi.<eos> Well... technically, all rabbis are for rent, if you think about it.<eos> Weddings, bar mitzvahs.<eos> You know, this one just specializes in corporate inquiry.<eos> Corporate inquiry...
Let me lay it all out for you.<eos> The whole brood of Hayes, we lived under the Cyclone on Coney Island, right?<eos> Brooklyn in the house. A-yo!<eos> And, uh, oh, I was always a nervous kid growing up, always worrying about the universe expanding, and... and so, my parents took me to a shrink, and the shrink was like, "Cindy, quit your worrying.<eos> The universe be chilling for another billion years."<eos> But I couldn't stop worrying and cooking lobsters and hanging with women in suspenders.<eos> I see you're familiar with Annie Hall.<eos> - Annie who?<eos> - I see.<eos> Okay, okay, okay. Anyway... anyway...
- The bag said "Irish stew."<eos> Looks like the fajitas.<eos> One kosher meal, please.<eos> - Your name isn't on the list.<eos> - You didn't even look at the list.<eos> It's a short list.<eos> Do you want this or not?<eos> Yeah, hit me.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> - Not on the list.
Although, they were... kind of right.<eos> Say you expand to 16 panty girls and you go down to two days per pair of panties, that's 48 pairs of panties per week.<eos> Times that by $75 each, and you have a gross amount... of...<eos> Holy fuck!<eos> What?<eos> $3,600 a week.<eos> Wow.<eos> But two days per panty, wouldn't that be more than three pairs per week?<eos> Yeah, but you should give them a day off...<eos> - for the Sabbath. - Oh.
Y'all don't know about that slave life.<eos> We makin' a dollar an hour.<eos> That's like 10 times what we got before.<eos> But the other jobs are about prison upkeep.<eos> The Whispers people are profiting from this.<eos> - I'm okay with that. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Me too.<eos> Your oatmeal's getting cold.<eos> Do you know anything about birds?<eos> What, like birds in general?
Mash. Tells your future, right?<eos> Mansion, apartment...<eos> shack, house! Yes! Yeah.<eos> You draw your spiral.<eos> And then you count your lines. And you get your magic number.<eos> And there it is... your whole life.<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> I always ended up living in the shack.<eos> Chapman probably lived in a mansion.<eos> - In the game or in real life?
I always ended up living in the shack.<eos> Chapman probably lived in a mansion.<eos> - In the game or in real life?<eos> - In real life.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It was hardly a mansion.<eos> How many bathrooms?<eos> Four?<eos> Or five. There was a half bath off the playroom.<eos> The playroom?
You know, Neri smells different, and she's just talking about getting pregnant. Wait.<eos> Are you really gonna start a whole criminal enterprise - from behind bars?<eos> - It's not drugs. It's underwear.<eos> I like your spirit.<eos> I-I am concerned that you know all of this.<eos> I'm a generalist.<eos> Hey. Chapman. - Yeah?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You think that growing up with all that money was good for you?<eos> - In what way?
I submitted your request to Tim in HR, and Tim said he likes books.<eos> So we're 100 percent behind the idea of a library.<eos> It's just hard to justify the expenditure when we can get books as donations.<eos> Are we gonna get the specific books that help the inmates with their case work as donations?<eos> What about allotments for higher education and new job training?<eos> I would like to see all of that happen.<eos> But you are one small head on a many-headed hydra.<eos> I'm gonna bring up all these things at the meeting today.<eos> Meeting?<eos> In... in Utica.
Ah, you don't know anything.<eos> You're happy, but you can't say it 'cause you gotta hate me.<eos> You said keeping the baby was the worst thing for her.<eos> Yeah, well, kids adapt.<eos> --Marc Anthony grew up in the projects and now he's rich and got to stick it to J. Lo even though he's pocket-size.<eos> And this was about you.<eos> I know that feeling you got when you had her in your arms.<eos> And if that went away forever, you'd be all kinds of fucked up.<eos> You make her sound like she's drugs.<eos> The worst kind.
Did they give you your prescription at medical?<eos> Well, sometimes it takes a couple of weeks to even out.<eos> What did you wanna see me about?<eos> Berdie Rogers.<eos> Is she coming back?<eos> Mr. Caputo is gonna be talking to several inmates about her conduct.<eos> I want you to know that you can trust him.<eos> You can basically tell him anything you would tell me.<eos> For example, don't be afraid to tell him that you spoke with her for several weeks and she offered you no medical care for your...<eos> Your mental condition.
Tell yourself you're into it.<eos> It's your pain.<eos> I'm into it?<eos> Yeah, you're really into it.<eos> You own it.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> At least now you'll have something to remember me by.<eos> Sister, I got a favor to ask.<eos> Can I make a confession to you?<eos> Of sin or crime?
Then the blacks and the Spanish take over at lunch.<eos> Keeps rotating like that.<eos> But me?<eos> I watch what I want, when I want to.<eos> You like wrestling?<eos> Oh, yeah, uh... I used to compete.<eos> I dislocated my shoulder, and that ended that.<eos> Huh, so that could've been you.<eos> I guess.<eos> In a parallel universe.
That's not...<eos> I was just trying to... Was just... I guess I was just trying to be considerate or whatever.<eos> Well, for your information, the jackal does just fine.<eos> Do you know where Berdie is?<eos> I went to her office this morning and she wasn't there.<eos> She's suspended while they investigate an incident.<eos> For how long?<eos> I... I have no idea.<eos> I think maybe you... were right.<eos> Which time?
Which one is it again?<eos> The cute one with the scraggly goatee.<eos> I still maintain you'd make a good dyke.<eos> Come on.<eos> Diving into all that facial hair, - No different than pussy.<eos> - Oh. First of all, that's really gross, okay? Jesus.<eos> And, secondly, I actually really like him, all right?<eos> And it's not because of all the doughnuts.<eos> We talk about things and stuff.<eos> Deep shit.
That's the evidence that I presented to the court to prove that he killed that girl.<eos> You read it, and then you'll understand what I've been going through.<eos> Whatever's in that box, that's not my brother.<eos> He is not the man we thought he was.<eos> Hey there, killer.<eos> Funny.<eos> First day of a new semester.<eos> It's all so exciting, isn't it?<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, God.
Vacation is over.<eos> This is How to Get away with Murder, the second semester, where things get even harder than the first.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I didn't think you needed to know.<eos> It's his sister.<eos> How would I not need to know that?<eos> If I don't tell you these things, it's because they're not things that you need to concern yourself with.<eos> You have enough on your plate.<eos> How is she?<eos> Good.
In general, did you have much contact with Mr. Keating?<eos> A little.<eos> Laurel!<eos> We worked out of his house, so... Miss Castillo...<eos> If there's something you're not telling us...<eos> Is Professor Keating gonna hear any of this? No.<eos> Anything that's said in here is between us.<eos> Sometimes Mr. Keating would... Look at me.<eos> Look at you?<eos> In a sexual way.
- Help.<eos> - Look, Rebecca was the one that broke in.<eos> Wes was the one that gave the final blow.<eos> Technically, Sam was still alive when you pushed him off...<eos> I did not push him.<eos> Look, I'm just saying that...<eos> We can save ourselves.<eos> Go to the D.A. and say that that we were in shock, plead to a felony.<eos> That means kissing the rest of our lives goodbye.<eos> Yeah, but... not our careers.
That's how sex works best.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just have to tell them I saw Nate kill Sam.<eos> While I'm at it, I can say he killed Rudy, too.<eos> - Rebecca...<eos> - I'm kidding. Ms. Sutter?<eos> I won't say anything stupid.<eos> When did you first meet Mr. Lahey?<eos> December.
I just, um...<eos> Is the heat on really high in here?<eos> - No, that's just your nerves. - Oh.<eos> Dean Sumner said you weren't coming in, considering...<eos> Sumner was mistaken.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> I've opted to depart from the syllabus today.<eos> Ms. Chapin.<eos> Can you tell us what the fifth amendment is?<eos> The fifth amendment? Um...
It's not like we're the only clients in your book.<eos> Right now you may as well be!<eos> Listen.<eos> Whatever is going on with me is not gonna affect your case.<eos> I guarantee it.<eos> Just like I guarantee you that I will kick the living crap out of the FBI in the courtroom, but only if you trust me.<eos> It's up to you, Paul.<eos> Do you want to fire me?<eos> You do know she lied to you, right?<eos> In her interview with you,
Excuse me, Officers?<eos> ...more than anyone!<eos> Daniel trusts his own to arrive.<eos> They'll go to everlasting life or everlasting death.<eos> Mitch, we're starting to get some radio interference now, too.<eos> Yeah, I'm having a hell of a time with my radio.<eos> It could be.<eos> It's the damnedest thing.<eos> We just got a report of a stolen sheriff's cruiser.<eos> A what?
Um, that girl who was here... where is she?<eos> Um, hi. Oh, my.<eos> You're the judges, aren't you?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - This is Amy Meyer's booth.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I can take you through the project.<eos> Please don't dock her any points.<eos> Um...<eos> - Okay, so... - Ow! ...in molecular cloning...
- No, that's too far.<eos> - Yours?<eos> - My sister's home.<eos> - We can fuck her.<eos> - Not so vulgar.<eos> - Let's not talk about your mother.<eos> - So where are we going?<eos> We can go to me, nobody home.<eos> - Where do you live?<eos> - Two blocks away.
That's really too bad.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - One more thing.<eos> I asked on Facebook if you want to be my brother.<eos> Just click 'accept'.<eos> - Okay, I'll see.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Have you been to clubs?<eos> - Yes, in Le Havre.
What is she doing?<eos> She's just sitting out there.<eos> Do you have to do that right now? It's for Mom.<eos> The last time I saw him, I just talked about business.<eos> We were driving in his truck.<eos> God, he was happy.<eos> He was the happiest I've ever seen him.<eos> Wait, where'd you guys go once you dropped us off?<eos> Just went for a drink, had a talk.<eos> About what?
And we'd like to thank all of you, everyone... for coming out and paying your respects... to our father.<eos> - Excuse me a second.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Thank you both so much for coming.<eos> We really appreciate it.<eos> How's your mother?<eos> I asked you not to come here.<eos> - This is what I'm talking about.<eos> - Here we fucking--<eos> Right here.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> Just like your father.<eos> He always got the pretty one.<eos> Back in the Navy, me and Bobby, we'd pull into port, head into town.<eos> Five minutes later, he would be surrounded.<eos> You could not see him through a fog of skirts.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I appreciate you coming.<eos> I'm truly sorry for your loss.<eos> - Both of you.
- Well, maybe you should say no.<eos> You're not giving up your apartment, are you?<eos> I... mmm... I don't know what I'm going to do yet.<eos> Whether or not Kevin and I move in with each other, the point is that he's going to be around.<eos> And if we're going to be in each other's lives, you're...<eos> Don't you even think about bringing him around at Christmas.<eos> My God.<eos> Mom, if there was ever a time for a rah-prochement...<eos> Isn't it a little different when it's two men, Megan?<eos> Oh God, Mom.
Nobody did...<eos> Do you remember Dr. Alexander?<eos> His wife Julie passed away last year?<eos> Mrs. Alexander is dead?<eos> It was a very difficult time for Dennis.<eos> - Uh... - And I helped him through it.<eos> And something started.<eos> Not physically.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But emotionally.
But emotionally.<eos> I... I don't understand, Mom.<eos> Are you unhappy with Dad?<eos> Not unhappy, but... yearning for something else.<eos> Something more.<eos> Can I just say I think it is beautiful that you were there for Dennis, but, like, who's going to be there for Daddy when you drop this bombshell on him?<eos> Honey, your father can take care of himself.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I have to try to honor my truth.<eos> Oh, God.
You need to get yourself a fob.<eos> They're "fobulous."<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thieves don't usually bring vales.<eos> Unless they're genius thieves.<eos> So you never know.<eos> - Are you coming?<eos> - Yes, yeah, thank you.<eos> Nice and tight.
Will fish start wiggling their hips and letting their hair grow? !<eos> It's serious!<eos> What's it about?<eos> It's all our shit, the residues of pills in our urine that's dumped in the rivers.<eos> It affects the males and reduces fertility. It's all about hormones.<eos> I'd like to work there some day.<eos> I don't want to spend my life in the clinic...<eos> If I get the chance.<eos> What about you, Charlotte?<eos> What about me?
I won't do it, as they'd probably sack me...<eos> You were going to take care of Dordevic.<eos> You go on... I'll see you up there.<eos> I've just come from your office.<eos> Don't freak out, but...<eos> I've come to throw myself at your feet.<eos> Is that alright?<eos> Yeah, that's alright.<eos> I've just come to say I'm sorry...<eos> Face to face.
Are you starkers?<eos> It seems nobody's asleep!<eos> Anyone for a vodka?<eos> Is that my phone?<eos> Shit!<eos> Yes, right away... 20 minutes.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - You kidding?<eos> - I'm on call.<eos> "On call?"
Yes.<eos> Since you have decided to commit yourselves to the bonds of marriage in the presence of God, and this congregation join hands and exchange your consents.<eos> Antoine will you take Laurence to be your husband... ..and promise to stay faithful to him in sickness and in health, and to love him until death do you part?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Laurence will you take Antoine to be your wife and promise to stay faithful to her in sickness and in health and to love him until death do you part?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> What God has united, let no man put asunder.<eos> You have a silly look on your face.<eos> What sort of look?<eos> A nice look or a nasty look?
So, until then, do your little séance, and I'll be in the car.<eos> All right?<eos> Uh... Hi.<eos> This is where she died.<eos> Did you know her?<eos> How do you know she died here?<eos> I saw her.<eos> Do you live here?<eos> Where do you live?<eos> London.

My name is Liv Moore, and I died, sort of.<eos> I had a promising career and a great fiance.<eos> Then I went to the world's worst boat party and got turned into a zombie.<eos> Now I work at the morgue for access to brains, but brain eating has side effects.<eos> I take on the victim's personality traits and have visions which I use to help solve their murders.<eos> I work with a detective who thinks I'm a psychic and my boss, the medical examiner, the only person who knows my secret.<eos> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.<eos> Previously on iZombie...
Would you look at this place?<eos> You've done very well.<eos> Who knew there was so much money in trend-spotting?<eos> You must be very good.<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> Oh, yeah, that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I buried the lead.<eos> You're a zombie now.<eos> Like, for real.
Oh, that's true.<eos> I suppose it's only fair we make compromises.<eos> Look at you, being all mature.<eos> I don't know why you're so surprised.<eos> If there's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it's how to compromise.<eos> I-I'm sorry?<eos> You make compromises for me?<eos> All the time.<eos> On Earth?<eos> In our lives?
Now, Gareth and I could surely fight all night to an even draw, if that's what you want.<eos> Hell, you can even send all your men to help him, if you so desire.<eos> But I'll fend them all off.<eos> 'Cause here's the thing.<eos> I love her, Richard.<eos> She's the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the eve.<eos> And you can offer her great fame, and you can offer her great fortune, but...<eos> Only I can offer her great love.<eos> And that is what she chooses.<eos> Actually...
Kill the king, make her watch.<eos> No!<eos> Sid, fetch me a drink.<eos> When he tells me to fetch, those are my favorite moments.<eos> Thanks again for the drink.<eos> Drinks.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> My father used to tell stories of you, - of your skill in battle... - Mm-hmm.<eos> Your heroism, of your goodness.

- How splendid to see you.<eos> Oh, what a show you've put on, sir!<eos> It really is very generous of you.<eos> Family means the world to me, as I'm sure it does to you.<eos> I've just been telling this fellow about our potential business venture.<eos> The design of my plane is nearly finished.<eos> I just need to set up a production line, and then it can fly.<eos> From the Selfridge aerodrome.<eos> - Where's the aerodrome going to be?<eos> - Piece of land in Acton.
And while you both are under the same roof, you can forge ahead with the aerodrome plans.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> We need to talk about the aerodrome.<eos> I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage.<eos> With my body I honor you. All that I am I give to you.<eos> Do you, Agnes Mary Towler, take Henri Olivier Leclair to be your husband?<eos> I do.<eos> To have and to hold from this day forward.<eos> To have and to hold from this day forward.<eos> - For better, for worse. - For better, for worse.

Why not?<eos> There's no-one about.<eos> Get the aeroplane built first and then we'll consider an aerodrome.<eos> But can you help with the production line?<eos> Building an aeroplane isn't cheap.<eos> I never said that I would finance it.<eos> You presumed...<eos> That is not true.<eos> You told me we'd work together.<eos> In a general way.

I do not know the place from where old ser comes.<eos> Things maybe are different there, I hope.<eos> But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn they own us.<eos> So we learn much about them... or we do not live long.<eos> They teach me what they are.<eos> Mercy, fair trial... these mean nothing to them.<eos> All they understand is blood.<eos> Thank you all for your council.<eos> Your Grace... a word, please, I beg you.<eos> About what?

I was a baby.<eos> A lot of people came and tried, I think.<eos> Whatever they did, it went away.<eos> What happened to your sisters?<eos> My father made them move out to the keep, outside.<eos> None of us were allowed to go near them.<eos> But we heard them, especially at night.<eos> They started to sound not like themselves.<eos> Did you ever see them?<eos> Only once, at the end.
Sam the Slayer.<eos> Another wildling lover, just like his friend, Jon Snow.<eos> How's your lady love, Slayer?<eos> Her name is Gilly.<eos> Ser Slynt knows her quite well.<eos> They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.<eos> Lies!<eos> A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos.<eos> I found him there after the battle was over.<eos> In a puddle of his own making.
- I can't wait.<eos> Great.<eos> Looks like a torture chamber in here.<eos> Do they really only ride here?<eos> You look like Frankenstein's gran.<eos> We'd be more than happy to employ you as a trainer.<eos> So?<eos> What do you say?<eos> - I learned to ride very nearby.<eos> In Kaltenbach.
Oh?<eos> I help you catch your horse, you help train mine.<eos> Under one condition.<eos> - What?<eos> It stays secret.<eos> I'm in trouble already.<eos> - How do I know I can trust you? You don't.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> At the clearing.
Do you feel you're going to throw up?<eos> Find Me a bathroom.<eos> Very good.<eos> - I can help you with something?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> What did the doctor say to you?<eos> - About what?<eos> - About therapy.
I like any sexuality if it's violent.<eos> I like watching men kiss on the lips.<eos> - Didn't find your glasses?<eos> - No.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> I put them in my pocket.<eos> You sure it was here?<eos> I don't know if I can talk about it with you... can I?<eos> - What?<eos> - That.
Then she could kill me.<eos> I ran to the door.<eos> I wanted to slam it behind me and lock it.<eos> But it transformed into a soft curtain without a handle.<eos> I don't remember what happened after that.<eos> Mum! Where are you?<eos> Mum!<eos> I'm sorry. It's fine.<eos> I've dreamt about this for years.<eos> About what?
Another horrible thought.<eos> Do you know what you want, Frank?<eos> Are you sure you want to live with me?<eos> Or do you talk about growing old together because it's charming?<eos> Or were you really serious?<eos> Today,<eos> I really realised that I love you... how much I love you.<eos> There's not much of a future in all that, but it's all the future I need.<eos> What are you thinking? Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?
What are you thinking? Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You love me?<eos> More than ever.<eos> I never stopped.<eos> I've never loved you less, only more.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Nothing? - No.
Noah.<eos> This isn't the end.<eos> There you go.<eos> That's right.<eos> Hey, we should...<eos> Noah.<eos> Noah.<eos> Noah!<eos> I was thinking about that guy in the storage container.<eos> Back at terminus.
What happens after all the nice wors an they still try to kick him out?<eos> They're guaring the armory now.<eos> We still have knives.<eos> That's all we'll nee against them.<eos> Well, tonight at the meeting... if it looks like it's going ba, I whistle.<eos> Carol grabs eanna, I take Spencer, you grab Reg, Glenn an Abraham cover us, watch the crow.<eos> - We can talk to them.<eos> - Yeah, we will.<eos> If we can't get through, we take the three of them an say we'll slit their throats.<eos> Like at Terminus?
i you want this?<eos> No.<eos> I hit my limit.<eos> I... I screwe up.<eos> An here we are.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna sleep some more.<eos> Reg: Maggie, hey.<eos> She's out on the porch.<eos> What o you nee to talk about, Maggie?<eos> The meeting tonight.
I am sorry.<eos> An I mean both emphatically an in equal measure.<eos> I'm... sorry, too.<eos> Utterly an completely unnecessary.<eos> I almost kille you.<eos> Yes, there's that.<eos> You're back.<eos> Goo, just wante to sneak off to the meeting.<eos> You think we coul fin some time to talk later?<eos> About Aien?
Can you help me?<eos> No.<eos> We're going to start.<eos> Can we wait?<eos> There's still people coming.<eos> Glenn, Rick.<eos> We're going to start.<eos> It's alreay ark.<eos> We're going to talk about what happene.<eos> Not the fight.
There's still people coming.<eos> Glenn, Rick.<eos> We're going to start.<eos> It's alreay ark.<eos> We're going to talk about what happene.<eos> Not the fight.<eos> Not what precipitate it.<eos> We're ealing with that.<eos> We're going to talk about one of our constables,<eos> Rick Grimes.
- No, no, no.<eos> D.E.A.?<eos> ! No, I'm a lawyer.<eos> Just reach in my pocket right now... right there!<eos> Truth.<eos> That is the truth!<eos> I'm a lawyer!<eos> Guys, I passed the bar!<eos> Ask me anything!<eos> Not contract law, okay?
Yeah, thanks.<eos> You're gonna have to take it black.<eos> We're out of milk?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Why are you in that space blanket?<eos> You brought your cellphone in here last night.<eos> It was in your pants pocket.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Where, uh... where is it?<eos> Outside...
They know about your money.<eos> Be careful.<eos> - Do you think...<eos> - Can you call back on a better line?<eos> Kettlemans, you're in danger.<eos> They're coming for your money.<eos> Bye.<eos> What did he say?<eos> We're...<eos> In danger.
To beg!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah. Hey.<eos> I was a jerk, okay?<eos> So, I will...<eos> I will pay you what I owe you, plus interest, if you just let me come through.<eos> I suggest you find parking somewhere else.<eos> Somewhere else, as in...

I found a bunch of dead roaches in that light fixture and rat turds the size of Raisinets.<eos> I cleaned your bathroom too.<eos> - Jesus Christ, Ian.<eos> - You got a problem with your boyfriend cleaning the layer of scum from the tub that your wife washes your child in?<eos> - Svetlana's been teaching me a little bit.<eos> - Great.<eos> Maybe she can get a job as a professor.<eos> Rub N' Tug got closed for good, so we need the dough.<eos> - Where are the girls?<eos> - Jail?
- What?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> I brought you some of my fresh brewed beer.<eos> Tell me what you think.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> That's a great outfit.<eos> How was work?<eos> A goddamn nightmare.
This. Us.<eos> Well, we are two people who like each other's bodies. - And, uh, we're very good at sex.<eos> - Uh-huh. And what about your girlfriend?<eos> What about her?<eos> She's in Florida.<eos> And then?<eos> And I have no idea, okay?<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> Are you gonna visit her?<eos> In Miami?
Okay, I'll let you go.<eos> But first, you apologize to my waitress then you walk away and never walk down this street again, got it?<eos> Yes, sir. I'm sorry.<eos> You okay?<eos> Your lip's bleeding.<eos> I'll ice it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Shit. Sorry.<eos> I wasn't looking at your boobs.<eos> Or that way.
There are church mysteries to which the unenlightened are not privy.<eos> Eddies are divided into six-member groups called semesters, which provide forums in which to confess transgressions, assign penance, and make amends.<eos> I get it...<eos> Eddies huddle together in clusters and spill their dirty secrets.<eos> What's this?<eos> Every Eddie is required to purchase a gold frame in which to feature an image representing their heart's desires.<eos> So, your heart's desire is to have superhero powers from cosmic rays?<eos> The rays represent edification.<eos> Well, then edify us on who was in Emma's cluster.<eos> Semester.
Running makes it look like you killed Emma out of jealousy.<eos> Craig only did that because we were in her office.<eos> You had sex in Emma's office?<eos> She has a couch.<eos> And a lock.<eos> And handi wipes.<eos> Girl and her boyfriend have been meeting up in Emma's office in the church for secret sexual liaisons.<eos> And they got in by promising the security guard that he could watch.<eos> No!<eos> Always to the dark place.
Emma was the one who was seeking out advice.<eos> I raised Ryan to be good.<eos> You didn't raise me at all.<eos> Advice about what?<eos> That's private.<eos> Like the catholics and confession.<eos> Confession.<eos> I'm Emma.<eos> I'm confessing something.<eos> But what?
- Everett, don't do that.<eos> Please, let's just talk to each other.<eos> You always said I shouldn't be a cop.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Too sensitive.<eos> In your heart, you're an artist.<eos> In my life, I'm a cop, and I'm a wicked good one.<eos> And your new job, you're gonna use this to turn me into what?<eos> Into a-a poet?<eos> A Potter?
Let's say there's a female cop, right?<eos> Single, cute, uh, predisposed to like bad boys.<eos> And there's this guy who is affiliated with a gang.<eos> He makes her fall madly in love with him.<eos> And next thing you know, she's a mole.<eos> McNally, are you dating a biker behind my back?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I'm not talking about me.<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> Nobody.
Little test for the neighborhood.<eos> See who's got the stones.<eos> I guess somebody does.<eos> That's handy.<eos> So, you drive up and you shoot a bunch of kids, you park the car and leave the keys, right?<eos> "Not me, Officer."<eos> No, not me, Officer.<eos> Look, I got a Saturday routine... breakfast at Roti Street, read the paper, see what's going on in the world.<eos> I was nowhere near that field.<eos> Not in the car.
Teach you how to sew in the army?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Man!<eos> Deep breath in.<eos> You're happy, huh?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I really am.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> What about you?<eos> Over the moon.
He, uh, he was a big shot.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Like, $100 kicks, you know, big, fancy convertible, thought he owned the world.<eos> Hey, what happened to your hand?<eos> Uh... y... you know, I...<eos> you can tell me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, I... I really don't want to talk about it, okay?<eos> So, how did... how did you meet this Sam guy?<eos> Uh, in an alleyway.
Detective in training.<eos> It's what you wanted, right?<eos> You've done all the courses.<eos> The new staff said you were ready.<eos> It's fine. 27 Division's fine.<eos> At least I know my way around.<eos> Can it, Price.<eos> You're staying.<eos> - Same platoon?<eos> - Same platoon.
You have a real pretty smile.<eos> - Yeah, I still got it.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> That's good.<eos> Is that your bike parked outside?<eos> - Sexy beast, isn't she?<eos> - Mmm.<eos> I used to dream about owning a machine like that.<eos> What do you mean used to?<eos> Another life.
I feel trapped.<eos> I keep waking up from a dream to realize that it's real life that's become the nightmare.<eos> Then I do these stupid, dangerous things.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's just...<eos> I need to breathe.<eos> Well, I know how that feels.<eos> It's good to have you around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - About that.
You don't understand.<eos> The need... will never go away.<eos> Then you'll fight the need!<eos> Don't you dare tie me up again.<eos> I'm going to make this simple.<eos> You want to go to shore? Show me you can learn to tie the first 10 knots on the chart in there.<eos> Then I'll no you're in control again.<eos> 10 knots!<eos> Where were the bodies found?<eos> Behind the ship's boilers.
Thank you.<eos> 'Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.<eos> Emily's feelings?<eos> Yes, Emily.<eos> Nice!<eos> - Yay!<eos> Good job!<eos> Whatever.<eos> Where's Sheldon?<eos> Date night.
And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight.<eos> So, how's the detector going?<eos> Well, it's tricky working with superfluids.<eos> Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.<eos> Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.<eos> Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around, yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"<eos> Come on, this is boring-- you really want to talk about this?<eos> No, I do.<eos> I-I didn't write "superfluid helium"<eos> on this napkin for nothing.
And since you've had such a rough day, I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.<eos> Thank you for forgiving me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.<eos> Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust "doughy""<eos> The truth is you were right.<eos> And I was just angry at myself.<eos> Can I ask you one thing?<eos> Of course.<eos> What?
Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.<eos> Oh, I like to laugh.<eos> But say it anyway.<eos> Okay, um...
I've always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.<eos> Keep dreaming.<eos> Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.<eos> Wow.<eos> He did it with a robot.<eos> You had sex with a robot?<eos> That's not what she meant.<eos> But technically, yes.<eos> Hang on, if you're making all this money, where is it?<eos> In a safe place.
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?<eos> I know.<eos> Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?<eos> That's what you're thinking about?<eos> Well, one of the things.
I know.<eos> Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?<eos> That's what you're thinking about?<eos> Well, one of the things.<eos> Are any of them me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought, "I can't decide<eos> "if I should watch The Flash TV show.<eos> I know, I'll ask Amy."<eos> Anyway...
Oh, I'm not taking charge-- you're the hammer.<eos> So... why haven't we picked a date?<eos> You know why.<eos> Well, of course I know why.<eos> But just for fun... why?<eos> Not in a rush, busy with work...<eos> Things are good right now.<eos> Really good.<eos> You still want to get married, right?<eos> Oh, my God.
This money belongs to us.<eos> We... well, I mean, Craig earned it.<eos> - I worked very hard...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know, weekends, holidays...<eos> - Yep, all unpaid, always.<eos> And, really, just because you're salaried, doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime.<eos> I think that's only fair.<eos> I mean, really, that's what this is about, right?<eos> - Fairness.

But I'm not like I was.<eos> I'm back. I'm solid.<eos> I wanna be here for you, for Kaylee, for my family.<eos> That's good.<eos> I'm glad to hear you're better.<eos> What?<eos> What is it, honey?<eos> Mike, I gotta ask.<eos> I mean I know I just need to move on from this but I keep thinking about something.<eos> - About what?
It was a gift.<eos> Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.<eos> I'd rather have a mother.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Still, it's good to remember.<eos> Remember the way things were.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> There's something else to help you remember.<eos> Down there at the end.
- In the world.<eos> - Well, no.<eos> There are thousands and thousands of books out there.<eos> This library is rather small, actually.<eos> Where you grew up, were there more books?<eos> My father's not the most literate man.<eos> They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.<eos> Where's that?<eos> The Citadel?<eos> In Oldtown.
So he claims they are not his brother's.<eos> That filth. There is not one shred of truth to it.<eos> I deny it.<eos> Good.<eos> But these are terrible charges.<eos> And the realm must know the truth of them.<eos> If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.<eos> Trial?<eos> I have confessed.<eos> To a single sin.
- In gloves? The blender was broken at the diner.<eos> And you wouldn't dare deprive them of dessert.<eos> You look swanky.<eos> Fundraising?<eos> Much better.<eos> We had dinner with the dean of Fairfield University.<eos> Some distant Rockefeller.<eos> Actually, I'm planning on enrolling in the fall.<eos> Master's degree.<eos> Really? In what?
Overdeveloped?<eos> She's not worthy of you.<eos> You can see it in her eyes.<eos> She doesn't want to tell you the truth.<eos> Drawing is a much more rare talent.<eos> I expected more.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> - What?<eos> - Where is everything?<eos> - On the truck.
Should I let my hair grow out?<eos> Good night, everybody.<eos> Ed, you were right.<eos> Pima's a treasure.<eos> Is she?<eos> You don't like the work?<eos> Because I was thinking, you know, she'd be right for Butler Shoes.<eos> Or maybe Topaz Pantyhose.<eos> She's got a thing for legs.<eos> Women's legs.
But if you can keep it quiet, There are people who'd appreciate it.<eos> Still married?<eos> Technically...<eos> I guess.<eos> - I'm sorry, I didn't...<eos> - No, no, that's okay.<eos> - How's your boy?<eos> - He's good.<eos> - Must be in college.<eos> - Army.
- Where is the weed?<eos> - Look, this is my house, man.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's in the drum.<eos> Oh, the old bongo.
All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's in the drum.<eos> Oh, the old bongo.<eos> It's in the drum.<eos> This one?
No, I want to be plowing her, man.<eos> That's our thing, me and Charlie. I plow them all eventually.<eos> Come on, darling.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't bite.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'll tell you what.<eos> How about you and me, you know, We drive down to Charlie's, And you two bone in the backseat?<eos> That's cool, right?<eos> Gets you to Charlie.<eos> Backseat.
Depends. You offering or asking?<eos> My snitch, Vickery...<eos> Guitar man.<eos> That's right... uh, well, turns out he's been blabbing about my secret identity.<eos> So you get the play, right?<eos> It only works if you're you. But on purpose, like 1,000-yard stare, psycho-cop scary.<eos> You want to see scary, keep your foot right where it is.<eos> All units, 187 at 8856 39th Street, South Central.<eos> Victim is white female.<eos> White? That neighborhood?
No!<eos> Insurance.<eos> Boring.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> We all need insurance.<eos> Those men keep us safe.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I suppose.<eos> I'll... tell him you said that.<eos> Anyway...
Just once.<eos> You'd chuck everything away for a chance that'll never happen?<eos> Yes.<eos> Get out of my room.<eos> Shall I send up Daniel?<eos> Fuck off!<eos> _<eos> Cliff still here?<eos> He's in bed.<eos> Your bed?
Everyone who recognises me gets a badge.<eos> "I've Met Adam Whitaker."<eos> I've gotta be honest.<eos> It's for the girls, really, but rules are rules.<eos> I'll give it to my mate Griff.<eos> He has a regular thing with you, every Sunday morning.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What sort of thing?<eos> He wanks over him.<eos> Not me personally.
My mum's all right with it.<eos> My dad just kind of harrumphed.<eos> Never really mentioned it again.<eos> Not in a bad way, just he wasn't gonna talk about his son's sex life, no matter who I was.<eos> All a bit... normal, really.<eos> But that's good, though. That's nice.<eos> Well, must've been worse for you.<eos> How d'you mean?<eos> Well, y'know.<eos> Culturally.
All a bit... normal, really.<eos> But that's good, though. That's nice.<eos> Well, must've been worse for you.<eos> How d'you mean?<eos> Well, y'know.<eos> Culturally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I suppose.<eos> My dad belongs to this church.<eos> More of a fellowship, really.
I wasn't aware that...<eos> Not that that's a problem, but... can I ask why?<eos> At my request, Mr Costello has discovered that...<eos> Including my client, Mr Best, you have suspended 17 members of staff from 2010 to the present day.<eos> Can I ask, how many of them were gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered or other?<eos> Now, as you know, I'm not in a position to say.<eos> An employee's sexuality is entirely private, but... are you claiming that our treatment of you was based on your sexual orientation?<eos> Well, is it?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Not in any way.
Yeah.<eos> I still want to turn on the news and hear that some bastard's gone into his cell and smashed his face in with a hammer for an hour till he's this pulp.<eos> A talking pulp.<eos> Every day I think about that.<eos> It never fades.<eos> I keep waiting for the day when it's less and it never, ever comes.<eos> I meant to say... when I left that night I said those things.<eos> You...<eos> Actually, I think you were right.<eos> Every word.
No, I don't mean Lance.<eos> Or you.<eos> Or any of that.<eos> What d'you mean?<eos> I just thought...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> All this time has passed and I still haven't done anything about it!<eos> I need to spend six months just walking on a beach.<eos> I should do it now, I should take a sabbatical, I could go abroad.<eos> All on my own.
Let's go, let's go.<eos> Umm... All of us here are friends and all have been rejected by Ren.<eos> What?<eos> You were really great!<eos> To confess to him that boldly!<eos> Much more...<eos> We were really moved by you...<eos> Oh...<eos> That's why.... You must really be frustrated with him, right?<eos> That Ichinose Ren.
You are deliberately doing these to make me hate you, right?<eos> I... can't go to Ren's side.<eos> What are you saying? After being rejected by Ren... I told him that I wanted to stay friends with him.<eos> But this gave me more gradual pain.<eos> And I started disliking the "ME" that slowly became greedy.<eos> That's fine as it is.<eos> Isn't loving a person all about happiness?<eos> There's also pain... and the suffering.<eos> I... Never understood the true meaning of love.<eos> In the end...
The man's away from his office for a full hour.<eos> Go on.<eos> Isn't that enough? Hmm?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe it is.<eos> "Whoso pulleth out this sword "of this stone and anvil is rightwise King born of all britain."<eos> I wondered when ye'd show yerself.<eos> Expected ye to come alone.<eos> Marley?<eos> Not much in the way of intellect.
You were at the garage?<eos> Okay, from when to when?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> About when to when?<eos> Is my dad coming?<eos> Two glasses.<eos> Not gonna do it.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Unh-unh.<eos> Oh, my God.
Come on!<eos> Where you at? !<eos> We need to start thinking about the future.<eos> The only way to get through what's going on now is to think about what's next.<eos> So, when Gwen's released, um... she's going to need help.<eos> She's going to need therapy, and she's going to need to be near us.<eos> But we want her to be near Matt, too.<eos> We'd like Matt to be buried close.<eos> Where?<eos> In Oakland.
That affects our children.<eos> So we keep our kids safe and away from Ana.<eos> That's all we can do, or should do.<eos> We don't want to add Mike's problems to our plate.<eos> We already have enough stress as it is.<eos> I'm sorry, love.<eos> You were talking about Timothy?<eos> - No, just...<eos> You know what, I'm tired.<eos> - The grant.
It's weird, right?<eos> It's like Freaky Friday down there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You didn't tell them about Idyllwild, did you?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, if they find out about that, there's no way they're letting you go on tour.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not gonna say anything.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> Can we talk to you for a moment?<eos> About Ana.
He drives me crazy, because he knows me so well.<eos> But in a partner, you know that's a good thing.<eos> - I was talking with Mike and...<eos> - Wait, you already talked to Mike about this?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes, we discussed it, but, you know, pending your approval.<eos> I was very clear that it was pending your approval.<eos> Can I please think about this?<eos> Of course. I'm not even sure, so...<eos> - In other news...
- Trying to do what? - Everyone's trying to find meaning.<eos> - The meaning of what?<eos> - Everything. Of life, right?<eos> Who we are, and where we come from.<eos> - Who's doing this?<eos> God? - God? No, us humans.<eos> All of us human beings. You and me.<eos> You haven't really thought that through.<eos> - You'd be better off writing a book about cheese.<eos> - About cheese?
Unless we shouldn't.<eos> Gus Pfender and Fiona Gallagher.<eos> Put that someplace safe.<eos> - Are you good with fractions?<eos> - Fractions of what?<eos> Like if you have a 16th of an ounce, how many grams will that be?<eos> - You're dealing drugs? - No.<eos> If Fiona found out I was helping you with your drug fraction, she'd have my scalp.<eos> - No one's telling Fiona anything.<eos> - Basic overview.
Hang on a second.<eos> What kind of cream pie are you talking about?<eos> What... kind of cream pie are you talking about?<eos> ♪ ♪ Cream pies.<eos> Everyone loves them.<eos> Comedians, baseball players, even protestors.<eos> Cream pies are a rich American tradition and also delicious.<eos> Mmm, my mouth's getting wet just watching her eat that cream pie.<eos> Asians know electronics.<eos> And fish.
...but I understand the game perfectly now, and, uh, that does not represent me.<eos> - Okay, I like that.<eos> - Okay? So I'm ready to give good answers. - I like that.<eos> - That does represent me.<eos> All right, that sounds good, that sounds good.<eos> If you repeat any of Frank's answers, you're gonna hear this sound...<eos> - ...and then...<eos> - Thought we were done with the buzzer. - Only if you repeat an answer.<eos> - Even in this round?<eos> - Yes, even in this round.
Santa Claus.<eos> Oh, God... uh, pass.<eos> Name something you might find in a bathtub.<eos> S... uh, soap.<eos> Ah! God, I really hate that buzzer.<eos> - Can we not do that?<eos> - Clock's ticking, clock's ticking.<eos> - Okay, uh, pass.<eos> - Name something people add sugar to.<eos> God... coffee.
I love you, Tommy.<eos> Bell, let's go.<eos> _<eos> Wait here.<eos> Welcome to Truth.<eos> Your boy already wanded me, man. I ain't packing'.<eos> Are you just gonna shoot me right here, man?<eos> I'm not here to kill you, man.<eos> That was you in Miami, wasn't it?<eos> In the alleyway?
Okay, we want to show you some reasons why life is worth living. - Yeah.<eos> - And, Dennis, you're up.<eos> Okay, so, uh, I like a good mani-pedi. - Uh. - Yeah, I like...<eos> I like a good, healthy nail. I love one.<eos> You know, you get your... you get your nail beds clean, - you get your cuticles pushed back, right? - Yeah.<eos> - You get your hangnails all trimmed up... - That's great. ...by one of those nice ladies over there.<eos> You know, a lot of those are sex workers.<eos> Yeah, the gals at the nail salon there-- yeah, they're prostitutes.<eos> They're trafficked in.<eos> Usually in shipping containers.
I mean, they're, like, crammed in there, you know, like-like sardines, - shipped with sardines sometimes. - Oh.<eos> It's ugly, but the point is, those ladies doing your nails probably tugged a guy off right before you.<eos> They ship 'em in in shipping containers?<eos> That's depressing as hell. - Uh, uh...<eos> - Goddamn! - All right, Dee?<eos> - Me? - You, you're up, yeah. Yeah.<eos> Hey, Bill, you know, for me, uh, really it's just the simple things that I like in my life, like a moonlight walk or a-a cozy, warm nap.<eos> Or a delicious, ripe piece of fruit, you know? - Oh.<eos> The, uh, sex workers use fruit during the act. - What?<eos> - Yeah.
It's a fine example.<eos> I'd hardly tiptoe in here as a boy, so sacred was the laird's room.<eos> But I'd slip in when he was out at the fields, just to hold it for a few moments.<eos> Dream of the day it would be mine.<eos> It is yours now, Jamie.<eos> Ours.<eos> Ours.<eos> My father, he built this place, ye ken.<eos> His blood and sweat are in this stone.<eos> This land.
I do feel more relaxed.<eos> Dov, moderation is key.<eos> I think what he's trying to say is that you have a problem.<eos> I'm telling you, you guys haven't given Nori a chance.<eos> Do you have any idea how much iron is in this?<eos> Gail, you should try it.<eos> I bet you're deficient.<eos> What did you just call me?<eos> Seriously?<eos> In the truck?
I need to talk to you for a second.<eos> Uh... Give me a second.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> You're giving me stress face.<eos> I-I don't know where my engagement ring is.<eos> D-d-did you check the bathroom?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Pockets?
D-d-did you check the bathroom?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Pockets?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Purse?<eos> - I don't have a purse.<eos> Well, w-when's the last time you saw it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, Sam's place?<eos> My place? Uh, the mall?
You know how I kicked your ass at that partner game?<eos> No, you didn't kick my ass.<eos> Yeah, well, um... We both agree I buy the better gifts.<eos> And you know what... before this whole mess started, I bought you the perfect gift at the dollar store.<eos> It's right in that glove box.<eos> You go... go for it.<eos> Get in there.<eos> [Laughs] Ohh. Where did you find it?<eos> Yeah. Where'd I find that?<eos> In the bedsheets.
Yeah. That's... that's the plan, right, in theory, but there's gonna be...<eos> there's gonna be transfers.<eos> There's gonna be the odd new division, new platoons.<eos> You know, I just...<eos> I keep telling myself, "we'll always have the penny."<eos> Well, you can't show up at the penny if you're working in Vancouver.<eos> - None of us are going to Vancouver.<eos> - Not us. McNally.<eos> Ward offered her a U.C. Gig.<eos> In Vancouver?
- FBI?<eos> - Don't waste your time guessing.<eos> That's good, Maggie Baptiste, because I'm already not interested.<eos> This crime is extremely time-sensitive,<eos> - life and death.<eos> - I already have a crime to solve.<eos> Don't get up. I'll show myself out.<eos> Kirsten, you have two choices.<eos> One... you come work with me.<eos> At your unguessable agency?
You know, I've been thinking about it, and you're right.<eos> It's time to let go of Rusty's undercover team.<eos> No, I'm certain.<eos> I thank you for your frankness.<eos> I wonder.<eos> Um, hey, lieutenant, uh, this... this girl, the... the one you... you found in the... in the trash last year, the one who called herself Alice, did you ever find out her name?<eos> No.<eos> No, we I.D.'d her killer, which was our job.<eos> But who... who was Alice?<eos> Really?
What's in the bag, Cambridge?<eos> Hey, hold on a second.<eos> Wait one damn second!<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Tom?<eos> Oh, god.<eos> If I'm dreaming, ‭then I'll never want to wake up.<eos> -Are you okay?<eos> - ‭I'm okay.
How does that feel... To be afraid?<eos> I am not afraid of you. ‭<eos> - Let him go.<eos> I am not afraid.<eos> I'm not afraid, either.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Denny.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> -You all right?<eos> - ‭I'm fine.
Who sends their mother red roses?<eos> A saint.<eos> I ran into Asey, the florist, last night at the small business owners' meeting. (chuckles)<eos> Ashley says it's the most anyone's ever spent on flowers.<eos> For his mother?<eos> That's what he told Ashley.<eos> You thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Well, I hate to say it, but I think I am.<eos> We need to find out the truth about "Saint Henry""<eos> And his flowers.
Y'all gonna have to do something for me.<eos> "You're the doctor.<eos> You know everything about babies."<eos> Stupid.<eos> Stupid.<eos> Stupid. - Hearing voices?<eos> - (Sighs) Yeah, I've been there.<eos> No voices. Just... thinking.<eos> Thinking?<eos> About what?
All right.<eos> All right.<eos> To the best weekend ever, part two.<eos> Hey, can't you read, man?<eos> Sign says "closed."<eos> That doesn't include me, your best friend.<eos> Hey.<eos> You on your way?<eos> Wade, I think that we need some time away from each other.<eos> Far away.
Stop.<eos> Well, you look just the same.<eos> I expected you'd be wearing overalls and chewing tobacco.<eos> Uncle Dexter, would you excuse me?<eos> Oh, darling.<eos> - Hmm? - Look who's here.<eos> Daphne Clarke.<eos> You did ballet together.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> In, like, the third grade.
- No. No idea.<eos> - Mm. Excuse me.<eos> It's locked.<eos> Who locked the door?<eos> I did.<eos> I was worried about intruders.<eos> Now I see my error in judgment.<eos> Somebody better get over here and help me open up this window, or we're sleeping outside tonight.<eos> Out here?<eos> In our bathing suits?
Come in.<eos> Come in!<eos> Hello.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm new, and was transferred here by mistake.<eos> They put me in English, but I do Russian.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Theo Leloir.<eos> Leloir is not on my list.<eos> Really?
Once we get going, we may not be able to come back.<eos> Freedom, here we come!<eos> France is quite a big place.<eos> Indre, Loire-Atlantique, Ille-et-Vilaine, Yonne, Manche.<eos> - So where to first?<eos> - The Massif Central.<eos> I went to a summer camp there when I was 8 years old.<eos> - Where was it?<eos> - It was... here.<eos> In Aubrac.
You should watch it for yourself in the cinema.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It may be a book or a person I've never personally met.<eos> They act as if they have more personality than they actually have.<eos> It's like a display.<eos> - A false representation.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> - Really?
- That includes the 30,000...<eos> - Craig, yes, he gets it.<eos> Yeah, he gets it.<eos> We are in this together, Mr. McGill, come what may.<eos> Now, where do we begin?<eos> - There you go. Kettleman.<eos> That's all of it.<eos> - Where's Kim?<eos> Oh, we moved her over to the east wing.<eos> The east wing?
It's the only chip those Kettlemans have. They refuse to play it.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Gets bigger every time I look at it.<eos> Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> "The right thing."<eos> You know where you're going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Am I correct in assuming we're now square?<eos> Square.
- Not so metaphorical, perhaps, Jenkins.<eos> - Perhaps, Sir.<eos> Are you thinking there's an actual doorway to heaven in the pyramids?<eos> I mean, I think we would have found that by now.<eos> Not a literal doorway. A doorway like ours... - an interdimensional doorway.<eos> - Well, that makes sense, because the pyramids were designed along precise mathematical lines.<eos> If the stones are resonant to certain energy wavelengths along the magical spectrum, they act as lenses of focuses... foci... along the three dimensions... dimensions...<eos> - infinity, infin... infinite, infinite...<eos> - Cassandra.<eos> - Infini...
No offense, but I could use a bit of a break.<eos> I mean, despite my many awesome heroics, it's still a bit judge-y in here.<eos> Well, I've been spinning a tale to my family that I was down on an oil refinery in Texas.<eos> I guess I could... Swing by and say hi to the folks.<eos> My family and I aren't really...<eos> Well, you know, um...<eos> I think I'll try a case.<eos> Whoa.<eos> It's a tricky one.<eos> Deep breaths.
Like it or not.<eos> Are you okay, hon?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> It's just a cramp.<eos> We're a sad bunch, huh?<eos> Next thing, Lou'll be grouchin' about his sciatica.<eos> Well, we're sitting here together.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> A man once said, "You'll know the angels when they come 'cause they'll have the faces of your children."<eos> Anyway...
"Memorized"?<eos> This is something you wrote down?<eos> Uh, Shaylene helped.<eos> Anyway... look, let me just start over, okay?<eos> Uh, we all feel that Detective Agnew...<eos> I'm sure it's a lovely speech.<eos> And you can tell Shaylene that it almost pushed me over the edge.<eos> But my hands are tied on this.<eos> We thought this might happen.<eos> In which case...
Come on, come on!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They'll be back.<eos> - So will I.<eos> - Well... so will I.<eos> This is India.<eos> Wow.<eos> Uh, where are you?<eos> Chicago... sort of.
We've been combing through the employee records, looking for a shell.<eos> - I'm cooking the ID now.<eos> - We'll send it when it's crispy.<eos> You should be able to wave your phone and just walk right in.<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's a square-cube law thing.<eos> Bigger and more high tech a company is, the easier it is to use the front door.<eos> What about Riley?<eos> I assume since none of us can reach her that she's still unconscious, which means that she's safe.<eos> Safe?
I think about that every day.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You speak English?<eos> - Uh... You speak English?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> I speak very good English.<eos> Where am I?<eos> It's so warm, I can feel the heat.<eos> Kibera, Nairobi.<eos> In Africa?
- You are of two minds.<eos> - At least.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, teacher.<eos> There are better ways that I could be spending my time.<eos> Whatever is distracting you, whatever it is you must decide or do, decide it and do it, and then come back to me.<eos> I'm a fucking mess.<eos> I'm a fucking mess, Hernando.<eos> The set doctor said you were fine.<eos> Fine?
- At least.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, teacher.<eos> There are better ways that I could be spending my time.<eos> Whatever is distracting you, whatever it is you must decide or do, decide it and do it, and then come back to me.<eos> I'm a fucking mess.<eos> I'm a fucking mess, Hernando.<eos> The set doctor said you were fine.<eos> Fine?<eos> Fine?
You are the singing man in my dream.<eos> I can't see you.<eos> Wolfgang?<eos> What the hell language is that?<eos> Kala?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I heard you talking to someone.<eos> Oh, just... to myself.<eos> Oh. Well, if you ever need someone to talk to about things...<eos> Things?
- That's in the movie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - That's in the movie, Lito!<eos> - It's in the movie?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Where is this?<eos> Nairobi.

Get him!<eos> Okay, everyone, grab on to me.<eos> We've gotta take cover!<eos> - Joker has eyes on us.<eos> - Where?<eos> No!<eos> I mean, he literally has a giant eye on us.<eos> I think that thing can see our every move!<eos> We've got to destroy it, or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor.<eos> Uh... Bat-Dad?

Uh... Bat-Dad?<eos> I really think you should see this.<eos> Building survey!<eos> This building's not up to code!<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Is that real lava?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> All right, yeah. It's 100% lava.<eos> - Everyone, start throwing me bricks.<eos> - Right away, sir.
All right, yeah. It's 100% lava.<eos> - Everyone, start throwing me bricks.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> - I need a 4x6.<eos> Come on, quick.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - I need an elbow.<eos> - Elbow.<eos> Yes! I did it.<eos> Pretty cool, huh?

'Cause last I checked, I only had one butt. What the...<eos> What have you done to Wayne Manor?<eos> Hey, Batman, guess what!<eos> I found out one of your secrets.<eos> - Uh-oh. - What do we have here, Batman?<eos> It looks like a bunch of relationship comedies.<eos> - What's that one?<eos> - Must Love Dogs.<eos> Must love crying.<eos> - Marley Me.

Kind of got my hands full.<eos> I've got good tone.<eos> Firing.<eos> - Uh... Batman?<eos> - What's up, buddy?<eos> - Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?<eos> Your number two needs to go number one.<eos> I thought I told you to go back at the prison.<eos> - I tried, but Bane was in there.<eos> - So?
- So?<eos> He had sort of a "get out of this bathroom now" vibe.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have given you that water.<eos> Can you hold it in like a big boy?<eos> Engine one down.<eos> Not a big deal. Don't worry about it. It's fine.<eos> - Engine two down. - It does that sometimes.<eos> We've lost engine three.<eos> Oh. Could live without it.<eos> Engine four!

Come on, Master Dick. We need to help him.<eos> I'm with you, Grandpa!<eos> Get off my Padre!<eos> Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.<eos> What are you two doing here?<eos> I told you to stay in the cockpit.<eos> You disobeyed me.<eos> You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.<eos> What?
You disobeyed me.<eos> You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.<eos> What?<eos> Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!<eos> No.<eos> Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.<eos> Guys, you're all un-timeouted!<eos> We have incoming!<eos> - Sir!
Okay. Everybody, timeout off.<eos> Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.<eos> - Batman, I can help you.<eos> - No. Protect the rope.<eos> The rope is fine!<eos> Save Master Dick!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'll just do one of my gymnastics moves to...<eos> No!<eos> Dick...
The rope is fine!<eos> Save Master Dick!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'll just do one of my gymnastics moves to...<eos> No!<eos> Dick...<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Hold on, Alfred. I'm almost there!<eos> No!<eos> Alfred!
No!<eos> Alfred!<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Move over, rope.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Barbara, did you see that?<eos> Batrope saved Alfred.<eos> Sick moves, rope.
No!<eos> Move over, rope.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Barbara, did you see that?<eos> Batrope saved Alfred.<eos> Sick moves, rope.<eos> I never doubted you, bro.<eos> Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.<eos> Rope!
I know Gymkata.<eos> - Sorry, what's that?<eos> It's a gymnastics-based martial art.<eos> I can punch those '80s monsters off the plane.<eos> Uh... Okay.<eos> Multiple bogeys on our six.<eos> Sir, I'll get them off our back.<eos> I was a tail gunner for the Royal Air Force.<eos> Locked and loaded, sir!<eos> Good.
Multiple bogeys on our six.<eos> Sir, I'll get them off our back.<eos> I was a tail gunner for the Royal Air Force.<eos> Locked and loaded, sir!<eos> Good.<eos> Love that!<eos> I got an idea.<eos> We're gonna change course.<eos> I want you to fly straight into that flaming eyeball.<eos> - What?
I've got you now.<eos> Eat dirt!<eos> Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!<eos> Okay, Babs, this is it.<eos> Fly us straight into that eye, and wait for my signal.<eos> Can it come now?<eos> Can we make the signal thing happen?<eos> Almost there.<eos> Almost there!<eos> - Fire!
Fly us straight into that eye, and wait for my signal.<eos> Can it come now?<eos> Can we make the signal thing happen?<eos> Almost there.<eos> Almost there!<eos> - Fire!<eos> - Almost there!<eos> That fire's coming in hot!<eos> Hot, hot, hot!<eos> Now! Barbara, dive bomb!

That was so great!<eos> Go team!<eos> Come on, let's hear it for us!<eos> That was incredible!<eos> I felt so jazzed!<eos> I say "jazzed"!<eos> I gotta give it to you, Batman.<eos> That was awesome.<eos> - Ha! And you were awesome.<eos> - Thanks.
You had a good idea, you had a good idea, and you had a good idea, and I had a great idea.<eos> You know what, I think that collectively, I'm gonna add one.<eos> - No way!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Man, that feels good.<eos> Best team ever!<eos> Let's take a photo!<eos> All right, everyone, squeeze together.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> - Nice and close!
Best team ever!<eos> Let's take a photo!<eos> All right, everyone, squeeze together.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> - Nice and close!<eos> - I gotta get my pump on.<eos> - It's worth it.<eos> - Okay, everybody in? These abs are no fluke.<eos> Everyone say, "Bat Family!"<eos> Bat Family!

Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> We are just one big happy fraternity of people who did an awesome job together.<eos> I can't think of any other way to put that.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - So, guys, listen up!<eos> Taking the Projector from the Joker is gonna be our most dangerous mission yet.<eos> - A family battle mission!<eos> - Right.<eos> Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then we'll head out.<eos> - Right away, sir.

Padre, please. Don't do this!<eos> Batman, you need us!<eos> How many times I gotta tell you?<eos> Batman works alone.<eos> No, we have to stick together.<eos> Please.<eos> Now go on, Scuttler. Go!<eos> - Go!<eos> Just get outta here.<eos> - Batman.

But I'm the one you're always chasing.<eos> Is this about that stupid "greatest enemy" thing?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> - You tell him, Joker!<eos> - It's time for a fresh start.<eos> He's not worth it.<eos> I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!<eos> That is right.<eos> Respect!
- Yes!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You and I are done!<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> I'm moving on!<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> And on my way out, I'm gonna blow up Gotham City!<eos> No.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Wingardium Leviosa!
I'm not your greatest enemy.<eos> Your greatest enemy is you.<eos> - Goodbye, Batman.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Good for you, boo-boo!<eos> - Everybody, get a bomb.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Bomb, bomb, bomb. Let's bomb it out.<eos> Say goodbye, Gotham City!<eos> - Whoa. - Hi!
I'm not a bad guy.<eos> But you're all in black.<eos> You have a cape.<eos> And you wear a big, scary mask.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> And you kicked me in the face.<eos> Listen, I'm Batman.<eos> Oof! You even sound like a bad guy.<eos> I swear, I am a good guy.<eos> Okay, Mr. Batman.

Yes, sir?<eos> - You're super nimble, right?<eos> - I sure am!<eos> And 110% expendable?<eos> I don't know what that means, but okay.<eos> - How'd I do, Dad?<eos> - Mediocre.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - And don't call me Dad.<eos> Sorry.
- How'd I do, Dad?<eos> - Mediocre.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - And don't call me Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Batman!
Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Batman!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Please.<eos> Joker, you mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.<eos> You're not a traditional bad guy.<eos> But you're not exactly a good guy, either.<eos> - Batman?

Are they really the ones you're protecting?<eos> Computer, Batman's in danger.<eos> Please, Computer, take us back!<eos> Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm?<eos> Batman programmed me to obey him.<eos> But he didn't say to not not rescue him.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Come on, guys. Let's hustle.<eos> Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.<eos> Well, hello!
Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.<eos> Well, hello!<eos> 'Puter, go to super-secret stealth mode.<eos> - Hold on!<eos> - No!<eos> Evil buddies, those are my last three painful reminders of Batman.<eos> Run!<eos> Come on, Alfred. This way.<eos> Wait, where's Dick?<eos> The little guy?
Come on, Alfred. This way.<eos> Wait, where's Dick?<eos> The little guy?<eos> He's over there.<eos> Initializing Batcave operating system.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> I've gotta save my family!<eos> Just think.<eos> - What would Batman do?<eos> - What?
Hold on a second, Brick Lady.<eos> I'm so sorry. I need to get down there and stop this.<eos> I can't let you go.<eos> My boss will be really mad at me.<eos> Yeah. But I bet your boss would be happy if you were able to get all those bad guys back in here.<eos> Hmm. She sure would.<eos> Then let me try.<eos> Let me get down there and help them.<eos> But haven't you tried that before?<eos> This way, Alfred.
I'll do whatever you want.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Exterminate!<eos> Please.<eos> Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here.<eos> I promise.<eos> And I mean all of them.<eos> One of these buttons has to save my friends.<eos> Self-destruct mode activated.<eos> Self what?

Dick, Alfred, Barbara.<eos> - Are you guys...<eos> - We're fine, Batman.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really... s-s-s...<eos> Sorry?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoo! I did it!<eos> I don't even know why you bothered coming back.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> What?
- We saw your signal, and we came to help.<eos> Joker may be done with us, but we're not done with him.<eos> We will be the Joker's reckoning.<eos> Joker said mean stuff to us.<eos> You were right, Barbara.<eos> It takes a village. Not a Batman.<eos> Okay. Everybody, listen up.<eos> These monsters want to destroy Gotham City.<eos> That's right. We need sick new vehicles.<eos> An arsenal of advanced weaponry.

We're not doomed.<eos> I got this.<eos> Everyone, grab on to me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Come on, guys. We need to hold this city together.<eos> Batrope, no!<eos> Everybody, run!<eos> No!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Right, Batman?
Gotcha.<eos> Come on, guys. We need to hold this city together.<eos> Batrope, no!<eos> Everybody, run!<eos> No!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Right, Batman?<eos> We need to use our heads!<eos> Maybe we should build something together.<eos> - Heads.
- Together.<eos> - Build. - Together.<eos> Together.<eos> We should build something together.<eos> I got it.<eos> You're right, Babs.<eos> We need to stick together.<eos> Literally.<eos> Robin, quick. Give me a boost.<eos> On it, Padre.

I've got you.<eos> Joker!<eos> Please, help us!<eos> No!<eos> I'm not gonna help you.<eos> At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy!<eos> I'm gonna have to die to know it.<eos> Shut up, Joker!<eos> If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.<eos> What?
If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.<eos> What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.<eos> So if you help me save Gotham, you'll help me save us.<eos> You just said "us."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Batman and the Joker.
And you.<eos> So if you help me save Gotham, you'll help me save us.<eos> You just said "us."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Batman and the Joker.<eos> What do you say?<eos> You had me at shut up.<eos> How are your abs, bro?<eos> Too much flab, not enough ab.<eos> Why?
- I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.<eos> I hate you forever.<eos> Splendid!<eos> We did it, everyone!<eos> Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.<eos> Padre, where are you going?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.<eos> Sorry, kid.
Dads.<eos> My two dads are the same dad.<eos> But they're both leaving.<eos> It's gonna be okay, kid.<eos> Sometimes, losing people is part of life.<eos> But that doesn't mean you stop letting them in.<eos> Some very wise people taught me that.<eos> My father figure.<eos> My platonic coworker buddy, who's a girl, but just a friend.<eos> And you.

I deserved that.<eos> - Hi.
Why?<eos> 'Cause someone needs to cut the tension between the two of us immediately.<eos> Okay.

It's you.<eos> Well, I guess I'll be seeing you on the streets, Batman.<eos> I guess so. Catch you later, Joker.<eos> Let's go, gang.<eos> Wait a minute, we're not just gonna let these criminals go, right?<eos> Ah, come on, Commish. Let's face it.<eos> Those guys are no match for the four of us.<eos> We'll give them a 30-minute head start.<eos> Besides, you can't fight crime on an empty stomach.<eos> Hey, Computer?

Did you stick wigs onto snakes?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - That is so weird.<eos> Can I play that song I wrote for the end credits?<eos> - That is a hard pass. - Come on.<eos> No!<eos> Let the kid play whatever music he wants.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> - Please? - No.<eos> - Padre?

That's my building.<eos> You should sell it and buy some shoes.<eos> Hi.
I'm Danny Rand.<eos> The son of Wendell Rand.<eos> I've, uh, been away a long time.<eos> And you're here to see Harold Meachum?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - One minute, please.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I used to ride my skateboard around in here.<eos> Someone will be right out to see you.<eos> - Oh, thanks. - Mmm.

Look, but I think you're in the wrong place.<eos> No, this is definitely the right place.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm calling security.<eos> - They can help you.<eos> - Wait, no.<eos> It's me.<eos> Look, I know it sounds crazy, but let me just talk to your dad, okay?<eos> Then I can leave you guys alone.<eos> I'm afraid Harold Meachum is dead.<eos> What?
No, this is definitely the right place.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm calling security.<eos> - They can help you.<eos> - Wait, no.<eos> It's me.<eos> Look, I know it sounds crazy, but let me just talk to your dad, okay?<eos> Then I can leave you guys alone.<eos> I'm afraid Harold Meachum is dead.<eos> What?<eos> I...
I didn't know.<eos> When?<eos> Why isn't anyone picking up?<eos> Can you get security up here?<eos> He died of cancer 12 years ago.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> All our parents are gone now.<eos> Okay, well, thanks for dropping by.<eos> I'm gonna show you...<eos> What?
Seriously.<eos> Why don't we just all walk over to the Stage Deli?<eos> We can have a cup of tea.<eos> We can talk about this.<eos> Stage Deli's been closed for years.<eos> It... it doesn't matter where we go, okay?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> You are absolutely insane if you think I'm gonna sit down and have a cup of tea with you.<eos> - I know this is strange, but...<eos> - Really?
You think?<eos> Maybe, that's because Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Please, get out of here now.<eos> Ward... you need to calm down.<eos> Calm down?<eos> Are you seriously telling me to calm down?<eos> - Get out, or I will throw you out.<eos> - Ward, you need to back off.<eos> Keep telling me what to do...<eos> All right.

If you set foot in this building again, our guards will take it as a personal threat and will respond with whatever means necessary.<eos> I think you know what that means.<eos> Look, Ward, don't do this.<eos> You're gonna feel real stupid once all this is cleared up.<eos> Come on!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Still... it's been, like, 15 years since Danny and his parents died.<eos> This guy just shows up out of nowhere?<eos> What?

I'm okay.<eos> Yeah, I... I'm good.<eos> I don't give a shit what you are.<eos> You know, you...<eos> you remind me of Billy.<eos> He was, uh... he was head of security when I left.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess he retired.<eos> One, two, three, four...<eos> Park Place.
Ward, it's your turn.<eos> One, two, three, four, five.<eos> Kentucky Avenue, 250 bucks.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What do you mean, "I don't think so"?<eos> I don't wanna pay it.<eos> - You have to.<eos> - It's the rules.<eos> Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello!
It's disgusting.<eos> - Ward.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Danny's been kind of a problem.<eos> Uh, I didn't mean to spook you.<eos> It's all right. I, uh...<eos> I don't really spook.<eos> I'm Big Al.<eos> Danny.

Yeah.<eos> Sort of.<eos> You know... you can get shoes at the shelter on East 13th.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just make sure you piss in 'em first.<eos> You know, they carry the bad juju from the previous owner.<eos> Only way to get rid of 'em is with your piss.<eos> Or... or the blood of a she-goat.<eos> Uh, that's hard to find around here.<eos> What?
Or... or the blood of a she-goat.<eos> Uh, that's hard to find around here.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> I'm guessing people think we're pretty much alike.<eos> - Special creatures.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Hey, Joy! Joy, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

You... you're living in my house.<eos> - This is my house now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it seems that way.<eos> Your dog's pretty scary.<eos> Did you break in?<eos> My dog was closed in my study last night when I got home.<eos> You did that?<eos> Now that is so not okay, my friend.<eos> Sorry, buddy...

Uh, speak English or Japanese.<eos> I haven't spoken Mandarin since I was a kid.<eos> Oh, uh, I'm sorry.<eos> Um... I was just wondering if... maybe I could get a job with you.<eos> I've already got someone who cleans up.<eos> - No, wait.<eos> I meant...<eos> - See ya.<eos> So... the guy is still around.<eos> - What guy?
I think he may have broken into my house as well.<eos> Okay.<eos> That takes this to a whole other level.<eos> - This guy's dangerous.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm a little freaked.<eos> I'm gonna make sure Shannon has people posted outside your place.<eos> There was another thing.<eos> So strange.<eos> What?
Huh?<eos> Not so good.<eos> You will never get a penny from us.<eos> Who said anything about money?<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> I want answers.<eos> I want to know what happened.<eos> To me, to my parents... to the company that has my name on it!<eos> That's all you want?<eos> Answers?
I was 15 when they died.<eos> Why would I know anything more?<eos> And why do you think that there's more to know?<eos> And why do you care?<eos> - Because you are not Danny Rand.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Show me a DNA test that proves you're a Rand.<eos> I have no living relatives.<eos> A fingerprint test.<eos> I...
- Because you are not Danny Rand.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Show me a DNA test that proves you're a Rand.<eos> I have no living relatives.<eos> A fingerprint test.<eos> I...<eos> I was ten when we crashed.<eos> - I never had fingerprints taken.<eos> - Then you've got nothing.<eos> Oh, man.
Stop this.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop the car!<eos> - Hold on, Danny!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Stop the car!<eos> Stop the car!<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...
Stop.<eos> Stop the car!<eos> - Hold on, Danny!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Stop the car!<eos> Stop the car!<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I...
I know.<eos> I thought you might be hungry.<eos> - Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> Chicken parm.<eos> The Italian deli on Bleecker.<eos> They throw 'em out at the end of the night.<eos> Plenty of food if you know where to look.<eos> That's where it all went wrong.<eos> Where all what went wrong?<eos> All mankind.
You're lucky, then.<eos> Buddha said, "Your purpose in life is to find your purpose."<eos> Sure, that makes sense.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's your purpose?<eos> To protect K'un-Lun from all oppression.<eos> Honor the sacrifice of Shou-Lao the Undying.<eos> Well, okay then.<eos> Just remember to have fun along the way.<eos> All right, man.
Thank you, guys.<eos> That was a lovely class.<eos> Please take some flyers.<eos> Pass them around, invite your friends to take a class.<eos> We need more students here.<eos> Oh, also...<eos> Thursday nights will be closed for AA meetings.<eos> They pay more than you do.<eos> Otherwise this place is closing.<eos> Hi.
Here for a lesson?<eos> What can $2 get me?<eos> Cup of coffee down the street?<eos> Hmm. I never had coffee before.<eos> Or maybe a pair of flip-flops at one of the stalls.<eos> Down the street.<eos> Oh. I'm, uh...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> So you should probably... go.<eos> I, uh...
Down the street.<eos> Oh. I'm, uh...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> So you should probably... go.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I want to challenge your master.<eos> You wanna what?<eos> It's protocol.<eos> I visit your dojo, I need to challenge your master.<eos> Wow.
I'm okay.<eos> So you should probably... go.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I want to challenge your master.<eos> You wanna what?<eos> It's protocol.<eos> I visit your dojo, I need to challenge your master.<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, okay... but I'm the master, and I don't accept your challenge.<eos> Oh. Okay, um...
- Nope.<eos> - You should.<eos> You'd probably get more students.<eos> I don't need the hassle.<eos> I could teach a couple classes.<eos> I mean, that's what I was asking when I was talking about work.<eos> I'd be cheap.<eos> No hassle at all.<eos> Where'd you train?<eos> K'un-Lun.

This is just a practice sword.<eos> It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.<eos> Ask Master Lei Kung the Thunderer.<eos> I'm asking you... nicely... one last time.<eos> Please go.<eos> I apologize for any inconvenience.<eos> Hey!<eos> Thanks.
Please go.<eos> I apologize for any inconvenience.<eos> Hey!<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Ward Meachum.

I think it can wait until the morning.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right away.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> The Chinese yuan is gonna drop.<eos> - It's gonna affect our expansion there.<eos> - I'll take care of it.<eos> Oh, like you're taking care of the Danny Rand situation?<eos> How do you even know about that?<eos> Shit.
Are you behind this?<eos> Is this another one of your stupid tests?<eos> No, Ward, I'm not behind it.<eos> I wish you'd take things like this more seriously, so that I don't see my company destroyed.<eos> - So it's your company now?<eos> - It's always been my company.<eos> You know, I could just ignore you.<eos> There's not a thing you could do about it.<eos> Oh, sometimes you still sound like you're an eight-year-old.<eos> Yeah, yeah, Dad.
How much does he know?<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> - I think you know why it matters.<eos> Ward, try to learn from me.<eos> You hire people when they're young, single, looking for something to commit to, to build their lives around.<eos> Pay 'em twice what they're worth.<eos> It builds loyalty.<eos> It's something I learned from Wendell.<eos> Sure.<eos> Kyle.

It's nearly midnight, sir.<eos> Aw, too late then, huh?<eos> See?<eos> He loves me.<eos> Jesus, Dad.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> - Never felt better.<eos> Of course.<eos> So... let's talk about the real issue.<eos> This, uh, Danny Rand character.
Like always.<eos> Hey.<eos> Al, are you awake?<eos> "As long as the cycle of existence lasts, may your happiness never decline.<eos> May you attain the constant joy of the bodhisattvas."<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> This was always my second home.<eos> I know all the ins and outs.<eos> Your brother tried to have me killed last night.<eos> What?
With two other guys.<eos> - With guns.<eos> - Shannon?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Very sure.<eos> Well, you seem to have gotten away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This time.<eos> All right, even if Shannon did attack you, I have to believe that it was something he... might have instigated on his own.<eos> Either way, it...
Maybe the truth is somewhere in between.<eos> "If you wish to see the truth...<eos> then hold no opinions."<eos> It's a Zen saying.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, then...<eos> I guess I should call you Danny?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, Danny.
I don't even know where to start.<eos> Well, why don't you just start at the beginning?<eos> We were in our jet.<eos> Flying over the Himalayas.<eos> Then... things started to...<eos> to go bad.<eos> Okay.<eos> We were, uh...<eos> We were flying too low.<eos> And the... the plane...
Okay.<eos> We were, uh...<eos> We were flying too low.<eos> And the... the plane...<eos> it started to come apart and, uh...<eos> And, um...<eos> - And then?<eos> - And, um...<eos> And then, uh...<eos> You...
We were, uh...<eos> We were flying too low.<eos> And the... the plane...<eos> it started to come apart and, uh...<eos> And, um...<eos> - And then?<eos> - And, um...<eos> And then, uh...<eos> You...<eos> What?
Looks like he had another one of those episodes.<eos> Better to let him sleep.<eos> It's just turbulence.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Danny.<eos> It's gonna be okay!<eos> - Just hold on, Danny!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Heather, stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!

There you are.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You are at Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> What?
- No.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Simon... no!<eos> I was just saying hello to the new guy.<eos> We're gonna get you cleaned up now.<eos> I need you to swallow these.<eos> I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Simon... no!<eos> I was just saying hello to the new guy.<eos> We're gonna get you cleaned up now.<eos> I need you to swallow these.<eos> I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?<eos> They important to you?<eos> business as usual.
That would mean that he... somehow miraculously survived a plane crash... in the Himalayas... he waited 15 years to come back with no shoes and a tendency toward violence.<eos> I know...<eos> I know.<eos> We'll get to the bottom of this.<eos> you know? and we've made sure he's getting it.<eos> We could have just had him arrested.<eos> So we're saints.<eos> if that's what you think.<eos> - We're gonna be okay!<eos> - Dad!
It's the drugs.<eos> You need to let me out of here.<eos> it's either here or jail. so I think we should make the most of it.<eos> Can... can you at least unstrap me?<eos> Are you gonna behave?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's start with this...<eos> Let's find out what's going on.<eos> what's your name?<eos> Danny Rand.
And then?<eos> And then...<eos> I woke up.<eos> I was in this huge snowdrift.<eos> I was hurt.<eos> It was snowing.<eos> You must have been cold.<eos> I was cold.<eos> But I could see pieces of the plane scattered over the mountainside.<eos> I...
I was cold.<eos> But I could see pieces of the plane scattered over the mountainside.<eos> I...<eos> I had to go and check.<eos> I found the cockpit first.<eos> Both pilots were dead.<eos> Then I found the main fuselage.<eos> My dad was inside.<eos> Danny.<eos> Wendell Rand?

I didn't want to leave my dad.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I was so cold.<eos> hungry.<eos> I... I had to try.<eos> Try what?<eos> To survive.<eos> but the...<eos> I... and... and... there were these two men standing above me.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.

I... I've never seen that before.<eos> If you want out of here... you're gonna have to start being honest with me.<eos> We'll talk about this some more.<eos> man!<eos> You might want to sound a little less<eos> - like a...<eos> - You guys are no good!<eos> Darryl.<eos> I could hear those feet slapping on the sidewalk a block away.<eos> sensei.
- You guys are no good!<eos> Darryl.<eos> I could hear those feet slapping on the sidewalk a block away.<eos> sensei.<eos> My shoes are too big.<eos> I could smell your garlic breath before you walked out your door.<eos> sensei.<eos> Jenny?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Yoga?
My shoes are too big.<eos> I could smell your garlic breath before you walked out your door.<eos> sensei.<eos> Jenny?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Yoga?<eos> You move about as fast as a pig... swimming in gravy.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll just end up crying.<eos> guys.

he's a schizoaffective disorder.<eos> He's been here almost 15 years.<eos> Don't think you'll be any different.<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> we all want out.<eos> That's why they dope us every eight hours until we are just mindless donkeys.<eos> Who you calling donkey?<eos> no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My mistake.
My mistake.<eos> too.<eos> For... for what?<eos> For being alive.<eos> That's just stupid.<eos> Apologize now or I'm going to hurt you.<eos> Remind me what's wrong with this one again.<eos> you!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> Whoa! No!
No! No!<eos> - You're out of here!<eos> You're out of here! - He started it!<eos> Danny!<eos> It's okay!<eos> Danny!<eos> It's okay!<eos> Open.<eos> Why?<eos> Danny?
- You're out of here!<eos> You're out of here! - He started it!<eos> Danny!<eos> It's okay!<eos> Danny!<eos> It's okay!<eos> Open.<eos> Why?<eos> Danny?<eos> What?
Why?<eos> Danny?<eos> What?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's just...<eos> You're the first person to call me Danny in here.<eos> I need to get out of this place.<eos> Do you have any family you can call?<eos> No.<eos> Friends?
Do you have any family you can call?<eos> No.<eos> Friends?<eos> Is there a phone I can use?<eos> but what are they going to do?<eos> Put me in the nut house?<eos> - Chikara Dojo.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - It's Danny.<eos> - Who?
No.<eos> Friends?<eos> Is there a phone I can use?<eos> but what are they going to do?<eos> Put me in the nut house?<eos> - Chikara Dojo.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - It's Danny.<eos> - Who?<eos> Danny.
Why would anyone be after you in the first place?<eos> okay?<eos> one of the richest families in New York?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they have a problem with you?<eos> they do. but I just don't think I'm the person to help.<eos> Colleen... you are the only person who can help me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> please...<eos> Dad.
Colleen... you are the only person who can help me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> please...<eos> Dad.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> and there were these...<eos> You put cameras in there?<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> We're all connected.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.
we have to deal with this.<eos> We can't deal with it until we know what we have.<eos> He's only given us a few clues.<eos> decide how we should proceed.<eos> So we just wait?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And watch.<eos> there is one thing you can do.<eos> has only made one phone call out to a...<eos> Colleen Wing.
At least an hour a day.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you Colleen Wing?<eos> I am.<eos> I'm sorry to intrude.<eos> My name is Ward Meachum.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> this is rather awkward.<eos> I'm wondering if you've had any contact with a man who's going by the name Danny?<eos> homeless... no shoes?
- We are Rand!<eos> I'm sure it was real nice to be part of that family.<eos> Have all the money in the world.<eos> Look how happy they seem.<eos> it's... easier to imagine we belong to some other world.<eos> Some happier world.<eos> we all went to the circus in Madison Square Garden.<eos> I didn't want to do the commercial.<eos> It's how Dad talked me into it.<eos> The circus.
we all went to the circus in Madison Square Garden.<eos> I didn't want to do the commercial.<eos> It's how Dad talked me into it.<eos> The circus.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The acrobats were amazing.<eos> And I sat next to my mom.<eos> Joy was on the other side.<eos> We had popcorn.<eos> John Anderson.
Come on.<eos> Get him up.<eos> Ask him where he's been the last 15 years.<eos> Ask him why he suddenly come back now.<eos> Jesus.<eos> We actually get a shrink who's trying to help the guy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why are you always saying sorry to me?<eos> You're like some scared little rabbit who's always apologizing.<eos> Sor...
I'd have to apologize... for forcing him to exert himself.<eos> I miss him.<eos> But now...<eos> I don't apologize for anything.<eos> get the car ready tonight.<eos> the thing with the four wheels.<eos> it's just... you never leave the penthouse.<eos> I'm thinking it's time.<eos> put him on.<eos> Joy Meachum?
it's just... you never leave the penthouse.<eos> I'm thinking it's time.<eos> put him on.<eos> Joy Meachum?<eos> This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you an odd question.<eos> okay. you did a commercial for Rand?<eos> Uh-huh.
okay. you did a commercial for Rand?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah. "We are Rand.<eos> Anything else stick out about that day?<eos> They put me in a stupid dress.<eos> It was cold out.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you do anything afterwards?<eos> yeah.<eos> The circus.
it was Danny's idea.<eos> and his parents had to bribe him.<eos> I remember because he wanted to be an acrobat after that.<eos> He was always jumping around.<eos> thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm afraid I can't really say.<eos> Patient confidentiality.
thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm afraid I can't really say.<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> now you have me curious.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Wish I could say more.<eos> Danny.

I thought you were dead. so I guess that's something we have in common.<eos> I didn't die.<eos> clearly not.<eos> I understand you were...<eos> taken in by some monks.<eos> Crane Mother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did you know?<eos> we dead know a lot.<eos> But not everything.
At least I understood my place there.<eos> and what was your place?<eos> I was a warrior.<eos> Only in the middle of a fight did I fully come alive.<eos> the... the more everything came into focus.<eos> What kind of warrior are you?<eos> listen to me.<eos> What do you mean you're a warrior?<eos> I became one in a long line... of Immortal Iron Fists.<eos> Living Weapon.
What exactly does that mean?<eos> It is my duty to destroy the Hand.<eos> And this is something you can do?<eos> You can destroy the Hand?<eos> I am the only one who can do it.<eos> Please... you have to get me out of here.<eos> don't worry. I'll take care of everything.<eos> Right now... you should just go back to sleep.<eos> Look up everything you can on the Iron Fist.<eos> sir.

What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then...<eos> I will leave you this.<eos> 000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.<eos> This must be very important to you.<eos> It is.<eos> then what do you do?<eos> I just want everyone to be safe.<eos> even the man in question.

Why?<eos> To keep me safe.<eos> Didn't expect to see you.<eos> You figure out a way to get me out of here?<eos> Why would Ward Meachum want me to sign papers that say you're dangerous?<eos> Because the family thinks I'm a threat to them.<eos> And why would they think that?<eos> I'm guessing because I'm Danny Rand and I probably own more than half the company.<eos> as in Rand Enterprises?<eos> Yeah.
of course not.<eos> why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't be involved in this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> just one last favor.

Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> just one last favor.<eos> What?<eos> Deliver these to Joy Meachum.<eos> Someone's here to see you.<eos> A Colleen Wing.<eos> She says she has a message from Danny.<eos> Show her in.<eos> Thanks.
What?<eos> Deliver these to Joy Meachum.<eos> Someone's here to see you.<eos> A Colleen Wing.<eos> She says she has a message from Danny.<eos> Show her in.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got no clue what I'm doing here.<eos> Danny asked me to give this to you.<eos> my God.
Yes.<eos> When... when we were kids... we would eat them together.<eos> Nobody would know that but Danny.<eos> but a bunch of MM's doesn't prove anything.<eos> It does.<eos> Ward.<eos> but this is definite proof.<eos> We gotta get him out of that place.<eos> We've... we've got to talk to him.<eos> Joy. Not now.
Danny... because...<eos> Where have you been the last 15 years?<eos> yes.<eos> I know.<eos> But where?<eos> is that all true?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - In China?<eos> - In... in K'un-Lun.<eos> K'un-Lun.
Is this all a part of you trying to focus your chi?<eos> Yeah.<eos> then I can summon the Iron Fist.<eos> And the Iron Fist is...<eos> The Iron Fist is...<eos> It's me.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> or are you the Iron Fist?<eos> I'm... I'm both.<eos> Danny...
or are you the Iron Fist?<eos> I'm... I'm both.<eos> Danny...<eos> I believe you've been through some great trauma.<eos> Your plane crashed.<eos> You lost your parents You barely survived yourself.<eos> And I'm guessing things didn't get better after that.<eos> I believe all that.<eos> But the rest... one that... helps us deal with the loss and suffering.<eos> uh...
But... I'm seeing a lot more people who honestly believe they have super powers.<eos> I am the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm happy for you to convince me.<eos> Do... do you want to show me the Iron Fist?<eos> Let's see how it works.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.<eos> What I'd like for you to do... is to open yourself to the possibility that there is no Iron Fist.<eos> Just...<eos> Danny Rand.
I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.<eos> What I'd like for you to do... is to open yourself to the possibility that there is no Iron Fist.<eos> Just...<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> A young man... who suffered an unspeakable tragedy.<eos> We'll talk about this tomorrow.<eos> Looks like more people are beginning to realize this is the real Danny Rand.<eos> I found nothing on Iron Fist. but nothing helpful.<eos> A mystery.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Finally.<eos> I don't want to be involved in whatever solution you have in mind.<eos> I... I don't do that kind of thing.<eos> Have some of your men do it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What are you planning to do with him?<eos> We're putting him somewhere safe.<eos> Somewhere safe?
He said he is the sworn enemy of the Hand.<eos> Do you realize how important that could be?<eos> not really.<eos> Danny may be of great value to me.<eos> right on the water.<eos> Let's move him there with a dozen or so men to keep... why?<eos> Why are we protecting him?<eos> Aren't you listening?<eos> Danny may be of great value to me.<eos> Dad.

Nothing good will come of this.<eos> Ward... do as I ask.<eos> Tonight.<eos> sir.<eos> It's me.<eos> There's been a change of plans with the patient.<eos> Hey!<eos> You're being moved.<eos> Gotta put this on.<eos> Hospital rules.
Listen, I'm gonna make this up to you, I promise.<eos> Are the cops coming by?<eos> I haven't broken any laws.<eos> I'm putting myself on the line here.<eos> And I don't like it.<eos> There won't be any more trouble.<eos> The third tenet of the Bushido code is mercy.<eos> But even that has its limits.<eos> Don't be here in the morning.<eos> Dad?

You caught me sleeping.<eos> I can come back.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's so peaceful in here, I can't help but doze off.<eos> I'm sure we'll find Danny within the hour.<eos> And it's not like he's all that sophisticated.<eos> Make sure to pay for the door repair at the hospital.<eos> And I don't want anyone talking.<eos> Now, what about the pier deal?<eos> Patel?
And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?<eos> That I work day and night so I can hand you something that's successful?<eos> That works out easily, because I want you to succeed?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> You guess?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - Really?
I asked to have Danny moved to a safe location, and you tried to have him killed.<eos> You don't understand that...<eos> If you just do things my way, it'll all work out for you, Ward.<eos> Can't you see that?<eos> Danny has nowhere else to go, but to come to us.<eos> So I'm asking you, when he reappears, keep him safe... until I decide what to do with him.<eos> Do I need to spell it out any further?<eos> No.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> I...
Then why aren't you gone?<eos> I'm worried for your safety.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't need you to protect me.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because the fat one who smelled like toe fungus<eos> - landed a blow.<eos> - And paid the price.<eos> Still... he never should have gotten that close.<eos> You, um...
Too much external force.<eos> It's internal force you want to master.<eos> And you should master silence.<eos> Leopard Punch.<eos> But again, all this power derives from the harnessing of inner force.<eos> Your chi can be focused and brought into the fight to overcome any obstacle.<eos> Amazing.<eos> I love it.<eos> Thanks for showing me.<eos> What?
Look, I'm Danny Rand!<eos> Like you see on the building.<eos> And I'm Colleen Wing, who's too broke to fix this door, so...<eos> Look, I'll have all this solved by Friday.<eos> Door included.<eos> Then...<eos> Then I can pay you an entire year's rent.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - Friday?<eos> - Yeah.
But you and Ward, you're the only link to a life that I had.<eos> It kept me going under very difficult circumstances.<eos> - Maybe it sounds ridiculous, but...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ...it's all I got.<eos> No, it doesn't sound ridiculous.<eos> I was 13 when Dad died.<eos> And I still hadn't quite gotten over you and your family.<eos> I was lost.<eos> I...
And I still hadn't quite gotten over you and your family.<eos> I was lost.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't care about anything.<eos> I was just going through the motions.<eos> But I had this... I had this vision... this dream... that kept happening over and over.<eos> - I was a kid... - back at school... and there Dad was at the end of the day, just... standing by the fence waiting for me.<eos> And I'd run to him, and he'd take my hand just as I passed the gate.<eos> And then the dream would end.<eos> But his smile...
And I'd run to him, and he'd take my hand just as I passed the gate.<eos> And then the dream would end.<eos> But his smile...<eos> I must have had that dream a hundred times.<eos> I had a dream about him, too.<eos> When?<eos> In the hospital.<eos> At first, I... I thought he was a hungry ghost.<eos> The people from where I'm from believe these ghosts... wander because they've been neglected by their family.<eos> Danny...
At first, I... I thought he was a hungry ghost.<eos> The people from where I'm from believe these ghosts... wander because they've been neglected by their family.<eos> Danny...<eos> - Uh... - No, no, no.<eos> I know.<eos> It sounds weird.<eos> The drugs they had me on were intense.<eos> Yeah? Huh.<eos> But it even smelled like him.<eos> Calvin Klein, right?
The people from where I'm from believe these ghosts... wander because they've been neglected by their family.<eos> Danny...<eos> - Uh... - No, no, no.<eos> I know.<eos> It sounds weird.<eos> The drugs they had me on were intense.<eos> Yeah?

- Uh... - No, no, no.<eos> I know.<eos> It sounds weird.<eos> The drugs they had me on were intense.<eos> Yeah? Huh.<eos> But it even smelled like him.<eos> Calvin Klein, right?<eos> Marc Jacobs.<eos> You mind if we go inside?<eos> Yeah.
Ward wanted to give you 40, but I got him to go higher.<eos> Just think of all you could do with that.<eos> I have to change my name?<eos> The world already thinks Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Let's just leave it that way.<eos> You can pick a name you love.<eos> You can start all over.<eos> It is gonna be great.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> - Danny...
It is gonna be great.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> - Danny...<eos> - Is this how you treat family?<eos> Yes, actually, it is.<eos> You know, the generosity of this offer speaks for itself.<eos> Look, you may not understand it, but Ward and I worked for this money.<eos> We worked day and night, while you were off doing... whatever you were doing.<eos> So... don't turn your nose up...<eos> Danny...

Hey.<eos> Are you the one who takes care of these?<eos> The gravestones?<eos> No, the family takes care of those.<eos> What if everyone in the family's dead?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I just cut the grass.<eos> But you could ask in the office.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.
- No.<eos> Come on.<eos> You were an intern in the legal department in my dad's office?<eos> You called his secretary Margaret a hatchet-faced bitch.<eos> I was standing right there.<eos> You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.<eos> Where was my office?<eos> Um... you didn't have one.<eos> They put you in the copy room.<eos> My desk?
It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.<eos> They're supposed to be my friends.<eos> I can help you get your business back, but I cannot help you make friends.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, so... what's it gonna cost me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But if we win, my firm is on permanent retainer for Rand.<eos> Deal?

Deal.<eos> We have a suite set up for occasions like this.<eos> I need you to lay low... and I need you to keep from drawing any attention to yourself.<eos> Okay, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm staying at the Chikara.<eos> Is that in Brooklyn?<eos> The new place with the glass floor?<eos> No, it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats.<eos> - Ah.
No, it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Do you have any money for some new clothes?<eos> Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.<eos> Why is everyone on at me about how I look?<eos> It's New York City.<eos> It matters.<eos> If this is too much for you...<eos> - What?
Sit this one out.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Too important.<eos> Okay, but you cannot be a drag tonight.<eos> We're doing something unusual and I can't have you screwing it up.<eos> Am I that big a problem?<eos> You've got a nice smile.<eos> Use it.<eos> Just as an experiment maybe.<eos> Raj!
Use it.<eos> Just as an experiment maybe.<eos> Raj!<eos> - Figured there's no time to waste.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Man after my own heart.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me pour this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Ward?
We are disappointed.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> There are discussions about your loyalty.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm doing everything you ask.<eos> I've got my best people working on the pier.<eos> Why did you leave?<eos> There was an emergency I had to attend to.<eos> What emergency?
There's... there's an impostor trying to infiltrate the company.<eos> A young man claiming to be Danny Rand.<eos> I needed to see for myself.<eos> And?<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.<eos> Yeah, I... I understand.<eos> - Kneel.<eos> - What?
I needed to see for myself.<eos> And?<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.<eos> Yeah, I... I understand.<eos> - Kneel.<eos> - What?<eos> On your knees.<eos> The, uh... the glass.
On your knees.<eos> The, uh... the glass.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Scissor punch!<eos> Scissor punch.<eos> Shuffle step.<eos> Round hook punch.<eos> Round hook punch!<eos> I got a Red Hook punch.<eos> - Red Hook?
Who put you in charge?<eos> Is this a kindergarten, or are you training warriors?<eos> I am trying to provide a safe place for people.<eos> Half the kids out there get beaten on a regular basis by family or bullies.<eos> This is the one place where they don't have to worry about that, until now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're in a bind.<eos> Having a tough time.<eos> But you can't be here.<eos> Sensei.
I know you're in a bind.<eos> Having a tough time.<eos> But you can't be here.<eos> Sensei.<eos> And here we are.<eos> Already?<eos> What is this?<eos> I thought we were headed to a restaurant.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> But first things first.
But first things first.<eos> Trust me, you're gonna like this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> And, frankly, this is starting to creep me out.<eos> Meet Kevin Kennedy.<eos> On life support following an auto accident for over a year.<eos> He weighed 185 and has O negative blood.<eos> In 30 minutes...<eos> Kevin's family will enter this room with a priest who will say last rites before the doctor takes him off life support and he dies.<eos> - Joy...
Exactly.<eos> His liver will never go to the national list.<eos> It will go directly to your nephew.<eos> Tonight.<eos> How the hell did you manage this?<eos> Rand has many friends.<eos> We'd like to add you to that list.<eos> And the pier is my buy-in.<eos> You, uh... really went above and beyond last night.<eos> Thanks.
You, uh... really went above and beyond last night.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You want to tell me what's so important about this pier?<eos> It's just an acquisition we need.<eos> For the future.<eos> So you're not gonna tell me.<eos> It's strategic.<eos> That's all.<eos> You know... it really pisses me off.<eos> What?
I'm tired... of a lot of things.<eos> I'd miss you.<eos> So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you that's fine.<eos> You know I back you no matter what.<eos> Right?<eos> I just want you to be happy.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Oh, thanks.
So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you that's fine.<eos> You know I back you no matter what.<eos> Right?<eos> I just want you to be happy.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> Your case is turning out to be more of a challenge than I thought.<eos> - How so?
I don't know.<eos> Do you have a date?<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was in July, 2001.<eos> I, uh... I broke my arm skateboarding.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> The X-rays from that period are on that shelf to your right.<eos> Uh, VC guys think it's a good investment, and I think so, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like to take a look.<eos> Danny.

You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?<eos> - Do you hate me that much?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because the Danny Rand that I knew, he's dead.<eos> And I want him to stay that way.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Back up.
- I don't understand.<eos> - Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm not your sister, he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.<eos> Danny, listen... we can work this out, okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.<eos> You can't deny what's mine.<eos> What my father meant for me to have.<eos> Sir.
I'm not your sister, he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.<eos> Danny, listen... we can work this out, okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.<eos> You can't deny what's mine.<eos> What my father meant for me to have.<eos> Sir.<eos> Give me everything you have on Danny.<eos> Everything.
Do you feel bad?<eos> About what you said?<eos> About what we're doing?<eos> I wonder why it has to be so complicated.<eos> And I really wish that I could find something in Danny to hate because...<eos> - it would make things a lot easier for me.<eos> - He just tried to attack your brother.<eos> He also said Dad visited him<eos> - in the mental hospital.<eos> - What?
Well done!<eos> Now, I told you it was gonna be a great night, didn't I?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Well, I hope you didn't lose your money on that one.<eos> 'Cause now we got the open round!<eos> That's right. Any of you guys wanna get in and take a shot, sign up with Leon right there.<eos> Who's it gonna be?<eos> Gonna be you?<eos> Who's gonna be the tough guy, huh?<eos> You?
You sure you wanna do this, honey?<eos> Call me honey again, I dare ya.<eos> Oh, I like it when you talk dirty.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We got any challengers?<eos> Who's it gonna be, huh?<eos> Anybody wanna take on the little lady?<eos> Rusty, uh... that's not fair.<eos> I paid my entry fee same as her.<eos> Leon?
Okay, then.<eos> We got any challengers?<eos> Who's it gonna be, huh?<eos> Anybody wanna take on the little lady?<eos> Rusty, uh... that's not fair.<eos> I paid my entry fee same as her.<eos> Leon?<eos> All right.<eos> Place your bets!<eos> Fighters...
Due to your client's continuing harassment and threats to me and my brother, we have decided to lower our offer to 20 million... and added a restraining order.<eos> The restraining order is a nice touch.<eos> I thought so.<eos> But since the time of your last offer, we have had a change of heart as well.<eos> We are still insisting on the full rights guaranteed as the sole heir of Rand, which includes a controlling 51%, board seat and compensation, but we are now adding a corner office, support staff, and a housing allowance in the amount of one million per year.<eos> Your sense of humor has always been your best attribute, but come on.<eos> You can't even prove he's who he says he is.<eos> At best he's crazy, at worst he's a con man.<eos> Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.<eos> Ward...
It could have been so easy.<eos> You could have just taken the money and had a great life.<eos> It's my name.<eos> And it means something.<eos> - Hey, I'll be back in a second. - Mmm.<eos> Yeah, I think Joy helped Hogarth, but I can't prove it.<eos> We need another plan.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can talk about it when I get there.<eos> Fifty.

What is this place?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> Last I remember, I was climbing up...<eos> Yeah, like goddamn Daredevil.<eos> Why'd you follow me?<eos> - You kicked me off the building?<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> It's what you do when you see someone trying to break in.<eos> You are really pushing the limits of karma.<eos> Now, boys.

You are really pushing the limits of karma.<eos> Now, boys.<eos> You see him, too?<eos> Danny.<eos> You died.<eos> - I saw pictures.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did die.<eos> You look the same age as when I last saw you.<eos> Your visit...
You look the same age as when I last saw you.<eos> Your visit...<eos> - it wasn't a hallucination.<eos> No, I had to see for myself.<eos> We had to protect ourselves, protect Rand.<eos> You know, it's not every day that someone comes back from the dead.<eos> Is it?<eos> But here we are.<eos> So... are we good?<eos> Danny?
You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear that.<eos> So, wait.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> I was diagnosed with cancer.<eos> Uh, lung, pancreatic.<eos> It attacked my whole body.<eos> I fought the good fight for three years, but, you know, I kept getting worse and worse.<eos> Toward the end...<eos> I barely hit a hundred pounds.<eos> - Jesus.
- Just like that?<eos> - No. No, what they failed to tell me was that I had to die first.<eos> Yeah, I still remember my last breath.<eos> Scariest shit I've ever experienced.<eos> And three days later...<eos> I'm breathing again.<eos> So, who saved you?<eos> Well, you mentioned these people during your stay at the hospital.<eos> - You called them the Hand.<eos> - The Hand?
Well, I can't.<eos> Not if I'm stuck in the courts trying to get back in Rand.<eos> Drop all litigation against our friend here.<eos> No more roadblocks.<eos> Offer everything he's owed as the rightful heir of Wendell Rand.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Uh, no offense to Danny, but he's been living in a monastery studying kung fu.<eos> This isn't a negotiation.<eos> Oh. Maybe we should give him his dad's old office, while we're at it.<eos> Yeah, great idea.
Make it happen, Ward.<eos> I've got big plans for you, Danny.<eos> Where should I start?<eos> What's the Hand doing in Rand?<eos> Well, that's unclear.<eos> I've only... ever met a couple representatives of the... of the Hand.<eos> You know, they show up in my home whenever they want with their demands.<eos> - What about now?<eos> - Well, only recently they... they demanded we purchase a local pier out near, uh, where... where was it?<eos> Red Hook.
Yeah, Joy closed the deal on the pier.<eos> Talk with her.<eos> We've needed a fighter like you back in the family.<eos> Hey, maybe I could teach you kung fu some time.<eos> - Hey, that'd be great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Feel free to call or come by any time.<eos> You need to watch yourself, Danny.<eos> I'm not afraid of the Hand.<eos> Good for you.
Feel free to call or come by any time.<eos> You need to watch yourself, Danny.<eos> I'm not afraid of the Hand.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I'm talking about Harold.<eos> Be careful.<eos> He's not a replacement for your dad.<eos> The only person Harold cares about is Harold.<eos> Now, watch this.<eos> Boom!
He's not a replacement for your dad.<eos> The only person Harold cares about is Harold.<eos> Now, watch this.<eos> Boom!<eos> - Sensei Wing knocked the shit out of him!<eos> - Right.<eos> You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.<eos> Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.
Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.<eos> I'm sorry, Sensei, but they never get to see you go all out.<eos> No, it's me that needs to be sorry.<eos> I'm a hypocrite, and I shouldn't have gone there.<eos> I don't need an apology.<eos> What you did was awesome.<eos> I posted it online.<eos> You what?
Danny's always been your soft spot.<eos> You clean up pretty good.<eos> The tie might be a touch effeminate.<eos> I like it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you all for coming out on this momentous occasion as Rand Enterprises welcomes Danny Rand to his rightful place in the company that bears his name.<eos> Danny will continue the legacy of his father, Wendell, and join us in guiding this great company into the future.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Danny Rand.<eos> That was great.<eos> Thanks.
And that's what Rand is to me.<eos> Home.<eos> My father, Wendell Rand, instilled in me a love and respect for this company that has never faded.<eos> I left here, ten years old, on a jet with my parents.<eos> We never reached our destination.<eos> I lost my family in that crash, and I became the lone survivor.<eos> I then was rescued by monks and raised in a monastery, a much different life to what I had here in New York.<eos> Ultimately... it taught me the value of life... of hard work... of never giving up on the things that matter to me.<eos> And Rand matters.<eos> Mr. Rand?

I don't know...<eos> Even though everything was familiar... it felt so... overwhelming.<eos> I felt out of control.<eos> But thankfully, Joy and Ward guided me to Dr. Paul Edmonds to get the help I needed.<eos> I couldn't have come back strong without them.<eos> Mr. Rand, how long was your stay at Birch Psychiatric Hospital?<eos> Is it true you had violent outbursts?<eos> Thank you for coming out.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Danny.
As Yu-Ti, the August Personage in Jade, says,<eos> "Kindness is the eternal law."<eos> Hey, look, have you got time to go through that pier deal you put through?<eos> The pier?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm just, uh...<eos> just trying to get my bearings.<eos> Yeah, just check with our assistant Megan.<eos> She'll set something up.<eos> Hey, morning, Megan.

Thanks.<eos> Your father's office.<eos> Even found his old desk.<eos> Now, don't get all weepy on me.<eos> I'm not.<eos> It's just, uh... It's been a while.<eos> - Is everything okay down there?<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Man...
Okay.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm gonna send a courier to pick up these contracts once you're done.<eos> Daniel... you have an extraordinary opportunity here.<eos> Don't foul it up.<eos> So, um...<eos> Once I'm done signing all this... then what?<eos> Door open, door closed?<eos> Open?

Pricing strategy for a new drug we patented.<eos> This will hit market in Asia, Africa,<eos> South and Central America, even Eastern Europe.<eos> These are all possible customers.<eos> Which means we can make this in bulk, making the production price less than $5 a pill.<eos> So, we can sell for $50 per dosage.<eos> It'll fund new research and give a nice boost to our profit margin in the pharmaceutical division.<eos> Excuse me, but, um, how many people die from, uh...<eos> What is it?<eos> Leishmaniasis.
If left untreated, latest numbers show roughly 50,000 a year.<eos> And we have the cure?<eos> We can save lives at five bucks a pill, but you wanna raise the price?<eos> I know how this looks, but this is how business is done.<eos> We should sell at cost.<eos> Hey, that's... that's not how it works.<eos> This is normal business.<eos> Then normal is not the best path to take.<eos> We can make our profits elsewhere.<eos> Please, Mr. Rand.
Then normal is not the best path to take.<eos> We can make our profits elsewhere.<eos> Please, Mr. Rand.<eos> We know how to do this.<eos> The World Health Organization will make most of the purchases and subsidize it for Third World countries.<eos> No one who needs this will be left untreated.<eos> No one should make a profit off of the misery of others.<eos> It's wrong.<eos> We need to sell the drug at cost.<eos> Period.
Yes.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> That may very well be, but if Mr. Rand wants to put his foot down on this, we'll do it.<eos> We'll go to market at cost.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, um, my schedule cleared up.<eos> Do you wanna go talk about that pier deal?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Shit.

This isn't the time to point fingers.<eos> It's the time for solutions.<eos> Can I count on you to handle this reporter?<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Well, taking care of this will more than make up for that drug pricing screw-up this afternoon.<eos> Joy is keeping Danny busy.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> That's what I like to hear.<eos> Love you, son.<eos> Megan!

But I like you.<eos> You ready for the fight of your life?<eos> You better be!<eos> Hey!<eos> You better be!<eos> Because the Daughter of the Dragon has returned!<eos> But... she doesn't think the Duke here... is enough of a challenge.<eos> So, on her request, she wants a little two-on-one action.<eos> And I got just the guy for her.<eos> Jimmy Pierce, you still here?

Is that normal, for chief counsel to... buy things without knowing why?<eos> I don't really need to know the "why."<eos> Ward's leadership has led Rand to success after success and...<eos> Why are you so interested in this?<eos> When I got to the... - the monastery, post-crash... - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A powerful, important job, and I wanted it.<eos> Your dad always said to set your goals high.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everyone there, and I mean everyone, said there was no way a xiaoguilao like me could do it.<eos> - A xiaogui... what?
Uh, I don't know.<eos> We'll see.<eos> So... how long you planning on staying here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've been pretty busy since I got here.<eos> After living in a monastery for 15 years...<eos> It's a big step up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> - First off, my room?
Yeah.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> - First off, my room?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It was nothing like this.<eos> Six by six, a dirty mat on the floor.<eos> A blanket, you know.<eos> A literal pot to piss in.<eos> Every morning, I'd walk a mile uphill with jugs the size of my torso, just to get mine and my shifu's daily ration of water.<eos> - Every morning?

I don't know.<eos> Another guy living in a deluxe apartment?<eos> - You want a drink?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know how to make a vodka tonic?<eos> Well... if it's just vodka and tonic, then, yeah.<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Um, light on the tonic.<eos> Danny!

Back to the Golden Sands.<eos> Go!<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> - You okay?<eos> Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We have to call the police.<eos> - I know where they're going.<eos> - What?
- I know where they're going.<eos> - What?<eos> You have no idea how bad it is.<eos> It's like we have goddamn Tarzan walking around the place, fresh from the jungle.<eos> How so?<eos> I shouldn't be telling you this, but we have this drug that we've spent years working on.<eos> Now, I can't go into specifics, but know this.<eos> This is a game changer.<eos> This drug will save millions of lives.<eos> - Wow.

At cost.<eos> - You're kidding me.<eos> - Mmm-mmm.<eos> That is a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> He is worse than these bleeding-heart-liberal-trust-fund hipsters wandering around Williamsburg.<eos> Uh, thanks for the interview.<eos> What, you're leaving so soon?<eos> We've got bourbon to finish.<eos> Tempting, but, uh, I have an early morning deadline.<eos> Ellison?
- It was a misunderstanding.<eos> - Right.<eos> I guess being a millionaire covers a multitude of sins.<eos> Billionaire.<eos> What do you know about the Golden Sands?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's a bunch of Chinese restaurants with that name.<eos> Any of them attached to hatchet-wielding criminals?<eos> You know 'em?<eos> Triads.
I'm sorry, we're closed.<eos> I need to speak to the head of the Yangshi Gongsi.<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you should not come looking for it.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Eh?<eos> This one bested all of you?<eos> I am Yang Hai-Qing... head of the Yangshi Gongsi.<eos> And you are?<eos> - Danny Rand.

We wanted words with her.<eos> No.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.<eos> Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?<eos> I'm here to let you know it's not within your best interests to come near Joy ever again.<eos> Why is Rand so determined to keep the pier all to itself?<eos> Look, another group of people forced us to purchase it.<eos> Who could force a giant business like Rand to do anything?<eos> The Hand.
Uh, it's... more of a sharing of ideas.<eos> We, um... we came to an agreement.<eos> What... what are you doing?<eos> How did you put it, Joy?<eos> This ain't my first rodeo?<eos> Look, I can pop it back into place.<eos> Easy.<eos> So... back in K'un-Lun, my shifu would make me count to three in Mandarin before he would fix it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yee...

I used to fight in a few illegal fight clubs on my way back from K'un-Lun.<eos> But just so you know...<eos> I'm more than willing to pay up on our previous deal.<eos> I still owe you rent for six months.<eos> Answer is the same.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> All right, let's make a move.<eos> - See you around.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks.
Answer is the same.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> All right, let's make a move.<eos> - See you around.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So how are we gonna tell Ward?<eos> He finds out men with hatchets attacked his sister?<eos> I thought you said you didn't want the cops involved.<eos> Hmm, good point.
Now, receive your reward.<eos> I haven't seen her in person since she was a child.<eos> Someone hit my daughter?<eos> My people said she had a run-in with some criminals.<eos> She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?<eos> Me.
So, as you can see...<eos> The value of this particular heroin is unprecedented.<eos> Why not let an expert be the judge?<eos> Oh, honey, you don't need to worry about that mess anymore.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> If you broke him...<eos> My mum always told me patience is a virtue.<eos> It's like the first time.<eos> Oh, my God!
Then the laws are wrong.<eos> If that's true, your fight doesn't belong here.<eos> Rand Enterprises cannot be held responsible for governmental guidelines.<eos> I think we're done.<eos> It's being shipped in through the new Rand Pier, Ward.<eos> Is that heroin?<eos> You bring drugs in my office?<eos> I had to find out what we're dealing with.<eos> What makes you think this has anything to do with us?<eos> Hai-Qing Yang.
Now, they got pretty angry, but don't worry, I cleared it up.<eos> - Hatchet Men?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I asked Hai-Qing what the Hand wanted with the pier, and then they sent me a box.<eos> This was inside.<eos> It's a message.<eos> Do you know how crazy this sounds?<eos> It's not.<eos> Look at the symbol on the bag.<eos> - A snake?
It's not.<eos> Look at the symbol on the bag.<eos> - A snake?<eos> - It's not a snake.<eos> It's the symbol for Shou-Lao the Undying.<eos> The Undying?<eos> From K'un-Lun.<eos> Shou-Lao made me a living weapon.<eos> Okay, now you've lost me.<eos> - The dragon. - Ah.
Okay.<eos> Let me make this simple.<eos> The Hand is using our company to smuggle synthetic heroin into the city.<eos> We need to stop it.<eos> Harold said so himself.<eos> You were there.<eos> And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...
You were there.<eos> And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.<eos> I have real business in the real world to deal with.<eos> Fine.<eos> - I'll leave you to it then.<eos> - Thanks.
Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.<eos> I have real business in the real world to deal with.<eos> Fine.<eos> - I'll leave you to it then.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Megan?
No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.<eos> I have real business in the real world to deal with.<eos> Fine.<eos> - I'll leave you to it then.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Megan?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Rand?
But I, uh... I do need to know when the next shipment arrives at the Red Hook Pier.<eos> - Could you tell me that?<eos> - No.<eos> But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin in Transport and have her bring that information to you.<eos> I'm on my way down now, anyway.<eos> She's right off the elevator on the fourth floor.<eos> I'll let her know you're coming.<eos> I'm so glad we had this talk.<eos> - Going to lunch.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Meachum.

Sounds ludicrous, but... at least then there'd be something I could do about it.<eos> Help them.<eos> You know what this is really about, right?<eos> I was so scared when Dad got sick.<eos> These people are just grasping for the same answers I did.<eos> We can't blame them.<eos> Everyone wants the ability to prevent bad things from happening, but... unfortunately, sometimes it's just a matter of chance.<eos> That's the last thing a control freak wants to hear.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?

I wanted to show you this.<eos> My son.<eos> That's his fourth-grade photo.<eos> Class picture day.<eos> He has cancer.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> I...

Okay. Okay.<eos> You are not to be underestimated, Claire.<eos> Hell, I'm still getting used to bringing the hurt... instead of fixing it.<eos> Well, for what it's worth...<eos> I've never had a student progress as fast as you have.<eos> Guess I got tired of people doing things for me all the time.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> In that case, we better keep practicing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.

Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're Danny Rand, right?<eos> I've seen you on the news.<eos> Talk about a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<eos> Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.<eos> Hi, Danny.
Talk about a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<eos> Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.<eos> Hi, Danny.<eos> Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.<eos> Well, um, it'll have to wait till I'm done.<eos> Oh, but I ordered takeout.<eos> You what?

She gave me a couple of bucks when I lived in the park.<eos> I see.<eos> Oh, what the...<eos> Excuse me, hi.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I told you, I ordered takeout.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You cannot just show up here with all of this stuff expecting some...<eos> - Is this a date?<eos> - What?
- Is this a date?<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I mean, uh, unless you want it to be.<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> It's definitely not that.<eos> - Oh, wow. - I just...
And that requires candlelight?<eos> This was my dad's favorite place.<eos> It's the only takeout I know.<eos> Smells good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, I'd be thrilled to spend the rest of my session just joining the two of you.<eos> I've never had takeout like this before.<eos> - Oh, the thing is, it's...<eos> - A great idea.

They didn't have a leg to stand on before. Now they do.<eos> The principal shareholder of Rand Enterprises has accepted responsibility.<eos> Right.<eos> "The... board member was coerced into... an admission of fault under false pretenses.<eos> No legal connection has been drawn between... Rand Enterprises and any of the affected individuals."<eos> We'll win this in court.<eos> A case like this could take years.<eos> Still cheaper than settling.<eos> Ward, they're threatening to release this video by the end of the day.<eos> So?
My grandmother could stir fry the shit out of donkey and veggies.<eos> I'll take your word for it.<eos> When you weren't sneaking out... were you just waiting around... what, meditating?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We learned martial arts.<eos> That must have been tough with you being so young.<eos> It was what it was.<eos> Well, still... after everything you'd been through with the crash...<eos> I don't know, that would have been a really hard thing for me to have handled.<eos> I, um...
Material attachments, uh... indulgent activities, romantic entanglements.<eos> Wait, you... you took a vow of chastity?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Why did you wait this long?<eos> To come back, I mean.<eos> The way was closed.<eos> I had to wait for it to open again.<eos> So you said you wanted to talk about something?<eos> Yeah, I, um...

Um, do you mind?<eos> No, take whatever you want.<eos> Cool?<eos> Namaste.<eos> See ya.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's Rand.<eos> Some bad people have gotten on the inside.<eos> Criminals.
See ya.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's Rand.<eos> Some bad people have gotten on the inside.<eos> Criminals.<eos> They're using the company as a cover to conduct their own business.<eos> What kind of business?<eos> They're trying to get a synthetic heroin into the city.<eos> Heroin?
They own the pier.<eos> I just need you to watch my back.<eos> You're joking.<eos> You want me to come with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm just a karate teacher, Danny.<eos> No, you're not. You're a fighter.<eos> I know you've been testing yourself<eos> - in an underground fight club.<eos> - What...
I had hoped that Mr. Rand would be here to speak for his actions, but... the concept of work hours is still foreign to him.<eos> However, we're a team and we need to support our colleague as he continues his transition back to this life and this company.<eos> So... let us do what we do best and save the day.<eos> I've carefully weighed our options.<eos> And after consulting with Joy... I've reached a conclusion.<eos> Settling would be a mistake.<eos> Paying these people off admits there's something to hide, when there isn't.<eos> This was an act of pure manipulation, and I'm calling their bluff.<eos> I think you might be letting right and wrong interfere with what's best for the company, Ward.<eos> Really, Lawrence?
It's just meant to be used the Japanese way.<eos> Hey.<eos> Check this out.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> Play time's over.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> We need your phone to take pics.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Everything all right?
My phone was on silent for meditation.<eos> The office has been calling.<eos> Are we doing this or what?<eos> Lead the way.<eos> Daniel Rand's miraculous return to Rand Enterprises is making headlines once again after a video where he apologizes for a corporate scandal puts the fate of the company at stake.<eos> Suck on that, Dad.<eos> A spokesperson for the class action suit claimed that Rand Enterprises callously turned a blind eye when it was brought to their attention that a chemical plant may have been responsible for 15 cases of cancer in a Staten Island neighborhood,<eos> Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?
Scared me.<eos> Yeah, well, the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.<eos> But maybe doing something like this...<eos> Walk where I walk, and they'll never see us.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thanks for doing this.<eos> Don't thank me yet.<eos> It's just nice having someone to count on.<eos> You have the Meachums.<eos> Joy...
"One never really knows one's own true intentions."<eos> So...<eos> Yeah, you might as well.<eos> What's our timeframe on that?<eos> Hey, we need to get closer.<eos> All right.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> Open 'em up.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Supplies?
Yeah, you might as well.<eos> What's our timeframe on that?<eos> Hey, we need to get closer.<eos> All right.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> Open 'em up.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Supplies?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Danny.
Look, we're on the right track, okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's just more equipment.<eos> Why would they need guns unless they have something to hide?<eos> All right.<eos> This is the one.<eos> It's gotta be.<eos> Keep an eye out for me.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Danny!
It's just more equipment.<eos> Why would they need guns unless they have something to hide?<eos> All right.<eos> This is the one.<eos> It's gotta be.<eos> Keep an eye out for me.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Danny!<eos> Let's lock this one up.<eos> Shit.

Let's lock this one up.<eos> Shit.<eos> Danny...<eos> Has found its way nicely to Marks.<eos> Up the field.<eos> Oh, that's a lovely ball.<eos> Back again...<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Radovan, the chemist.
- He's been stabbed.<eos> We need to get him to a hospital.<eos> Jump in.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I'm a wanted man in several countries... unless they find me first.<eos> If we don't help him, he's gonna die.<eos> We know a nurse.<eos> I'm sure you're aware of this.<eos> That video has gone viral.<eos> Ward?

I need to know.<eos> Ward!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Well, that makes one of us.<eos> I don't know what's going on here, but I do know that we have a problem, and I need you in your right mind to help me figure out how to correct it.<eos> Shouldn't listen to Joy.<eos> Why are you doing this to yourself, Ward?<eos> Doing it to him.<eos> Who?<eos> Danny?
I was hoping he could stay here.<eos> I have lessons here, I...<eos> We can move him to your bedroom.<eos> We'll figure something out.<eos> I'll hire security guards.<eos> You can't trust anyone!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Relax.<eos> - Take me back.<eos> Take me back.<eos> - Shh.
We'll figure something out.<eos> I'll hire security guards.<eos> You can't trust anyone!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Relax.<eos> - Take me back.<eos> Take me back.<eos> - Shh.<eos> No, you need to relax.<eos> It's okay, you're safe here.<eos> - Sabina.

It's okay, you're safe here.<eos> - Sabina.<eos> - Hey, shh...<eos> Is that your wife?<eos> Do you want us to call her?<eos> My daughter.<eos> They have her.<eos> Who has her?<eos> The Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.
- Hey, shh...<eos> Is that your wife?<eos> Do you want us to call her?<eos> My daughter.<eos> They have her.<eos> Who has her?<eos> The Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> What?
That you just started a war by taking him from them.<eos> Do you realize that?<eos> My colleague at Metro-General Hospital was gutted.<eos> It was an army of ninjas, and they tried to kill me, too.<eos> It was all covered up.<eos> Forced me to quit my job.<eos> They've been here all along.<eos> The Hand is everywhere.<eos> Why did they want you here in New York?<eos> Heroin.
Then I'll find her.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, this is not something a rich kid from the Upper West Side can just "handle," okay?<eos> This is a job that requires someone with special... skills.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Okay, we all have our limitations.<eos> You have to accept yours.<eos> Listen...<eos> I know I'm not the best businessman... and I don't think I'll be the CEO my father was.<eos> But this?
Finally.<eos> They study your every move, looking for what you reveal to them.<eos> In this way, you are your own worst enemy.<eos> The time has come.<eos> The time has come.<eos> And this is why I tolerate no questioning from you... because doubt leads... To death.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> We'll make this right.<eos> - We're taking care of it.<eos> - What?
The time has come.<eos> And this is why I tolerate no questioning from you... because doubt leads... To death.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> We'll make this right.<eos> - We're taking care of it.<eos> - What?<eos> That.<eos> Went with CIR.<eos> - Wilkins's recommendation.<eos> - CIR?

You didn't get my e-mail?<eos> Oh, I missed that.<eos> You good for this meeting?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I just mean...<eos> Are you gonna be all right today?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> What happened last night can't happen again.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm on my own here, Ward.<eos> I...
I mean, I feel like I'm on my own here, Ward.<eos> I...<eos> We have real trouble, and you...<eos> I mean, I have no idea what's going on with you.<eos> Nothing is going on with me.<eos> Well, I tried to turn a blind eye.<eos> I've tried to ignore it.<eos> I know what's in the drawer.<eos> Listen...<eos> Sorry.
Look.<eos> It's not a thing.<eos> Promise.<eos> You scared me, okay?<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh. I need you to do something for me.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> - Danny.
Okay.<eos> Oh. I need you to do something for me.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> - Danny.<eos> This is all about him.<eos> He has got to be at that meeting today.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got it.<eos> I'll make sure that he's there.<eos> Thanks.
- Danny.<eos> This is all about him.<eos> He has got to be at that meeting today.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got it.<eos> I'll make sure that he's there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Found two more warehouses on the Lower East Side, Mr. Rand.<eos> - Is that everything?<eos> - Yes, sir.
Okay.<eos> I got it.<eos> I'll make sure that he's there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Found two more warehouses on the Lower East Side, Mr. Rand.<eos> - Is that everything?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Please, it's Danny.<eos> Megan, could you give us a minute?<eos> Of course, Mr. Meachum.

- This is a real problem.<eos> Have you seen the video of you apologizing?<eos> Yeah, I've seen it.<eos> In the time it took me to walk from my office, we're probably over six million views.<eos> What's your point?<eos> We laid out a path for you to follow.<eos> Simple.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> The woman's son was dying.<eos> Hey, sad story.

Don't even say that.<eos> - That's yours?<eos> - Sure is.<eos> - You sure we're gonna be back in time?<eos> Monastery Boy in an Aston Martin.<eos> I had the fastest donkey cart in K'un-Lun, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> I mean, we gotta get him to a hospital.<eos> I don't want a hospital.<eos> - Mr. Radovan...
- Mr. Radovan...<eos> - I... I want my daughter.<eos> Danny's taking care of that.<eos> Right now, we need to take care of you.<eos> We should call an ambulance.<eos> Not sure that's the best idea.<eos> Look, if we don't do something soon, you're gonna have a dead man on your bed.<eos> Yeah, what about his daughter?<eos> That's Danny's problem.<eos> Our problem...
We gotta head back.<eos> Not until I find her.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> What's worse, my time.<eos> There is no heroin, no girl, nothing.<eos> Look, you can stay in the car if you want.<eos> I'm not stopping.<eos> I thought you were staying in the car.<eos> Thought wrong.<eos> This it?
We have to call the...<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Rand can't be tied to this.<eos> Danny, we have to get out of here!<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I fought him.<eos> Because he didn't stop me, they killed him.<eos> What is that?<eos> An invitation.
Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I fought him.<eos> Because he didn't stop me, they killed him.<eos> What is that?<eos> An invitation.<eos> I'm not going anywhere else.<eos> You weren't invited.<eos> It's for me only.<eos> Danny.

Danny.<eos> Hey.<eos> How is he?<eos> - Not good.<eos> - Better.<eos> His right bronchi are contracting.<eos> He doesn't have very long.<eos> What about his daughter?<eos> It's called da jue zhan.<eos> A grand duel.
This... this is what you're gonna do?<eos> It's the only way to get Sabina back.<eos> Yeah, not the only way.<eos> There is a little thing called "notifying the police."<eos> Nah, it's too risky.<eos> We can't take that chance.<eos> The duel begins at sundown.<eos> We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky. Sundown.<eos> Of course.
We can't take that chance.<eos> The duel begins at sundown.<eos> We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky. Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> You can't.<eos> This is for me only.<eos> - Danny...
This is not something you just walk into.<eos> This is what I'm supposed to do.<eos> What do you mean, "supposed to do"?<eos> Look...<eos> I'm not just an ordinary fighter, okay?<eos> I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> The hell does that mean?<eos> It means I never lose.<eos> The more you talk... the weirder this gets.<eos> Danny...

Coming back to New York... I thought things were gonna be different.<eos> It hasn't been what I thought.<eos> I have been preparing to defend K'un-Lun my entire life against the Hand.<eos> And now, I find out that they are here?<eos> This is where I'm meant to be.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Megan!

No, I didn't get him.<eos> You know how he is.<eos> He's caught up in something of his own.<eos> - I should've, but...<eos> - Right.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm tired of hearing that.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Ward, Wayne Olsen.
He's caught up in something of his own.<eos> - I should've, but...<eos> - Right.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm tired of hearing that.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Ward, Wayne Olsen.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Ward.<eos> - Likewise, Mr. Olsen.
Tell me the legend again.<eos> Why are you so interested in hearing it?<eos> Because it gives me courage.<eos> A child... touched by fire.<eos> Delivered from heaven to be our greatest warrior.<eos> Destined for victory.<eos> And that's me?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.
Don't you know?<eos> I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> What else is there?<eos> You have yet to face the most cunning opponent of them all.<eos> The Hand.<eos> No.<eos> Who're you talking to?<eos> It's time.<eos> Sabina.
No, no, no, no, no! Shh!<eos> He's really hurting. Shh.<eos> Calm, calm, calm, clam.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I need to get that bandage down.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> I need you to stay calm. Shh.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Breathe.<eos> - Sabina!
Is he...<eos> No.<eos> We got to take him in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Iron Fist accepts the challenge of the Grand Duel in the name of the holy city of K'un-Lun.<eos> My terms are that, upon my victory, the Hand will relinquish custody of the young woman Sabina... and depart from Rand.<eos> Welcome.<eos> My master agrees to your terms.<eos> Should you lose, but remain alive, you must remove yourself from all of our dealings.<eos> Agreed.
The challenge has begun.<eos> You cannot be in two places at once.<eos> You must be a double-edged sword.<eos> So you know how to fight.<eos> But it doesn't make you the Iron Fist.<eos> Because the real Iron Fist would never leave his post.<eos> It would immediately make him unworthy.<eos> Did you run away, Danny Rand?<eos> - Shut your mouth.<eos> - A sore spot.
- A sore spot.<eos> Or did you come here to destroy the Hand?<eos> - Is that why you're here?<eos> - I don't think he knows why he's here.<eos> He's just a little boy chasing girls.<eos> The enemy will try and divide you.<eos> You are a living weapon.<eos> Drive all other thoughts out of your mind except this...<eos> Destroy the Hand.<eos> Yield.

The first battle is won.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I need Pulmonary.<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Claire?<eos> Oh, Delicia, thank God.<eos> - I need a line hop.<eos> - Done.<eos> What's the trauma?<eos> John Doe.
Okay.<eos> Call upstairs.<eos> We're bringing in an active.<eos> Can we forego on the fingerprints and ID?<eos> You haven't changed.<eos> I'll buy as much time as I can.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Shit.

Heard you were on the floor.<eos> - You heard I was on the floor? - Mmm.<eos> - I've been here 30 seconds. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Friend of yours?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Fine, um... put him at the head of the queue.<eos> Gentlemen, get him on a gurney.<eos> Thanks, Shirley.
It does.<eos> I sense your fear.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I fear no one.<eos> We all fear something.<eos> There's no need to hide.<eos> I'm not hiding.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Then why hide behind the mask of...<eos> Danny Rand?
It's not a mask.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> Mmm, I don't think so.<eos> That child died long ago.<eos> I think someone new is waiting to get out.<eos> Are we going to fight or not?<eos> We don't have to fight.<eos> Why don't you... kiss me instead?<eos> If you took me for pleasure how would that make you feel?<eos> Terrible?

If you took me for pleasure how would that make you feel?<eos> Terrible?<eos> Or maybe...<eos> - Good. - Hmm.<eos> Aw, you're worried.<eos> Even about a stranger.<eos> There's no need.<eos> What is this?<eos> Singing Spider venom.<eos> Very rare.
Yes, you can.<eos> Just give in.<eos> It's the life you want, and I can give it to you.<eos> You were looking for freedom, and here it is.<eos> Poisoned.<eos> A gift I freely give.<eos> Reject or accept the darkness.<eos> It is your choice.<eos> Both are acceptable.<eos> But your choice...
Reveals who you are.<eos> The second battle is won.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Barely.<eos> If you wish to withdraw...<eos> I'm not leaving without the girl.<eos> It's a well-crafted statement, and I'm sure that Danny can deliver it with sincerity.<eos> And it's not untrue.<eos> Uh, he was speaking from his heart...<eos> Yeah, a great quality.

I, uh... I guess we're done here.<eos> Ward?<eos> Hey, Ward!<eos> Stop, Ward!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I know that I just had a refill, but like I already explained, my housekeeper accidently threw the bag away with the pills in it.<eos> No. I can't wait until the doctor gets in, in the morning.<eos> Okay, thank you for being absolutely no help.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Ah! Ah, my hand.
I don't think anything's broken.<eos> Let's let the doctor decide that, hmm?<eos> I just need something for the pain.<eos> Look, we need to be sure.<eos> It won't be long.<eos> Nothing is broken.<eos> Look, I've had a really long day and now this.<eos> So I just need something for the pain, and then I'll be on my way.<eos> If I can just get you to sign in, then...<eos> What the...

Look...<eos> What would it take?<eos> - Three or four pills, huh?<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> What?<eos> Do you want the whole thing?<eos> Look, you can leave right now, or I can call security.<eos> Security?<eos> Really?<eos> - Really?

Really?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Ward!<eos> What is going on?<eos> Is this a friend of yours?<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Well... we seem to be having a problem here.<eos> I was feeling a little...<eos> You know, I... I hurt my hand.<eos> Yeah.
I was feeling a little...<eos> You know, I... I hurt my hand.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not like that, Joy.<eos> Let's get you out of here.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I didn't leave here on the best of terms.<eos> Shirley is not one to give up without a fight.<eos> Unless someone forced her to.<eos> Hey, Delicia, um...
What's wrong?<eos> I didn't leave here on the best of terms.<eos> Shirley is not one to give up without a fight.<eos> Unless someone forced her to.<eos> Hey, Delicia, um...<eos> can you check and see which OR<eos> - my John Doe was checked in to?<eos> - Sure.<eos> That's strange.<eos> What?
Shirley is not one to give up without a fight.<eos> Unless someone forced her to.<eos> Hey, Delicia, um...<eos> can you check and see which OR<eos> - my John Doe was checked in to?<eos> - Sure.<eos> That's strange.<eos> What?<eos> He never arrived at an OR.<eos> Thanks.
- There.<eos> - Where?<eos> - There.<eos> - What level is this?<eos> - That is sub three.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Why would they have a patient down there?<eos> Because they're leaving!<eos> Come on.<eos> To the left.
With a desire to serve... until death.<eos> Cast away your childish needs.<eos> Bury your mother.<eos> Bury your father.<eos> You belong to me and to me alone.<eos> - You must submit, can you do it?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Then tell me who you are!<eos> A child... touched by fire... delivered from heaven to become the greatest warrior, destined for victory.<eos> Guardian of the Gate...

Then tell me who you are!<eos> A child... touched by fire... delivered from heaven to become the greatest warrior, destined for victory.<eos> Guardian of the Gate...<eos> Destroyer of the Hand.<eos> Stop!<eos> Strike him down, the girl dies.<eos> Withdraw from the duel, and she'll be spared.<eos> That's dishonorable.<eos> What do I care for honor?<eos> Your purpose.
I dream of it every night.<eos> So, please, why would you choose to leave heaven?<eos> My reasons are my own.<eos> Like the girl?<eos> I am entertained by how your mind works.<eos> Has life inside the monastery changed so much?<eos> Because you seem so different from those I remember.<eos> They still teach honor.<eos> - And I made a promise.<eos> - Honor.
Something I thought your father, Wendell, could use more of.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You knew my father?<eos> Tell me about my father!<eos> I could've won.<eos> And I did win.<eos> She cheated.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> What?
Wait a minute.<eos> You knew my father?<eos> Tell me about my father!<eos> I could've won.<eos> And I did win.<eos> She cheated.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> What?<eos> Was I supposed to let her die?<eos> What?
Shit.<eos> It's, uh... it's Silybum marianum.<eos> Milk thistle.
Shit.<eos> It's, uh... it's Silybum marianum.<eos> Milk thistle.<eos> It's good for the liver.<eos> Why is it that a man who is so obsessed with his own longevity... can be so careless with the people who control his fate?<eos> The Hand is concerned with this rebellious streak you've shown.<eos> You left the confines of your penthouse.<eos> I explained that already.<eos> There was someone claiming to be Danny...<eos> Danny Rand.
I swear on the lives of my children, I have nothing to do with Danny Rand.<eos> Harold, we have a problem.<eos> You killed them.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> They were going to kill you, Danny.<eos> Why didn't you summon the Iron Fist?<eos> I can't.<eos> I just used it at the tournament.<eos> It drains my chi.<eos> Oh. The tournament?
Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> All that matters is they're onto us.<eos> We need to move fast.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - Ah. Her name is Madame Gao.<eos> I, uh, met her on my deathbed.<eos> She's the one who made the deal, Danny.<eos> Live in service to the Hand, or die in the dark.<eos> She said she knew my father.<eos> What?
Time isn't on our side.<eos> Look how out of control this has already gotten.<eos> What I had to do to protect you.<eos> I don't know how much more of this I can take.<eos> You know what needs to be done to end this, Danny.<eos> What do we do with the bodies?<eos> I'll, uh... I'll take care of 'em.<eos> I'll make 'em disappear.<eos> Gao will know they're missing, but as long as it looks as though they did their job before they left...<eos> What job?
Oh, come on.<eos> - You're slipping.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> You're fine?<eos> You're fine, like when I came in the other night and I found you passed out on your couch?<eos> I told you, I took a muscle relaxer.<eos> What else have you been taking?<eos> I don't need your bullshit, Joy.<eos> You have no idea what my life is like.<eos> No goddamn idea.
I don't need your bullshit, Joy.<eos> You have no idea what my life is like.<eos> No goddamn idea.<eos> - Because you won't tell me!<eos> - I can't!<eos> I ca...<eos> You need help, Ward.<eos> What I need is for you to stay out of my business.<eos> I have everything under control.<eos> Yeah.
Tell me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Enjoy your secrets.<eos> It's late.<eos> Wasn't sure you were gonna pick up this time.<eos> - I'm glad you did.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I need your help with something over at the penthouse.<eos> It's important.<eos> Really not a good time.
- You need me?<eos> - Please.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Hold still.<eos> I haven't done this in a while.<eos> Maybe I should go to the hospital.<eos> - I can tell 'em I got mugged.<eos> - The hospital's not safe.<eos> And I can handle a few stitches.<eos> What?
What if Gao was lying?<eos> Just trying to get in your head, undermine your will to fight her.<eos> It's strategy straight out of The Art of War.<eos> Oh, it's Claire.<eos> Sabina's safe.<eos> - Just trying to keep the wound clean.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.
Sabina's safe.<eos> - Just trying to keep the wound clean.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are these for?<eos> 'Cause I need a drink.<eos> And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.<eos> Glass.
Tell me another one.<eos> Another story.<eos> About K'un-Lun.<eos> Man...<eos> I was there a long time.<eos> They aren't all great memories.<eos> How about how you got that tattoo?<eos> Well... it's not exactly a tattoo.<eos> It's the mark of the Iron Fist.<eos> Danny...
So, yeah...<eos> I guess we both lost tonight.<eos> You're going to keep trying... aren't you?<eos> To stop... them?<eos> I can't quit now.<eos> I should go.<eos> - You can stay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> I gotta... go to the office in the morning, so I should...<eos> Danny...
You're going to keep trying... aren't you?<eos> To stop... them?<eos> I can't quit now.<eos> I should go.<eos> - You can stay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> I gotta... go to the office in the morning, so I should...<eos> Danny...<eos> I want you to stay.<eos> - You sure?
Oh, maybe it was your sister.<eos> Well, guess I'll do it myself, then.<eos> Come on!<eos> God.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> You think I don't know how messed up this is?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> Danny?
Well, guess I'll do it myself, then.<eos> Come on!<eos> God.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> You think I don't know how messed up this is?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> Danny?<eos> Right here.
I do the same thing.<eos> It keeps people at bay, but... you know that you don't have to wear it with me.<eos> Hey, I need you to find all of my dad's old files.<eos> Okay.<eos> They're probably in storage.<eos> Which ones do you want?<eos> Um... anything that mentions a woman named Gao.<eos> - Who's that? - Um...<eos> Just... just get everything of my father's.<eos> All of it.
They're probably in storage.<eos> Which ones do you want?<eos> Um... anything that mentions a woman named Gao.<eos> - Who's that? - Um...<eos> Just... just get everything of my father's.<eos> All of it.<eos> And get them to move it into my office.<eos> It's probably gonna be a lot of files.<eos> Well, I have a pretty big office.<eos> - Danny.
But I also care about this company.<eos> And right now, I seem to be the only one here who is taking this seriously.<eos> I mean, I have no idea where Ward is.<eos> And you don't even show up for the CIR meeting.<eos> And when you do show up to work, your face is beat to shit.<eos> You're the one that wanted into this company, right?<eos> You fought like hell to get it.<eos> Well, now is the time for the hard work to actually start.<eos> I need you to just do what I say at this meeting today, so we can get this situation fixed.<eos> - Danny?
I've been in Rand far longer than you have.<eos> And I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.<eos> You're not going to attack an old woman in front of all your employees, are you?<eos> I think Danny Rand is in enough trouble around here.<eos> I passed your test.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> What I can do.<eos> You're not the first I've met to carry the mantle of the Iron Fist.<eos> Is that why you use that symbol on your heroin packages?<eos> The dragon without the wings?
Eat at fancy restaurants with your friends, like Claire Temple and Colleen Wing.<eos> Stop your war.<eos> This city is no place for the Iron Fist.<eos> You're a businessman now... and this is the best offer you are ever going to get.<eos> My father... did you make him an offer too?<eos> Don't forget to water your plant, Danny.<eos> It is your responsibility now.<eos> Yamade wa Buddha, please watch me and guide over my descent.<eos> This is probably gonna hurt.<eos> Ward?

I mean, you...<eos> you're the only family I have left.<eos> And maybe what's happening to you is partly my fault, too.<eos> Sometimes, it's... it's just easier to... pretend nothing's wrong than to say something.<eos> Maybe you should take a break.<eos> Just... for a few weeks.<eos> I can handle things here.<eos> There are places... discreet places... that could help you.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> - Yeah?
They work for us.<eos> - You need to remind them of that.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Demand is higher than we anticipated.<eos> As long as supply can keep up with orders, we should be reaching our sales goal within the next three months.<eos> Quantity is not an issue.<eos> The chemist is almost ready to give up his formula.<eos> And once he does that, we can begin mass production.<eos> There are still holdouts.<eos> Like Hai-Qing Yang.
She killed the last guy who failed to defeat me.<eos> Turned his head into a mailbox.<eos> I'm giving you a new choice.<eos> You're gonna leave my building.<eos> You're gonna run, and you're never coming back.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> That's why you're gonna give me your password.<eos> So I can find them first.<eos> Your form's getting a little sloppy, Colleen.<eos> Bakuto.
That's why you're gonna give me your password.<eos> So I can find them first.<eos> Your form's getting a little sloppy, Colleen.<eos> Bakuto.<eos> I didn't know you were coming.<eos> I was just warming up.<eos> Mmm. Obviously.<eos> I only recently got back into the city.<eos> I heard the dojo's under new management?<eos> Ownership, not management.

Obviously.<eos> I only recently got back into the city.<eos> I heard the dojo's under new management?<eos> Ownership, not management.<eos> And that's your Danny Rand?<eos> The Iron Fist.
You will always come first for me.<eos> You need to be cautious.<eos> He's begun to attract a lot of attention.<eos> Comes a great deal of danger.<eos> Mmm, I am aware.<eos> Believe me.<eos> For now, keep doing as you are.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Danny.
I'll be in touch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Danny.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> The board will be here in a minute.<eos> Uh, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here.<eos> Put this on.<eos> Thanks.
That's all I could find in storage.<eos> It's been 15 years.<eos> There was probably more, but things get moved around, and then, eventually, they get lost.<eos> And forgotten.<eos> Do you think this is a good company?<eos> To work? Sure.<eos> I mean, I lost my dental benefits in the last contract negotiations, and that kind of sucked.<eos> I... I mean, with the plant.<eos> - You saw the video, right?<eos> - Yeah.
- Yeah.<eos> - What did you think?<eos> - It's not really my place to say.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> My mother lives on Staten Island.<eos> I think I wanna make a few phone calls.<eos> You said you had this under control, Joy.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> Hey.
I know you all want me to back out on this... but my dad once told me,<eos> "If something is worth fighting for, you stand and you fight."<eos> So, I'm standing.<eos> Danny, you may have a voice on this board, but it's just a courtesy.<eos> Don't expect anyone here to be listening to a kid who got his MBA from a Himalayan monastery.<eos> Lawrence, you don't have to attack him.<eos> - Danny's plan is...<eos> - The idiotic dream of a child.<eos> Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it.<eos> What?
What?<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted.<eos> Any of you.<eos> But if you look deep down at the better part of yourselves... you'll know we're doing the right thing.<eos> Look, I'm sorry to cut this short, but there's somewhere else I really need to be.<eos> Oh, uh, and the assistants need their dental plan back, so we should probably get on that, too.<eos> Shit.
- I can't just leave him.<eos> - Hey, do the smart thing, Danny.<eos> Strike Gao down while you have the element of surprise.<eos> Leave Radovan.<eos> Look out for your own.<eos> I started this program... to teach you not just how to defend yourselves, but how to prepare for your futures.<eos> Today is Darryl's last day.<eos> He's been selected for an elite training program that comes with a full scholarship to a university.<eos> - You gonna miss me?<eos> - Nah...
I don't care.<eos> Let's go get him.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> But we gotta go.<eos> Now.<eos> - Go where?<eos> - To get a bundle of arrows.<eos> Hello?
Let's go get him.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> But we gotta go.<eos> Now.<eos> - Go where?<eos> - To get a bundle of arrows.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr. Meachum.
Okay.<eos> But we gotta go.<eos> Now.<eos> - Go where?<eos> - To get a bundle of arrows.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr. Meachum.<eos> This is Veronica from Ambergris Caye.<eos> - There's a problem with your reservation.<eos> - What kind of problem?
I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.<eos> And they fear me.<eos> With you and your men by our side... they'll fear you, too.<eos> Lawrence.
I was just reading some of the press on the closure.<eos> It's good.<eos> Danny might actually be onto...<eos> What's going on?<eos> The board just held an emergency meeting.<eos> About what?<eos> About how you, your brother, and Danny will no longer be on the board... or any part of this company ever again.<eos> You've been ousted from Rand.<eos> Oh, no...<eos> Radovan.

Sabina's fine.<eos> She's home.<eos> She's safe.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> Where's Madame Gao?<eos> You must forgive me.<eos> I told her.<eos> I told her how to make the heroin.<eos> Where did she go?<eos> Radovan, please.
She's safe.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> Where's Madame Gao?<eos> You must forgive me.<eos> I told her.<eos> I told her how to make the heroin.<eos> Where did she go?<eos> Radovan, please.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Anzhou...

You're a shitty thief.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you let me think I was getting away with it?<eos> Oh, well, we all have our private vices.<eos> Yours just happened to be embezzling.<eos> And as long as your hobby didn't interfere with our work... who was I to judge?<eos> But honestly, Ward, couldn't you have just gotten a mistress?<eos> Much simpler.<eos> I am sick of it!<eos> The control, the manipulation...
You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?
Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> The hell is wrong with you?<eos> I thought you were one of them.<eos> - One of who?

I thought you were one of them.<eos> - One of who?<eos> - The Hand.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What are you even doing here?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> I think you should sit down.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake.<eos> Something terrible has happened to your father.<eos> What?
I don't give a shit what you do.<eos> Just stay the hell away from me and Joy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're a cancer, Danny.<eos> I'm going to China.<eos> This factory, it's in Anzhou.<eos> It's where we were headed when my plane crashed.<eos> My father, he... he never visited the foreign sites.<eos> He must've suspected something was going on.<eos> Heroin?
Maybe Gao found out he was onto her.<eos> You think she did something to the plane?<eos> All I know is that Gao punishes people who try to fight her.<eos> If I wanna find the truth, then I have to find her.<eos> What if she won't talk?<eos> She'll talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have you stopped to consider that this idea totally sucks?<eos> It doesn't suck, okay?<eos> Kinda harsh, Claire.

I can't keep running.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> For Louisa.<eos> For myself.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> I'm gonna track her down.<eos> I'm gonna take her by surprise.<eos> I'm gonna grab her.<eos> Grab her?<eos> And then what?
For Louisa.<eos> For myself.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> I'm gonna track her down.<eos> I'm gonna take her by surprise.<eos> I'm gonna grab her.<eos> Grab her?<eos> And then what?<eos> Do we take her to the Chinese authorities?<eos> Uh... Interpol?
That's gonna be one awkward-ass flight.<eos> Look, I don't know, okay?<eos> It's a long way to China.<eos> I'll figure it out before we get there.<eos> If you don't trust me, then don't come.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm not sure there is a graceful way to handle this.<eos> Can I get anyone anything before we get started?<eos> Coffee?
I think you'll find the severance to be more than generous.<eos> A hundred million each.<eos> That's exactly what we offered Danny.<eos> Ironic, isn't it?<eos> Enjoy this while you can.<eos> When I'm on the other side of this table, I guarantee you won't be smiling.<eos> You have no one to blame but each other.<eos> Bringing Danny into this company was a toxic decision.<eos> Thankfully, we didn't give him a job title, so we don't have to offer him severance.<eos> A silver lining.
For what I achieved.<eos> I earned my position.<eos> I'm not gonna just walk away.<eos> Not without a fight.<eos> Joy, this isn't a fight we can win.<eos> Well, that may not be true.<eos> If... if I can put together a solid strategy, will you at least consider it?<eos> Okay.<eos> But only if you give serious thought to accepting the settlement.<eos> Deal.

But only if you give serious thought to accepting the settlement.<eos> Deal.<eos> Blackalicious, BDP,<eos> Big Pun?<eos> Wow.<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?<eos> Colleen?
Big Pun?<eos> Wow.<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?<eos> Colleen?<eos> What about her?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Wow.
Nope.<eos> I've seen you reread that letter at least three times since we took off.<eos> The handwriting is distinctly not feminine.<eos> He'll be glad to hear that.<eos> "He" is?<eos> Presently unavailable.<eos> Danny, I want to ask you something.<eos> Sure.<eos> If you find out... that Gao indeed did kill your parents... um, you're not gonna do anything stupid, right?<eos> Like what?
Okay, I'm not special... but I've seen enough people die to understand the value of a life.<eos> What about all the lives that Gao destroys?<eos> Hey...<eos> Turbulence is scary, but it's not dangerous.<eos> In fact, it's...<eos> - totally normal, actually...<eos> - When flying over mountains?<eos> I know.<eos> My mom told me the same thing before she was ripped out of our plane.<eos> Shit.
Say everything that's going through your head.<eos> Just let it out.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just feel like you can't.<eos> You just need to focus on something else.<eos> Start talking.<eos> Okay.<eos> There was turbulence.<eos> Just like this.
There was turbulence.<eos> Just like this.<eos> We were... we were flying over mountains.<eos> It was... it was bad.<eos> There was lightning.<eos> Good.<eos> Keep going.<eos> The plane, it started to fall apart.<eos> Something hit me in the head.<eos> My mom, she...
Keep going.<eos> The plane, it started to fall apart.<eos> Something hit me in the head.<eos> My mom, she...<eos> she came to see if I was okay.<eos> Then the roof was gone.<eos> Then, my mom... she was gone.<eos> My dad, he told me he loved me, and then... then everything went white.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Mom!

I love you, Danny!<eos> How did you feel when you saw the monks?<eos> I felt safe.<eos> Good.<eos> Just focus on that feeling.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're as safe now as you were with them then.<eos> Just keep breathing.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Ward.
Your father would be ashamed if he could see the way his family was falling apart.<eos> All due respect, Lawrence, you don't know shit about my father.<eos> Do you want the money or not?<eos> There is no money.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> The offer doesn't expire for another two days.<eos> Oh, it didn't expire.<eos> It was rejected.<eos> The hell it was.<eos> By who?
I didn't know what had happened to her.<eos> It wasn't until years later that I realized she was sick.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but... I always felt kinda...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Part of me is sorry you understand that.<eos> And the rest?
Talk or bleed.<eos> - Um... - I have a better idea.<eos> Give me your wallet.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> It would be better if my bowl weren't empty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You speak English?<eos> I was not born a homeless beggar.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.
I need information... about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.<eos> I can pay.<eos> The only fool... bigger than one seeking information about that witch... is the fool willing to provide it.<eos> I'd rather be a fool than a coward.<eos> If you know how dangerous Gao is, this is your chance to do something about it.<eos> Do you really believe you can stop her?<eos> I believe someone has to try.<eos> Then ask me your questions.<eos> Heel, Toro, heel.<eos> Hey.
I'm not talking about a legal loophole.<eos> What else is there?<eos> Oh, you're not thinking of using Danny, are you?<eos> Exploiting his corporate crusader image?<eos> Exposing the board for wanting to oust us because we wanted to stop poisoning people?<eos> I'm sorry, but that is a profoundly stupid idea.<eos> You can't keep him in line.<eos> Every time he opens his mouth, he digs you deeper into the hole.<eos> What's this?<eos> The way back.
I don't know what to say.<eos> I can't believe you'd even consider doing something like this.<eos> I'm not the one who painted us into this corner.<eos> I'm just trying to find a way out.<eos> Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?<eos> Jesus, Joy.
Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.<eos> Something else, you mean?<eos> You're the person I most admire.<eos> Come on.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't know anyone as brilliant or as fearless.<eos> You come up with these crazy ideas.<eos> And you stand your ground, even when the entire board tries to fight you on it.<eos> And then you prove them wrong every single time.<eos> Joy...
Joy...<eos> I hired that PI because I thought it was something you would do.<eos> Maybe it was just stupid of me to think I could fight on your level.<eos> I'm not the person you think I am.<eos> Everything that you admire about me, that's not me.<eos> That's all lies. I...<eos> I'm done with lies.<eos> You deserve to know.<eos> Know what?<eos> Everything.
I'm not the person you think I am.<eos> Everything that you admire about me, that's not me.<eos> That's all lies. I...<eos> I'm done with lies.<eos> You deserve to know.<eos> Know what?<eos> Everything.<eos> She's keeping those people enslaved.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> The beggar.
The beggar.<eos> He said they leave for their evening meal around now, right?<eos> As soon as the building's empty, we'll sneak in and we'll burn it to the ground.<eos> Wait. Sorry.<eos> You really think it's a good idea to torch the one place we know Gao might show up?<eos> Well, what better way to smoke 'em out than with a fire?<eos> Okay, they're leaving.<eos> Maybe I should hang back and keep watch while y'all are inside.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> You ready?
Because you're not in control?<eos> Exactly.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> You do?<eos> When I'm in the fight club, I'm beating the shit out of people... I'm completely out of control.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> And this from someone who has always been in complete control.<eos> So what happened?<eos> I met you.<eos> What?

I met you.<eos> What?<eos> So it's my fault?<eos> Everything's your fault.<eos> "Hey, Claire.<eos> How was your trip to China?"<eos> We committed arson, and then... got killed by an evil ninja cult.<eos> It was great.<eos> What'd you do this weekend?"<eos> Shit!
You okay?<eos> I've almost been killed three times this week.<eos> So no, Colleen, I'd say I'm pretty friggin' far from okay.<eos> I mean, are you hurt?<eos> No.<eos> But you are.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went after Gao.<eos> - Alone?
But you are.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went after Gao.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> At least that's what he said.<eos> Hey... buddy.<eos> Asshole.
Your masters are murderers.<eos> Our paths diverge in a different place.<eos> But unlike you, I've remained true to my vow.<eos> I'm here to stop the greatest threat to my people.<eos> No you're not.<eos> You're here to punish, not protect!<eos> You're wearing your oath like a mask.<eos> Tell me, Iron Fist... where's the honor in that?<eos> Danny, stop!<eos> Jesus, Danny.
I can't...<eos> I can't be here.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Hey.<eos> Talk to me, Ward.<eos> Please.<eos> You're scaring the shit out of me.<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Is this where your drug dealer lives?<eos> Ward?
What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't know you needed money until literally two seconds ago.<eos> It's not just now.<eos> It's all that bullshit about looking up to me.<eos> It's not bullshit.<eos> You put me up on a pedestal.<eos> Now that I've fallen off, you look at me with all that goddamn pity.<eos> Ow. Stop.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Ward!
Now that I've fallen off, you look at me with all that goddamn pity.<eos> Ow. Stop.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Ward!<eos> Stop!<eos> I didn't ask to be the heir to your daddy issues, so grow up and stop begging for my approval.<eos> It is cliché. It's pathetic!<eos> You said you had this under control.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I just...
Stop it!<eos> Ward!<eos> Stop!<eos> I didn't ask to be the heir to your daddy issues, so grow up and stop begging for my approval.<eos> It is cliché. It's pathetic!<eos> You said you had this under control.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I just...<eos> - I lost.<eos> I...
Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know...<eos> I wish I'd never come to China with you.<eos> Seems fair.<eos> They poisoned their weapons.<eos> It was her.<eos> Gao used the same poison on the pilots.<eos> That's why my plane crashed.<eos> She killed my parents.<eos> Danny...
I don't like this at all, Danny.<eos> I don't understand why we had to bring her here.<eos> Never let the enemy choose the battlefield.<eos> Always work from a position of strength.<eos> Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.<eos> Let's just take her in.<eos> I'm not turning her over to the police until I find out what I want to know.<eos> The police?
Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.<eos> Let's just take her in.<eos> I'm not turning her over to the police until I find out what I want to know.<eos> The police?<eos> Do you truly believe that's where I will end up?<eos> Tell me about my father and the Hand.<eos> Why are you asking about events that happened 15 years ago when you have more pressing concerns?<eos> Tell me what I want to know.<eos> Or what?

You know she was responsible for your parents' death.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.<eos> Let's just be done with this.<eos> So now you're ganging up on me?<eos> We're not.<eos> We're with you.<eos> We just... we just don't want you doing something that can't be undone.<eos> Rand has a lab, right?<eos> Yeah. So?
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm just tired.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's better than torture.<eos> Hey!<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.<eos> These kids are playing here.<eos> Is that your son?<eos> Yeah, so?
Is that your son?<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> I have a son.<eos> Okay, and?<eos> Ward, listen, I don't know what's going on.<eos> I don't know if it's drugs or whatever, but...<eos> I looked into the building you took me to, and Dad bought it the week before he died.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about this?<eos> Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.

You've been stripped of everything but your shares.<eos> We can't even enter the building anymore.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Maybe you should ask yourself that.<eos> Everything fell apart once you showed up.<eos> This is my fault?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mostly.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I...
If you were going to be special, it would have already happened.<eos> The only thing that can come out of this for you is sorrow, heartbreak, and pain.<eos> Sometimes the strongest thing you can do is leave.<eos> Danny would understand that.<eos> I'm not abandoning Danny.<eos> Not even to save your mother?<eos> How do you know my men aren't at her door right now?<eos> If anything happens to my mother,<eos> - I swear to God...<eos> - Claire?
I'm not abandoning Danny.<eos> Not even to save your mother?<eos> How do you know my men aren't at her door right now?<eos> If anything happens to my mother,<eos> - I swear to God...<eos> - Claire?<eos> Why don't you take a break?<eos> Hello, Ms. Wing.<eos> You don't look well.<eos> Mr. Rand?
- Claire?<eos> Why don't you take a break?<eos> Hello, Ms. Wing.<eos> You don't look well.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Hey. How are you?<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> You're not allowed here anymore.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I just, um...
I need your help.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I really like my job, Mr. Rand.<eos> I need this job.<eos> I'm sorry to put you in this position, but it's really important.<eos> There's no one else I can turn to.<eos> If you get caught, you never saw me.<eos> Of course.<eos> What's... what's this for?<eos> - I...
What's... what's this for?<eos> - I...<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> It's exhausting, isn't it?<eos> You know, I'm not above shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth to shut you up.<eos> I know the burden you carry.<eos> A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.
I know the burden you carry.<eos> A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.<eos> You didn't know my grandfather.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> You mess with people's heads.<eos> "The frog trapped in a well... does not understand the sea."<eos> So what?
They are coming, Ms. Wing.<eos> You know what they'll do when they arrive.<eos> Get out now, before it is too late.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Do you know what he will do when he finds out the truth?<eos> Danny Rand belongs to someone else.<eos> He will never be yours.<eos> Your path leads in a different direction.<eos> Honor the warrior your grandfather created.<eos> Claire!
Stop talking.<eos> Do you know what he will do when he finds out the truth?<eos> Danny Rand belongs to someone else.<eos> He will never be yours.<eos> Your path leads in a different direction.<eos> Honor the warrior your grandfather created.<eos> Claire!<eos> You're sick.<eos> Come on.<eos> Rand.

Especially after Ward and Joy lost the company.<eos> You never went this long without contacting me before.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - You talk a lot.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> No, everything is not okay.<eos> How could they lose the company?<eos> Well, it was the board.<eos> Voted them all out.<eos> - Joy, Danny...

You got any bourbon?<eos> In the... in the compartment to your right.<eos> Is everything all right, sir?<eos> You... you seem different.<eos> What would you do if you found out you could live forever?<eos> Oh, anything I want, I guess.<eos> No, be specific.<eos> What would you do?<eos> - I'd eat ice cream for breakfast.<eos> - Really?
- Really?<eos> Well, and lunch. Yes, sir.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> That wasn't a compliment.<eos> Orders around the front.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> If you don't get out of here, I will bust your head wide open.<eos> Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.

I never meant it.<eos> Please, please, please, please, forgive me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> You're my son, and I love you.<eos> I died, and I came back again.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Colleen?
I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> You're my son, and I love you.<eos> I died, and I came back again.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Colleen?<eos> It's all right.<eos> The flu... maybe.
She introduced me to him.<eos> I set it up for months.<eos> She was easy to manipulate.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Claire, it's not working.<eos> But Wendell won't have anything to do with us.<eos> He wasn't willing to make a deal.<eos> But Harold, now, is a different story.<eos> He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?

What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> Well...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Hey!<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.<eos> She might not have the answers you're looking for.<eos> Danny.

Danny.<eos> My arm.<eos> The cut.<eos> - It's the same poison from China.<eos> - Can you help her?<eos> Not unless I know what this poison is.<eos> We just put Gao to sleep.<eos> Did you really think your drugs would affect me?<eos> I spent most of the 17th century being interrogated.<eos> Bullshit.
- Can you help her?<eos> Not unless I know what this poison is.<eos> We just put Gao to sleep.<eos> Did you really think your drugs would affect me?<eos> I spent most of the 17th century being interrogated.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What poison did your men use?<eos> It's too late.<eos> Her time has come.<eos> - Danny.
Bullshit.<eos> What poison did your men use?<eos> It's too late.<eos> Her time has come.<eos> - Danny.<eos> - Hey, I'm right here.<eos> I need you to call someone, okay?<eos> Grab my phone.<eos> It's under "sensei."<eos> What?
I need you to call someone, okay?<eos> Grab my phone.<eos> It's under "sensei."<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He can help.<eos> Okay.<eos> Each second you waste, she draws closer to her death.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Voice mail.
Well, if that's what it takes, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I just want what's best for you and your, uh, sister.<eos> You know, I hope she'll be more forgiving.<eos> You can't bring Joy into this.<eos> I don't have any other option.<eos> She's my only daughter.<eos> Dad... if you do that, the Hand will kill her.<eos> I've been working on something that's going to put an end to all that.<eos> What?
Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Say it.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> - We're gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're such children.<eos> Ignore her.<eos> We're gonna get through this.<eos> Right, Claire?
- I don't know.<eos> - Say it.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> - We're gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're such children.<eos> Ignore her.<eos> We're gonna get through this.<eos> Right, Claire?<eos> Yep.
We're gonna get through this.<eos> Right, Claire?<eos> Yep.<eos> Time is up, Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Your eyes will get adjusted to the dark.<eos> What was that?<eos> Camera.
Yep.<eos> Time is up, Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Your eyes will get adjusted to the dark.<eos> What was that?<eos> Camera.<eos> They're getting the lay of the land.<eos> Shit!

It seemed like such a miraculous gift.<eos> But it wasn't.<eos> Each time he came back...<eos> He was worse.<eos> One night, without warning, he took two of his own children... and roasted them on a fire.<eos> When his wife discovered it, she fled with her only remaining child in her arms.<eos> They destroy the ones closest to them first.<eos> The only solution is to run.<eos> You're finished for the day?<eos> Yes, sir.
Wow!<eos> I didn't know which was your favorite, so...<eos> - Mr. Meachum, you didn't...<eos> - Oh, please... call me Harold.<eos> Now, I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> In all the time I've worked for you, I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.<eos> Well, I'm a new man, Kyle.<eos> I'm a new man in every way.<eos> Hmm, yeah.

Well, I don't like all these fancy flavors.<eos> Vanilla's fine for me.<eos> I go to all the trouble of, uh, getting you all this ice cream, and all you can do is complain.<eos> Oh! No, no, no! I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to complain.<eos> Uh, this is great, really.<eos> I can just eat this.<eos> You're not gonna eat anything, you ungrateful little shit!<eos> Sir.
Yeah, I'll give you sorry.<eos> Hey, what's that?<eos> It's just... it's just ice cream.<eos> Oh, shut up and die.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've been where you're going.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> It's just... nothingness.<eos> Kyle?
Hey, what's that?<eos> It's just... it's just ice cream.<eos> Oh, shut up and die.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've been where you're going.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> It's just... nothingness.<eos> Kyle?<eos> Kyle?

Kyle?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Oh, what did I do?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Ward Meachum?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Step over here, please.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Step over here, please.<eos> This your car?
Jesus!<eos> Oh, what did I do?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Ward Meachum?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Step over here, please.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Step over here, please.<eos> This your car?<eos> I...
I...<eos> This is...<eos> - I want a lawyer.<eos> - Already?<eos> This isn't mine.<eos> This is a set up.<eos> Someone set me up!<eos> You cannot search my car without cause.<eos> It was on the seat.<eos> Cause.
Oh, my God.<eos> Really?<eos> - Are we really gonna do this?<eos> - What is that?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> You sit there, take notes about how screwed up I am, prescribe some meds, send me back to some kind of cell.<eos> I know how the whole 72-hour-hold business works.<eos> Is that why you think you're here?<eos> I'm here because my dad had drugs planted in my car.<eos> Your dad?
He's been dead for 13 years.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.<eos> That's how he works.<eos> Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> You just let me out of here.<eos> I will take you to him.<eos> End of story.<eos> But you see, Ward, that's a risky proposition for a dual diagnosis patient.<eos> Dual diagnosis?
End of story.<eos> But you see, Ward, that's a risky proposition for a dual diagnosis patient.<eos> Dual diagnosis?<eos> You're an addict and you have psychological disorders,<eos> - so we have to proceed very...<eos> - I'm not an addict.<eos> The heroin that the cops found in your car tells a different story.<eos> As does your father's very public death from cancer.<eos> So, where would you like to begin?<eos> Daddy?

So, where would you like to begin?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Hello, Joy.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> You were in a casket.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry you saw me like that.<eos> You've grown up so much.<eos> What...
Daddy?<eos> Hello, Joy.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> You were in a casket.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry you saw me like that.<eos> You've grown up so much.<eos> What...<eos> Joy.

Dad?<eos> My Joy.<eos> My Joy.<eos> She is a fighter.<eos> But once the poison reaches her brain...<eos> There has to be something else we can do.<eos> This is beyond me, Danny.<eos> If she dies, you die.<eos> Colleen, it's me.<eos> - Sensei?
My Joy.<eos> She is a fighter.<eos> But once the poison reaches her brain...<eos> There has to be something else we can do.<eos> This is beyond me, Danny.<eos> If she dies, you die.<eos> Colleen, it's me.<eos> - Sensei?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Colleen?
I've taken care of Madame Gao's mercenaries.<eos> How do we know this isn't another trap?<eos> Look out your window.<eos> Now... please, open the door.<eos> You have no business here.<eos> Leave!<eos> You should have called me sooner.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Bakuto.<eos> Sensei.
Now... open your fist.<eos> Now... place your hand over the poison.<eos> Focus on it.<eos> Do you sense the poison?<eos> Yes.<eos> And do you sense her life force?<eos> They should feel different.<eos> Yes.<eos> Use your chi to burn the poison away.<eos> Danny!
Do you sense the poison?<eos> Yes.<eos> And do you sense her life force?<eos> They should feel different.<eos> Yes.<eos> Use your chi to burn the poison away.<eos> Danny!<eos> Sweet Christmas, it worked!<eos> You're safe.<eos> Danny!
Yes.<eos> Use your chi to burn the poison away.<eos> Danny!<eos> Sweet Christmas, it worked!<eos> You're safe.<eos> Danny!<eos> You okay, there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Danny!
Danny!<eos> "The frog in the well never understands the sea."<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> Colleen, what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> No.<eos> Where we're going, you're not allowed.<eos> Claire.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> What?
Saved my life.<eos> It's a lot... having to keep a secret like this.<eos> And I... I understand now why Ward's... why he is the way he is.<eos> Yeah, I think we might be losing him, Joy.<eos> You put him in a terrible position, Dad.<eos> Lying to everyone.<eos> Standing right next to me while I cried over you, knowing he could do something about it, he could make it better.<eos> No, he couldn't make it better.<eos> No one could.<eos> Hey, Joy.
And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed. Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> Mmm-hmm. You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile.<eos> You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.<eos> So peaceful.
You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.<eos> So peaceful.<eos> And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy...
Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy...<eos> Joy, I... I love you.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for, you know, I'm sorry for all of... all of this.<eos> I'm just glad the universe listened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was it like?<eos> What?
I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy...<eos> Joy, I... I love you.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for, you know, I'm sorry for all of... all of this.<eos> I'm just glad the universe listened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was it like?<eos> What?<eos> Death?
It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time...<eos> This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.<eos> I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...<eos> I... I wanted to be on the other side so much.<eos> But the harder I tried... the further I'd just... I'd drift away and... it would become colder... and colder.<eos> And, uh, and I was here.<eos> Restored.<eos> Joy...
Happy and whole.<eos> I want that, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But this is strange.<eos> This is...<eos> - Hey, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> - This is really unreal.<eos> I...
Yeah.<eos> But this is strange.<eos> This is...<eos> - Hey, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> - This is really unreal.<eos> I...<eos> I know.<eos> Ward...
- I'm worried about him.<eos> - Ward has a problem, Joy.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I know.<eos> I know he has a problem.<eos> I've talked to him about it, and it hasn't helped.<eos> Oh, well, you know, addicts can be...<eos> they can be unpredictable.<eos> But we've gotta do everything we can to help him.<eos> Everything.
Ward told me about the... the blackmail.<eos> - I... I want you to step away from that.<eos> - Why?<eos> You just...<eos> leave that for, you know, that... that Hogarth and the courts to work out.<eos> I don't want you risking anything.<eos> Where's the risk?<eos> People will ask you questions, and you're... you're gonna wanna answer honestly and truthfully.<eos> Yeah, under oath.<eos> Mmm-hmm.
- Hey.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.<eos> What is this?<eos> A monastery?

This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.<eos> What is this?<eos> A monastery?<eos> A school?<eos> Uh, a bit of both.<eos> A safe place for people who need a home.<eos> They took me in, helped me get settled.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> Bakuto and his group.<eos> Your sensei?

I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.<eos> Let it replace everything that is broken.<eos> Now... how do you feel?<eos> Hungry.
There's a difference between "secret" and "secure."<eos> You see, we take in people from all walks of life who need safety.<eos> They need that because their lives were complicated... even dangerous, sometimes.<eos> Because of that, we try and keep a low profile.<eos> We give them a safe haven...<eos> and much more.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, each person needs a purpose, something to believe in, a place to belong, a community that can help you become all that you can be.<eos> So it's a cult?<eos> Yes, just, uh, just like the Girl Scouts.

And Gao?<eos> What have you done with her?<eos> She's been taken out of commission.<eos> There's no need to worry.<eos> She murdered my parents... almost had us killed.<eos> I need to know where she's gone.<eos> I've placed her in confinement until we can be sure that turning her over to the police will get us the right results.<eos> Her power is far-reaching.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> Good pace, guys.

Not everything.<eos> Please, my office is this way.<eos> Sensei.<eos> I understand when you say you're training people.<eos> Can I get you to sign this?<eos> But for what, exactly?<eos> You wanna know what's in it for me?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Ever since I got to New York, whenever people find out I'm the Iron Fist, they... they want to use it for their own purposes.<eos> Yeah.
Well, yeah.<eos> Ever since I got to New York, whenever people find out I'm the Iron Fist, they... they want to use it for their own purposes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're not using people.<eos> They make their own choices.<eos> Participate only in things they feel comfortable with.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> A change is coming, Danny.<eos> Something significant.

Inside?<eos> You know you don't fit in at Rand.<eos> I've read the news.<eos> You can use help there as well.<eos> I can provide that.<eos> But your destiny... is here.<eos> Doing something only you can do.<eos> - He's not picking up.<eos> - Oh, let it ring.<eos> Hey, Joy.

Danny.<eos> Harold?<eos> You're alive.<eos> Oh, why wouldn't I be?<eos> Uh, I came to the penthouse.<eos> There was... there was blood everywhere.<eos> I thought Gao...<eos> - Oh, not a chance.<eos> Hey, listen...<eos> - And Joy?
Yes.<eos> Yes, it's all right.<eos> I told her everything.<eos> Hey, we're, uh, working on a plan to get Rand back, and, uh, you're a big part of that.<eos> Look, I'll get there as soon as I can.<eos> Hey, no excuses.<eos> This is important, Danny.<eos> I haven't been very reliable, I know.<eos> But you'll be glad to hear that Gao is finally out of the way.<eos> - What?
I can't confirm that.<eos> I'm trying to find out if she's been sent to jail or something else.<eos> But I've been assured by Bakuto that she's out of commission.<eos> Oh, and who exactly is this, uh, Bakuto?<eos> He's a friend.<eos> I think.<eos> Hey, Danny, just be careful, all right?<eos> And, uh, get here as soon as you can.<eos> - Oh, he did it.<eos> - What?
- What?<eos> Yeah, he did it.<eos> - He did what?<eos> - He did it.<eos> He did it.<eos> Oh, man, he has... he's eliminated Gao.<eos> - He has eliminated...<eos> - Who's Gao?<eos> - Oh, we have to celebrate.<eos> - What...
He did it.<eos> Oh, man, he has... he's eliminated Gao.<eos> - He has eliminated...<eos> - Who's Gao?<eos> - Oh, we have to celebrate.<eos> - What...<eos> We have to celebrate.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Wait, explain this to me, who... who's Gao?<eos> Balvenie, 40-year-old.
Open it.<eos> - and I'm... I can't.<eos> - One for you.<eos> One for me.<eos> Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.<eos> - No, I don't want it.<eos> Dad, stop!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Dad.
- Yeah.<eos> - Dad.<eos> I didn't...<eos> I didn't...<eos> I'm... I'm so sorry, Joy.<eos> Um... I'll clean this up.<eos> Come in.<eos> He's just finished a call, sir.<eos> To whom?<eos> Joy Meachum.
I'm... I'm so sorry, Joy.<eos> Um... I'll clean this up.<eos> Come in.<eos> He's just finished a call, sir.<eos> To whom?<eos> Joy Meachum.<eos> And she passed the phone off to a Harold.<eos> Harold Meachum?<eos> Are you sure about that name?<eos> Yes, sir.
But we need to be honest.<eos> I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated... I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.<eos> Danny!

Can you come and go as you please?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We have free time.<eos> We all live in the dorms here.<eos> But there's a curfew.<eos> You ever try and sneak out?<eos> - Security's too tight.<eos> - And nobody really wants to.<eos> Are there any areas off-limits?<eos> Yeah, a few.
Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.<eos> That's not true!<eos> They are stealing your ability to trust.<eos> That is how they crush you.<eos> Who?

I see you found what you were looking for.<eos> She's a piece of work, isn't she?<eos> Always spinning a new web.<eos> I was just looking for some answers.<eos> You won't find them here.<eos> Trust me, I've tried.<eos> But I'm glad you came... because now you know she won't work with us... but she won't work against us, either.<eos> I deliver him back into your capable hands.<eos> Enjoy your evening.<eos> Hey.
What's wrong?<eos> Gao's here.<eos> Did you talk to her?<eos> Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.<eos> In what way?<eos> She implied that this was the Hand.<eos> Bakuto.

Colleen?<eos> I wanted to tell you from the beginning.<eos> No.<eos> - Please, just listen.<eos> - No.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Give me a chance to explain...<eos> Explain what?<eos> The Hand are murderers and killers!<eos> Gao!
That's not true.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Did Bakuto give you that money the first time we met in the park?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Was it okay with him when I stayed around at the dojo?<eos> - This isn't some conspiracy, Danny.<eos> - Then explain it to me.<eos> Make it make sense.<eos> Because right now, all I'm hearing are lies<eos> - and evasion...
- Then explain it to me.<eos> Make it make sense.<eos> Because right now, all I'm hearing are lies<eos> - and evasion...<eos> - I already met you!<eos> I already felt the way I feel.<eos> And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?<eos> Danny...
A way out.<eos> A return to public life for you.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Look, Singleton, we have to be extra cautious at this time.<eos> This is disappointing.<eos> I was hoping you wouldn't take the bait and dig further.<eos> Even sneaking down to kill Gao would have been better than this.<eos> More lies.<eos> Simply a test.

Can you make sure we aren't disturbed?<eos> You might wanna check the file I left on your desk.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.<eos> Prostitution, embezzling money from the Rand pension fund into your Cayman accounts...<eos> Listen, I don't know what this is all about<eos> - or how this is even possible, but...<eos> - This is about legacy.<eos> Mine... and yours.<eos> What?
You know, you don't think I had them turned off for routine maintenance?<eos> Come on, Lawrence.<eos> Now...<eos> Now, I think we can, uh... we can both agree that our children and their lives are the most important thing, right?<eos> - I guess.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Have you thought at all about what your, uh, fall from grace might do to them?<eos> How they might be bullied, pursued by the media, shamed on all fronts?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And Michael.
Oh, well, that's just sad.<eos> Because a father's first responsibility to their kids is to provide a beautiful lie for them to live in.<eos> How much longer until the, uh, system reboots?<eos> Two minutes, thirty.<eos> Well, make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.<eos> I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.<eos> Who the hell are these people?<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> What?
It's the Hand.<eos> What?<eos> Then we'll kill as many as we can on our way out.<eos> Backup, two-man teams!<eos> Move it!<eos> - Over here!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Sensei, what's going on?<eos> - It's Danny.<eos> - What?
Come on!<eos> Let's go! Move!<eos> Okay, we make it to the gate, you summon the Fist,<eos> - knock it down.<eos> We're out.<eos> - Right.<eos> We're gonna be seen, though.<eos> I can hold them off for a bit, but we have to go quickly.<eos> Stealing apples from Master Q'uon was harder.<eos> Ready?
Stealing apples from Master Q'uon was harder.<eos> Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> - Darryl.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Get outta the way.<eos> This isn't your fight!<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The gate!
- Get outta the way.<eos> This isn't your fight!<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The gate!<eos> - Move!<eos> No, no, no, forget him!<eos> Forget him.<eos> - To the gate.<eos> - Darryl.<eos> The Fist!
- Move!<eos> No, no, no, forget him!<eos> Forget him.<eos> - To the gate.<eos> - Darryl.<eos> The Fist!<eos> You have to use the Fist.<eos> Knock down the gate.<eos> - Hold it!<eos> - Danny, now!
Knock down the gate.<eos> - Hold it!<eos> - Danny, now!<eos> We're out of time.<eos> Block that area.<eos> Your anger, your hatred, your confusion... it's destroyed your chi.<eos> The Fist won't work.<eos> You cannot access it.<eos> This wasn't the plan.<eos> - Eric.

As soon as the news hits the airwaves, our stock, which is already falling, will plummet even further.<eos> Unless... you see fit to reinstate the visionaries that led Rand to historic profits.<eos> Right the ship.<eos> Show Wall Street and the world that stability is being restored.<eos> Now, there will be whispers about the why of Wilkins' death, but Rand should quiet those fears with a show of strength.<eos> The Meachums will set things right.<eos> Now the truth is... you need us.<eos> I move that we... reinstate the Meachums... and Mr. Rand.<eos> I second the motion.<eos> All those in favor...
It gave me this sense of comfort.<eos> I thought it was just... my imagination, uh, the wishful thinking of... of a daughter who missed her dad.<eos> Now I know it was something else.<eos> You were there... watching... manipulating, conspiring.<eos> No, Joy, it's not like that.<eos> But it is.<eos> And you know it.<eos> You remember the promise you made?<eos> No more lies.<eos> Complete honesty.
I did not have Lawrence killed.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad to hear it.<eos> But I'm afraid to say there is someone we are gonna have to destroy.<eos> His name is Bakuto.<eos> We have to stop.<eos> They're not following.<eos> We won't be able to get you through the airport like this.<eos> - We need to get you stitched up.<eos> - Airport?
I saw some equipment in Bakuto's office.<eos> I think he can track cell phones.<eos> I left mine back at the compound.<eos> Another reason to leave this city as quickly as possible.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Danny, the path will not remain open forever.<eos> If we miss it, it will be years before we can return.<eos> They killed my parents, Davos!<eos> - What?

- You were gone, Danny.<eos> There one moment, then nothing.<eos> You failed us.<eos> And for what?<eos> For what?<eos> What do you have to show for abandoning us?<eos> I have the truth about what happened to my parents.<eos> And you want to take them all on?<eos> Without the Fist?<eos> Please, Davos.
Without the Fist?<eos> Please, Davos.<eos> I need your help.<eos> And once we do this, we go back?<eos> Once the Hand is done... there'll be nothing left for me here.<eos> Now, I need to get this wound taken care of.<eos> I know someone who can help.<eos> Someone I trust.<eos> That woman who helped you escape the compound, who is she?<eos> No one important.

They had nowhere to go.<eos> No one to care for them.<eos> This corrupt society was willing to let them rot on the streets.<eos> They were lost, just like you once were.<eos> But you found them.<eos> Trained them.<eos> You brought them into the Hand.<eos> Now Kevin's interning in the mayor's office and Becca's in medical school.<eos> We gave them a purpose.<eos> A family.
I can save Danny, too.<eos> He doesn't understand the good we're doing.<eos> - I can make him see.<eos> - The time for understanding is over.<eos> He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.<eos> The Iron Fist must be controlled.<eos> The Hand needs him.<eos> When you find him, you will tell me where he is.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey.
He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.<eos> The Iron Fist must be controlled.<eos> The Hand needs him.<eos> When you find him, you will tell me where he is.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Danny.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Davos.
When you find him, you will tell me where he is.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Danny.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Davos.<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> - Are you the healer?<eos> I... What?
Come on.<eos> There's something in there.<eos> - Try not to move.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Got it.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Can you stitch me up?<eos> - You're losing too much blood.<eos> - What about healing yourself?<eos> - What?
I, um... I can't.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Okay, uh... hand.<eos> Hold tightly here.<eos> You might not like this.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure you're gonna bleed to death if I don't do this.<eos> Shit!
Not right now.<eos> Okay, uh... hand.<eos> Hold tightly here.<eos> You might not like this.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure you're gonna bleed to death if I don't do this.<eos> Shit!<eos> Just a few more.
- Davos.<eos> - You mentioned that.<eos> - He's from K'un-Lun.<eos> The monastery?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Hey, can we go over this a little later, please?<eos> Come on!<eos> That was two!<eos> You seem to be a very gifted healer.<eos> - Thanks.
Seriously?<eos> Hey, can we go over this a little later, please?<eos> Come on!<eos> That was two!<eos> You seem to be a very gifted healer.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - It was Bakuto.<eos> The guy who saved us in the dojo.<eos> He's the one who stabbed me.<eos> What about Colleen?

Yeah, by sending them straight to the Hand.<eos> She was trying to do the same thing to me.<eos> There's got to be more going on here.<eos> You said it was like a cult compound?<eos> I mean, maybe she's been brainwashed.<eos> She lied.<eos> She's been lying to me from the beginning.<eos> Everything she said.<eos> - Just... just using me!<eos> - Danny...

It's clean.<eos> Or cleaner.<eos> A friend of mine left it here.<eos> Is your friend okay?<eos> Probably doing better than you are.<eos> Anything else you need?<eos> I just need to restore my chi.<eos> Well, you're on your own with that.<eos> Hey, you look like you need a...<eos> A refill.

Well, it started moving to a collection of offshore holdings based in South America.<eos> That's Bakuto.<eos> Bakuto, that's what he wants.<eos> He's stealing every cent in Gao's piggy bank.<eos> No.<eos> These are Rand accounts.<eos> - It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> This is the silver bullet I've been looking for, Joy!<eos> - Joy. - Mmm.

Well, as long as you're watching, are you hungry?<eos> I ordered pizza.<eos> What passes for food in this world is poison for both the body and soul.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess you guys don't order a lot of delivery in K'un-Lun.<eos> - How much has Danny told you of K'un-Lun?<eos> - Not much.<eos> Just, uh, that it's a remote monastery up in the Himalayas, full of karate hunks.<eos> Kung fu, not karate.<eos> These books.
These books.<eos> Why are you studying Reiki?<eos> I'm trying to understand how it is that Danny does what he does.<eos> Healing through chi.<eos> Reiki is thought of as a pseudoscience, but there are stories of it healing tumors and curing disease.<eos> So, maybe it's more real than I thought.<eos> You know, chi is the breath of life.<eos> It's what powers the Iron Fist.<eos> Where does that come from?<eos> The Fist?

Wow.
Dragons aren't real.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Okay, you mean, like... a small thing, like a komodo dragon?<eos> Or like Pete's Dragon?<eos> I don't... I don't know who Pete is.<eos> But think infinite.<eos> So do you have to kill it?<eos> Shou-Lao is undying.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> The Iron Fist?
So do you have to kill it?<eos> Shou-Lao is undying.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> The Iron Fist?<eos> No.<eos> There's only one.<eos> I trained for it, same as Danny.<eos> But ultimately, Lei Kung and the elder monks decided it was Danny who should enter the cave.<eos> He was the first... outsider to be chosen.<eos> Why him?
- Claire, please.<eos> They killed friends of mine and you knew that.<eos> And that is why I couldn't tell you.<eos> Either of you.<eos> You let me think that I was actually doing something to stop them.<eos> We were.<eos> There are different groups within the Hand, okay?<eos> I'm part of one that is trying to help people.<eos> Then did you think about trying a different name for the group?<eos> Like the Ear?

What did you think was gonna happen?<eos> Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> I told him that I thought you were a good person, no matter what.<eos> So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?<eos> See anything?<eos> Rocks.

Look, I don't know why you left K'un-Lun... but whatever it is that you're looking for, you're not going to find it back there.<eos> You had a traumatic experience as a kid.<eos> And I think that all that rage and anger that you've been burying since you were ten years old is still there.<eos> And if you are not careful... if you do not figure out a way to deal with it... then destroying is going to be all that you are good for.<eos> Thank you, Claire... for everything.<eos> Look, I... I just need one last thing.<eos> Name it.<eos> Can I borrow your car?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks.

I could get in trouble.<eos> Am I your sensei or not?<eos> No, of course.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> The Hand always comes first.<eos> Mmm... It's good to have you back, Danny.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.<eos> By lying to me?<eos> Oh, Joy.
He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.<eos> By lying to me?<eos> Oh, Joy.<eos> He was just respecting my wishes.<eos> He was trying to keep you safe.<eos> - Well, look what that got us.<eos> - Oh, that was in the past.<eos> Now we're ready to take the fight to the Hand.<eos> As a family.
We cut off the head and the snake will die.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> - It's right here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I did my job.<eos> That's how the Hand functions.<eos> Everyone does their job.<eos> Your job was to tell Bakuto if you found Danny.<eos> Brian, Mary.
That's how the Hand functions.<eos> Everyone does their job.<eos> Your job was to tell Bakuto if you found Danny.<eos> Brian, Mary.<eos> You guys been keeping up with your training?<eos> - You need to come with us.<eos> - Bakuto wants to talk to you.<eos> Tell him to meet me at my dojo.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Sensei.
Guess we better not keep him waiting.<eos> No one inside you don't know, understood?<eos> - You vouch for him?<eos> - That's Gary.<eos> He helped us with the Miami thing.<eos> Oh, well... let's hope tonight's a little less messy than that.<eos> How long has Singleton known?<eos> Well, I had to keep a few cards close to my chest.<eos> No, they're just here as a precaution.<eos> And the other guy?
Whatever it takes, Joy.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> So... are we ready to turn off the Hand's accounts?<eos> Dad, I just got you back.<eos> I mean, if we do this... the Hand's not gonna take it lightly.<eos> Hey...<eos> I've wasted too much time imprisoned by these monsters.<eos> I don't want to lose another day.<eos> - But what you're asking Danny to do...<eos> - Enough!
- But what you're asking Danny to do...<eos> - Enough!<eos> I thought you were stronger than this, eh?<eos> Did I back the right child in this war or not?<eos> It's Danny.<eos> He's at the compound.<eos> Come on.<eos> Shut down the accounts.<eos> Now.<eos> Atta girl.
- Bakuto, what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You've let Danny infect you with doubt about our cause.<eos> And there's no cure for that.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Bakuto?
But I don't know... if I believe in you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You've let Danny infect you with doubt about our cause.<eos> And there's no cure for that.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Bakuto?<eos> After all that we've been through, at least we can take some comfort knowing that in your final moments... you'll still be giving to the Hand.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you mean, "giving to the Hand"?<eos> Bakuto!
Wait.<eos> What do you mean, "giving to the Hand"?<eos> Bakuto!<eos> After everything you have taught us... how could you betray the Hand?<eos> Nothing?<eos> You're not gonna give me one of your little sanctimonious speeches about the code, teamwork and all that?<eos> What was it you used to say, sensei?<eos> A single arrow is easily broken.<eos> Because right now, you look pretty broken to me.<eos> Shit!
She broke my damn nose.<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> I didn't let you drive because it's not my car.<eos> And besides, you don't even have a license.<eos> - Do you have a license?<eos> - No, but it's different.<eos> I'm rich.<eos> Well, last time I drove with you, you wrecked Brother Kuo's cart, remember?<eos> You wanted to take the unpaved road around the lake because you thought you'd see the girls from the village bathing.<eos> Yeah.
And all we saw was your dad doing his private meditations.<eos> - In the nude.<eos> - Yeah, I know, okay?<eos> I remember.<eos> Do you ever think that maybe the Thunderer was wrong?<eos> About certain things?<eos> Everyone meditates in their own private way.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Sometimes I get these... these flashes.<eos> Anger.
Wait, we have to wait for Bakuto.<eos> Hey!<eos> Whoa! Colleen, wait!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> - I'm not here to hurt you.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You're the destroyer of the Hand!<eos> I'm the Hand!<eos> So light up your damn fist and destroy me!<eos> Colleen, please.
A little help here?<eos> No. No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> - I'm so hungry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> No, no.<eos> - First you, then Joy.<eos> - No, not Joy!
No. No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> - I'm so hungry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> No, no.<eos> - First you, then Joy.<eos> - No, not Joy!<eos> Not Joy!

Not Joy!<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Huh? Huh? Huh?<eos> I...<eos> I don't like being strapped down.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Nurse Hill.<eos> What's your first name?<eos> - Stacy.

I...<eos> I don't like being strapped down.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Nurse Hill.<eos> What's your first name?<eos> - Stacy.<eos> - Stacy.<eos> That's a nice name.<eos> You... you know who I am, how much I'm worth, right?<eos> - Of course, Mr. Meachum.
Frankly, it's the worst I've seen in a long time.<eos> But as the Bible says...<eos> - "This too shall pass."<eos> - Please.<eos> Stacy, get me outta here.<eos> I will pay you whatever you want.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Get me out!<eos> Get me out!<eos> - Hello, Ward.
I'm here to help.<eos> There you go.<eos> You've been poisoned by Madame Gao's synthetic heroin.<eos> - You know her?<eos> Who are you?<eos> - My name is Bakuto.<eos> Think of this drug as a shortcut past your withdrawal symptoms.<eos> - Are you with the hospital?<eos> - No, no... I'm with the Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.
I can make sure he never comes back.<eos> From the dead, I mean.<eos> It's a gift that we've given to a very chosen few.<eos> We can see that we made a mistake in giving it to Harold.<eos> You know this, too.<eos> This has a cost, right?<eos> We are living in a new age where governments aren't the true controllers of man's destinies.<eos> It's corporations like Rand Enterprises that govern the world.<eos> - So you wanna run Rand like Gao. - No.<eos> No, not like Gao.
There are countless poor souls that are addicted to Gao's drugs, going through your same withdrawal.<eos> And you're saying you would share this with Rand?<eos> All of this and freedom from your father forever.<eos> It sounds good, no?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.<eos> - And that is?<eos> - Help me capture the Iron Fist, and you and your sister will be safe.<eos> Bakuto...
- It's what they do.<eos> - That's not why she's here.<eos> She's running from them.<eos> - She's on our side.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Then she can help us blow up the whole compound with Bakuto and his minions inside.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Hey, students from my dojo are in there.<eos> They're not bad.<eos> They just...
They don't know what's really going on.<eos> So those were your students I broke to pieces, who tried to stop us from escaping?<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> You see?<eos> She's still with them!<eos> - This asshole was your best friend?<eos> - Look, just calm down!<eos> The both of you!
It's no wonder you can't summon the Iron Fist.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know, last week, if you would have told me that I'd be here, working with my daughter, I wouldn't have believed it.<eos> Reunion would be a hell of a lot better if we weren't taking down drug dealers.<eos> Oh, well, we take our blessings where we can find 'em.<eos> You used to say that to me when I'd sit with you during your chemo treatments.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> Yeah, you'd... sit and talk to me about school and... your latest drama with your friends, and...<eos> Oh, you sang that one song over and over.<eos> - "Crazy in Love"?
- Yeah.<eos> Hey...<eos> I know it wasn't easy being there by my side during those treatments.<eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world.<eos> I mean, those moments...<eos> - I felt like I had you all to myself.<eos> - Well, it meant a lot.<eos> Well, here we are with a second chance.<eos> Promise me when this is all over, we can make up for lost time.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - You, me, Danny, Ward.

Hey, it's okay.<eos> Just give us a sec.<eos> So how are you?<eos> Give the hospital a call.<eos> Find out how he's been released.<eos> Yeah, much better.<eos> I was hoping we could head out and catch up.<eos> Uh, yeah, definitely.<eos> But right now we're in the middle of something big.<eos> - What?

I'm not talking about them.<eos> I'm talking about Dad.<eos> - He needs us.<eos> - No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a... It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.<eos> - You're not making any sense.<eos> - I understand.<eos> I...
Trust me.<eos> I'm on the road to wellness.<eos> Joy is part of it.<eos> Joy, let's go.<eos> I haven't had a dad for 13 years, Ward, and by some miracle, he's... he's here.<eos> I want us to stay here with him, okay?<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - God damn it!<eos> - You need to get away from Harold.<eos> - Hey, now, son...
He's killed two men, that I know of.<eos> I have no doubt that he killed Wilkins.<eos> - Have you seen Kyle around lately?<eos> - Who's Kyle?<eos> It pains me to say this, Joy.<eos> It's clear that Ward still needs help.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Let's just go.<eos> - Let's just go now.<eos> - Kevin.
It's clear that Ward still needs help.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Let's just go.<eos> - Let's just go now.<eos> - Kevin.<eos> Dad, stop this!<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Do it!<eos> Ward.
- Let her go.<eos> - Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> - Just put the gun away.<eos> - I will put the gun away when we are on the elevator and away from here.<eos> Deal?
- Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> - Just put the gun away.<eos> - I will put the gun away when we are on the elevator and away from here.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.
I told you, not until I got Joy out of here.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Who are these guys?<eos> Looks like I interrupted a lovely family moment.<eos> Your backstabbing brother has turned us over to the Hand.<eos> I promise you this is for the best.<eos> Harold is a monster.<eos> No, you're the monster.<eos> Enough.<eos> All of you.

Wait, what?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.<eos> And I'm gonna show you no mercy.<eos> You're not coming back.<eos> Once we remove your head from your body, there will be no returning...<eos> - You're not killing my father!<eos> - Hey, lady!
Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> You're testing the limits of my patience.<eos> Stay still, Joy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Everything'll be okay.<eos> Don't do this in front of Joy.<eos> I will get you anything you want.<eos> Name it.<eos> - Your phone.

The longer I spend in New York, the more I realize the duality in life.<eos> My grandmother always said that that was the truest sign of wisdom.<eos> I didn't get it then, but now...<eos> I'm gonna put you in a hotel.<eos> You're not safe here.<eos> - You've been through enough as it is.<eos> - No, I'm not hiding.<eos> I want Bakuto dead, too.<eos> We're losing focus.<eos> Hello, Danny.

Hello, Danny.<eos> Bakuto?<eos> I'm sorry it's come to this, but you've left me with few options.<eos> Bakuto, you can't.<eos> You should take this as a compliment.<eos> It shows how much you mean to me.<eos> No!<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> No.<eos> Joy.
Unlike you and me.<eos> All the questionable shit we've done in the name of Rand...<eos> Hey, hey, hey. That's not true, Joy.<eos> This is all very touching, but time is up.<eos> This blade has cut down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants.<eos> If you would have told me I might use it on a businessman?<eos> Well, I wouldn't wanna desecrate the integrity of your blade.<eos> You're not gonna want to move, Harold.<eos> I don't wanna have to swing twice.<eos> Any last words?

Joy.<eos> I love you.<eos> Dad!<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Stop, please.<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, cutting it close there.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Oh, my little girl.
Oh, cutting it close there.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Oh, my little girl.<eos> Hey, it's okay, Joy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't move.<eos> - Danny...

You set this up?<eos> - I'm sorry, Danny.<eos> - Time to go.<eos> - Don't let them take him.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We can't let them take him.<eos> Danny's making a noble sacrifice for us.<eos> - No. It's not okay. - Shh.<eos> Shh. - Hey, hey.<eos> - Danny!
Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.<eos> He's trying to draw you out.<eos> I know.<eos> But he's mine.<eos> You've learned well.<eos> But you're only as strong as your weapon.<eos> What matters is how you use your weapon.<eos> He's her sensei.<eos> This is her fight.<eos> Colleen...
What matters is how you use your weapon.<eos> He's her sensei.<eos> This is her fight.<eos> Colleen...<eos> You were right, Bakuto.<eos> I never was cut out to be Hand.<eos> Kill him.<eos> If we kill him...<eos> we're no better than them.<eos> - So what?
- You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.<eos> Yield.

We should go.<eos> - We need help here!<eos> - What's the injury?<eos> She's been shot.<eos> Please, she's my sister.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sign in at the desk.<eos> You'll be notified when she's in stable condition.<eos> Clear the floor, please.<eos> Ten-four.
You know, there came a time when I had to topple the king.<eos> Took a lot of balls to try and kill me again.<eos> And, uh... now you know my weakness.<eos> - It was a mistake.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> No, it was...<eos> It was a mistake to think that anything could get in the way of the three of us taking back control of Rand.<eos> The three of us?<eos> - What about Danny?
- What about Danny?<eos> - Oh, he's served his purpose.<eos> Whether he kills Bakuto... or Bakuto kills him.<eos> Harold, it's Danny.<eos> Hey, I'm relieved to hear your voice.<eos> - What happened with Bakuto?<eos> - We've taken care of him.<eos> - Oh, so you cut off the head of the snake?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And Joy?
I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> - You're like family to me.<eos> - Okay. Talk later.<eos> When Bakuto put the cuffs on me, I... I had no idea if the Fist was gonna work or not.<eos> - Does this mean you're better?<eos> - Let's not go overboard.<eos> Guess it just means I don't want to be someone's Sack Man.<eos> - What?
Guess it just means I don't want to be someone's Sack Man.<eos> - What?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> That whole thing with Davos was...<eos> - Ugly.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I really screwed things up with him.<eos> I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I...
But what I found in you is... It's new.<eos> It's different.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> How does Ward even know where you are?<eos> - No.<eos> - What is he talking about?<eos> Looks like Gao's men.<eos> Or Bakuto's.

Now, let's turn it over to Thembi Wallace for an update on the Danny Rand investigations.<eos> One source suggests that Danny Rand may have been using his own business to smuggle millions of dollars of illegal drugs.<eos> And though Rand continues to elude capture, the New York DEA has placed him at the top of their list of most wanted fugitives.<eos> This is Thembi Wallace reporting from Downtown Manhattan.<eos> - Now back to sports.<eos> - Thanks, Thembi.

Sir, you can't park there.<eos> Why don't you get it washed for me?<eos> So, yes, I know for a fact that the charges against Danny are false.<eos> Last we spoke, you seemed very much on the anti-Danny track.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> I want to help him.<eos> Danny made a poor decision when he attacked the DEA agents.<eos> His life is in danger.<eos> Unfortunately, I haven't had any contact with him.<eos> Good morning.

It's a long story.<eos> You have been faking your death for all these years?<eos> That is fraud on the highest level.<eos> Would you mind excusing us?<eos> I need to speak with my son.<eos> Is this wise?<eos> Stepping out in public?<eos> I'm about to reenter the world, Ward.<eos> The time is now.<eos> Combination the same?
I didn't even know that was there.<eos> Dad, the world thinks you're dead.<eos> How are you going to explain what happened?<eos> Oh, come on, Ward.<eos> I've had 13 years to plan this out.<eos> I spin 'em a tale about the art of gene therapy and the tremendous advances we've made in cryotherapy.<eos> And here I am, a new man.<eos> Dad, that's insane.<eos> Oh, the board's gonna welcome me back with open arms.<eos> Dad!

Otherwise, it's just me and Joy running this company.<eos> And not Danny?<eos> Danny?<eos> Danny is just a drug-smuggling fugitive from the law.<eos> I think we both know that's not true.<eos> Either way...<eos> Heroin's a big money-maker, Ward.<eos> Oh, not to mention that cure your, uh, buddy Bakuto has.<eos> Now we'll get rich both ends.<eos> Dad. Hey!
Dad. Hey!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You owe Danny.<eos> He freed you from the Hand.<eos> Well, I'll send flowers to his funeral.<eos> You've been messing with Danny ever since he's been back, haven't you?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Since long before that.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Sorry.
Yeah.<eos> But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was asked to give you something.<eos> A client needs you.<eos> $5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.<eos> Please, take it.<eos> "J-Money."
As an officer of the court, I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.<eos> You really think that's a good idea?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You're a billionaire facing federal drug charges.<eos> You might as well have the words "Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.<eos> You surrender, and you will end up in a jail cell for 6 to 12 months minimum before this even goes to trial.<eos> Trust me, our criminal justice system sucks.<eos> Look, did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Colleen Wing.
Look, did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Colleen Wing.<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.<eos> They will not hesitate to shoot.<eos> Colleen, you are being charged with assault, obstructing justice and abetting a fugitive.<eos> So you have some problems of your own to focus on.<eos> - Shit.
The DEA, this is what they've given me.<eos> These are from the Hand tablet.<eos> What, you've seen these documents before?<eos> They've been changed.<eos> It must've been Harold Meachum.<eos> You know.<eos> You know that he's alive then?<eos> I just saw him.<eos> Where?<eos> Rand Enterprises.
Now, if you still have the tablet, I could... I could get it analyzed.<eos> Maybe prove that the documents were forged.<eos> I gave it to Harold.<eos> Back when I was stupid enough to think we were on the same side.<eos> Is there anything else we can do?<eos> The way I see it, you have three options.<eos> You can... go back to Xanadu, or wherever the hell it is that you were for 15 years, and never look back.<eos> Or you can turn yourself in and we can try to fight this in court.<eos> But given the evidence, the best I can do is beg for a plea deal.<eos> And the third option?
Silent is the last thing it should be.<eos> You think it's deserted?<eos> I mean, we took out their leader.<eos> Maybe they ran.<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> Where would they go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?
Tell me what I need to know.<eos> It's no mystery why you're such a poor Iron Fist.<eos> You don't understand your own path.<eos> Your chi is so polluted with guilt, yet you refuse to face it.<eos> - And what should I be guilty of?<eos> - The death of your parents.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> You watched them both die, yet somehow, you survived with barely a scratch.<eos> How many nights did you lie awake, asking yourself, "Why did I live?"<eos> So what?
And guilt is such an uncomfortable feeling, isn't it?<eos> Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.<eos> You think you're so clever... with these little mind games.<eos> And that's the real reason why you left K'un-Lun, isn't it?<eos> Your thirst for vengeance.<eos> You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.<eos> I didn't even know it was murder until after I left.<eos> You were only ten years old, but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.<eos> We're wasting our time here.<eos> Danny.
Why would I have gone to such trouble to hide it with a plane crash?<eos> It was someone much more treacherous than I.<eos> In fact, I tried to talk him out of it, as I thought it would draw too much unwanted attention.<eos> She is playing mind games.<eos> She's trying to get you on her side.<eos> The side of truth and honesty.<eos> Who else would kill my parents?<eos> Stop thinking like a child.<eos> Who would benefit most from the death of the Rand family?<eos> - No one.

He set up our heroin operation in China.<eos> But when your father was about to discover all this,<eos> Harold feared that he would ruin everything.<eos> I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.<eos> You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> You have two doors ahead of you, Danny Rand.<eos> Pass through one, and it will lead you to fulfill your destiny as the true Iron Fist.<eos> The other door...

- I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.<eos> There are no locks strong enough to imprison the truth.<eos> He's been lying to me.<eos> Manipulating me.<eos> He's been pretending to be... be my friend.<eos> I...
And I will.<eos> Please, just listen.<eos> I was raised on the Bushido code, okay?<eos> From the time I could pick up a sword, I was taught to never harm another for personal reasons, but Bakuto?<eos> I really wanted to kill Bakuto.<eos> But I'm glad that in the end, it was Davos and not me, otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.<eos> You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.<eos> Which is why I have to kill Harold for you.<eos> What?

He texted you to warn you about the DEA, right?<eos> Hey.<eos> You're looking better.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I don't want to see you right now.<eos> I know.<eos> And I don't blame you.<eos> Then leave.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Which part?
- Just stop.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I won't.<eos> You need to get yourself some help.<eos> And whatever your problem is with Dad... it's your problem.<eos> - I'd like you to leave now.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until you understand why I did what I did last night.<eos> I don't care.<eos> What?
I seriously doubt that.<eos> You think your being on the run for one day can compare to my lifetime of abuse?<eos> He killed my parents.<eos> He caused my plane to crash.<eos> How?<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Gao told me.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Danny, I'm sorry.<eos> Danny?
Okay.<eos> Well, the, uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> You know, I needed your help, but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you.<eos> So I... withheld certain documents.<eos> Now, look, I'm... I'm sorry if that was the wrong decision.<eos> Okay. Show them to me now.<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> I gave everything to the DEA.<eos> - Bullshit.

- something for yourself.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, Joy, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> You know, you saw how familiar Danny was with those people from the Hand.<eos> He's been working with them the whole time.<eos> He's been selling drugs to them from our company.<eos> You did it.<eos> You actually did.<eos> You set him up.<eos> - What?
- Dad, look.<eos> He's...<eos> He is trying to turn you against me, just like he did with Ward.<eos> He won't stop until he destroys our family.<eos> But, so help me, I will not let that lying piece of shit take what is rightfully mine.<eos> Then look me in the eye... and tell me you didn't do it.<eos> That's insane.<eos> I swear on my life I didn't do that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Joy, sweetheart...

Joy!<eos> Joy.<eos> So, everyone knows what they're doing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're gonna need this.<eos> How much is this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> As much as Hogarth would give me.<eos> Sure.
We can't just leave Ward up there.<eos> The plan was to go up if it's clear.<eos> Maybe that means something different in K'un-Lun, but in New York, guys with guns is the opposite of clear.<eos> If Ward needs help, let's call the police.<eos> We can't wait for the police.<eos> Harold is dangerous.<eos> Let's not pretend that you care about Ward when we know what this is really about for you.<eos> I'm going in there.<eos> Let's just think about this.<eos> Danny!

Let's just think about this.<eos> Danny!<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - He's gonna get himself killed.<eos> - I can't let him do this alone.<eos> - Colleen!<eos> - Claire, we stick to the plan.<eos> - Just get... Just get the tablet!<eos> Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!<eos> Shit, shit, shit.
- Claire, we stick to the plan.<eos> - Just get... Just get the tablet!<eos> Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!<eos> Shit, shit, shit.<eos> How much for your cart?<eos> - Only thing I'm selling is peanuts.<eos> - This enough?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Shit!
Get out of here!<eos> Shit!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Go get her.<eos> I'll go around the back.<eos> Stop right there, ma'am.<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey! You looking for me?<eos> Guns.<eos> Shit.
Just got a call from our guards downstairs.<eos> Danny Rand is here.<eos> Remember, Iron Fist or not, he's not bulletproof.<eos> Let's get ready for him.<eos> Dad, no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> You move, and I'll hit you again.<eos> Danny, I hope like hell you know what you're doing.<eos> Colleen!

I won't eat, I won't sleep, I won't stop... until you've paid the price.<eos> Come on.<eos> Without that fist, you're just another screwed up little kid who won't go where I go.<eos> I can go there.<eos> It's my choice!<eos> Oh, but you won't.<eos> That's why you're gonna die.<eos> Better that than to live like you.<eos> Hated by those who should love you no matter what.<eos> - Ward.

Come here.<eos> Give your Uncle Harold a hug.<eos> Finish me off.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, finish me off.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> Oh, yeah?
Come on, finish me off.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm through with you, Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.<eos> You're going to prison.<eos> Only this time, it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in.<eos> Danny!
Only this time, it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in.<eos> Danny!<eos> I'm sorry it all came down to this.<eos> Thank you for... being here.<eos> Despite everything, this is... still my father's body.<eos> And I didn't want to do this alone.<eos> Any news from Joy?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Danny, Ward.
Danny, Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.<eos> We could have met you at the office.<eos> Oh, you know me...<eos> I always enjoy a good cremation.<eos> - Heard anything else?<eos> - Yeah, I just... I just got off the phone with the agent in charge of the New York DEA.<eos> In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution to the DEA's Widows' and Children's Fund, they are dropping all the charges, including the assault against their officers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Now what?
We can run the company together, the way our fathers should have.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm not really a good businessman.<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna miss Dad. Who will I blame for my... failures, my weaknesses... my unhappiness?<eos> I understand.<eos> I've spent my whole life feeling like my parents were watching over me.<eos> I really didn't realize there was going to be so much emotional honesty.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's, uh... Let's do this.<eos> - Danny.

There's still so much I don't know about being an Iron Fist.<eos> Yeah, look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.<eos> No, that's... not a good thing.<eos> Your first instinct to a problem is to respond with violence.<eos> I guess what I'm saying here is... you're both pretty effed up and need some serious psychological help.<eos> All right.<eos> I gotta get out of here. Uh...<eos> I believe these... are mine.<eos> Wow.

maybe I can be something else.<eos> A light... for those trapped in the darkness.<eos> There's a lot of darkness right here in New York.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's also a little light, too.<eos> I'll miss you... while you're gone.<eos> Well, I was...<eos> I was kind of hoping that...<eos> you'd come with me.<eos> Good morning, sir.
And you know that if you have any hope of returning to your old life, he must be removed.<eos> Removed?<eos> Killed.<eos> I can help you with that.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> How much farther?<eos> Almost there.<eos> It's gonna look completely different from this.<eos> Much warmer.<eos> Trees.

How... How long we been here, man?<eos> 18-plus?<eos> - Twenty.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> There's nobody fucking out there, man.<eos> - 'Less he's a pro. - A Hajji?<eos> I'm just saying, maybe.<eos> Six construction guys on that pipeline.<eos> Two-man security escort.<eos> Yeah.
Right. We're dealing with Juba now?<eos> Might be.<eos> I'm just saying, that wall's cursed.<eos> It's a wall, man.<eos> You're scared of a fucking wall?<eos> Nah, I'm scared of what's behind it.<eos> Could be two Hajjis sucking each other off behind that thing.<eos> What's there is there.<eos> Rest of that shit's in your head, you understand?<eos> Ize?
Hey, I'm serious, man. - Get down.<eos> - I'm serious, too.<eos> I'm going down there grabbing that guy's radio, coming back up here, and we are getting the fuck gone.<eos> Yeah, roger that.<eos> Comm check.<eos> Yup-yup.<eos> Check-check.<eos> Where have you gone?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Movement?
Keep them eyes open.<eos> - Just watch my six.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> Yeah, we're fucking solo out here.<eos> Lonely as fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm getting closer here.<eos> You got eyes on that wall?<eos> Roger that.<eos> - Shit.
- Just watch my six.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> Yeah, we're fucking solo out here.<eos> Lonely as fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm getting closer here.<eos> You got eyes on that wall?<eos> Roger that.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What?
Man, this fucking thing's fogging up, man.<eos> You have got to get rid of that shit.<eos> It was Dean's.<eos> Fuck Dean.<eos> Dean was a bitch.<eos> Yeah, fuck Dean.<eos> Dean was a bitch.<eos> Bad juju carrying around a dead man's scope.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> What?
Can you tell where they came from?<eos> You know what, fuck it.<eos> Get the hell out of there, bro.<eos> Hey, Ize, just check the...<eos> Shit, I'm hit!<eos> Fuck, man, fuck!<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Fuck! Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Shit!
